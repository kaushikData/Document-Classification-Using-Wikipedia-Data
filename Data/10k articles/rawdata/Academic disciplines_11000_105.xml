'''3D reconstruction from multiple images''' is the creation of [[three-dimensional model]]s from a set of images. It is the reverse process of obtaining 2D images from 3D scenes.

The essence of an image is a projection from a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, during which process the depth is lost. The 3D point corresponding to a specific image point is constrained to be on the line of sight. From a single image, it is impossible to determine which point on this line corresponds to the image point. If two images are available, then the position of a 3D point can be found as the intersection of the two projection rays. This process is referred to as [[triangulation (computer vision)|triangulation]]. The key for this process is the relations between multiple views which convey the information that corresponding sets of points must contain some structure and that this structure is related to the poses and the calibration of the camera.

In recent decades, there is an important demand for 3D content for [[computer graphics]], [[virtual reality]] and communication, triggering a change in emphasis for the requirements. Many existing systems for constructing 3D models are built around specialized hardware (e.g. stereo rigs) resulting in a high cost, which cannot satisfy the requirement of its new applications. This gap stimulates the use of digital imaging facilities (like a camera). Moore's law also tells us that more work can be done in software. An early method was proposed by Tomasi and Kanade.&lt;ref name="Tomasi"&gt;C. Tomasi and T. Kanade, “[http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3040&amp;context=compsci Shape and motion from image streams under orthography: A factorization approach]”, International Journal of Computer Vision, 9(2):137-154, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; They used an affine factorization approach to extract 3D from images sequences. However, the assumption of [[orthographic projection]] is a significant limitation of this system.

==Processing==

The task of converting multiple 2D images into 3D model consists of a series of processing steps:

[[Color mapping|Camera calibration]] consists of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, without which at some level no arrangement of algorithms can work. The dotted line between Calibration and Depth determination represents that the camera calibration is usually required for determining depth.

'''Depth determination''' serves as the most challenging part in the whole process, as it calculates the 3D component missing from any given image – depth. The correspondence problem, finding matches between two images so the position of the matched elements can then be triangulated in 3D space is the key issue here.

Once you have the multiple depth maps you have to combine them to create a final mesh by calculating depth and projecting out of the camera – '''registration'''. Camera calibration will be used to identify where the many meshes created by depth maps can be combined together to develop a larger one, providing more than one view for observation.

By the stage of '''Material Application''' you have a complete 3D mesh, which may be the final goal, but usually you will want to apply the color from the original photographs to the mesh. This can range from projecting the images onto the mesh randomly, through approaches of combining the textures for super resolution and finally to segmenting the mesh by material, such as specular and diffuse properties.

==Mathematical description of reconstruction==

Given a group of 3D points viewed by N cameras with matrices '''&lt;math&gt;\{P^i\}_{i=1\ldots N}&lt;/math&gt;'''. Define '''&lt;math&gt;m_j^i\simeq P^iw_j&lt;/math&gt;''' be the homogeneous coordinates of the projection of the '''&lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt;''' point onto the '''&lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt;''' camera. The reconstruction problem can be changed to: given the group of pixel coordinates '''&lt;math&gt;\{m_j^i\}&lt;/math&gt;''', find the corresponding set of camera matrices '''&lt;math&gt;\{P^i\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and the scene structure '''&lt;math&gt;\{w_j\}&lt;/math&gt;''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;
m_j^i\simeq P^iw_j
&lt;/math&gt; (1)

Generally, without further restrictions, we will obtain a projective reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mohr and E. Arbogast. 
It can be done without camera calibration. 
Pattern Recognition Letters, 12:39-43, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Faugeras. 
[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.462.4708&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf What can be seen in three dimensions with an uncalibrated stereo rig?] 
In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 563-578, Santa Margherita L., 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; If '''&lt;math&gt;\{P^i\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\{w_j\}&lt;/math&gt;'''  satisfy (1), '''&lt;math&gt;\{P^iT\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\{T^{-1}w_j\}&lt;/math&gt;''' will satisfy (1) with any '''4 × 4''' nonsingular matrix '''T'''.

A projective reconstruction can be calculated by points correspondences only, without any a-priori information.

== Autocalibration ==
'''Autocalibration''' or self-calibration is the classical approach, in which camera motion and parameters are recovered first, using rigidity, then structure is readily calculated. Two methods implementing this idea are presented as follows:

=== Kruppa equations ===
With a minimum of three displacements, we can obtain the internal parameters of the camera using a system of polynomial equations due to Kruppa,&lt;ref&gt;E. Kruppa. Zur Ermittlung eines Objektes aus zwei Perspektiven mit innerer Orientierung. Sitz.-Ber.Akad.Wiss., Wien, math. naturw. Kl., Abt. IIa., 122:1939-1948, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; which are derived from a geometric interpretation of the rigidity constraint.&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Maybank and O. Faugeras. A theory of self-calibration of a moving camera. International Journal of Computer Vision, 8(2):123-151, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Faugeras and S. Maybank. [https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/54/01/PDF/RR-1157.pdf Motion from point matches: multiplicity of solutions]. International Journal of Computer Vision, 4(3):225-246, June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matrix '''&lt;math&gt;K = AA^{\top}&lt;/math&gt;''' is unknown in the Kruppa equations, named Kruppa coefficients matrix. With ''' K''' and by the method of Cholesky factorization one can obtain the intrinsic parameters easily:

:&lt;math&gt; K= 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_1 &amp; k_2 &amp; k_3 \\
k_2 &amp; k_4 &amp; k_5 \\
k_3 &amp; k_5 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Recently Hartley &lt;ref name="Hartley"&gt;R. I. Hartley. [http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/hartley/public_html/Papers/kruppa/final-version/kruppa2.pdf Kruppa's equations derived from the fundamental matrix]. 
IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 19(2):133-135, February 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a simpler form. Let '''&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;''' be written as '''&lt;math&gt;F = DUV^\top&lt;/math&gt;''', where

Then the Kruppa equations are rewritten (the derivation can be found in &lt;ref name="Hartley"/&gt;)

=== Mendonça and Cipolla ===
This method is based on the use of rigidity constraint. Design a cost function, which considers the intrinsic parameters as arguments and the [[Fundamental matrix (computer vision)|fundamental matrices]] as parameters. '''&lt;math&gt;{F}_ij&lt;/math&gt;''' is defined as the fundamental matrix, '''&lt;math&gt;{A}_i&lt;/math&gt;'''and '''&lt;math&gt;{A}_j&lt;/math&gt;''' as intrinsic parameters matrices.

== Stratification ==
Recently, new methods based on the concept of '''stratification''' have been proposed. Starting from a projective structure, which can be calculated from correspondences only, upgrade this projective reconstruction to a Euclidean reconstruction, by making use of all the available constraints. With this idea the problem can be stratified into different sections: according to the amount of constraints available, it can be analyzed at a different level, projective, affine or Euclidean.

=== The stratification of 3D geometry ===
Usually, the world is perceived as a 3D [[Euclidean space]]. In some cases, it is not possible to use the full Euclidean structure of 3D space. The simplest being projective, then the affine geometry which forms the intermediate layers and finally Euclidean geometry. The concept of stratification is closely related to the series of transformations on geometric entities: in the projective stratum is a series of projective transformations (a [[homography (computer vision)|homography]]), in the affine stratum is a series of [[affine transformations]], and in Euclidean stratum is a series of Euclidean transformations.

Suppose that a fixed scene is captured by two or more perspective cameras and the correspondences between visible points in different images are already given. However, in practice, the matching is an essential and extremely challenging issue in computer vision. Here, we suppose that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; 3D points &lt;math&gt;A_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are observed by &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; cameras with projection matrices &lt;math&gt;P_{j},j=1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt; Neither the positions of point nor the projection of camera are known. Only the projections &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; point in the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; image are known.

===Projective reconstruction===
Simple counting indicates we have &lt;math&gt;2nm&lt;/math&gt; independent measurements and only &lt;math&gt;11 m + 3 n&lt;/math&gt; unknowns, so the problem is supposed to be soluble with enough points and images. The equations in homogeneous coordinates can be represented:

:&lt;math&gt;
a_{ij}\sim P_{j}A_{i}\qquad i=1,\ldots n,~~j=1,\ldots m
&lt;/math&gt;       (2)

So we can apply a nonsingular '''4 × 4''' transformation ''H'' to projections '''&lt;math&gt;P_{j}&lt;/math&gt;→&lt;math&gt;P_{j}H^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;''' and world points '''&lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;→&lt;math&gt;HA_i&lt;/math&gt;'''. Hence, without further constraints, reconstruction is only an unknown projective deformation of the 3D world.

===Affine reconstruction===
''See [[affine space]] for more detailed information about computing the location of the plane at infinity '''&lt;math&gt;{\Pi}_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;'''.''
The simplest way is to exploit prior knowledge, for example the information that lines in the scene are parallel or that a point is the one thirds between two others.

We can also use prior constraints on the camera motion. By analyzing different images of the same point can obtain a line in the direction of motion. The intersection of several lines is the point at infinity in the motion direction, and one constraint on the affine structure.

===Euclidean reconstruction===
By mapping the projective reconstruction to one that satisfies a group of redundant Euclidean constraints, we can find a projective transformation ''H'' in equation (2).The equations are highly nonlinear and a good initial guess for the structure is required. This can be obtained by assuming a linear projection - parallel projection, which also allows easy reconstruction by SVD decomposition.&lt;ref name="Tomasi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic vs geometric error ==
Inevitably, measured data (i.e., image or world point positions) is noisy and the noise comes from many sources. To reduce the effect of noise, we usually use more equations than necessary and solve with [[least squares]].

For example, in a typical null-space problem formulation Ax = 0 (like the DLT algorithm), the square of the residual ||Ax|| is being minimized with the least squares method.

In general, if ||Ax|| can be considered as a distance between the geometrical entities (points, lines, planes, etc.), then what is being minimized is a '''geometric error''', otherwise (when the error lacks a good geometrical interpretation) it is called an '''algebraic error'''.

Therefore, compared with algebraic error, we prefer to minimize a geometric error for the reasons listed:
# The quantity being minimized has a meaning.
# The solution is more stable.
# The solution is constant under Euclidean transforms.

All the linear algorithms (DLT and others) we have seen so far minimize an algebraic error. Actually, there is no justification in minimizing an algebraic error apart from the ease of implementation, as it results in a linear problem. The minimization of a geometric error is often a non-linear problem, that admit only iterative solutions and requires a starting point.

Usually, linear solution based on algebraic residuals serves as a starting point for a non-linear minimization of a geometric cost function, which provides the solution a final “polish”.&lt;ref&gt;R.

== 3D reconstruction of Medical Images ==

=== Motivation &amp; applications ===
The 2-D imaging has problems of anatomy overlapping with each other and don’t disclose the abnormalities. The 3-D imaging can be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

3-D models are used for planning the operation, morphometric studies and has more reliability in orthopedics.
[[File:Epipolar Geometry1.svg|thumb|Projection of P on both cameras]]

=== Problem statement &amp; Basics ===
To reconstruct 3-D images from 2-D images taken by a camera at multiple angles. [[Medical imaging]] techniques like [[CT scanning]] and MRI are expensive, and although CT scans are accurate, they can induce high radiation doses which is a risk for patients with certain diseases. Methods based on MRI are not accurate. Since we are exposed to powerful magnetic fields during an MRI scan, this method is not suitable for patients with ferromagnetic metallic implants. Both the methods can be done only when in lying position where the global structure of the bone changes. So, we discuss the following methods which can be performed while standing and require low radiation dose.

Though these techniques are 3-D imaging, the region of interest is restricted to a slice; data is acquired to form a time sequence.  

==== 1) Stereo Corresponding Point Based Technique ====
This method is simple and implemented by identifying the points manually in multi-view radiographs. The first step is to extract the corresponding points in two x-ray images and second step is the 3D reconstruction with algorithms like Discrete Linear Transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Pearcy/publication/19301926_Stereo_radiography_of_lumbar_spine_motion/links/543b04fb0cf204cab1daf4ee.pdf|title=Pearcy MJ. 1985. Stereo radiography of lumbar spine motion. Acta Orthop Scand Suppl|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using DLT, the reconstruction is done only where there are SCPs. By increasing the number of points, the results improve &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Aubin CE, Dansereau J, Parent F, Labelle H, de Guise JA. 1997. Morphometric evaluations of personalised 3D reconstructions and geometric models of the human spine|url=|journal=Med Biol Eng Comput|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is time consuming. This method has low accuracy because of low reproducibility and time consumption. This method is dependent on the skill of the operator. This method is not suitable for bony structures with continuous shape. This method is generally used as an initial solution for other methods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-1-W5/319/2015/isprsarchives-XL-1-W5-319-2015.pdf|title=S.Hosseinian, H.Arefi, 3D Reconstruction from multiview medical X-ray images- Review and evaluation of existing methods.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2) Non-Stereo corresponding contour method (NCSS) ====
This method uses X-ray images for 3D Reconstruction and to develop 3D models with low dose radiations in weight bearing positions.

In NSCC algorithm, the preliminary step is calculation of an initial solution. Firstly anatomical regions from the generic object are defined. Secondly, manual 2D contours identification on the radiographs is performed. From each radiograph 2D contours are generated using the 3D initial solution object. 3D contours of the initial object surface are projected onto their associated radiograph.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2D association performed between these 2 set points is based on point-to-point distances and contours derivations developing a correspondence between the 2D contours and the 3D contours. Next step is optimization of the initial solution. Lastly deformation of the optimized solution is done by applying Kriging algorithm to the optimized solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Laporte |first1=S |last2=Skalli |first2=W |last3=de Guise |first3=JA |last4=Lavaste |first4=F |last5=Mitton |first5=D |year=2003 |title=A biplanar reconstruction method based on 2D and 3D contours: application to distal femur|journal=Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin|volume=|pages=|via=|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastien_Laporte2/publication/10868711_A_Biplanar_Reconstruction_Method_Based_on_2D_and_3D_Contours_Application_to_the_Distal_Femur/links/0912f50dc38102144b000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, by iterating the final step until the distance between two set points is superior to a given precision value the reconstructed object is obtained.

The advantage of this method is it can be used for bony structures with continuous shape and it also reduced human intervention but they are time consuming.

==== 3) Surface Rendering technique ====
Surface Rendering technique visualizes a 3D object as a set of surfaces called iso-surfaces. Each surface has points with the same intensity (called iso-value). It is used when we want to see the separated structures e.g. skull from slices of head, blood vessel system from slices of body etc. This technique is used mostly for high contrast data. Two main methods for reconstructing are:

*Contour based reconstruction: Iso-contours are attached to form iso-surfaces&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=G.Scott Owen, HyperVis. ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee, the National Science Foundation (DUE-9752398), and the Hypermedia and Visualization Laboratory, Georgia State University.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Voxel based reconstruction: Voxels having same intensity values are used to form iso-surfaces. One popular algorithm is Marching Cubes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some similar algorithms as Marching Tetrahedrons, Dividing Cubes &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; can be considered.

Other proposed or developed techniques include Statistical Shape Model Based Methods, Parametric Methods, Hybrid methods.

==History==
The first suggestion of ADP-ribosylation surfaced during the early 1960s. At this time, [[Pierre Chambon]] and coworkers observed the incorporation of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] into hen liver nuclei extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambon|first1=P|last2=Weill|first2=J. D.|last3=Mandel|first3=P.|title=Nicotinamide mononucleotide activation of new DNA-dependent polyadenylic acid synthesizing nuclear enzyme|journal=Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.|date=1963|volume=11|pages=39–43|doi=10.1016/0006-291x(63)90024-x|pmid=14019961}}&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive studies on the acid insoluble fraction, several different research laboratories were able to identify [[Adenosine diphosphate ribose|ADP-ribose]], derived from [[NAD+]], as the incorporated group. Several years later, the enzymes responsible for this incorporation were identified and given the name poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Originally, this group was thought to be a linear sequence of ADP-ribose units covalently bonded through a ribose glycosidic bond. It was later reported that branching can occur every 20 to 30 ADP residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayaishi|first1=O.|last2=Ueda|first2=K.|title=Poly- and Mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation Reactions: Their Significance in Molecular Biology. In ADP-Ribosylation Reactions: Biology and Medicine|date=2012|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first appearance of mono-ADP-ribosylation occurred a year later during a study of toxins: [[Corynebacterium diphtheriae|corynebacterium diphtheria]] diphtheria toxin was shown to be dependent on NAD+ in order for it to be completely effective, leading to the discovery of enzymatic conjugation of a single ADP-ribose group by mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase.

It was initially thought that ADP-ribosylation was a [[Posttranslational modification|post translational modification]] involved solely in gene regulation. However, as more enzymes with the ability to ADP-ribosylate proteins were discovered, the multifunctional nature of ADP-ribosylation became apparent. The first mammalian enzyme with poly-ADP-ribose transferase activity was discovered during the late 1980s. For the next 15 years, it was thought to be the only enzyme capable of adding a chain of ADP-ribose in mammalian cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hassa|first1=P. O.|last2=Haenni|first2=S.

Finally, [[sirtuin]]s, a family of enzymes that also possess NAD+-dependent deacylation activity, were discovered to also possess mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase activity.&lt;ref name=Frye&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frye|first1=RA|title=Characterization of five human cDNAs with homology to the yeast SIR2 gene: Sir2-like proteins (sirtuins) metabolize NAD and may have protein ADP-ribosyltransferase activity.|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=June 24, 1999|volume=260|issue=1|pages=273–9|pmid=10381378|doi=10.1006/bbrc.1999.0897}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rack|first=Johannes Gregor Matthias|last2=Morra|first2=Rosa|last3=Barkauskaite|first3=Eva|last4=Kraehenbuehl|first4=Rolf|last5=Ariza|first5=Antonio|last6=Qu|first6=Yue|last7=Ortmayer|first7=Mary|last8=Leidecker|first8=Orsolya|last9=Cameron|first9=David R.|date=2015-07-16|title=Identification of a Class of Protein ADP-Ribosylating Sirtuins in Microbial Pathogens|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=59|issue=2|pages=309–320|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.013|issn=1097-4164|pmc=4518038|pmid=26166706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catalytic mechanism==
[[File:ADP-Ribosylation-Mechanism.png|thumbnail|right|Mechanism for ADP-ribosylation, with residues of the catalyzing enzyme shown in blue.]]
The source of ADP-ribose for most enzymes that perform this modification is the redox cofactor [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]. In this transfer reaction, the [[N-glycosidic bond]] of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that bridges the ADP-ribose molecule and the nicotinamide group is cleaved, followed by [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]] by the target amino acid side chain. ADP-ribosyltransferases can perform two types of modifications: mono-ADP ribosylation and poly-ADP ribosylation.

===Mono ADP-ribosylation===
Mono-ADP ribosyltransferases commonly catalyze the addition of [[ADP-ribose]] to [[arginine]] side chains using a highly conserved R-S-EXE motif.&lt;ref name=Laing&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laing|first1=Sabrina|last2=Unger|first2=Mandy|last3=Koch-Nolte|first3=Friedrich|last4=Haag|first4=Friedrich|title=ADP-ribosylation of arginine|journal=Amino Acids|date=July 21, 2010|volume=41|issue=2|pages=257–269|doi=10.1007/s00726-010-0676-2|pmc=3102197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction proceeds by breaking the bond between [[nicotinamide]] and ribose to form an [[oxonium ion]]. Next, the arginine side chain of the target protein then acts a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon adjacent to the oxonium ion. In order for this step to occur, the arginine nucleophile is [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] by a [[glutamate]] residue on the catalyzing enzyme. Another conserved glutamate residue forms a hydrogen bond with one of the hydroxyl groups on the ribose chain to further facilitate this nucleophilic attack. As a result of the cleavage reaction, nicotinamide is released.  The modification can be reversed by ADP-ribosylhydrolases, which cleave the [[N-glycosidic bond]] between arginine and ribose to release ADP-ribose and unmodified protein; NAD+ is not restored by the reverse reaction.

===Poly ADP-ribosylation===
Poly-(ADP-ribose) [[polymerase]]s (PARPs) are found mostly in [[eukaryotes]] and catalyze the transfer of multiple ADP-ribose molecules to target proteins. As with mono-ADP ribosylation, the source of ADP-ribose is NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. PARPs use a [[catalytic triad]] of His-Tyr-Glu to facilitate binding of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and positioning of the end of the existing poly-ADP ribose chain on the target protein; the Glu facilitates catalysis and formation of a (1-&gt;2) O-glycosidic linkage between two ribose molecules. 
There are several other enzymes that recognize poly-ADP ribose chains, [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyse]] them or form branches; over 800 proteins have been annotated to contain the loosely defined poly ADP-ribose binding motif; therefore, in addition to this modification altering target protein conformation and structure, it may also be used as a tag to recruit other proteins or for regulation of the target protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Žaja|first1=Roko|last2=Mikoč|first2=Andreja|last3=Barkauskaite|first3=Eva|last4=Ahel|first4=Ivan|title=Molecular Insights into Poly(ADP-ribose) Recognition and Processing|journal=Biomolecules|date=December 21, 2012|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.3390/biom3010001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amino acid specifity ==
Many different [[amino acid]] [[side chains]] have been described as ADP-ribose acceptors. From a chemical perspective, this modification  represents protein [[glycosylation]]: the transfer of ADP-ribose occurs onto amino acid side chains with a nucleophilic oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, resulting in N-, O-, or S-glycosidic linkage to the ribose of the ADP-ribose&lt;ref&gt;Qiang Liu, Bogdan I.

Originally, acidic amino acids ([[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]]) were described as the main sites of ADP-ribosylation.

==Function==

===Apoptosis===
During [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or cellular stress PARPs are activated, leading to an increase in the amount of poly-ADP-ribose and a decrease in the amount of NAD+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scovassi|first1=AI|last2=Denegri|first2=M|last3=Donzelli|first3=M|last4=Rossi|first4=L|last5=Bernardi|first5=R|last6=Mandarino|first6=A|last7=Frouin|first7=I|last8=Negri|first8=C|title=Poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in cells undergoing apoptosis: an attempt to face death before PARP degradation.|journal=European Journal of Histochemistry|date=1998|volume=42|issue=4|pages=251–8|pmid=10068897}}&lt;/ref&gt; For over a decade it was thought that PARP1 was the only poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in mammalian cells, therefore this enzyme has been the most studied. [[Caspase]]s are a family of cysteine [[protease]]s that are known to play an essential role in [[programmed cell death]]. This protease cleaves PARP-1 into two fragments, leaving it completely inactive, to limit poly-ADP-ribose production. One of its fragments migrates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and is thought to become a target of autoimmunity.

During caspase-independent [[apoptosis]], also called parthanatos, poly-ADP-ribose accumulation can occur due to activation of PARPs or inactivation of [[poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase]], an enzyme that [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] poly(ADP-ribose) to produce free ADP-ribose. Studies have shown poly-ADP-ribose drives the translocation of the apoptosis inducing factor protein to the nucleus where it will mediate [[DNA fragmentation]]. It has been suggested that if a failure of caspase activation under stress conditions were to occur, necroptosis would take place. Overactivation of PARPs has led to a [[necrosis|necrotic cell death]] regulated by the [[Tumor necrosis factors|tumor necrosis factor protein]]. Though the mechanism is not yet understood, PARP inhibitors have been shown to affect necroptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aredia|first1=F|last2=Scovassi|first2=AI|title=Involvement of PARPs in cell death.|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|date=June 1, 2014|volume=6|pages=308–17|pmid=24896207|doi=10.2741/707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene regulation===
ADP-ribosylation can affect [[gene expression]] at nearly every level of regulation, including chromatin organization, transcription factor recruitment and binding, and mRNA processing.

The organization of [[nucleosomes]] is key to regulation of gene expression: the spacing and organization of nucleosomes changes what regions of DNA are available for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] machinery to bind and transcribe DNA. [[PARP1]], a poly-ADP ribose polymerase, has been shown to affect chromatin structure and promote changes in the organization of nucleosomes through modification of [[histones]]. 
[[File:PARP1 with DNA.png|thumbnail|Crystal structure of PARP1 zinc finger domain bound to DNA (purple). PDB: 4AV1]]

PARPs have been shown to affect [[transcription factor]] structure and cause recruitment of many transcription factors to form complexes at DNA and elicit transcription.Mono ADP-ribosyltransferases are also shown to affect transcription factor binding at promoters. For example, PARP14, a mono ADP-ribosyltransferase, has been shown to affect [[STAT protein|STAT]] transcription factor binding.

Other ADP-ribosyltransferases have been shown to modify proteins that bind [[mRNA]], which can cause [[RNA silencing|silencing]] of that gene transcript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryu|first1=Keun Woo|last2=Kim|first2=Dae-Seok|last3=Kraus|first3=W. Lee|title=New Facets in the Regulation of Gene Expression by ADP-Ribosylation and Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=January 9, 2015|pages=150109134251009|doi=10.1021/cr5004248|volume=115|pmid=25575290|pmc=4378458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA repair===
Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) can function in [[DNA repair]] of single strand breaks as well as double strand breaks. In single-strand break repair ([[base excision repair]]) the PARP can either facilitate removal of an oxidized sugar or strand cleavage. [[PARP1]] binds the single-strand breaks and pulls any nearby base excision repair intermediates close.  These intermediates include [[XRCC1]] and APLF and they can be recruited directly or through the PBZ domain of the APLF.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schreiber|first1=V|last2=Amé|first2=JC|last3=Dollé|first3=P|last4=Schultz|first4=I|last5=Rinaldi|first5=B|last6=Fraulob|first6=V|last7=Ménissier-de Murcia|first7=J|last8=de Murcia|first8=G|title=Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (PARP-2) is required for efficient base excision DNA repair in association with PARP-1 and XRCC1.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=June 21, 2002|volume=277|issue=25|pages=23028–36|pmid=11948190|doi=10.1074/jbc.m202390200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the synthesis of poly-ADP ribose. The PBZ domain is present in many proteins involved in DNA repair and allows for the binding of the PARP and thus ADP-ribosylation which recruits repair factors to interact at the break site. [[PARP2]] is a secondary responder to DNA damage but serves to provide functional redundancy in DNA repair.&lt;ref name=Pears&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pears|first1=Catherine J.|last2=Couto|first2=C. Anne-Marie|last3=Wang|first3=Hong-Yu|last4=Borer|first4=Christine|last5=Kiely|first5=Rhian|last6=Lakin|first6=Nicholas D.|title=The role of ADP-ribosylation in regulating DNA double-strand break repair|journal=Cell Cycle|date=October 28, 2014|volume=11|issue=1|pages=48–56|doi=10.4161/cc.11.1.18793|pmc=3272231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WikiDiagram1.pdf|thumb|DNA repair facilitated by PARP1 recruitment of repair enzymes. Repair of a single strand break in DNA is initiated by the binding of PARP1.	PARP1 binds single-strand breaks and pulls base excision repair intermediates close, leading to the synthesis of poly-ADP ribose. XRCC1 is the X-ray repair cross complementing protein 1. XRCC1 complexes with polynucleotide kinase (PNK) which processes DNA termini. PCNA is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen that serves as a DNA clamp that aids in the DNA polymerase activity (DNA pol) FEN1 (Flap endonuclease 1) is then recruited to remove the overhanging 5' flap. The last step of DNA repair involves DNA ligase which brings the final DNA strands together in a phosphodiester bond.]]

There are many mechanisms for the repair of damaged double stranded DNA. PARP1 may function as a synapsis factor in alternative non-homologous end joining. Additionally, It has been proposed that PARP1 is required to slow replication forks following DNA damage and promotes [[homologous recombination]] at [[DNA replication#replication fork|replication fork]]s that may be dysfunctional. It is possible that PARP1 and [[PARP3]] work together in repair of double-stranded DNA and it has been shown that PARP3 is critical for double-stranded break resolution. There are two hypotheses by which PARP1 and PARP3 coincide. The first hypothesis states that the two ADP-ribosyltransferases serve to function for each other's inactivity. If PARP3 is lost, this results in single-strand breaks, and thus the recruitment of PARP1. A second hypothesis suggests that the two enzyme work together; PARP3 catalyzes mono-ADP ribosylation and short poly-ADP ribosylation and serves to activate PARP1.&lt;ref name="Pears" /&gt;

The PARPs have many protein targets at the site of DNA damage.  [[Ku (protein)|KU protein]] and [[DNA-PKcs]] are both double-stranded break repair components with unknown sites of ADP-ribosylation. [[Histone]]s are another protein target of the PARPs.  All core histones and linker histone H1 are ADP-ribosylated following DNA damage. The function of these modifications is still unknown, but it has been proposed that ADP-ribosylation modulates higher-order [[chromatin]] structure in efforts to facilitate more accessible sites for repair factors to migrate to the DNA damage.

===Protein degradation===

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) figures prominently in protein degradation.  The [[Proteasome|26S proteasome]] consists of a catalytic subunit (the 20S core particle), and a regulatory subunit (the 19S cap).&lt;ref name=Cheng&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Yifan|title=Toward an atomic model of the 26S proteasome|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date=April 2009|volume=19|issue=2|pages=203–208|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2009.02.004|pmc=2743420}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ubiquitin|Poly-ubiquitin]] chains tag proteins for degradation by the proteasome, which causes hydrolysis of tagged proteins into smaller peptides.

Tankyrase (TNKS), an ADP-ribosyltransferase, interacts with proteasome regulator [[PSMF1|PI31]].  Evidence in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] and [[HEK 293 cells|human]] cell lines demonstrates that the Ankyrin domain (ANK) of TNKS facilitates interaction with the N-terminal TNKS-binding motif and C-terminal HbYX domain of PI31.&lt;ref name=ChoPark&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho-Park|first1=Park F.|last2=Steller|first2=Hermann|title=Proteasome Regulation by ADP-Ribosylation|journal=Cell|date=April 2013|volume=153|issue=3|pages=614–627|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.03.040}}&lt;/ref&gt; This promotes ADP-ribosylation of PI31 by the PARP domain of TNKS. In addition, it was shown that treatment of ''Drosophila'' cells with a TNKS inhibitor, XAV939, attenuated 26S proteasome activity. Moreover, ADP-ribosylation of PI31 has been demonstrated to block PI31-mediated inhibition of α-subunits of the 20S particle. Therefore, a working hypothesis is that tankyrase-mediated ADP-ribosylation reduces PI31's activity, which in turn decreases protein degradation performed by the proteasome.&lt;ref name="ChoPark" /&gt;

==Clinical significance==

===Cancer===

PARP1 is involved in [[base excision repair]] (BER), single- and double-strand break repair, and chromosomal stability. It is also involved in [[transcriptional regulation]] through its facilitation of [[protein–protein interactions]]. PARP1 uses [[NAD+]] in order to perform its function in apoptosis. If a PARP becomes overactive the cell will have decreased levels of NAD+ cofactor as well as decreased levels of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and thus will undergo [[necrosis]]. This is important in [[carcinogenesis]] because it could lead to the selection of PARP1 deficient cells (but not depleted) due to their survival advantage during cancer growth.&lt;ref name="Boulares"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boulares HA, Yakovlev AG, Smulson ME |title=Genome Degradation by DNAS1L3 Endonuclease: A Key PARP-1-Regulated Event in Apoptosis |journal=Madame Curie Bioscience Database |year =2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susceptibility to carcinogenesis under PARP1 deficiency depends significantly on the type of DNA damage incurred. There are many implications that various PARPs are involved in preventing carcinogenesis. As stated previously, PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in BER and chromosomal stability. PARP3 is involved in [[centrosome]] regulation. [[TNKS|Tankyrase]] is another ADP-ribose polymerase that is involved in [[telomere]] length regulation.&lt;ref name="Scarpa" /&gt;

PARP1 inhibition has also been widely studied in anticancer therapeutics. The mechanism of action of a PARP1 inhibitor is to enhance the damage done by chemotherapy on the cancerous DNA by disallowing the reparative function of PARP1.

PARP14 is another ADP-ribosylating enzyme that has been well-studied in regards to cancer therapy targets; it is a signal transducer and activator of [[STAT6|STAT6 transcription-interacting protein]], and was shown to be associated with the aggressiveness of B-cell lymphomas.&lt;ref name="Boulares" /&gt;

===Bacterial toxins===

Bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxins (bAREs) covalently transfer an ADP-Ribose moiety of NAD+ to target proteins of infected eukaryotes, to yield nicotinamide and a free hydrogen ion. bAREs are produced as [[zymogen|enzyme precursors]], consisting of a "A" and "B" domains: the "A" domain is responsible for ADP-Ribosylation activity; and, the "B" domain for translocation of the enzyme across the membrane of the cell. These domains can exist in concert in three forms: first, as single polypeptide chains with A and B domains covalently linked; second, in multi-protein complexes with A and B domains bound by non-covalent interactions; and, third, in multi-protein complexes with A and B domains not directly interacting, prior to processing.&lt;ref name="Krueger"/&gt;

[[File:Diphtheria tox.png|thumb|Crystal structure of the diphtheria toxin. PDB: 1MDT]]

Upon activation, bAREs ADP-ribosylate any number of eukaryotic proteins; such mechanism is crucial to the instigation of the diseased states associated with ADP-ribosylation.  GTP-binding proteins, in particular, are well-established in bAREs pathophysiology.  For examples, cholera and heat-labile enterotoxin target the [[Gs alpha subunit|α-subunit]] of Gs of [[Heterotrimeric G protein|heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins]]. As the α-subunit is ADP-ribosylated, it is permanently in an "active", GTP-bound state; subsequent activation of intracellular [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cyclic AMP]] stimulates the release of fluid and ions from intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, C3 ADP-ribosylates GTP-binding proteins [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] and [[Ras subfamily|Ras]], and Pertussis ADP-Ribosylates [[Gi alpha subunit|Gi]], Go, and Gt. In diphtheria, ADP-ribosylates ribosomal elongation factor [[Elongation factor|EF-2]], which attenuates protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="Krueger" /&gt;

There are a variety of bacteria which employ bAREs in infection: [[cholera]] of [[Vibrio cholerae|vibrio cholera]]; [[heat-labile enterotoxin]] of [[Escherichia coli|E.Coli]]; [[Pseudomonas exotoxin|Exotoxin A]] of [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]; [[Pertussis toxin]] of [[Bordetella pertussis|B. Pertussis]]; [[Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin|C3 toxin]] of [[Clostridium botulinum|C. botulinum]]; and [[Diphtheria toxin]] of [[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]].&lt;ref name=Deng&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Qing|last2=Barbieri|first2=Joseph T.|title=Molecular Mechanisms of the Cytotoxicity of ADP-Ribosylating Toxins|journal=Annual Review of Microbiology|date=October 2008|volume=62|issue=1|pages=271–288|doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.162848|pmid=18785839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anting''' is a [[self-anointing in animals|self-anointing]] behavior during which [[bird]]s rub insects, usually [[ant]]s, on their feathers and skin.  The bird may pick up the insects in their bill and rub them on the body (active anting), or the bird may lie in an area of high density of the insects and perform [[dust bathing]]-like movements (passive anting).  The insects secrete liquids containing chemicals such as [[formic acid]], which can act as an [[insecticide]], [[miticide]], [[fungicide]], or [[bactericide]].  Alternatively, anting could make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid, or, possibly supplement the bird's own [[Uropygial gland|preen oil]]. Instead of ants, birds can also use [[millipede]]s. More than 200 species of bird are known to ant.&lt;ref name = "Osborn"/&gt; In addition, other animals such as [[squirrel]]s and [[pangolin]]s may exhibit anting-type behavior.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}  [[Stoat]]s are known to roll around in moss in a similar way.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Function==
[[File:Brahminy Kite Anting 01.jpg|right|thumb|A [[brahminy kite]] anting]]
It has been suggested that anting is a way of reducing feather-parasites such as mites, or controlling fungi or bacteria, although there has been little convincing support for any of those theories.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref name=j2/&gt; It is possible that the use of certain kinds of ants indicates the importance of the chemicals they release. Some cases of anting involved the use of [[millipede]]s or [[Cerura vinula|puss moth]] (''Cerura vinula'') caterpillars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Curious Naturalists|author=Tinbergen, Niko|page=107|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these, too, are known to release powerful defensive chemicals.&lt;ref name=j6/&gt;

Another suggestion, based on observation of [[blue jay]]s, is that the bird makes the insects edible by discharging the harmful acid onto its feathers. Birds were found to show anting behaviour only if the ants had a full acid sac, and with subjects whose acid sacs had been experimentally removed, the behaviour was absent.&lt;ref name=j3/&gt;

It has also been suggested that anting is related to [[Moulting#In birds|moulting]]. Correlation with moulting, however, may be attributable to the greater activity of ants in summer.&lt;ref name=j4/&gt;

==History==
This behaviour was first described by [[Erwin Stresemann]] in German as ''Einemsen'' in the German ornithology journal ''Ornithologische Monatsberichte'' (Volume XLIII, p.&amp;nbsp;138) in 1935. Indian ornithologist [[Salim Ali (ornithologist)|Salim Ali]] interpreted an observation by his cousin [[Humayun Abdulali]] in the 1936 volume of ''Journal of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]]'' and included a reference to the Stresemann's paper suggesting that the German term could be translated into English as "anting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ali, Salim |year=1936|title=Do birds employ ants to rid themselves of ectoparasites?|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/47602998 |journal=[[Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society|J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.]]|volume=38| issue=3| pages=628–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related behaviours==

[[dust bath|Dusting]] with soil from ant-hills has been considered by some as equivalent to anting.&lt;ref name=j5/&gt;

Some birds like [[Antbird#Behaviour|antbird]]s and [[Northern flicker#Diet|flicker]]s not only ant, but also consume the ants as an important part of their diet. Other opportunist ant-eating birds include [[sparrow]]s, [[wren]]s, [[grouse]] and [[starlings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taber|first=Stephen Welton|title=The World of the Harvester Ants | series = W.L. Moody, jr. Natural History Series | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=1998|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to anting may be the observed habit some birds show of picking up cigarette butts, sometimes lit, and rubbing themselves with them.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The relationship between '''biology and sexual orientation''' is a subject of research.

==Empirical studies==
===Twin studies===
A number of [[twin study|twin studies]] have attempted to compare the relative importance of genetics and environment in the determination of sexual orientation. In a 1991 study, Bailey and Pillard conducted a study of male twins recruited from "homophile publications", and found that 52% of [[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|monozygotic (MZ)]] brothers (of whom 59 were questioned) and 22% of the [[Twin#Fraternal (sororal; dizygotic) twins|dizygotic (DZ)]] twins were [[Concordance (genetics)|concordant]] for homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Pillard, RC |title=A Genetic Study of Male Sexual Orientation |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=1089–96 |year=1991 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1991.01810360053008 |pmid=1845227}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'MZ' indicates identical twins with the same sets of genes and 'DZ' indicates fraternal twins where genes are mixed to an extent similar to that of non-twin siblings. In a study of 61 pairs of twins, researchers found among their mostly male subjects a concordance rate for homosexuality of 66% among monozygotic twins and a 30% one among dizygotic twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homosexual orientation in twins: a report on 61 pairs and three triplet sets|year=1993|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|volume=22|issue=3|pages=187–206|author=Whitam FL|displayauthors=etal|doi=10.1007/bf01541765|pmid=8494487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Bailey, Dunne and Martin studied a larger sample of 4,901 Australian twins but reported less than half the level of concordance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Dunne MP, Martin NG |title=Genetic and environmental influences on sexual orientation and its correlates in an Australian twin sample |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=524–36 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10743878 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.3.524 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/78/3/524}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found 20% concordance in the male identical or MZ twins and 24% concordance for the female identical or MZ twins. Self reported [[zygosity]], sexual attraction, fantasy and behaviours were assessed by questionnaire and zygosity was [[Serology|serologically]] checked when in doubt. Other researchers support biological causes for both men and women's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Hershberger, Scott L. 2001. Biological Factors in the Development of Sexual Orientation. Pp. 27–51 in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identities and Youth: Psychological Perspectives, edited by Anthony R. D’Augelli and Charlotte J. Patterson. Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press. Quoted in Bearman and Bruckner, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bearman and Brückner (2002) criticized early studies concentrating on small, select samples&lt;ref name=Bearman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bearman P. S. |author2=Bruckner H. |year=2002 |title=Opposite-sex twins and adolescent same-sex attraction |url=http://iserp.columbia.edu/content/opposite-sex-twins-and-adolescent-same-sex-attraction |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=1179–1205 |doi=10.1086/341906 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175100/http://iserp.columbia.edu/content/opposite-sex-twins-and-adolescent-same-sex-attraction |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.483.4722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-representative selection of their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;While inconsistent with modern findings, the first relatively large-scale twin study on sexual orientation was reported by [[Franz Josef Kallmann|Kallman]] in 1952. (''See:'' {{cite journal |author=Kallmann FJ |title=Comparative twin study on the genetic aspects of male homosexuality |journal=J. Nerv. Ment. Dis. |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=283–97 |date=April 1952 |pmid=14918012 |doi= |url=}}). Examining only male twin pairs, he found a 100% concordance rate for homosexuality among 37 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, compared to a 12%–42% concordance rate among 26 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, depending on definition. In other words, every identical twin of a homosexual subject was also homosexual, while this was not the case for non-identical twins. This study was criticized for its vaguely described method of recruiting twins and for a high rate of [[mental illness|psychiatric disorders]] among its subjects. (''See'' Rosenthal, D., "Genetic Theory and Abnormal Behavior" 1970, New York: McGraw-Hill.)&lt;/ref&gt; They studied 289 pairs of identical twins (monozygotic, or from one fertilized egg) and 495 pairs of fraternal twins (dizygotic, or from two fertilized eggs) and found [[Concordance (genetics)|concordance rates]] for same-sex attraction of only 7.7% for male identical twins and 5.3% for females, a pattern which they say "does not suggest genetic influence independent of social context".&lt;ref name=Bearman/&gt;

A 2010 study of all adult twins in Sweden (more than 7,600 twins)&lt;ref name="karolinska"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Långström N, Rahman Q, Carlström E, Lichtenstein P |title=Genetic and environmental effects on same-sex sexual behavior: a population study of twins in Sweden |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=75–80 |date=February 2010 |pmid=18536986 |doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9386-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that same-sex behavior was explained by both heritable factors and individual-specific environmental sources (such as prenatal environment, experience with illness and trauma, as well as peer groups, and sexual experiences), while influences of shared-environment variables such as familial environment and social attitudes had a weaker, but significant effect.  Women showed a statistically non-significant trend to weaker influence of hereditary effects, while men showed no effect of shared environmental effects.  The use of all adult twins in Sweden was designed to address the criticism of volunteer studies, in which a potential bias towards participation by gay twins may influence the results;

{{quote|text=Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34–.39 of the variance [of sexual orientation], the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61–.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18–.19 for genetic factors, .16–.17 for shared environmental, and .64–.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="karolinska"/&gt;}}

====Criticisms====
Twin studies have received a number of criticisms including [[self-selection bias]] where homosexuals with gay siblings are more likely to volunteer for studies. Nonetheless, it is possible to conclude that, given the difference in sexuality in so many sets of identical twins, sexual orientation cannot be attributed solely to genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel L. |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel Todd |last3=Wegner |first3=Daniel M. |title=Psychology |date=2011 |publisher=New York, NY Worth Publishers |isbn=978-1429237192 |page=435 |edition= 2nd |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/35310322 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is the finding that even monozygotic twins can be different and there is a mechanism which might account for monozygotic twins being discordant for homosexuality. Gringas and Chen (2001) describe a number of mechanisms which can lead to differences between [[Twin#chorionicity|monozygotic twins]], the most relevant here being chorionicity and amniocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-3782(01)00171-2 |last1=Gringas |first1=P. |last2=Chen |first2=W. |year=2001 |title=Mechanisms for difference in monozygous twins |url= |journal=Early Human Development |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=105–117 |pmid=11440823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dichorionic twins]] potentially have different hormonal environments because they receive maternal blood from separate placenta, and this could result in different levels of brain masculinisation. Monoamniotic twins share a hormonal environment, but can suffer from the 'twin to twin transfusion syndrome' in which one twin is "relatively stuffed with blood and the other exsanguinated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=Seth G. N. |title=Michael Rutter: Genes and behavior: nature-nurture interplay explained |journal=Genes, Brain and Behavior |date=April 2006 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=303 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-183x.2006.00219.x |language=en |issn=1601-1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromosome linkage studies===
Chromosome linkage studies of sexual orientation have indicated the presence of multiple contributing genetic factors throughout the genome. In 1993 [[Dean Hamer]] and colleagues published findings from a linkage analysis of a sample of 76 gay brothers and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamer DH, Hu S, Magnuson VL, Hu N, Pattatucci AM |title=A linkage between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation |journal=Science |volume=261 |issue=5119 |pages=321–7 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8332896 |doi=10.1126/science.8332896 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8332896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamer et al. found that the gay men had more gay male uncles and cousins on the maternal side of the family than on the paternal side. Gay brothers who showed this maternal pedigree were then tested for X chromosome linkage, using twenty-two markers on the X chromosome to test for similar alleles. In another finding, thirty-three of the forty sibling pairs tested were found to have similar alleles in the distal region of [[Xq28]], which was significantly higher than the expected rates of 50% for fraternal brothers. This was popularly dubbed the "'''gay gene'''" in the media, causing significant controversy.  Sanders et al. in 1998 reported on their similar study, in which they found that 13% of uncles of gay brothers on the maternal side were homosexual, compared with 6% on the paternal side.&lt;ref name= "Born gay321"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Glenn |last2=Rahman |first2=Qazi |title=Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Owen Publishers |isbn=9780720613094 |edition= 2nd |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mustanski et al. (2005) performed a full-genome scan (instead of just an X chromosome scan) on individuals and families previously reported on in Hamer et al. (1993) and Hu et al. (1995), as well as additional new subjects.

Results from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012.&lt;ref name=camb20141117&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sanders AR, Martin ER, Beecham GW, Guo S, Dawood K, Rieger G, Badner JA, Gershon ES, Krishnappa RS, Kolundzija AB, Duan J, Gejman PV, Bailey JM |date = November 2014 |title = Genome-wide scan demonstrates significant linkage for male sexual orientation |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0033291714002451 |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume = 45 |issue = 7 |pages = 1379–88 |doi = 10.1017/S0033291714002451 |pmid = 25399360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] markers.

Significant linkage was also detected in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8, overlapping with one of the regions detected in the Hamer lab's previous genomewide study.

In addition to [[allosome|sex chromosomal]] contribution, a potential [[autosomal]] genetic contribution to the development of homosexual orientation has also been suggested. In a study population composed of more than 7000 participants, Ellis et al. (2008) found a statistically significant difference in the frequency of blood type A between homosexuals and heterosexuals. They also found that "unusually high" proportions of homosexual males and homosexual females were [[Rh factor|Rh negative]] in comparison to heterosexuals. As both blood type and Rh factor are genetically inherited traits controlled by [[alleles]] located on chromosome 9 and chromosome 1 respectively, the study indicates a potential link between genes on autosomes and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ellis L |author2=Ficek C |author3=Burke D |author4=Das S |title=Eye Color, Hair Color, Blood Type, and the Rhesus Factor: Exploring Possible Genetic Links to Sexual Orientation |journal=Arch.

The biology of sexual orientation has been studied in detail in several animal model systems.  In the common fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the complete pathway of sexual differentiation of the brain and the behaviors it controls is well established in both males and females, providing a concise model of biologically controlled courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pavlou HJ, Goodwin SF |title=Courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster: towards a 'courtship connectome' |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=76–83 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23021897 |pmc=3563961 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2012.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mammals, a group of geneticists at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology altered the sexual preferences of female mice by removing a single gene linked to reproductive behavior. Without the gene, the mice exhibited masculine sexual behavior and attraction toward urine of other female mice. Those mice who retained the gene fucose mutarotase (FucM) were attracted to male mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20609214 |year=2010 |last1=Park |first1=D |last2=Choi |first2=D |last3=Lee |first3=J |last4=Lim |first4=DS |last5=Park |first5=C |title=Male-like sexual behavior of female mouse lacking fucose mutarotase |volume=11 |pages=62 |doi=10.1186/1471-2156-11-62 |pmc=2912782 |journal=BMC Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In interviews to the press, researchers have pointed that the evidence of genetic influences should not be equated with genetic determinism. According to Dean Hamer and Michael Bailey, genetic aspects are only one of the multiple causes of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-gay-gene-is-back-on-the-scene-1536770.html |title=The 'gay gene' is back on the scene |first=Steve |last=Connor |date=31 October 1995 |website=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10637532/Being-homosexual-is-only-partly-due-to-gay-gene-research-finds.html |title=Being homosexual is only partly due to gay gene, research finds |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |date=13 February 2014 |website=The Telegraph |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published an article with a [[genome wide association study]] on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. A gene named '''SLITRK6''' on [[chromosome 13]] was identified, and contains an area or DNA sequence which is different for gay men than for heterosexual men.&lt;ref name="Nature21"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanders |first1=Alan R. |last2=Beecham |first2=Gary W. |last3=Guo |first3=Shengru |last4=Dawood |first4=Khytam |last5=Rieger |first5=Gerulf |last6=Badner |first6=Judith A. |last7=Gershon |first7=Elliot S. |last8=Krishnappa |first8=Ritesha S. |last9=Kolundzija |first9=Alana B. |last10=Duan |first10=Jubao |last11=Gejman |first11=Pablo V. |last12=Bailey |first12=J.

===Epigenetics studies===
{{Main|Epigenetic theories of homosexuality}}
A study suggests linkage between a mother's genetic make-up and homosexuality of her sons. Women have two X chromosomes, one of which is "switched off". The inactivation of the X chromosome occurs randomly throughout the embryo, resulting in cells that are mosaic with respect to which chromosome is active. In some cases though, it appears that this switching off can occur in a non-random fashion. Bocklandt et al. (2006) reported that, in mothers of homosexual men, the number of women with extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation is significantly higher than in mothers without gay sons.  13% of mothers with one gay son, and 23% of mothers with two gay sons, showed extreme skewing, compared to 4% of mothers without gay sons.&lt;ref name="Bocklandt et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocklandt S, Horvath S, Vilain E, Hamer DH |title=Extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation in mothers of homosexual men |journal=Hum.

===Birth order===
{{Main|Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation}}
Blanchard and Klassen (1997) reported that each additional older brother increases the odds of a man being gay by 33%.&lt;ref name="Blanchard and Klassen 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Klassen P |title=H-Y antigen and homosexuality in men |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=185 |issue=3 |pages=373–8 |date=April 1997 |pmid=9156085 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1996.0315 |url=http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/sex/H-Y%20anitgen.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.602.8423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/health/10gene.html |title=Pas de Deux of Sexuality Is Written in the Genes |date=10 April 2007 |newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Wade |first1=Nicholas }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now "one of the most reliable epidemiological variables ever identified in the study of sexual orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Birth order and sibling sex ratio in homosexual versus heterosexual males and females |journal=Annu Rev Sex Res |volume=8 |issue= |pages=27–67 |year=1997 |pmid=10051890 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this finding, it has been proposed that male fetuses provoke a maternal immune reaction that becomes stronger with each successive male fetus.
This maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH) begins when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth.&lt;ref name="Anthony2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Anthony F. Bogaert]] |author2=[[Malvina Skorska]] |last-author-amp=yes |title=Sexual orientation, fraternal birth order, and the maternal immune hypothesis: a review |journal=[[Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=247–254 |date=April 2011 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.004 |pmid=21315103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which are "almost certainly involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates".
These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, increasing the likelihood that the exposed son will be more attracted to men than women.&lt;ref name="Anthony2011"/&gt;
It is this antigen which maternal H-Y antibodies are proposed to both react to and 'remember'. Successive male fetuses are then attacked by H-Y antibodies which somehow decrease the ability of H-Y antigens to perform their usual function in brain masculinisation.&lt;ref name="Blanchard and Klassen 1997"/&gt;

However, the maternal immune hypothesis has been criticized because the prevalence of the type of immune attack proposed is rare compared with the prevalence of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitehead NE |title=An antiboy antibody? Re-examination of the maternal immune hypothesis |journal=J Biosocial Sci |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=905–921 |year=2007 |pmid=17316469 |doi=10.1017/S0021932007001903|citeseerx=10.1.1.573.5483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fraternal birth order effect" however, cannot account for between 71-85% of male homosexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Blanchard, Paterson, &amp; Bogaert, 2002; Blanchard &amp; Bogaert, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it does not explain instances where a firstborn child displays male homosexual preference (MHP).&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 2011; Rieger et al., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, researchers discovered a biological mechanism of gay people who tend to have older brothers. They think [[Neuroligin 4 Y-linked]] protein is responsible for a later son being gay. They found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. The result also indicates that number of pregnancies, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bogaert |first1=Anthony F. |last2=Skorska |first2=Malvina N. |last3=Wang |first3=Chao |last4=Gabrie |first4=José |last5=MacNeil |first5=Adam J. |last6=Hoffarth |first6=Mark R. |last7=VanderLaan |first7=Doug P. |last8=Zucker |first8=Kenneth J. |last9=Blanchard |first9=Ray |title=Male homosexuality and maternal immune responsivity to the Y-linked protein NLGN4Y |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=9 January 2018 |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=302–306 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1705895114 |pmid=29229842 |pmc=5777026 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/302 |language=en |issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female fertility===
In 2004, Italian researchers conducted a study of about 4,600 people who were the relatives of 98 homosexual and 100 heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men tended to have more offspring than those of the heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men on their mother's side tended to have more offspring than those on the father's side. The researchers concluded that there was genetic material being passed down on the X chromosome which both promotes fertility in the mother and homosexuality in her male offspring. The connections discovered would explain about 20% of the cases studied, indicating that this is a highly significant but not the sole genetic factor determining sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Camperio-Ciani A, Corna F, Capiluppi C |title=Evidence for maternally inherited factors favouring male homosexuality and promoting female fecundity |journal=Proc.

Research conducted in Sweden&lt;ref name="pmid15883379"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Savic I, Berglund H, Lindström P |title=Brain response to putative pheromones in homosexual men |journal=Proc.

The research showed that when both heterosexual women and gay men are exposed to a testosterone derivative found in men's sweat, a region in the hypothalamus is activated. Heterosexual men, on the other hand, have a similar response to an estrogen-like compound found in women's urine.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Nicholas. (May 9, 2005). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/science/09cnd-smell.html Gay Men Are Found to Have Different Scent of Attraction]." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion is that sexual attraction, whether same-sex or opposite-sex oriented, operates similarly on a biological level. Researchers have suggested that this possibility could be further explored by studying young subjects to see if similar responses in the hypothalamus are found and then correlating these data with adult sexual orientation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Studies of brain structure===
A number of sections of the [[Human brain|brain]] have been reported to be sexually dimorphic; that is, they vary between men and women. There have also been reports of variations in brain structure corresponding to sexual orientation. In 1990, [[Dick Swaab]] and Michel A. Hofman reported a difference in the size of the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] between homosexual and heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swaab DF, Hofman MA |title=An enlarged suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men |journal=Brain Res. |volume=537 |issue=1–2 |pages=141–8 |date=December 1990 |pmid=2085769 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90350-K |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-8993(90)90350-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Allen and Gorski reported a difference related to sexual orientation in the size of the [[anterior commissure]],&lt;ref name="pmid1496013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=L.

Research on the physiologic differences between male and female brains are based on the idea that people have male or a female brain, and this mirrors the behavioral differences between the two sexes. Some researchers state that solid scientific support for this is lacking. Although consistent differences have been identified, including the size of the brain and of specific brain regions, male and female brains are very similar.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, 2006; Lenroot and Giedd, 2010; McCarthy et al., 2009; Sakuma, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum and Beltz, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexually dimorphic nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus====
[[Simon LeVay]], too, conducted some of these early researches. He studied four groups of [[neuron]]s in the [[hypothalamus]] called INAH1, INAH2, INAH3 and INAH4. This was a relevant area of the brain to study, because of evidence that it played a role in the regulation of [[sexual behaviour in animals]], and because INAH2 and INAH3 had previously been reported to differ in size between men and women.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=LeVay |first=Simon |title=A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men |journal=Science |issn=0036-8075 |volume=253 |issue=5023 |year=1991 |pages=1034–1037 |doi=10.1126/science.1887219 |pmid=1887219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained brains from 41 deceased hospital patients. The subjects were classified into three groups. The first group comprised 19 gay men who had died of [[AIDS]]-related illnesses. The second group comprised 16 men whose sexual orientation was unknown, but whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. Six of these men had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The third group was of six women whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. One of the women had died of an AIDS-related illness.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"/&gt;

The [[HIV-positive people]] in the presumably heterosexual patient groups were all identified from medical records as either [[intravenous drug abuse]]rs or recipients of [[blood transfusion]]s. Two of the men who identified as heterosexual specifically denied ever engaging in a homosexual sex act. The records of the remaining heterosexual subjects contained no information about their sexual orientation; they were assumed to have been primarily or exclusively heterosexual "on the basis of the numerical preponderance of heterosexual men in the population".&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"/&gt;

LeVay found no evidence for a difference between the groups in the size of INAH1, INAH2 or INAH4. However, the INAH3 group appeared to be twice as big in the heterosexual male group as in the gay male group; the difference was highly significant, and remained significant when only the six AIDS patients were included in the heterosexual group. The size of INAH3 in the homosexual men's brains was comparable to the size of INAH3 in the heterosexual women's brains.

However, other studies have shown that the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area, which include the INAH3, are of similar size in homosexual males who died of AIDS to heterosexual males, and therefore larger than female. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus. Furthermore, the SCN of homosexual males is extremely large (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted Dörner hypothesis that homosexual males have a "female hypothalamus" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the "male brain from originally female brain" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.hiim.unizg.hr/images/knjiga/CNS41.pdf |last1=Judaš |first1=Miloš |last2=Kostović |first2=Ivica |title=Temelji Neuroznanosti: Sadržaj Poglavlja |chapter=Neurobiologija emocija i spolnosti |page=408 |language=hr |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://webcitation.org/query?date=2016-03-23&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hiim.unizg.hr%2Fimages%2Fknjiga%2FCNS41.pdf |chapter-format=PDF |archive-date=23 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1292983 |volume=38 Suppl 2 |issue=2 |title=Gender and sexual orientation in relation to hypothalamic structures |year=1992 |journal=Horm Res |pages=51–61 |doi=10.1159/000182597 |author1=Swaab |first1=D.

William Byne and colleagues attempted to identify the size differences reported in INAH 1–4 by replicating the experiment using brain sample from other subjects: 14 HIV-positive homosexual males, 34 presumed heterosexual males (10 HIV-positive), and 34 presumed heterosexual females (9 HIV-positive). The researchers found a significant difference in INAH3 size between heterosexual men and heterosexual women. The INAH3 size of the homosexual men was apparently smaller than that of the heterosexual men, and larger than that of the heterosexual women, though neither difference quite reached statistical significance.&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Byne W, Tobet S, Mattiace LA |title=The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and HIV status |journal=Horm Behav |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11534967 |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1680 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byne and colleagues also weighed and counted numbers of neurons in INAH3 tests not carried out by LeVay. The results for INAH3 weight were similar to those for INAH3 size; that is, the INAH3 weight for the heterosexual male brains was significantly larger than for the heterosexual female brains, while the results for the gay male group were between those of the other two groups but not quite significantly different from either. The neuron count also found a male-female difference in INAH3, but found no trend related to sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"/&gt;

A 2010 study, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab asserted that "the fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells, or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge. In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Garcia-Falgueras A, Swaab DF |title=Sexual Hormones and the Brain: An Essential Alliance for Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation |journal=Endocr Dev |volume=17 |issue= |pages=22–35 |year=2010 |pmid=19955753 |doi=10.1159/000262525 |series=Endocrine Development |isbn=978-3-8055-9302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ovine model====
The [[domestic ram]] is used as an experimental model to study early programming of the neural mechanisms which underlie homosexuality, developing from the observation that approximately 8% of domestic rams are sexually attracted to other rams (male-oriented) when compared to the majority of rams which are female-oriented. In many species, a prominent feature of sexual differentiation is the presence of a sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus, which is larger in males than in females.

Roselli et al. discovered an ovine SDN (oSDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus that is smaller in male-oriented rams than in female-oriented rams, but similar in size to the oSDN of females. Neurons of the oSDN show [[aromatase]] expression which is also smaller in male-oriented rams versus female-oriented rams, suggesting that sexual orientation is neurologically hard-wired and may be influenced by hormones. However, results failed to associate the role of neural aromatase in the sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in the sheep, due to the lack of defeminization of adult sexual partner preference or oSDN volume as a result of aromatase activity in the brain of the fetuses during the critical period. Having said this, it is more likely that oSDN morphology and homosexuality may be programmed through an androgen receptor that does not involve [[aromatisation]]. Most of the data suggests that homosexual rams, like female-oriented rams, are masculinized and defeminized with respect to mounting, receptivity, and gonadotrophin secretion, but are not defeminized for sexual partner preferences, also suggesting that such behaviors may be programmed differently. Although the exact function of the oSDN is not fully known, its volume, length, and cell number seem to correlate with sexual orientation, and a dimorphism in its volume and of cells could bias the processing cues involved in partner selection. More research is needed in order to understand the requirements and timing of the development of the oSDN and how prenatal programming effects the expression of mate choice in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[C.

==Biological theories of cause of sexual orientation==

===Early fixation hypothesis===
{{Main|Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation}}
The early fixation hypothesis includes research into prenatal development and the environmental factors that control masculinization of the brain. Some studies have seen pre-natal hormone exposures as the primary factor involved in determining sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., Sexual Hormones and the Brain: An Essential Alliance for Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation, in Endocrine Development, vol. 17, pp. 22–35 (2010) ({{ISSN|1421-7082}}) (authors are of Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, of Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences) (author contact is 2d author) (vol. 17 is Sandro Loche, Marco Cappa, Lucia Ghizzoni, Mohamad Maghnie, &amp; Martin O. Savage, eds., Pediatric Neuroendocrinology).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. &amp; Rahman, Q (2005) Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation, Peter Owen, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4808435 |volume=131 |issue=1 |title=Plasma testosterone levels in heterosexual and homosexual men |date=January 1974 |journal=Am J Psychiatry |pages=82–3 |vauthors=Brodie HK, Gartrell N, Doering C, Rhue T |doi=10.1176/ajp.131.1.82}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is supported by both the observed differences in brain structure and cognitive processing between homosexual and heterosexual men. One explanation for these differences is the idea that differential exposure to hormone levels in the womb during fetal development may change the masculinization of the brain in homosexual men. The concentrations of these chemicals is thought to be influenced by fetal and maternal immune systems, maternal consumption of certain drugs, maternal stress, and direct injection. This hypothesis is also connected to the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order research]].

===Exotic becomes erotic===&lt;!--Linked from 'Daryl Bem'--&gt;
[[Daryl Bem]], a social psychologist at [[Cornell University]], has theorized that the influence of biological factors on sexual orientation may be mediated by experiences in childhood. A child's temperament predisposes the child to prefer certain activities over others. Because of their temperament, which is influenced by biological variables such as genetic factors, some children will be attracted to activities that are commonly enjoyed by other children of the same gender. Others will prefer activities that are typical of another gender. This will make a gender-conforming child feel different from opposite-gender children, while gender-nonconforming children will feel different from children of their own gender. According to Bem, this feeling of difference will evoke psychological arousal when the child is near members of the gender which it considers as being 'different'. Bem theorizes that this psychological arousal will later be transformed into sexual arousal: children will become sexually attracted to the gender which they see as different ("exotic"). This proposal is known as the "exotic becomes erotic" theory.&lt;ref name="Bem"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bem DJ, Herdt G, McClintock M |title=Exotic becomes erotic: interpreting the biological correlates of sexual orientation |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=531–48 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11100261 |doi=10.1023/A:1002050303320 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0004-0002&amp;volume=29&amp;page=531}} [http://dbem.ws/Exotic%20Becomes%20Erotic.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual orientation and evolution==
===General===
Sexual practices that significantly reduce the frequency of heterosexual intercourse also significantly decrease the chances of successful reproduction, and for this reason, they would appear to be [[adaptation|maladaptive]] in an [[evolution]]ary context following a simple Darwinian model (competition amongst individuals) of natural selection—on the assumption that homosexuality would reduce this frequency.  Several theories have been advanced to explain this contradiction, and new experimental evidence has demonstrated their feasibility.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre F, Estep KW 1993 223-33"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0303-2647(93)90051-D |vauthors=MacIntyre F, Estep KW |title=Sperm competition and the persistence of genes for male homosexuality |journal=BioSystems |volume=31 |issue=2–3 |pages=223–33 |year=1993 |pmid=8155854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars&lt;ref name="MacIntyre F, Estep KW 1993 223-33"/&gt; have suggested that homosexuality is indirectly adaptive, by conferring a reproductive advantage in a non-obvious way on heterosexual siblings or their children. By way of analogy, the [[allele]] (a particular version of a gene) which causes [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anemia]] when two copies are present, also confers resistance to [[malaria]] with a lesser form of [[anemia]] when one copy is present (this is called [[heterozygous advantage]]).&lt;ref name="swars"&gt;Baker, Robin (1996) Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex, p.241 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have also pointed out that Darwin himself described [[kin selection]] in [[The Origin of Species]], so under a Darwinian model of evolution, not only individuals, but family groups (bloodlines) can compete for selection.

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295 |title=Gender bending |journal=The Economist|date=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them". Their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zietsch, B. |author2=Morley, K. |author3=Shekar, S. |author4=Verweij, K. |author5=Keller, M. |author6=Macgregor, S. |date=November 2008 |title=Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=424–433 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.07.002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the same study, the authors noted that "nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing "social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way" (and thus seek out a greater number of sexual partners) as an example of one alternative explanation. Also, the authors of the study acknowledge that a large number of sexual partners may not lead to greater reproductive success, specifically noting there is an "absence of evidence relating the number of sexual partners and actual reproductive success, either in the present or in our evolutionary past".

The heterosexual advantage hypothesis was given strong support by the 2004 Italian study demonstrating increased [[fecundity]] in the female matrilineal relatives of gay men.&lt;ref name="Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="camperio08"/&gt;  As originally pointed out by Hamer,&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, D., Copeland, P. The Science of Desire: The Search for the Gay Gene and the Biology of Behavior (Simon and Schuster, 1994) {{ISBN|0-684-80446-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; even a modest increase in reproductive capacity in females carrying a "gay gene" could easily account for its maintenance at high levels in the population.&lt;ref name="camperio08"/&gt;

===Gay uncle hypothesis===
The "gay uncle hypothesis" posits that people who themselves do not have children may nonetheless increase the prevalence of their family's genes in future generations by providing resources (e.g., food, supervision, defense, shelter) to the offspring of their closest relatives.

This hypothesis is an extension of the theory of [[kin selection]], which was originally developed to explain apparent altruistic acts which seemed to be maladaptive. The initial concept was suggested by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1932 and later elaborated by many others including [[John Maynard Smith]], [[W. D. Hamilton]] and [[Mary Jane West-Eberhard]].&lt;ref name="Mayr 1982"&gt;Mayr, E. (1982). ''The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p 598.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was also used to explain the patterns of certain social insects where most of the members are non-reproductive.

Vasey and VanderLaan (2010) tested the theory on the Pacific island of Samoa, where they studied women, straight men, and the fa'afafine, men who prefer other men as sexual partners and are accepted within the culture as a distinct third gender category. Vasey and VanderLaan found that the fa'afafine said they were significantly more willing to help kin, yet much less interested in helping children who aren't family, providing the first evidence to support the kin selection hypothesis.&lt;ref name="uleth.ca"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/handle/10133/3159 | title=The development and evolution of male androphilia in Samoan fa'afafine| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2010/02/05/study-supports-gay-super-uncles-theory | title=Study Supports Gay Super Uncles Theory| date=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis is consistent with other studies on homosexuality, which show that it is more prevalent amongst both siblings and twins.&lt;ref name="uleth.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} Since both twins and non-twin siblings share genes and therefore have a higher factor of genetic redundancy, there is less genetic familial risk if the strategy is expressed. It is speculated that environmental and hormonal stress factors (linked to resource feedbacks) may act as triggers.

Since the hypothesis solves the problem of why homosexuality has not been selected out over thousands of years, despite it being antithetical to reproduction, many scientists consider it the best explanatory model for non-heterosexual behaviour such as homosexuality and bisexuality. The natural bell curve variation that occurs in biology and sociology everywhere, explains the variable spectrum of expression.

Vasal and VanderLaan (2011) provides evidence that if an adaptively designed avuncular male androphilic phenotype exists and its development is contingent on a particular social environment, then a collectivistic cultural context is insufficient, in and of itself, for the expression of such a phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s10508-011-9763-z|pmid = 21656333|title = Sexual Orientation in Men and Avuncularity in Japan: Implications for the Kin Selection Hypothesis|journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume = 41|issue = 1|pages = 209–215|year = 2011|last1 = Vasey|first1 = Paul L|last2 = Vanderlaan|first2 = Doug P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological differences in gay men and lesbian women==

Some studies have found correlations between physiology of people and their sexuality; these studies provide evidence which suggests that:

* Gay men and straight women have, on average, equally proportioned brain hemispheres. Lesbian women and straight men have, on average, slightly larger right brain hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7456588.stm |title=BBC NEWS - Health - Scans see 'gay brain differences' |publisher=|date=2008-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the study caution that any interpretation of this finding must take into account that the group difference in brain activation between heterosexual men and homosexual men in the amygdala region is not large and that the most robust finding is that both heterosexual and homosexual men used the same areas when they reacted to sexually preferred stimuli. "For the most part, homosexual and heterosexual men showed very similar patterns of activation (albeit to different erotic stimuli). One possible exception was the amygdala, in which homosexual men showed greater activational differences between preferred and nonpreferred erotic stimuli compared with heterosexual men. However, this difference was not hypothesized a priori, was not large, and was the only group difference found out of many tested. Thus, this finding needs replication."(Debra A.

==Political aspects==
{{Main|LGBT social movements|LGBT rights opposition}}
Whether genetic or other physiological determinants form the basis of sexual orientation is a highly politicized issue. ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', a U.S. gay and lesbian newsmagazine, reported in 1996 that 61% of its readers believed that "it would mostly help gay and lesbian rights if homosexuality were found to be biologically determined".&lt;ref&gt;The Advocate (1996, February 6). Advocate Poll Results. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-national study in the [[United States]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Sweden]] found that those who believed that "homosexuals are born that way" held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuality than those who believed that "homosexuals choose to be that way" or "learn to be that way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ernulf KE, Innala SM, Whitam FL |title=Biological explanation, psychological explanation, and tolerance of homosexuals: a cross-national analysis of beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychol Rep |volume=65 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=1003–10 |date=December 1989 |pmid=2608821 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1989.65.3.1003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitley B. E. Jr |year=1990 |title=The relationship of heterosexuals' attributions for the causes of homosexuality to attitudes toward lesbians and gay men |url= |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=369–377 |doi=10.1177/0146167290162016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Equal Protection Clause|Equal protection]] analysis in U.S. law determines when government requirements create a “suspect classification" of groups and therefore eligible for heightened [[strict scrutiny|scrutiny]] based on several factors, one of which is [[Immutable characteristic|immutability]].

Evidence that sexual orientation is biologically determined (and therefore perhaps immutable in the legal sense) would strengthen the legal case for heightened scrutiny of laws discriminating on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;Balog, Kari (2005–2006) "Equal Protection for Homosexuals: Why the Immutability Argument is Necessary and How it is Met.", Cleveland St. L. Rev. 545–573.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Is Sexuality Immutable?", Margaret Talbot, The New Yorker, January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0125/Prop.-8-trial-defenders-of-gay-marriage-ban-make-their-case |title=Prop. 8 trial: defenders of gay-marriage ban make their case |journal=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=27 January 2010 |date=2010-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived causes of sexual orientation have a significant bearing on the status of sexual minorities in the eyes of social conservatives. The [[Family Research Council]], a [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] [[think tank]] in Washington, D.C., argues in the book ''Getting It Straight'' that finding people are born gay "would advance the idea that sexual orientation is an innate characteristic, like race; that homosexuals, like African-Americans, should be legally protected against 'discrimination;' and that disapproval of homosexuality should be as socially stigmatized as racism. However, it is not true." On the other hand, some [[social conservatives]] such as Reverend Robert Schenck have argued that people can accept any scientific evidence while still morally opposing homosexuality.&lt;ref name=neil&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/14/what_makes_people_gay/ What Makes People Gay?] By Neil Swidey. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. Published August 14, 2005. Accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Organization for Marriage]] board member and fiction writer [[Orson Scott Card]] has supported biological research on homosexuality, writing that "our scientific efforts in regard to homosexuality should be to identify genetic and uterine causes... so that the incidence of this dysfunction can be minimized.... [However, this should not be seen] as an attack on homosexuals, a desire to 'commit genocide' against the homosexual community.... There is no 'cure' for homosexuality because it is not a disease. There are, however, different ways of living with homosexual desires."&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mormontimes.com/content/single/10235 |title=Science on gays falls short |publisher=[[Deseret Morning News]] |date=August 7, 2008 |last=Card |first=Orson Scott |accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advocates for the rights of sexual minorities resist linking that cause with the concept that sexuality is biologically determined or fixed at birth. They argue that sexual orientation can shift over the course of a person's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queerbychoice.com/myths.html Myths About Queer by Choice People]. [http://www.queerbychoice.com/ Queer by Choice]. Accessed March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, others resist any attempts to pathologise or medicalise 'deviant' sexuality, and choose to fight for acceptance in a moral or social realm.&lt;ref name=neil/&gt; [[Chandler Burr]] has stated that "[s]ome, recalling earlier psychiatric "treatments" for homosexuality, discern in the biological quest the seeds of genocide. They conjure up the specter of the surgical or chemical "rewiring" of gay people, or of abortions of fetal homosexuals who have been hunted down in the womb."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199706/homosexuality-biology/4 Homosexuality and Biology]. By Chandler Burr. ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; LeVay has said in response to letters from gays and lesbians making such criticisms that the research "has contributed to the status of gay people in society".&lt;ref name=neil/&gt;

'''Charles Sanders Peirce''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɜr|s}}&lt;ref&gt;"Peirce", in the case of C. S. Peirce, always rhymes with the English-language word "terse" and so, in most dialects, is pronounced exactly like the English-language word "{{audio|en-us-purse.ogg|purse}}". See {{cite news |url=http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/news/1_3/13_4x.htm#pronunciation |title=Note on the Pronunciation of 'Peirce' |website=Peirce Project Newsletter |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |date=December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; "purse"; 10&amp;nbsp;September 1839 – 19&amp;nbsp;April 1914) was an American [[philosopher]], [[logic]]ian, [[mathematics|mathematician]], and [[science|scientist]] who is sometimes known as "the father of [[pragmatism]]". He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, [[scientific method|scientific methodology]], and [[semiotics]], and for his founding of [[pragmatism]].

An innovator in mathematics, [[statistics]], philosophy, research [[methodology]], and various sciences, Peirce considered himself,  first and foremost, a [[logic]]ian. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]]. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among [[logical positivists]] and proponents of [[philosophy of language]] that dominated 20th&amp;nbsp;century Western philosophy; additionally, he defined the concept of [[abductive reasoning]], as well as rigorously formulated [[mathematical induction]] and [[deductive reasoning]]. As early as 1886 he saw that [[logic gate|logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits]]; the same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.&lt;ref name=P2M&gt;{{cite book |author=Peirce, C.

==Life==
[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce's birthplace building.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Peirce's birthplace. Now part of [[Lesley University]]'s Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences]]
Peirce was born at 3 Phillips Place in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and [[Benjamin Peirce]], himself a professor of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Harvard University]] and perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Very strong argument, should require citation}} At age&amp;nbsp;12, Charles read his older brother's copy of [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Elements of Logic'', then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max, "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v1/v1intro.htm Introduction]", ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 1:xvii, find phrase "One episode".&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to earn the [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] and [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] (1862) from Harvard; in 1863 the [[Lawrence Scientific School]] awarded him a [[B.Sc.]] that was Harvard's first ''summa cum laude'' [[chemistry]] degree;&lt;ref&gt;"Peirce, Charles Sanders" (1898), ''The National Cyclopedia of American Biography'', v. 8, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1uI-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=%22Peirce%2C%20Charles%22 p. 409].&lt;/ref&gt; and otherwise his academic record was undistinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Chauncey Wright]], and [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=363–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his Harvard instructors, [[Charles William Eliot]], formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This opinion proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard 1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life—repeatedly vetoed Harvard's employing Peirce in any capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=19–20, 53, 75, 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous condition then known as "facial neuralgia", which would today be diagnosed as [[trigeminal neuralgia]]. His biographer, Joseph Brent, says that when in the throes of its pain "he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made his life's later years so tragic.

===Early employment===
Between 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]] and its successor, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]],&lt;ref name=Burch&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Charles Sanders Peirce]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the latter's death in 1880. That employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the [[American Civil War]]; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the [[Boston Brahmin]] Peirces sympathized with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Survey, he worked mainly in [[geodesy]] and [[gravimetry]], refining the use of [[pendulum]]s to determine small local variations in the [[Earth]]'s [[gravity]].&lt;ref name=Burch/&gt;  He was elected a resident fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in January 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Survey sent him to Europe five times,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a [[solar eclipse]]; there, he sought out [[Augustus De Morgan]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], and [[William Kingdon Clifford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an Assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of [[star]]s and the shape of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=SP2&gt;Moore, Edward C., and Robin, Richard S., eds., (1964), ''Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, Second Series'', Amherst: U. of Massachusetts Press. On Peirce the astronomer, see Lenzen's chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 1877 he was elected a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the [[meter]] as so many [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] of a certain [[frequency]],&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max (1983), "Peirce as Scientist, Mathematician, Historian, Logician, and Philosopher", ''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'' (new edition), see p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; the kind of definition employed [[Metre#Standard wavelength of krypton-86 emission|from 1960 to 1983]].

During the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}} Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands during 1883–1909, on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic ''[[Century Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep Peirce Edition Project (UQÀM) – in short] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211228/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep |date=2011-07-06 }}" from [[#PEP|PEP-UQÀM]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, an investigation by the [[William B. Allison|Allison]] Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent [[Julius Hilgard]] and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Nathan, "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v5/v5intro.htm Introduction]", ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 5:xxviii–xxix, find "Allison".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]]'s request.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never again held regular employment.

===Johns Hopkins University===
In 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at [[Johns Hopkins University]], which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy ([[Josiah Royce|Royce]] and [[John Dewey|Dewey]] completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by [[G. Stanley Hall]] and studied by [[Joseph Jastrow]], who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by [[J. J. Sylvester]], who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University]]'' (1883) contained works by himself and [[Allan Marquand]], [[Christine Ladd-Franklin|Christine Ladd]], [[Benjamin Ives Gilman]], and [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]], several of whom were his graduate students.&lt;ref name=grads&gt;Houser, Nathan (1989), "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v4/v4intro.htm Introduction]",  ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 4:xxxviii, find "Eighty-nine".&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held.

Brent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, [[Simon Newcomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=150–54, 195, 279–80, 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as “his difficult personality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Keith Devlin]] believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.&lt;ref name="devlin_2000"/&gt;

Peirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, [[Melusina Fay Peirce|Harriet Melusina Fay]] ("Zina"), left him in 1875,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=98–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with [[Juliette Peirce|Juliette]], whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nationality (she spoke French&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;) remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Nathan, "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v6/v6intro.htm Introduction]", ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 6, first paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=123, 368}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=150–51, 368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success.&lt;ref&gt;In 1885 ({{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=369}}); in 1890 and 1900 (p. 273); in 1891 (pp. 215–16); and in 1892 (pp. 151–52, 222).&lt;/ref&gt; He had no children by either marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===

[[File:Gravestone Charles Sanders Peirce and Juliette Peirce.jpg|thumb|Charles and Juliette Peirce's grave]]

In 1887 Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy {{convert|2000|acre|km2|0}} of rural land near [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], which never yielded an economic return.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=191–92, 217, 270, 318, 321, 337.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peirces named the property "[[Juliette Peirce#Arisbe|Arisbe]]". There they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=369–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles writing prolifically, much of it unpublished to this day (see [[#Works|Works]]). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the [[verso]] side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people, including his brother [[James Mills Peirce]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his neighbors, relatives of [[Gifford Pinchot]], settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' (with whose editor, [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]], he became friendly). He did translations for the [[Smithsonian Institution]], at its director [[Samuel Langley]]'s instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=249–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began but did not complete a number of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed him to the [[Assay Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge [[Francis C. Russell]] of Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced Peirce to editor [[Paul Carus]] and owner [[Edward C. Hegeler]] of the pioneering American philosophy journal ''[[The Monist]]'', which eventually published at least 14 articles by Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many texts in [[James Mark Baldwin]]'s ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Peirce's definitions in the Baldwin|Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]]'' (1901–1905); half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]] under his supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=374–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He applied in 1902 to the newly formed [[Carnegie Institution]] for a grant to write a systematic book of his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis, Newcomb, served on the Institution's executive committee, and its President had been the President of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=279–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend [[William James]], dedicating his ''Will to Believe'' (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=261–64, 290–92, 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=306–07,  315–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used "Santiago" ("St. James" in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See [[Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce]] for discussion and references).

Peirce died destitute in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], twenty years before his widow. Juliette Peirce kept the urn with Peirce’s ashes at Arisbe. In 1934, Pennsylvania Governor [[Gifford Pinchot]] arranged for Juliette’s burial on Milford Cemetery. The urn with Peirce’s ashes was interred with Juliette.&lt;ref&gt;In 2018, plans have been made to erect a memorial monument for Peirce at the site of burrial – see: Justin Weinberg, [http://dailynous.com/2018/03/14/proper-memorial-monument-peirce/ 'A Proper Memorial Monument for Peirce'], website ''[[Daily Nous]]'', March 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery, the American Civil War, and racism===
Peirce grew up in a home where the supremacy of the white Anglo-Saxon male was taken for granted and Negro slavery was considered natural.&lt;ref name=Brent&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brent|first1=Joseph|title=Charles Sanders Peirce, a life|date=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0253211613|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the outbreak of the Civil War his father described himself as a [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]], but after the outbreak of the war, this stopped and he became a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] partisan, providing donations to the Sanitary Commission, the leading Northern war charity. No members of the Peirce family volunteered or enlisted.
Peirce shared his father's views and liked to use the following syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic.&lt;ref name=Menand1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menand|first1=Louis|title=The Metaphysical Club|date=2001|publisher=Flamingo|location=London|isbn=978-0007126903|pages=161–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See: [[Peirce's law#Other proofs of Peirce's law]]''.

Therefore, negroes are equal in political rights to whites.

==Reception==
[[Bertrand Russell]] (1959) wrote,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1959), ''Wisdom of the West'', p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; "Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century, and certainly the greatest American thinker ever." (Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', published from 1910 to 1913, does not mention Peirce; Peirce's work was not widely known until later.)&lt;ref name=Anellis&gt;Anellis, Irving H. (1995), "Peirce Rustled, Russell Pierced: How Charles Peirce and Bertrand Russell Viewed Each Other's Work in Logic, and an Assessment of Russell's Accuracy and Role in the Historiography of Logic", ''Modern Logic'' 5, 270–328. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/anellis/csp&amp;br.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. N. Whitehead]], while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own "process" thinking. (On Peirce and [[process metaphysics]], see Lowe 1964.&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt;) [[Karl Popper]] viewed Peirce as "one of the greatest philosophers of all times".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl (1972), ''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]&lt;ref&gt;See Royce, Josiah, and Kernan, W. Fergus (1916), "Charles Sanders Peirce", ''The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Method'' v. 13, pp. 701–09.

Ogden]] wrote about Peirce with respect, but to no immediate effect.

The first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], the editor of an anthology of Peirce's writings titled ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CLL|Chance, Love, and Logic]]'' (1923) and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings.&lt;ref&gt;Ketner ''et al.'' (1986), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#cb|Comprehensive Bibliography]]'', see p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dewey]] studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins&lt;ref name=grads/&gt; and, from 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' is much influenced by Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;Hookway, Christopher (2008), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/ Pragmatism]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the first six volumes of ''Collected Papers'' (1931–1935), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and [[T. A. Goudge|Goudge]] (1950), the 1941 Ph.D. thesis by [[Arthur W. Burks]] (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The [[#CSPS|Charles S. Peirce Society]] was founded in 1946. Its ''Transactions'', an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce, pragmatism, and American philosophy, has appeared since 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/pages.php?pID=94&amp;CDpath=4|title=Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society|website=Indiana University Press Journals|language=en|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to [[transactionalism]]).

In 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics [[Carolyn Eisele]] (1902–2000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her 40 years of research on Peirce the mathematician and scientist, culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and [[history of ideas|historian of ideas]] [[Max Fisch]] (1900–1995) emerged as an authority on Peirce; Fisch (1986)&lt;ref name=Fisch&gt;Fisch, Max (1986), ''Peirce, Semeiotic, and Pragmatism'', Kenneth Laine Ketner and Christian J. W. Kloesel, eds., Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana U. Pr.&lt;/ref&gt; includes many of his relevant articles, including a wide-ranging survey (Fisch 1986: 422–48) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983.

Peirce has gained a significant international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and [[pragmatism]] in Brazil ([[#CIEP|CeneP/CIEP]]), Finland ([[#HPRC|HPRC]] and [[#CDPT|{{Not a typo|Commens}}]]), Germany ([[#IRGAI|Wirth's group]], [[#RGSEME|Hoffman's and Otte's group]], and Deuser's and Härle's group&lt;ref&gt;Theological Research Group in C.S. Peirce's Philosophy (Hermann Deuser, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen; Wilfred Härle, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany).&lt;/ref&gt;), France ([[#LIRSCE|L'I.R.S.C.E.]]), Spain ([[#GEP|GEP]]), and Italy ([[#CSPI|CSP]]). His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirceans of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the [[University of Toronto]]'s, thanks in good part to the leadership of [[T. A. Goudge|Thomas Goudge]] and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at [[IUPUI|Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]], home of the [[#PEP|Peirce Edition Project]] (PEP), and the [[Pennsylvania State University]].

==Works==
Peirce's reputation rests largely on a number of academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as ''Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'', the ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', ''[[The Monist]]'', ''[[Popular Science]] Monthly'', the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', ''Memoirs of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', and others. See [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime|Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime]] for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Burks|Burks, Arthur]], Introduction, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 7, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; was ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#PR|Photometric Researches]]'' (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited ''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'' (1883), containing chapters by himself and his [[#GS|graduate students]]. Besides lectures during his years (1879–1884) as Lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Lectures by Peirce|Lectures by Peirce]].

[[Harvard University]] obtained from Peirce's widow soon after his death the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Robin, Richard S. (1967), ''[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/robin/robin.htm Annotated Catalogue of the Papers of Charles S. Peirce]''. Amherst MA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; catalogued this ''[[Nachlass]]'' did it become clear that Peirce had left approximately 1650 unpublished manuscripts, totaling over 100,000&amp;nbsp;pages,&lt;ref&gt;"The manuscript material now (1997) comes to more than a hundred thousand pages. These contain many pages of no philosophical interest, but the number of pages on philosophy certainly number much more than half of that. Also, a significant but unknown number of manuscripts have been lost." — Joseph Ransdell (1997), "Some Leading Ideas of Peirce's Semiotic", [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/ransdell/leading.htm#note2 end note 2], 1997 light revision of 1977 version in ''Semiotica'' 19:157–78.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly still unpublished except [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#mf|on microfilm]].

The first published anthology of Peirce's articles was the one-volume ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CLL|Chance, Love and Logic: Philosophical Essays]]'', edited by [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], 1923, still in print. [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Other collections|Other one-volume anthologies]] were published in 1940, 1957, 1958, 1972, 1994, and 2009, most still in print. The main posthumous editions&lt;ref&gt;See for example "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/collections.html Collections of Peirce's Writings]" at ''Commens'', U. of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; of Peirce's works in their long trek to light, often multi-volume, and some still in print, have included:

1931–1958: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' (CP), 8 volumes, includes many published works, along with a selection of previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence. This long-time standard edition drawn from Peirce's work from the 1860s to 1913 remains the most comprehensive survey of his prolific output from 1893 to 1913. It is organized thematically, but texts (including lecture series) are often split up across volumes, while texts from various stages in Peirce's development are often combined, requiring frequent visits to editors' notes.&lt;ref&gt;See 1987 review by B. Kuklick (of ''Peirce'' by Christopher Hookway), in ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science''v. 38, n. 1, pp. 117–19.

1975–1987: [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CN|''Charles Sanders Peirce: Contributions to'' The Nation]], 4 volumes, includes Peirce's more than 300 reviews and articles published 1869–1908 in ''[[The Nation]]''. Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner and James Edward Cook, online.

1976: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce]]'', 4 volumes in 5, included many previously unpublished Peirce manuscripts on mathematical subjects, along with Peirce's important published mathematical articles. Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.

1977: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SS|Semiotic and Significs: The Correspondence between C. S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby]]'' (2nd edition 2001), included Peirce's entire correspondence (1903–1912) with [[Victoria, Lady Welby]]. Peirce's other published correspondence is largely limited to the 14 letters included in volume 8 of the ''Collected Papers'', and the 20-odd pre-1890 items included so far in the ''Writings''. Edited by Charles S. Hardwick with James Cook, out of print.

1982–now: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce, A Chronological Edition]]'' (W), Volumes 1–6 &amp; 8, of a projected 30. The limited coverage, and defective editing and organization, of the ''Collected Papers'' led Max Fisch and others in the 1970s to found the [http://peirce.iupui.edu/ Peirce Edition Project] (PEP), whose mission is to prepare a more complete critical chronological edition. Only seven volumes have appeared to date, but they cover the period from 1859–1892, when Peirce carried out much of his best-known work. ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 8 was published in November 2010; and work continues on ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 7, 9, and 11. In print and online.

Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.

1992: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'' collects in one place Peirce's 1898 series of lectures invited by William James. Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner, with commentary by [[Hilary Putnam]], in print.

1992–1998: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' (EP), 2 volumes, is an important recent sampler of Peirce's philosophical writings. Edited (1) by Nathan Hauser and Christian Kloesel and (2) by ''Peirce Edition Project'' editors, in print.

1997: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#PPM|Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right Thinking]]'' collects Peirce's 1903 Harvard "Lectures on Pragmatism" in a study edition, including drafts, of Peirce's lecture manuscripts, which had been previously published in abridged form; the lectures now also appear in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2. Edited by Patricia Ann Turisi, in print.

2010: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#PMSW|Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Writings]]'' collects important writings by Peirce on the subject, many not previously in print. Edited by Matthew E. Moore, in print.

;Discoveries

Peirce made a number of striking discoveries in formal logic and foundational mathematics, nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after he died:

In 1860&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1860 MS), "Orders of Infinity", [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/PEP_news_Sept2010.pdf ''News from the Peirce Edition Project'', September 2010] (PDF), p. 6, with the manuscript's text.

Peirce'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; he showed how [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] could be done via a [[Functional completeness|repeated sufficient single binary operation]] ([[logical NOR]]), anticipating [[Henry M. Sheffer]] by 33&amp;nbsp;years. (See also [[De Morgan's Laws]].)

In 1881&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1881), "On the Logic of Number", ''American Journal of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQgPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA85 85–95]].

See See Shields, Paul (1997), "Peirce's Axiomatization of Arithmetic", in Houser ''et al.'', eds., ''Studies in the Logic of Charles S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; he set out the [[Peano axioms|axiomatization of natural number arithmetic]], a few years before [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Giuseppe Peano]]. In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as "[[Dedekind-finite]]", and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an [[infinite set]] (Dedekind-infinite), as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that can be put into a [[one-to-one correspondence]] with one of its proper [[subsets]].

In 1885&lt;ref name=CSP1885&gt;Peirce (1885), "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation", ''American Journal of Mathematics'' 7, two parts, first part published 1885, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lwYPAAAAIAAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA180 180–202] (see Houser in [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v4/v4introx.htm#21note linked paragraph] in "Introduction" in ''Writings of Charles S.

In 1886, he saw that Boolean calculations could be carried out via electrical switches,&lt;ref name=P2M/&gt; anticipating [[Claude Shannon]] by more than 50 years. [[File:PeirceAlphaGraphs.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Existential graph]]s: Alpha graphs]]

Based on them are [[John F. Sowa]]'s [[conceptual graph]]s and Sun-Joo Shin's [[diagrammatic reasoning]].

;''The New Elements of Mathematics''

Peirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook, with the working title ''The New Elements of Mathematics'', that presented mathematics from an original standpoint. Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared&lt;ref name=Burks /&gt; in ''The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce'' (1976), edited by mathematician [[Carolyn Eisele]].

;Nature of mathematics

Peirce agreed with [[Auguste Comte]] in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|classified]] mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the [[real numbers]]) and continua. Influenced by his father [[Benjamin Peirce|Benjamin]], Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science ''about'' drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1898), "The Logic of Mathematics in Relation to Education" in ''Educational Review'' v. 15, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/educationalrevie15newyuoft#page/209/mode/1up 209–16] (via ''Internet Archive''). Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 3.553–62. See also his "The Simplest Mathematics" (1902 MS), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 4.227–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; Beginning with his first paper on the [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#LOR1870|"Logic of Relatives" (1870)]], Peirce extended the [[theory of relations]] that [[Augustus De Morgan]] had just recently awakened from its Cinderella slumbers. Much of the mathematics of relations now taken for granted was "borrowed" from Peirce, not always with all due credit; on that and on how the young [[Bertrand Russell]], especially his ''Principles of Mathematics'' and ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', did not do Peirce justice, see Anellis (1995).&lt;ref name=Anellis/&gt; In 1918 the logician [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C.&amp;nbsp;I. Lewis]] wrote, "The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer—at least in the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Clarence Irving (1918), ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'', see ch. 1, §7 "Peirce", pp. 79–106, see [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofsymbolic00lewiiala#page/79/mode/1up p. 79] (''Internet Archive''). Note that Lewis's bibliography lists works by Frege, tagged with asterisks as important.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1940, [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of [[relation algebra]].

Relational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of [[E. H. Moore]] and the [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] of [[Garrett Birkhoff]]. In computer science, the [[relational model]] for [[database]]s was developed with Peircean ideas in work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who was a doctoral student&lt;ref&gt;Avery, John (2003) ''Information theory and evolution'', p. 167; also Mitchell, Melanie, "[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/MMScientificAncestry.html My Scientific Ancestry]".&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Arthur W. Burks]], a Peirce scholar. In economics, relational logic was used by [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[John von Neumann]], and [[Paul Samuelson]] to study preferences and utility and by [[Kenneth J. Arrow]] in ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'', following Arrow's association with Tarski at [[City College of New York]].

On Peirce and his contemporaries [[Ernst Schröder]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Hilary Putnam]] (1982)&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;Putnam, Hilary (1982), "Peirce the Logician", ''Historia Mathematica'' 9, 290–301. Reprinted, pp. 252–60 in Putnam (1990), ''Realism with a Human Face'', Harvard. [http://www.jfsowa.com/peirce/putnam.htm Excerpt with article's last five pages].&lt;/ref&gt; documented that Frege's work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]]. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation"&lt;ref name=CSP1885/&gt; (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by [[Peano]] and Schröder, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, [[philosophy of language]], and the [[foundations of mathematics]].

Peirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides [[Ernst Schröder]]:
* Philosophical algebraist [[William Kingdon Clifford]]&lt;ref&gt;Beil, Ralph G. and Ketner, Kenneth (2003), "Peirce, Clifford, and Quantum Theory", ''International Journal of Theoretical Physics'' v. 42, n. 9, pp. 1957–72.&lt;/ref&gt; and logician [[William Ernest Johnson]], both British;
* The Polish school of logic and foundational mathematics, including [[Alfred Tarski]];
* [[Arthur Prior]], who praised and studied Peirce's logical work in a 1964 paper&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt; and in ''Formal Logic'' (saying on page 4 that Peirce "perhaps had a keener eye for essentials than any other logician before or since.").

A philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982);&lt;ref name=Putnam /&gt;the Introduction in Nathan Houser ''et al.''

Continuity and [[synechism]] are central in Peirce's philosophy: "I did not at first suppose that it was, as I gradually came to find it, the master-Key of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1893–1894, MS 949, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a mathematical point of view, he embraced [[infinitesimal]]s and worked long on the mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903 MS), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.176: "But I now define a ''pseudo-continuum'' as that which modern writers on the theory of functions call a ''continuum''. But this is fully represented by [...] the totality of real values, rational and irrational [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of ''analysis situs'' ([[topology]]); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any [[Aleph number]] (any infinite ''multitude'' as he called it) of instants.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902 MS) and [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Ransdell, Joseph]], ed. (1998), "Analysis of the Methods of Mathematical Demonstration", [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm#m4 Memoir 4], Draft C, MS L75.90–102, see 99–100. (Once there, scroll down).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room. Jérôme Havenel (2008): "It is on 26&amp;nbsp;May 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties."&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Probability and statistics===
Peirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (absolute chance) is real (see [[Tychism]] on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation]] of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) [[statistical model|probability]] when such models are not based on objective [[randomization]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce condemned the use of "certain [[likelihood function|likelihoods]]" (''The Essential Peirce'', 2:108–09) even more strongly than he criticized [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian methods]]. Indeed Peirce used a bit of [[Bayesian inference]] in criticizing parapsychology (''Writings of Charles S. Pierce'', 6:76).&lt;/ref&gt; Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his [[possible world semantics]] introduced the [[propensity probability|"propensity" theory of probability]] before [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Richard W. (1975), "Propensity: Popper or Peirce?", ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]'' ([http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org site]), v. 26, n. 2, pp. 123–32. {{doi|10.1093/bjps/26.2.123}}.

Peirce was one of the [[founders of statistics]]. He formulated modern statistics in "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" (1877–1878) and "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]" (1883).

==Philosophy==
{{quote|It is not sufficiently recognized that Peirce's career was that of a scientist, not a philosopher; and that during his lifetime he was known and valued chiefly as a scientist, only secondarily as a logician, and scarcely at all as a philosopher. Even his work in philosophy and logic will not be understood until this fact becomes a standing premise of Peircean studies.|Max Fisch 1964, p. 486.&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt;}}

Peirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], [[statistics]], [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt; [[metrology]],&lt;ref name=metr/&gt; [[geodesy]], [[experimental psychology]],&lt;ref name=psych/&gt; [[economics]],&lt;ref name=econom/&gt; [[linguistics]],&lt;ref name=ling/&gt; and the [[history and philosophy of science]]. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.

Peirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system, belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion ([[fallibilism]]) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways—including philosophical [[pragmatism]] (which he founded), [[#Critical common-sensism|critical common-sensism]], and [[scientific method]]&amp;mdash;and, in metaphysics: [[Philosophical realism|Scholastic realism]], e.g. [[John Duns Scotus]], belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, [[objective idealism]], and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love.  In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like [[skepticism]] and [[positivism]], respectively, in others' work.  However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an [[Pragmatism#antiskep|anti-skepticism]] and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity,&lt;ref name=FCE&gt;Peirce (1897) "Fallibilism, Continuity, and Evolution", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.141–75 ([http://www.textlog.de/4248.html Eprint]), placed by the ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', editors directly after "F.R.L." (1899, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.135–40).&lt;/ref&gt; and pragmatism commits one to anti-[[nominalist]] belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453–57).

For Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;Peirce (1903), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.180–202 and (1906) "The Basis of Pragmaticism", ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:372–73, see "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.

===Theory of categories===
{{Main article|Categories (Peirce)}}

On May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled "[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm On a New List of Categories]" to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[G. W. F. Hegel]], categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Burch/&gt; Peirce scholars generally regard the "New List" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's "architectonic", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How To Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.

"On a New List of Categories" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.&lt;ref&gt;See in "Firstness", "Secondness", and "Thirdness" in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1893), "The Categories" MS 403. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/bycsp.htm#NLOC-R Eprint], edited by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph Ransdell]], with information on the re-write, and interleaved with the 1867 "New List" for comparison.&lt;/ref&gt; {{C. S. Peirce categorial table}}

===Aesthetics and ethics===
Peirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://agora.phi.gvsu.edu/kap/CSP_Bibliography/CSP_norm_bib.pdf Charles S. Peirce on Esthetics and Ethics: A Bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030406170524/http://agora.phi.gvsu.edu/kap/CSP_Bibliography/CSP_norm_bib.pdf |date=2003-04-06 }}" (PDF) by Kelly A. Parker in 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902 MS), Carnegie Application, edited by Joseph Ransdell, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm Memoir 2], see table.&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized aesthetics as the study of the good (grasped as the admirable), and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/esthetics.html Esthetics] at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy: logic, or semiotic==
{{Semiotics}}

===Logic as philosophical===
Peirce regarded logic ''per se'' as a division of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref name=FRL&gt;Peirce (1899 MS), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.135–40, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071421/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the art of devising methods of research".&lt;ref name=ars&gt;Peirce (1882), "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', v. 2, n. 19, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 11–12] (via Google), November 1882. Reprinted (''The Essential Peirce'', 1:210–14; ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 4:378–82; ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 7.59–76). The definition of logic quoted by Peirce is by [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]].&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1878), "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–15 (CP 2.645–68, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 3:276–90, ''The Essential Peirce'', 1:142–154). {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. ... logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall ''not'' be limited. ... Logic is rooted in the social principle.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) "mathematics of logic" much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply "logic". He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.

Peirce argued that [[#fs|logic is formal semiotic]], the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs&lt;ref name=QFM&gt;Peirce, (1868), "Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA103 pp. 103–14].

Peirce'', 2:193–211, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:11–27. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; and sign processes ("semiosis") such as the inquiry process. He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or [[universal rhetoric]], or methodeutic,&lt;ref name=rhetoric/&gt; the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.

====Presuppositions of logic====
In his "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and "in one sense, the sole", rule of reason is that, ''to learn, one needs to desire to learn'' and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think.&lt;ref name="FRL"/&gt; So, the first rule is, ''to wonder''. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:
:...there follows one [[corollary]] which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:
&lt;center&gt;Do not block the way of inquiry.&lt;/center&gt;
Peirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that "the one unpardonable offence" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which "metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted". Peirce in many writings holds that [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|logic precedes metaphysics]] (ontological, religious, and physical).

Peirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of ''fallibilism'', which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real ([[tychism]] and [[synechism]]).&lt;ref name=FCE/&gt;

The First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough ([[#defs|see below]]). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), The Carnegie Institute Application, Memoir 10, MS L75.361–62, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-04.htm#m10 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

# No power of Introspection. All knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from known external facts.
# No power of Intuition (cognition without logical determination by previous cognitions). No cognitive stage is absolutely first in a process. All mental action has the form of inference.
# No power of thinking without signs. A cognition must be interpreted in a subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all.
# No conception of the absolutely incognizable.
(The above sense of the term "intuition" is almost Kant's, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)

Peirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning,&lt;ref name=GVLL/&gt; and the falsity of philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]] ([[#Against Cartesianism|see below]]).

Peirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself&lt;ref name=SCFI /&gt; and later said that to "dismiss make-believes" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905), "What Pragmatism Is", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 2, pp. 161–81, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 see 167]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.411–37, see 416. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/whatis/whatpragis.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Logic as formal semiotic====
Peirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in [[Aristotle]]'s work, in such ''loci'' as: the basic terminology of [[psychology]] in ''[[On the Soul]]''; the founding description of [[sign relation]]s in ''[[On Interpretation]]''; and the differentiation of [[inference]] into three modes that are commonly translated into English as ''[[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'', in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', as well as inference by [[analogy]] (called ''paradeigma'' by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.

Peirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both ''[[semiotic]]'' and ''semeiotic''. Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic [[sign relation]], and defined ''[[semiosis]]'' as "action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce 1907, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.484. Reprinted, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:411 in "Pragmatism" (398–433).&lt;/ref&gt; As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse:

{{quote|To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.|Peirce 1868.&lt;ref name=QFM/&gt;}}
Peirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where 'sign' is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or ''quasi-mind'', that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-mind]" in ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt;—the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).

Inquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:

# Conditions for meaningfulness. Study of significatory elements and combinations, their grammar.
# Validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various separate modes.
# Conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.

Peirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:

{{quote|''On the Definition of Logic''. Logic is ''formal semiotic''. A sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''. This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of [[Weierstrass]]ian severity, and that is perfectly evident. The word "formal" in the definition is also defined.|sign= Peirce, "Carnegie Application", ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, p. 54.}}

===Signs===
{{Main article|Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce}} {{See also|Representation (arts)#Peirce and representation|Sign (semiotics)#Triadic signs}}
:''A list of noted writings by Peirce on signs and sign relations is at [[Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce#References and further reading|Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce § References and further reading]].''

====Sign relation====
Peirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign—not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The ''[[sign relation]]'' is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its ''object'', and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its ''interpretant'' (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible ''[[triadic relation]]'', according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.

''Extension × intension = information.'' Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Logic of information|information]]'', including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1867), "Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension" (CP 2.391–426), ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06.htm ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 2:70–86]).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.

''Determination.'' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object—the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object—an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience&lt;ref name=collateral&gt;See pp. 404–09 in "Pragmatism" in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101 here] at peirce-l's Lyris archive. Note: Ransdell's quotes from ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 8.178–79 are also in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:493–94, which gives their date as 1909; and his quote from ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 8.183 is also in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:495–96, which gives its date as 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word "determine" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of "specializes," ''bestimmt'',&lt;ref name=determined&gt;Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:492.&lt;/ref&gt; involving variable amount, like an influence.&lt;ref name=Marty&gt;See "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/76defeng.htm 76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce]", collected by Robert Marty (U. of Perpignan, France).&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, A Letter to Lady Welby (1908), ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'', pp. 80–81: {{quote|I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of "upon a person" is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object determines the sign to determine another sign—the interpretant—to be related to the object ''as the sign is related to the object'', hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.&lt;ref name=Marty/&gt;

====Semiotic elements====
Peirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):
# A ''sign'' (or ''representamen'')&lt;ref&gt;''Representamen'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɛ|p|r|ɪ|z|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|ə|n}} {{respell|REP|ri|zen|TAY|mən}}) was adopted ([[wikt:representamen|not coined]]) by Peirce as his technical term for the ''sign'' as covered in his theory, in case a divergence should come to light between his theoretical version and the popular senses of the word "sign". He eventually stopped using "representamen". See ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:272–73 and ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'' p. 193, quotes in "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html Representamen]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; represents, in the broadest possible sense of "represents". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial—a cloud might be a sign of rain for instance, or ruins the sign of ancient civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language|year=1984|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis|isbn=978-0253203984|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Peirce sometimes put it (he defined ''sign'' at least 76 times&lt;ref name=Marty/&gt;), the sign stands ''for'' the object ''to'' the interpretant. A sign represents its object in some respect, which respect is the sign's ''ground''.&lt;ref name=ground/&gt;
# An ''object'' (or ''semiotic object'') is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as [[Prince Hamlet]].&lt;ref name=fictive&gt;Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:492–502. Fictional object, 498. Object as universe of discourse, 492. See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dynamicalobject.html Dynamical Object]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the [[universe of discourse]] to which the partial or special object belongs.&lt;ref name=fictive/&gt; For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded "as on bedrock".&lt;ref&gt;See "Immediate Object", etc., at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].&lt;/ref&gt;
# An ''[[interpretant]]'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's "predecessor" (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object. An interpretant either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a ''final'' or ''normal'' interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign ''would'' have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.
Some of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref name=collateral/&gt;

====Classes of signs====
Among Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]], via Peirce's three phenomenological [[#Theory of categories|categories]]: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.&lt;ref name=9signs/&gt;

I. ''Qualisign, sinsign, legisign'' (also called'' tone, token, type,'' and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''):&lt;ref name=terms&gt;On the varying terminology, look up in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].&lt;/ref&gt; This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a "First"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a "Second"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a "Third".

II. ''Icon, index, symbol'': This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object—the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.

III. ''Rheme, dicisign, argument'' (also called ''sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,'' also ''seme, pheme, delome,''&lt;ref name=terms/&gt; and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional ''term, proposition, argument''): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}}
Every sign belongs to one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) ''and'' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.

===Modes of inference===
{{Main article|Inquiry}}
Borrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three basic modes of [[inference]]—''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]''—in his "critique of arguments" or "logic proper". Peirce also called abduction "retroduction", "presumption", and, earliest of all, "hypothesis". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical [[Syllogism#Barbara (AAA-1)|syllogism Barbara (AAA)]], for example in "Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis" (1878).&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 13, pp. 470–82, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=u8sWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA472 472] or [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 13/August 1878/Illustrations of the Logic of Science VI|the book at Wikisource]]. ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.619–44 [623]&lt;/ref&gt; He does this by rearranging the ''rule'' (Barbara's major premise), the ''case'' (Barbara's minor premise), and the ''result'' (Barbara's conclusion):

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
Deduction.

''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. &lt;br&gt;
''Case:'' These beans are beans from this bag. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Result:'' These beans are white.
{{col-break|gap=1%}}
Induction.

''Case:'' These beans are &amp;#91;randomly selected&amp;#93; from this bag. &lt;br&gt;
''Result:'' These beans are white. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white.
{{col-break|gap=1%}}
Hypothesis (Abduction).

''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. &lt;br&gt;
''Result:'' These beans [oddly] are white. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Case:'' These beans are from this bag.
{{col-end}}

Peirce 1883 in "A Theory of Probable Inference" (''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'') equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before&lt;ref name=SCFI/&gt;). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:&lt;ref&gt;See, under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce'', the following quotes:
* On correction of "A Theory of Probable Inference", see quotes from "Minute Logic", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.102, c. 1902, and from the Carnegie Application (L75), 1902, ''Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science'' v. 2, pp. 1031–32.
* On new logical form for abduction, see quote from Harvard Lectures on Pragmatism, 1903, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.188–89.
See also Santaella, Lucia (1997) "The Development of Peirce's Three Types of Reasoning: Abduction, Deduction, and Induction", 6th Congress of the [[IASS]]. [http://www.pucsp.br/~lbraga/epap_peir1.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The surprising fact, C, is observed;
:But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,
:Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.}}
The logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. "Deduction proves that something ''must'' be; Induction shows that something ''actually is'' operative; Abduction merely suggests that something ''may be''."&lt;ref&gt;"Lectures on Pragmatism", 1903, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.171.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction.&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to J. H. Kehler (dated 1911), ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 3, pp. 203–04, see in "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/retroduction.html Retroduction]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[methodeutic]] or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing.

* Pragmatism (1907 MS in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2)&lt;/div&gt; Peirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, which he called ''[[pragmatism]]'' and, later, ''[[pragmaticism]]'', is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called ''[[pragmatic maxim]]''. Here is one of his more [[Pragmatic maxim#2|emphatic reiterations]] of it:

{{quote|Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have. Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object.}}

As a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, [[William James]], and others in [[the Metaphysical Club]]. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877) and especially "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) as foundational to [[pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1897), ''The Will to Believe'', see p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (CP 5.11–12), like James (''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

In 1905 Peirce coined the new name [[pragmaticism]] "for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition", saying that "all went happily" with James's and [[F.C.S. Schiller]]'s variant uses of the old name "pragmatism" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in "literary journals, where it gets abused". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author [[Giovanni Papini]]'s declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pragmaticism#Pragmaticism's name]] for discussion and references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" series of articles. In the second one, "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:
# Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
# Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea "distinct", that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition "nominal" (CP 5.553).
# Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's conceived effects, such as fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduced that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. In clearness's second grade (the "nominal" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.&lt;ref name=Induction&gt;"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead", in Peirce (1878 April), "The Probability of Induction", p. [https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up 718] (via ''Internet Archive'' ) in ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705–18. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.669–93, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 3:290–305, ''The Essential Peirce'', 1:155–69, elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.

Peirce said that a conception's meaning consists in "[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]" implied by "acceptance" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to "vulgar" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.13 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.34 [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce ascribed the success of modern science less to a novel interest in verification than to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph Ransdell]]'s comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/intro/l75intro.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; which he variously called speculative, general, formal or [[universal rhetoric]] or simply methodeutic.&lt;ref name=rhetoric&gt;See [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/rhetoricspec.html rhetoric definitions] at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

====Theory of inquiry====
{{See also|Inquiry}}

=====Critical common-sensism=====
Critical common-sensism,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 4, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA481-IA20 481–99]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.438–63. Also important: ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.497–525.&lt;/ref&gt; treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy]] with a [[fallibilism]] that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.

=====Rival methods of inquiry=====
In "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched '''four methods''' of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:
# The method of '''tenacity''' (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
# The method of '''authority''' – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
# The method of the '''''a priori''''' – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The method of '''science''' – wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the 1898 Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.616–48 in part and ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'', 105–22, reprinted in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:27–41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's "first rule"&lt;ref name=FRL/&gt; is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. [[Scientific method]] excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive—eventually—at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

=====Scientific method=====
Insofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]''; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.

Based on his critique of three [[#Modes of inference|modes of argument]] and different from either [[foundationalism]] or [[coherentism]], Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:

# Active, [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;
# Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;
# Inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience, in both senses: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''.

Thereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''simpliciter'', which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.

A theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.

Peirce extracted the pragmatic [[mental model|model]] or [[theory]] of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.

Abduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective [[modularity (programming)|modularity]] of its principal components.

Peirce's outline of the scientific method in §III–IV of "A Neglected Argument"&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Peirce (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", published in large part, ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, 90–112. Reprinted with an unpublished part, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.452–85, ''Selected Writings'' pp. 358–79, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:434–50, ''Peirce on Signs'' 260–78.&lt;/ref&gt; is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of [[#Modes of inference|critique of arguments]]).

1. '''Abductive''' (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the "facile and natural", as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from "logical simplicity".&lt;ref&gt;See also Nubiola, Jaime (2004), "[http://www.unav.es/users/LumeNaturale.html Il Lume Naturale: Abduction and God]", ''Semiotiche'' I/2, 91–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (c. 1906), "PAP (Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism)" (MS 293), ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, pp. 319–20, first quote under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism "the logic of abduction".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), "Pragmatism – The Logic of Abduction", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.195–205, especially 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Carnegie application, MS L75.279–80: [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Memoir 27], Draft B.&lt;/ref&gt; and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;See MS L75.329–30, from Draft D of [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Memoir 27] of Peirce's application to the Carnegie Institution: {{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), breadth, or incomplexity.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents", ''The Essential Peirce'', 2, see pp. 107–09. On Twenty Questions, see 109: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

2. '''Deductive''' phase. Two stages:
:i. Explication. Not clearly premised, but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.
:ii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found. [[Corollary|Corollarial]] or, if needed, Theorematic.

3. '''Inductive''' phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real "is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead";&lt;ref name=Induction/&gt; in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows "a method which, sufficiently persisted in," will "diminish the error below any predesignate degree." Three stages:
:i. Classification. Not clearly premised, but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas.
:ii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 7.114–20). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of ''S'', ''S'' is found actually accompanied by ''P'' that was predicted for ''S'' (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.
:iii. Sentential Induction. "...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".

=====Against Cartesianism=====
Peirce drew on the methodological implications of the [[#Four incapacities|four incapacities]]—no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable—to attack philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]], of which he said that:&lt;ref name=SCFI /&gt;

1. "It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt" – when, instead, we start with preconceptions, "prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us ''can'' be questioned", though we may find reason to question them later. "Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts."

2. "It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness" – when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left. No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy's multi-generational dream. When "candid and disciplined minds" continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory's author should feel doubts about it.

3. It trusts to "a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses" – when, instead, philosophy should, "like the successful sciences", proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to "the multitude and variety of its arguments" as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but "a cable whose fibers", soever "slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected".

4. It renders many facts "absolutely inexplicable, unless to say that 'God makes them so' is to be regarded as an explanation"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce believed in God. See section [[#Philosophy: metaphysics]].&lt;/ref&gt; – when, instead, philosophy should avoid being "unidealistic",&lt;ref&gt;However, Peirce disagreed with Hegelian [[absolute idealism]]. See for example ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 8.131.&lt;/ref&gt; misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas, and supposing, inevitably, "some absolutely inexplicable, unanalyzable ultimate", which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible.

Peirce [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) [[wikt:psychical|psychical]] or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.

'''Ontology.''' Peirce was a Scholastic Realist, declaring for the reality of generals as early as 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1868), "Nominalism versus Realism", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 1, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA57 57–61]. Reprinted (CP 6.619–24), ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_14/v2_14.htm ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 2:144–53]).&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 "The Logic of Relatives" he wrote: {{quote|I formerly defined the possible as that which in a given state of information (real or feigned) we do not know not to be true. But this definition today seems to me only a twisted phrase which, by means of two negatives, conceals an anacoluthon. We know in advance of experience that certain things are not true, because we see they are impossible.}} Peirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they ''would'' behave under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;On developments in Peirce's realism, see:

'''Psychical or religious metaphysics.''' Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits—and it is a belief in God not as an ''actual'' or ''existent'' being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a ''real'' being.&lt;ref name=Godasreal&gt;Peirce in his 1906 "Answers to Questions concerning my Belief in God", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.495, [http://users.xplornet.com/~gnox/CSPgod.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223094243/http://users.xplornet.com/~gnox/CSPgod.htm |date=2008-02-23 }}, reprinted in part as "The Concept of God" in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'', J. Buchler, ed., 1940, pp. 375–78: {{quote|I will also take the liberty of substituting "reality" for "existence." This is perhaps overscrupulosity; but I myself always use ''exist'' in its strict philosophical sense of "react with the other like things in the environment." Of course, in that sense, it would be fetichism to say that God "exists." The word "reality," on the contrary, is used in ordinary parlance in its correct philosophical sense. [....] I define the ''real'' as that which holds its characters on such a tenure that it makes not the slightest difference what any man or men may have ''thought'' them to be, or ever will have ''thought'' them to be, here using thought to include, imagining, opining, and willing (as long as forcible ''means'' are not used); but the real thing's characters will remain absolutely untouched.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Wikisource:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]" (1908),&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will "stand or fall with the hypothesis"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an "infinitely incomprehensible" being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be ''more'' false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is free&lt;ref&gt;See his [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#MMS|"The Doctrine of Necessity Examined" (1892) and "Reply to the Necessitarians" (1893)]], to both of which editor [[Paul Carus]] responded.&lt;/ref&gt; and (see [[Synechism]]) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.

'''Physical metaphysics.''' Peirce held the view, which he called [[objective idealism]], that "matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1891), "The Architecture of Theories",'' [[The Monist]]'' v. 1, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart01hegeuoft#page/161/mode/1up 161–76], see [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart01hegeuoft#page/170/mode/1up p. 170], via ''Internet Archive''. Reprinted (CP 6.7–34) and (''The Essential Peirce'', 1:285–97, see p. 293).&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce asserted the reality of (1) absolute chance (his [[Tychism|tychist]] view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love ([[Agapism|agapist]] view), echoing his [[#Theory of categories|categories]] Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called "sporting"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called "tychasm", "anancasm", and "agapasm")&lt;ref&gt;See "tychism", "tychasm", "tychasticism", and the rest, at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].&lt;/ref&gt; of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]]; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1893), "Evolutionary Love", ''The Monist'' v. 3, pp. 176–200. Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.278–317, ''The Essential Peirce'', 1:352–72. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/evolove/evolove.htm Eprint] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520131053/http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/evolove/evolove.htm |date=May 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially of space, time, and law.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 115 in ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'' (Peirce's 1898 lectures).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science of review==
{{Main article|Classification of the sciences (Peirce)}}
Peirce outlined two fields, "Cenoscopy" and "Science of Review", both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science.  In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus:&lt;ref name=phil/&gt;

# Science of Discovery.
## Mathematics.
## Cenoscopy (philosophy as discussed earlier in this article – categorial, normative, metaphysical), as First Philosophy, concerns positive phenomena in general, does not rely on findings from special sciences, and includes the ''general'' study of inquiry and scientific method.
## Idioscopy, or the Special Sciences (of nature and mind).
# Science of Review, as Ultimate Philosophy, arranges "...the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science". His examples included [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s ''[[Alexander Von Humboldt#The "Cosmos"|Cosmos]]'', [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s ''Philosophie positive'', and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]'s ''Synthetic Philosophy''.
# Practical Science, or the Arts.

Peirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.

'''Civil-military operations''' or '''CMO''' are activities of a military force to minimize civil interference on and maximize civil support for [[military operation]]s.  CMO is conducted in conjunction with combat operations during wartime and becomes a central part of a military campaign in [[Counter-insurgency|counter-insurgencies]].  Some militaries have specialized units dedicated to conduct CMO, such as [[Civil Affairs|civil affairs]] forces or form task forces specifically for this purposes, such as a [[joint civil-military operations task force]] in the U.S. Military.  Also, some militaries have staff sections dedicated to planning and coordinating CMO for their command.  CMO is often called [[Civil-Military Co-operation|civil-military co-operation]] or CIMIC in [[NATO]] operations and [[Civil-military coordination|civil-military co-ordination]] in [[United Nations|UN]] operations.
==Official definitions==
The [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Military]] defines CMO as:

{{quote|Military activities associated with an operation that ensure that military commanders comprehend, make use of and mitigate any negative impact of the civil environment on military operations and plans.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Department of National Defence, Canadian Force Operations, National Defence Pub B-GJ-005-300/FP-000 (Ottawa: DND, August 15, 2005), p. 19-2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Military of the United States|U.S. Military]] defines CMO as:

{{quote|The activities of a commander that establish, maintain, influence, or exploit relations between military forces, governmental and nongovernmental civilian organizations and authorities, and the civilian populace in a friendly, neutral, or hostile operational area in order to facilitate military operations, to consolidate and achieve operational US objectives. Civil-military operations may include performance by military forces of activities and functions normally the responsibility of the local, regional, or national government. These activities may occur prior to, during, or subsequent to other military actions. They may also occur, if directed, in the absence of other military operations. Civil-military operations may be performed by designated civil affairs, by other military forces, or by a combination of civil affairs and other forces.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Civil-Military Operations, Joint Publication (JP) 3-57 (Washington, DC: CJCS, July 08, 2008), p.

The '''Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching''', also referred to as the '''Cognitive Theory of Interactive Teaching''', was developed by Allan Collins and Albert L. Stevens (Collins &amp; Stevens, 1981).  Allan Collins was a chief scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., a research firm in Cambridge Massachusetts. He is also a specialist in the field of [[cognitive science]] and human semantic processing.  Albert L. Stevens was a senior scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. He was also director of the company's [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[Education Technology]] and Training Systems Division.  He is also a specialist in cognitive science. (Reigeluth, 1983)
The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins and Stevens (1981) requires the learner to construct theories and principles through dialogue, the teaching of self-questioning techniques and the teaching of [[metacognitive]] or [[self-monitoring]] skills, all with the intent of clarifying misconceptions so the theory or principle is well articulated and developed.  The essence of the cognitive theory of Inquiry teaching is that of developing students' metacognitive skills. Inquiry teaching deliberately attempts to develop these stills through instruction.

The theory is a prescriptive model rooted in the discovery tradition and cognitive sciences. It was derived form an analysis of the transcripts of teachers, described as interactive teachers, using a variety of teaching strategies. These strategies were in some way related to one of the following methodology: the inquiry method of the teaching, discovery method of teaching and Socratic method of teaching.  The transcripts studied represent a variety of topics taught by teachers across different subject areas (Reigeluth, 1983). Collins and Stevens believed that their Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is domain independent or that it can be applied across subject areas or the curriculum.

== Historical background ==
Inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodologies of the ancient Greek. According Mayer and Alexander (2011), inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodology of the ancient Greek, where the teacher poses a problem and assists the student in solving that problem by asking a series of question. They have also pointed out that this method of instruction can be seen in the works of Plato and Socrates.
Bransford, Franks and Sherwood (1989), as cited by Mayer and Alexander (2011), have indicated that it was not until the 1960s that the role of teachers started to change from where the teacher provided the student with the questions as well as the answers. After the 1960s, instruction provided greater opportunity for students to engage in creating their own answers to questions posed (Mayer &amp; Alexander, 2011).

== Characteristics ==
The purpose of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins (1986) is to provide learners with the opportunity to “actively engage in articulating theories and principles that are critical to deep understanding of a domain” (p.1). Collins (1986) believes that the knowledge attained will allow the learner to actively and meaningfully engage in solving problems and making predictions.  He also indicated that the knowledge acquire is not simply content knowledge. Figure 1 summarizes Collins and Stevens Theory of Inquiry Teaching.

The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry (Interactive) Teaching according to the Reigeluth (1983) consists of three parts: 
# The teachers goals
# The teaching strategies employed by teachers
# The controlling structures used to govern their teaching.

There are two main goals teachers using the inquiry method seek to achieve, according to Collin and Stevens (1981): 
# The teaching of a particular rule or theory
# Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory.

These two main goals are associated with several sub-goals. The list below identifies the two main goals and their associated sub-goal as posited by Collins and Stevens (1981):
#The teaching of a particular rule or theory
#* Analyzing and addressing misconceptions of students hypotheses
#* Students are taught how to make prediction in new situations
#Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory
#* Students are taught what questions to ask
#* Students are taught the nature of the theory or rule
#* Students are taught how to test the rule or theory
#* Student are taught how to articulate and defend the rule or theory

== Teaching strategies employed by teachers ==
Collins and Stevens (1981) have highlighted ten teaching strategies used by teachers using inquiry teaching. They believed that these ten teaching strategies, listed below, are the most important ones identified in their investigation. These ten teaching strategies identified by Collin and Stevens (1981, p. 18) are:
#Selecting positive and negative exemplars
#Varying cases systematically
#Selecting counterexamples 
#Generating hypothetical cases 
#Forming hypotheses 
#Testing hypotheses 
#Considering alternative predictions 
#Entrapping students 
#Tracing consequences to a contradiction 
#Questioning authority
 
== Controlling structures used to govern their teaching ==
Colling and Stevens (1981) indicated that the time allocated between the teachers' goals and sub-goals is critical to the effectiveness of inquiry teaching. Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited by Collins and Stevens (1981) had made an attempt at developing a theory of controlling structures after getting feedback from several tutors. This controlling structure theory consisted of four parts. The four parts this theory includes the following: 
#"a set of strategies for selecting cases with respect to the main goals,
#a student model,
#an agenda,
#a set of priority rules for adding goals and sub-goals to the agenda." (p. 47)
Collins and Stevens (1981) have suggested that base on the goals of the teacher, cases are selected to ensure that student develop mastery of the principles or theories being taught. They have also indicated that teachers appear to develop some strategies for selecting cases to develop students' mastery of the principles or theories. These are some of the strategies used by teachers for selecting cases as mentioned by Collins and Stevens (1981):
#cases that demonstrated the more important factors were selected before those that have less important factors
#the cases selected were sequenced from concrete factors to abstract factors
#the selection of cases dependent on their importance and frequency: more important or frequent to less important and less frequent
According to Collins and Stevens the controlling structure used to govern the dialogue in the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is demonstrated in the following manner:
#A case is chosen, which is a theory or principle, based on the main goal of the teacher. The teacher then questions students to determine their understanding of the theory. Students' answers reveal their understanding or lack of understanding. Next, the teacher tags the theory or principle based what students know, their error and what they do not know. Collins and Stevens referred to this as the students' model.
#Armed with the students' model, the teacher can then add information to facilitate and improve students understanding of what is known. This is determined by the level of sophistication of students' answers.
#Sub-goals are developed to diagnose and address students' errors and misconceptions.
#An agenda is developed prioritizing how students' errors and misconception well be address using the sub-goals developed.
Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited in Collins and Stevens (1981), have identified how priorities have been set by teachers. Priorities have been set based on the following:
#"Errors before omissions.
#Prior steps before later steps.
#Shorter fixes before longer fixes.
#More important factors before less important factors" (p. 49)
Criticism of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching
Reigeluth (1983) has put forward the following criticisms about Cognitive Theory of Inquiry:
#He believes that the theory is not suitable for all kinds of content as proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981), who believed that the theory is domain independent and that it can be used to facilitate the development of rules and theories needed for deep understand of the domain. The theory, as he indicated, is more applicable to instruction involving the construction or understanding of rules, principles and theories. The theory may not be suitable for the teaching of facts or concept.
#He believes that the theory is not self-sufficient, in that it requires the use of other forms of instruction to facilitate the development students background information, which is critical to the discovery process proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981)
#The theory may not be efficient in specific rules and principle, particularly those involving algorithms, where an expository approach may be more efficient.

== Conclusion ==
The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching, despite the short coming identified by Reigeluth (1983), provides some strategies for teaching high-order thinking skills. Reigeluth (1983) also points out that the Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Teaching provides some strategies for instruction that other theories have overlooked. Strategies such as considering alternative prediction, entrapping students, tracing consequences to a contradiction and questioning authority are invaluable skill in critical thinking. 
The focus of education today is to develop learners who are independent critical thinkers. There was once the belief that critical thinking skills could not be taught and that these skills develop naturally independent of instruction. The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry of Teaching indicate that learners can be taught strategies to develop and apply critical thinking skills.
Dewey (1938), as cited by McGregor (2007), pointed out that if students are provided with factual information without the cognitive skills that would enable them to understand, appreciate, transfer and connect ideas, the information gained would become meaningless in the future. It implies therefore, that instruction should seek to nurture the development of critical thinking skill.
Dewey (1910) as cited by McGregor (2007), has also indicated that there is a connection between thinking and learning. He posited that "thoughts involved in developing ideas and understandings are often assumed and implicated. To develop thoughtful learning these processes need to be more explicit and connected to the processes of coming to know and understand" (p. 47).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8350">In genetics and cell biology, repression is a mechanism often used to decrease or inhibit the expression of a gene. Removal of repression is called '''derepression'''. This mechanism may occur at different stages in the expression of a gene, with the result of increasing the overall RNA or protein products. Dysregulation of derepression mechanisms can result in altered gene expression patterns, which may lead to negative phenotypic consequences such as disease.

== Derepression of transcription ==
[[Transcription (biology)|Transcription]] can be repressed in a variety of ways, and therefore can be derepressed in different ways as well. A common mechanism is [[allosteric regulation]]. This is when a [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] binds a [[Repressor|repressor protein]] and causes it to undergo a [[conformational change]]. If the repressor is bound upstream of a gene, such as in an operator sequence, then it would be repressing the gene's expression. This conformational change would take away the repressor’s ability to bind DNA, thus removing its repressive effect on transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Mitchell|date=June 2005|title=The lac repressor|journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies|volume=328|issue=6|pages=521–548|doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2005.04.004|issn=1631-0691|pmid=15950160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of transcriptional derepression uses [[chromatin remodeling]] complexes. For transcription to occur, [[RNA polymerase]] needs to have access to the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] sequence of the gene or it cannot bind the DNA. Sometimes these sequences are wrapped around [[nucleosome]]s or are in condensed [[heterochromatin]] regions, and are therefore inaccessible. Through different chromatin remodeling mechanisms these promoter sequences can become accessible to the RNA polymerase, and transcription becomes derepressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urnov|first=F. D.|last2=Wolffe|first2=A.

Transcriptional derepression may also occur at the level of [[transcription factor]] activation. Certain families of transcription factors are non-functional on their own because their [[Active site|active domains]] are blocked by another part of the protein.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shingler|first=V.|date=February 1996|title=Signal sensing by sigma 54-dependent regulators: derepression as a control mechanism|journal=Molecular Microbiology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=409–416|issn=0950-382X|pmid=8830233|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.1996.388920.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substrate binding to this second, regulatory domain causes a conformational change in the protein to allows access to the active domain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This lets the transcription factor bind to DNA and serve its function, thus derepressing the transcription factor.

== Derepression of translation ==
Derepression of [[Translation (biology)|translation]] increases protein production without altering the levels of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] in the cell. [[MicroRNA|miRNA]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are a common mechanism of translation repression, binding to the mRNA through complimentary base pairing to silence them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McManus|first=Michael T.|last2=Petersen|first2=Christian P.|last3=Haines|first3=Brian B.|last4=Chen|first4=Jianzhu|last5=Sharp|first5=Phillip A.|date=June 2002|title=Gene silencing using micro-RNA designed hairpins|journal=RNA|volume=8|issue=6|pages=842–850|issn=1355-8382|pmc=1370301|pmid=12088155|doi=10.1017/s1355838202024032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[RNA-binding protein|RNA binding proteins]] have been shown to target [[untranslated region]]s of the mRNAs and upregulate the translation initiation rates by alleviating the repressive miRNA effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=T|last2=Yap|first2=NL|last3=Roberts|first3=R|last4=Stewart|first4=AF|date=2012|title=Mechanisms of Translational Derepression During Ischemia|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Cardiology|volume=28|issue=|pages=S193-S194|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cjca.2012.07.256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of derepression ==

=== Auxin signalling ===
An example is the [[auxin]] mediated derepression of the auxin response factor family of transcription factors in plants. These auxin response factors are repressed by Aux/IAA repressors. In the presence of auxin, these Aux/AII proteins undergo [[ubiquitin]]ation and are then degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogg|first=L. E.|last2=Bartel|first2=B.|date=November 2001|title=Auxin signaling: derepression through regulated proteolysis|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=1|issue=5|pages=595–604|issn=1534-5807|pmid=11709180|doi=10.1016/s1534-5807(01)00077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delker|first=Carolin|last2=Raschke|first2=Anja|last3=Quint|first3=Marcel|date=April 2008|title=Auxin dynamics: the dazzling complexity of a small molecule's message|journal=Planta|volume=227|issue=5|pages=929–941|doi=10.1007/s00425-008-0710-8|issn=0032-0935|pmid=18299888}}&lt;/ref&gt; This derepresses the auxin response factors so they may carry out their functions in the cell.

== Altered derepression causing diseases ==

=== [[Familial Alzheimer's Disease|Familial Alzheimer’s disease]] ===

[[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]] is a [[Neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] disease involving progressive memory loss and other declines in brain function. One common cause of familial Alzheimer’s is mutation in the ''[[PSEN1]]'' gene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This gene encodes a protein that cleaves certain intracellular peptides which, once free in the [[cytoplasm]], promote [[CREB-binding protein|CBP]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;degradation. Mutations in ''PSEN1'' decrease its production or ability to cleave proteins. This derepresses the CBP proteins, and allows them to perform their function of upregulating transcription of their target genes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabellini|first=Davide|last2=Green|first2=Michael R.|last3=Tupler|first3=Rossella|date=June 2004|title=When enough is enough: genetic diseases associated with transcriptional derepression|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume=14|issue=3|pages=301–307|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2004.04.010|issn=0959-437X|pmid=15172674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Rett syndrome|Rhett syndrome]] ===

Rhett syndrome is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] involving deterioration of learned language and motor skills, [[autism]], and seizures starting in infancy. Many cases of Rhett syndrome are associated with mutations in ''[[MECP2]]'', a gene encoding a transcriptional repressor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mutations in this gene decrease the levels of MeCP2 binding to different promoter sequences, resulting in their overall derepression. The increased expression of these MeCP2 regulated genes in [[neuron]]s contribute to the Rhett syndrome phenotype.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabellini|first=Davide|last2=Tupler|first2=Rossella|last3=Green|first3=Michael R.|date=June 2003|title=Transcriptional derepression as a cause of genetic diseases|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume=13|issue=3|pages=239–245|issn=0959-437X|pmid=12787785|doi=10.1016/s0959-437x(03)00050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome|Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]] ===

This syndrome is associated with an increased susceptibility of tumors and growth abnormalities in children. A common cause of this syndrome is a mutation in an [[Imprinting (genetics)|imprint control region]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;near the [[Insulin-like growth factor 2|''Igf2'' gene]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This imprint control region is normally bound by an [[Insulator (genetics)|insulator]] on the maternal [[allele]], which represses an [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] from acting on the ''Igf2'' gene. This insulator is absent on the paternal allele and allows it access to the gene. Mutations in this imprint control region inhibit the insulator from binding, which derepresses enhancer activity on the maternal Igf2 gene. This abnormal derepression and increase in gene expression can result in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{For|divergent evolution in animals|Divergent Evolution in Animals}}
[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Darwin's finches]] are a clear and famous example of divergent evolution, in which an ancestral species [[adaptive radiation|radiates]] into a number of descendant species with both similar and different traits.]]

'''Divergent evolution''' or '''divergent selection''' is the accumulation of differences between closely related species populations, leading to [[speciation]]. Divergent evolution is typically exhibited when two populations become separated by a geographic barrier (such as in [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] or [[peripatric speciation]]) and experience different [[natural selection|selective pressures]] that drive adaptions to their new environment. After many generations and continual evolution, the populations become [[reproductive isolation|unable to interbreed]] with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/speciationmodes_05 |title=Sympatric speciation |publisher= |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American naturalist [[J. T. Gulick]] (1832-1923) was the first to use the term "divergent evolution",&lt;ref name="Gulick"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite journal |last=Gulick |first=John T. |authorlink=J. T. Gulick |title= Divergent Evolution through Cumulative Segregation |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=September 1888 |volume= 20 |issue=120 |pages=189–274 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1888.tb01445.x |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNQUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:HARVARD32044106309446&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= 26 September 2011}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its use becoming widespread in modern evolutionary literature. Classic examples of divergence in nature are the [[adaptive radiation]] of the [[Darwin's finches|finches]] of the [[Galapagos]] or the coloration differences in populations of a species that live in different habitats such as with [[Rock pocket mouse|pocket mice]] and [[Eastern fence lizard|fence lizards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Evolution |edition=2nd |author=Carl T. Bergstrom and Lee Alan Dugatkin |date=2016 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=9780393937930 |pages=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be applied in [[molecular evolution]], such as to [[protein]]s that derive from [[homology (biology)|homologous]] genes. Both orthologous genes (resulting from a speciation event) and paralogous genes (resulting from [[gene duplication]]) can illustrate divergent evolution. Through gene duplication, it is possible for divergent evolution to occur between two genes within a species. Similarities between species that have diverged are due to their common origin, so such similarities are homologies. In contrast, [[convergent evolution]] arises when an [[adaptation]] has arisen independently, creating [[analogous structures]] such as the wings of birds and of insects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5757">'''Ecoimmunology''' is an interdisciplinary field combining aspects of [[immunology]] with [[ecology]], [[biology]], [[physiology]], and [[evolution]].  The field of ecoimmunology, while young, seeks to give an [[Proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate]] perspective for [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate]] mechanisms of immunology.

==Description==
Classical, or mainstream, [[immunology]] works hard to control variation (inbred/domestic model organisms, parasite-free environments, etc.) and asks questions about mechanisms and functionality of the immune system using a [[reductionism|reductionist]] method.  Comparative immunology investigates the major changes of the immune system among taxa.  While ecoimmunology originated from these fields, it is distinguished by its focus to describe and explain natural variation in immune functions,&lt;ref name="sheldon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(96)10039-2 |pmid=21237861 |last1=Sheldon |first1=BC |last2=Verhulst |first2=S |title=Ecological immunology: costly parasite defences and trade-offs in evolutionary ecology |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=317–21 |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more specifically, why and how biotic and abiotic factors contribute to variation in immunity in animals. Study of the [[trade-offs]] between immunity and other physiological mechanisms are a central study topic within the field, but have been expanded to include roles in species and individual variation, sex, social aspects, and mating system differences, and progress is also being made to develop methods to explore this variation.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01820.x |last1=Martin |first1=LB |last2=Hawley |first2=DM |last3=Ardia |first3=DR |title=An introduction to ecological immunology |journal=Functional Ecology |volume=25 |pages=1–4 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies involve ''[[in vivo]]'' laboratory experiments, but there have been recent calls for immunologists to study immune variation more in wild animals in particular.&lt;ref name="pedersen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04938.x |pmid=21324009 |last1=Pedersen |first1=ABP |last2=Babayan |first2=S |title=Wild Immunology |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=872–80 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple institutes engage in ecoimmunological research, such as the Center for Immunity, Infection and Evolution at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the Max Planck Institute for Immunoecology and Migration. The US [[National Science Foundation]] has funded a Research Coordination Network) to bring methodological and conceptual unity to the field of ecoimmunology.

==Seminal papers==
One of the field’s most seminal papers, by Folstad and Karter,&lt;ref name="folstad"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Folstad |first1=I |last2=Karter |first2=AJ |title=Parasites, bright males, and the immunocompetence handicap |journal=American Naturalist |volume=139 |issue=3 |pages=603–22 |year=1992 |jstor=2462500 |doi=10.1086/285346}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a response to Hamilton and Zuk’s famous paper on the [[handicap principle|handicap hypothesis]] for sexually selected traits.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.7123238 |last1=Hamilton |first1=WD |last2=Zuk |first2=M |title=Heritable true fitness and bright birds: A role for parasites? |journal=Science |volume=218 |issue=4570 |pages=384–87 |year=1982 |pmid=7123238|bibcode=1982Sci...218..384H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Folstad and Karter proposed the [[immunocompetence]] handicap hypothesis, whereby testosterone acts as a mediator of immunosuppression and thus keeps sexually-selected traits honest.&lt;ref name="folstad"/&gt; Although there is only moderate observational or experimental evidence supporting this claim up until now, the paper itself was one of the first links to be made suggesting a cost to immunity requiring trade-offs between it and other physiological processes. In 1996, a foundational paper for the field invoked trade-offs, the allocation of limited resources among competing, costly physiological functions, as a prime cause of variation in immunity.&lt;ref name="sheldon"/&gt;  Evidence for these putative trade-offs has often proven to be elusive

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26912">{{Progressivism}}
The '''Efficiency Movement''' was a major movement in the United States, Britain and other industrial nations in the early 20th century that sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement best practices.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The concept covered mechanical, economic, social, and personal improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Haber, ''Efficiency and Uplift: Scientific Management in the Progressive Era, 1890–1920'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for efficiency promised effective, dynamic management rewarded by growth.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer K. Alexander, ''The Mantra of Efficiency: From Waterwheel to Social Control'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the influence of an early proponent, it is more often known as [[Taylorism]].

==United States==
The Efficiency Movement played a central role in the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States, where it flourished 1890–1932.&lt;ref&gt;Haber (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents argued that all aspects of the economy, society and government were riddled with waste and inefficiency.  Everything would be better if experts identified the problems and fixed them.  The result was strong support for building research universities and schools of business and engineering, municipal research agencies, as well as reform of hospitals and medical schools, and the practice of farming.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Spillman, "The Efficiency Movement in Its Relation to Agriculture," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' Vol. 59, (May, 1915), pp. 65–76 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1012894 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known leaders were engineers [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856–1915), who used a stopwatch to identify the smallest inefficiencies, and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.]] (1868–1924) who proclaimed there was always "one best way" to fix a problem.

Leaders such as [[Herbert Croly]], [[Charles R. van Hise]] and [[Richard T. Ely|Richard Ely]] sought to improve governmental performance by training experts in public service comparable to those in Germany, notably at the Universities of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Schools of business administration set up management programs oriented toward efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Morris, "The Wisconsin Idea and Business Progressivism," ''Journal of American Studies,'' April 1970, Vol. 4#1 pp 39–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal and state efficiency===
Many cities set up "efficiency bureaus" to identify waste and apply the best practices.  For example, Chicago created an Efficiency Division (1910–16) within the city government's Civil Service Commission, and private citizens organized the Chicago Bureau of Public Efficiency (1910–32).  The former pioneered the study of "personal efficiency," measuring employees' performance through new scientific merit systems and efficiency movement &lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Lee, ''Bureaus of Efficiency: Reforming Local Government in the Progressive Era,'' (Marquette University Press, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-87462-081-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State governments were active as well. For example, Massachusetts set up its "Commission on Economy and Efficiency" in 1912.  It made hundreds of recommendations.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Commission on Economy and Efficiency, ''Annual report of the Commission on Economy and Efficiency'' (Boston, 1913), p 76 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWQNAAAAYAAJ  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Leading philanthropists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]]&lt;ref&gt;Abigail A. Van Slyck, ''Free to All: Carnegie Libraries &amp; American Culture, 1890–1920'' (1998) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John D. Rockefeller]] actively promoted the efficiency movement.  In his many philanthropic pursuits, Rockefeller believed in supporting efficiency.  He once said,
:"To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste ...it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17090 John D. Rockefeller, ''Random Reminiscences of Men and Events'' (1933)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
The [[Conservation in the United States|conservation movement]] regarding national resources came to prominence during the Progressive Era.  According to historian [[Samuel P. Hays]], the conservation movement was based on the "gospel of the efficiency.".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement 1890–1920'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Massachusetts Commission on Economy and Efficiency reflected the new concern with conservation. It said in 1912:
:"The only proper basis for the protection of game birds, wild fowl and, indeed, all animals is an economic one, and must be based upon carefully constructed and properly enforced laws for the conservation of all species for the benefit of future generations of our citizens, rather than based on local opinion....This expenditure for the protection of fish and game is clearly a wise economy, tending to prevent the annihilation of birds and other animals valuable to mankind which might otherwise become extinct.  It may be said that Massachusetts and her sister States have suffered irreparable loss by carelessly allowing, for generations past, indiscriminate waste of animal life."&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

[[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] was the nation's foremost conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda by emphasizing the need to eliminate wasteful uses of limited natural resources. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter,  [[Gifford Pinchot]].  Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nation's first [[conservation biology|conservation]] President.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|325px|left|1908 US editorial cartoon on Theodore Roosevelt and conservation]]

In 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty."

In contrast, environmentalist [[John Muir]] promulgated a very different view of conservation, rejecting the efficiency motivation. Muir instead preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. Working through the [[Sierra Club]] he founded, Muir tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Nash, ''Wilderness and the American Mind'' (3rd ed. 1982), pp 122–40&lt;/ref&gt;  While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, "to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees." &lt;ref&gt;Gifford Pinchot, ''Breaking New Ground,'' (1947) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National politics===
In U.S. national politics, the most prominent figure was [[Herbert Hoover]], a trained engineer who downplayed politics and believed dispassionate, nonpolitical experts could solve the nation's great problems, such as ending poverty.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Barber, ''From new era to New Deal: Herbert Hoover, the economists, and American economic policy, 1921–1933'' (1989) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on efficiency===
After 1929, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] blamed the [[Great Depression]] on Hoover and helped to somewhat discredit the movement, though the demand for efficiency and elimination of waste remains an important component of American values.

===Antitrust===
Boston lawyer [[Louis Brandeis]] (1856–1941) argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added a new political dimension to the Efficiency Movement. For instance, while fighting against legalized price fixing, Brandeis launched an effort to influence congressional policymaking with the help of his friend [[Norman Hapgood]], who was then the editor of [[Harper's Weekly]]. He coordinated the publication of a series of articles (''Competition Kills'', ''Efficiency and the One-Price Article'', and ''How Europe deals with the one-price goods''), which were also distributed by the lobbying group American Fair Trade League to legislators, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices, governors, and twenty national magazines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prophets of Regulation|last=McCraw|first=Thomas|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=0674716086|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his works, he was asked to speak before a congressional committee considering the price-fixing bill he drafted. Here, he stated that "big business is not more efficient than little business" and that "it is a mistake to suppose that the department stores can do business cheaper than the little dealer."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brandeis ideas on which business is most efficient conflicted with Croly's positions, which favored efficiency driven by a kind of consolidation gained through large-scale economic operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Herbert Croly of the New Republic: The Life and Thought of an American Progressive|last=Levy|first=David|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1985|isbn=0691047251|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=157-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1895 Brandeis had warned of the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin I. Urofsky, ''Louis D. Brandeis: a life'' (2009) pp 300–26&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Curse of Bigness'' he argued, "Efficiency means greater production with less effort and at less cost, through the elimination of unnecessary waste, human and material. How else can we hope to attain our social ideals?."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Brandeis, ''The curse of bigness: miscellaneous papers of Louis D. Brandeis'' edited by Osmond Kessler Fraenkel and Clarence Martin Lewis, (1965) p 51&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued against an appeal to Congress by the state-regulated railroad industry in 1910 seeking an increase in rates. Brandeis explained that instead of passing along increased costs to the consumer, the railroads should pursue efficiency by reducing their overhead and streamlining their operations, initiatives that were unprecedented during the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Efficient Society: Why Canada Is As Close To Utopia As It Gets|last=Heath|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin Canada|year=2002|isbn=0140292489|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Bedaux system===
The Bedaux system, developed by Franco-American [[management consultant]] [[Charles Bedaux]] (1886–1944) built on the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]] and [[Charles Edward Knoeppel|Charles E. Knoeppel]].&lt;ref name=Brech&gt;[[Edward Francis Leopold Brech]], ''Productivity in Perspective, 1914-1974'' (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn&gt;Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its distinctive advancement beyond these earlier thinkers was the [[Bedaux Unit]] or ''B'', a universal measure for all manual work.&lt;ref name=Littler&gt;Craig R. Littler, ''Development of the Labour Process in Capitalist Societies:  a Comparative Study of the Transformation of Work Organization in Britain, Japan and the USA'' (London: Heinemann, 1982) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_development_of_the_labour_process_in.html?id=2k2yAAAAIAAJ entry on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

The Bedaux System was influential in the [[United States]] in the 1920s and [[Europe]] in the 1930s and 1940s, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB&gt;Steven Kreis, 'Charles E. Bedaux' in ''[[American National Biography]]'' [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1000116 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link"&gt;Steven Kreis, 'The Diffusion of Scientific Management: the Bedaux Company in America and Britain, 1926-1945' in ''A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor'' (1992) {{cite web|url= https://ohiostatepress.org/books/Complete%20PDFs/Nelson%20Mental/08.pdf |title=Link }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1920s to the 1950s there were about one thousand companies in 21 countries worldwide that were run on the Bedaux System, including giants such as [[Swift's]], [[Eastman Kodak]], [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]], [[DuPont]], [[Fiat]], [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] and [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Tisdall, ''Agents of Change: The Development and Practice of Management Consultancy'' (London: Heinemann, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancies, Institutions and the Diffusion of Taylorism in Britain, Germany and France, 1920s to 1950s', ''Business History'' (1997) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076799700000146 PDF from Taylor &amp; Francis online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ferguson, ''The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna&gt;'Christopher D. McKenna, ''The World's Newest Profession: Management Consulting in the Twentieth Century'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2010). [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/american-history-after-1945/worlds-newest-profession-management-consulting-twentieth-century Cambridge University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to other movements===
Later movements had echoes of the Efficiency Movement and were more directly inspired by Taylor and [[Taylorism]].  [[Technocracy movement|Technocracy]], for instance, more of a fad than a movement, and others flourished in the 1930s and 1940s.

Postmodern opponents of nuclear energy in the 1970s broadened their attack to try to discredit movements that saw salvation for human society in technical expertise alone, or which held that scientists or engineers had any special expertise to offer in the political realm.

Coming into usage in 1990, the Western term [[Lean manufacturing]] (lean enterprise, lean production, or simply "Lean") refers to a business idea that considered the expenditure of resources for anything other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Today the Lean concept is broadening to include a greater range of strategic goals, not just cost-cutting and efficiency.

==Britain==
In engineering, the concept of efficiency was developed in Britain in the mid-18th century by [[John Smeaton]] (1724–1792). Called the "father of civil engineering", he studied water wheels and steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (2008) ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th century there was much talk about improving the efficiency of the administration and economic performance of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold White, ''Efficiency and empire'' (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ANUBAAAAMAAJ  online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Efficiency''' was an attempt to discredit the old-fashioned habits, customs and institutions that put the British at a handicap in competition with the world, especially with Germany,&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Dawson, ''The German Workman: a Study in National Efficiency'' (1906) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoxNAAAAMAAJ online]&lt;/ref&gt; which was seen as the epitome of efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''The Quest for National Efficiency, 1899–1914: A Study in Politics and Political Thought'' (Oxford UP, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, "National Efficiency" became a powerful demand&amp;nbsp;— a  movement supported by prominent figures across the political spectrum who disparaged sentimental humanitarianism and identified waste as a mistake that could no longer be tolerated.  The movement took place in two waves; the first wave from 1899 to 1905 was made urgent by the inefficiencies and failures in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).  ''Spectator'' magazine reported in 1902 there was "a universal outcry for efficiency in all departments of society, in all aspects of life".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Searle, "The Politics of National Efficiency and of War, 1900–1918" in Chris Wrigley, ed.,  ''A Companion to Early 20th-Century Britain'' (Blackwell, 2003) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most important themes were technocratic efficiency and managerial efficiency.  As White (1899) argued vigorously, the empire needed to be put on a business footing and administered to get better results.  The looming threat of Germany, which was widely seen as a much more efficient nation, added urgency after 1902.  Politically National Efficiency brought together modernizing Conservatives and Unionists, Liberals who wanted to bring modernize their party, and [[Fabian Society|Fabians]] such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], along with [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], who had outgrown socialism and saw the utopia of a scientifically up-to-date society supervised by experts such as themselves.  Churchill in 1908 formed an alliance with the Webbs, announcing the goal of a "National Minimum", covering hours, working conditions, and wages&amp;nbsp;– it was a safety net below which the individual would not be allowed to fall.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Kloppenberg, ''Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870–1920'' (1988) p 475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pelling, ''Winston Churchill'' (1989) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative legislation included the [[Education Act 1902|Education Act of 1902]], which emphasized the role of experts in the schools system.  Higher education was an important initiative, typified by the growth of the [[London School of Economics]], and the foundation of [[Imperial College]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a pause in the movement between 1904 and 1909, when interest resumed.  The most prominent new leaders included Liberals [[Winston Churchill]] and [[David Lloyd George]], whose influence brought a bundle of reform legislation that introduced the welfare state to Britain.

Much of the popular and elite support for National Efficiency grew out of concern for Britain's military position, especially with respect to Germany.  The Royal Navy underwent a dramatic modernization, most famously in the introduction of the ''[[Dreadnought]]'', which in 1906 revolutionized naval warfare overnight.

==Germany==
In Germany the efficiency movement was called "rationalization" and it was a powerful social and economic force before 1933. In part it looked explicitly at American models, especially [[Fordism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Nolan, "Housework Made Easy: the Taylorized Housewife in Weimar Germany's Rationalized Economy," ''Feminist Studies.'' Volume: 16. Issue: 3. pp 549+&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedaux system was widely adopted in the rubber and tire industry, despite strong resistance in the socialist labor movement to the Bedaux system. [[Continental AG]], the leading rubber company in Germany, adopted the system and profited heavily from it, thus surviving the Great Depression relatively undamaged and improving its competitive capabilities. However most German businessmen preferred the home-grown '''REFA system''' which focused on the standardization of working conditions, tools, and machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erker, "Das Bedaux-System: Neue Aspekte der Historischen Rationalisierungsforschung,["The Bedaux system: new aspects of research on the history of rationalization"], ''Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte,'' 1996, Vol. 41#2 pp 139–158&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rationalization" meant higher productivity and greater efficiency, promising science would bring prosperity. More generally it promised a new level of modernity and was applied to economic production and consumption as well as public administration. Various versions of rationalization were promoted by industrialists and Social Democrats, by engineers and architects, by educators and academics, by middle class feminists and social workers, by government officials and politicians of many parties. It was ridiculed by the extremists in the Communist movement. As ideology and practice, rationalization challenged and transformed not only machines, factories, and vast business enterprises but also the lives of middle-class and working-class Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
Ideas of Science Management was very popular in the Soviet Union. One of the leading theorists and practitioners of the Scientific Management in Soviet Russia was [[Alexei Gastev]]. The [[Central Institute of Labour]] (Tsentralnyi Institut Truda, or TsIT), founded by Gastev in 1921 with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s support, was a veritable citadel of socialist Taylorism.
Fascinated by Taylorism and Fordism, Gastev has led a popular movement for the “scientific organization of labor” (Nauchnaya Organizatsiya Truda, or NOT).
Because of its emphasis on the cognitive components of labor, some scholars consider Gastev’s NOT to represent a [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] variant of cybernetics. As with the concept of 'Organoprojection' (1919) by [[Pavel Florensky]], underlying [[Nikolai Bernstein]] and Gastev's approach, lay a powerful man-machine metaphor.

==Japan==
[[W. Edwards Deming]] (1900–1993) brought the efficiency movement to Japan after World War II, teaching top management how to improve design (and thus service), product quality, testing and sales (the last through global markets), especially using statistical methods.  Deming then brought his methods back to the U.S. in the form of quality control called [[continuous improvement process]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Gabor, ''The Man Who Discovered Quality: How W. Edwards Deming Brought the Quality Revolution to America'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Engineers Museum''' (officially ''The pioneer museum'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kymi.fi/en/attractions-and-shopping/service/198&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Finnish language|Finnish:]] valtakunnallinen, i.e., all-national, Pioneerimuseo, in [[Russian language|Russian:]] Музей саперных войск) is the oldest corps museum in Finland. It was opened 13 May 1945 in the garrison of [[Koria (Kouvola)|Koria]], which was the part of [[Elimäki|Elimäki municipality]], now [[Kouvola]] town. The Engineers Museum has the status of the scientific military museum and it is supervised by the [[Military Museum of Finland]] (in [[Finnish language|Finnish:]] Sotamuseo). The Engineers Museum was re-opened in [[Miehikkälä]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salpakeskus.fi/index.php?l=3&amp;path=214,0,0|title=Salpakeskus|work=salpakeskus.fi|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Engineers Museum will stay in [[Miehikkälä]] still in 2012. In 2013 it will be opened in [[Hämeenlinna]] near [[The Artillery Museum of Finland]]. Two other attractions related to the Engineer corps of Finland will stay at their present places: [[Salpa Line]] museum and the Bunker museum.

==History==

===Lieutenant's idea===
The history of the Engineer Museum starts in 1929, when a second lieutenant Eero-Eetu Saarinen made a proposal to the commander of the engineer battalion, concerning an engineer corps museum. The engineer troops started to collect materials for the museum. Most of the collectibles achieved by Saarinen got lost during the [[Winter War]].

===Opening after the wars===
On 12 May 1945 lieutenant colonel Eero-Eetu Saarinen delivered an opening speech of the museum. The museum worked in the barracks until 1965, when the municipality of [[Elimäki]] donated a log house the museum, so that the museum could become enlarged.

===Organised Engineers Corps Union===
Already in the beginning of the 1970s it became obvious that a new building would be needed. In the Koria garrison area, which was the main base of the Engineers corps, the new build main building was built opened by the lieutenant colonel Eero-Eetu Saarinen 25 July 1974 in [[Kivimäki]]{{dn|date=January 2017}}&lt;!--Nothing helpful on the Finnish DAB page. Google Translate of the corresponding passage in the Finnish article didn't help either--&gt; of [[Koria]]. The next year, in 1975, the Pioneeriaselajin Liitto ry, was established to govern the Engineers Museum.

===Englargening===
The other outer building was built and opened in 1976. The construction site manager and inspector was military technician Arvo Tolmunen.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Aimo Hattula, the Hakku (Pickaxe) magazine, number 3, 2007, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The corps museum was granted an officials status as an official war historical museum by the minister of defence, Veikko Pihlajamäki, 24 March 1987.

===Diaspora and fire===
As the Kymi Engineer Battalion was moved from Koria to Vekaranjärvi garrison of the [[Karelia Brigade]], the activities of the museum halted in Koria. The exhibits were packed and were delivered to separate locations. Most of the exhibits ended up to [[Kouvola]] and were burned also a kind of vandalism destroyed the materials.

===New start===
[[Kouvola]] municipality had planned to support the museum, but the idea did not survive, so that the registered Union of the Engineers Corps.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Until the beginning of the 2000s a new plan was made in cooperation with [[Miehikkälä]] municipality. In 2003 a project for opening the museum was started with the financial help of the European union structural funds. The general headquarters did not take the museum to the category of the further developed museums on 4 March 2004, but it was added to the list 18 May 2005.

==Exhibitions==
The museum will be open in June, July and August, from 10 o'clock to 18 o'clock.  The museum has a relatively small number of visitors due to the distant location.  In the same region there are two other museums related to the military engineering: Salpa-museo (The Salpa defence line museum) and Bunkkerimuseo (The bunker museum).

===Main building===

In the main exhibition there are about 500 exhibits. Specialities in the main building are models of the Kiviniemi, Vuoksi ja Syvärinniska field bridges. On the other half of the main building there is the '''Pitäjämuseo''', a local rural museum presenting the past agrarian life from the point of view of the household woodware.rf

====Kiviniemi bridge====

There has been at least six bridges over the [[Vuoksi]] river in [[Sakkola]].  The first known bridge was a wooden bridge in the 1800s, which was replaced by a stone bridge in 1827.  The Vuoksi river was enlargened and the flow eroded the soil structures of the stone bridge, so that it had to be break down.  Nordestam senate in 1870 authorised rebuilding, which was started in 1878, but the works ended during the first phases of the construction works.

According to the next plan the new bridge was to be built, in the new place, onto the narrowest part of the Kiviniemi falls area, 300 metres further from the place, where the bridge had been two times.  The new length of the bridge would be 74.8 metres. The construction works started in winter 1876 and the bridge was opened for the traffic in 1878. The budget of the construction works reached 139,000 [[Finnish mark]]s.

During the [[Winter War]] the Finns explored the bridge.  The Soviets built another bridge from steel after the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] of 1940 in the inter-war period. Before the advancing Finnish troops reached the bridge, the Soviet troops explored the bridge in the beginning of the [[Continuation War]] in 1941.  The Finns built a railway bridge from steel, which was destroyed in 1944.  Now there is a Soviet made bridge made of steel crossing Vuoksi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.lut.fi/eki/vuoksivirtaa/virtuaalimatka_vuoksella/jokihaasteena/kiviniemen_silta.html|title=Virtuaali Vuoksi - Virtuaalimatka vuoksella - Joki ihmisten haasteena - Kiviniemen silta|work=lut.fi|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StuG III Ausf G, Dezember 1942.jpg|thumb|265px|right|An anti-tank armoured assault vehicle Sturmgeschütz III Ausf. G]]

===Front- and backyard===

There is a [[Sturmgeschütz III|Sturmgeschütz III Ausf. G]] on the frontyard of the museum, On the backyard there are several aluminic assault boats, [[KrAZ]] lorry with and without a pontoon bridge equipment.  The heaviest vehicle is a [[T-72]] main battle tank with a [[Mine plow|mine plough]].

==Collections==
There are about 3 700 collectibles in the museum.

==Salpa Centre==
The Salpa Centre (Salpakeskus), which was established 7 July 2005, is a voluntary consortium of four participating communities: The Engineers Museum (governed by the Union of the Engineer Corps), The [[Salpa Line Museum|Salpa (Defence) Line Museum]] and the Salpa Line Tradition Association, the registered society, (Salpalinjan perinneyhdistys ry), both in [[Miehikkälä]], the [[Bunker Museum]] in [[Virolahti]].

The parties have been cooperation in developing the Bunker Museum, Engineers Museum and Salpa Line Museum with the support of the European union structural funds for less than a decade.

On the [[Salpa Line|Salpa defence line]] there will be organised annually a hiking tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salpakeskus.fi/index.php?l=1&amp;path=1,164,0|title=Salpakeskus|work=salpakeskus.fi|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th Salpa trekking was to take place in 2012 from 29 June to 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fi-fi.facebook.com/pages/Salpavaellus/105964786101271|title=Turvallisuustarkistus vaaditaan|work=facebook.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salpa defence line is in some parts relatively good condition as it was never needed due to the truce of 5 September 1944 and [[Moscow Armistice]], 19 September 1944, which ended the co-belligerence of Finland with the [[Greater German Realm]] and made the [[Lapland War]] inevitable.

A '''flux tube''' is a generally tube-like ([[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]]) region of space containing a [[magnetic field]], B, such that the field is perpendicular to the normal vector, &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Both the cross-sectional area of the tube and the field contained may vary along the length of the tube, but the [[magnetic flux]] is always constant.

As used in [[astrophysics]], a flux tube generally has a larger magnetic field and other properties that differ from the surrounding space. They are commonly found around [[star]]s, including the [[Sun]], which has many [[flux]] tubes of around 300&amp;nbsp;km diameter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=E. N.|date=1979|title=Sunspots and the Physics of Magnetic Flux Tubes.

A well-known example is the flux tube between [[Jupiter]] and its moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].

==History ==
{{Main|Line of force}}

In 1861, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] gave rise to the concept of a flux tube inspired by [[Michael Faraday]]'s work in electrical and magnetic behavior in his paper titled "[[On Physical Lines of Force]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=B|year=1990|title=Waves in Magnetic Flux Tubes|url=|journal=Basic Plasma Processes on the Sun: Proceedings of the 142th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union Held in Bangalore, India, December 1–5, 1989|volume=Edition 1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell described flux tubes as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If upon any surface which cuts the lines of fluid motion we draw a closed curve, and if from every point of this curve we draw lines of motion, these lines of motion will generate a tubular surface which we may call a ''tube of fluid motion."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=J. C.|date=1861|title=On Physical Lines of Force|url=|journal=Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science|volume=4|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Properties ==

=== Flux tube strength ===
The flux tube's strength, F, is defined to be the [[magnetic flux]] through a surface, S, with F constant throughout the flux tube as a result of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's Equation]]: &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot B = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Magnetohydrodynamics of the Sun|last=Priest|first=E.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2014|isbn=978-0-521-85471-9|location=|pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the condition that the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]], A, of the flux tube is small, F can be approximated as &lt;math&gt;F \approx BA &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If the area is decreased then the magnetic field must increase in order to satisfy the condition of constant F.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Priest|first=E. R.|last2=Forbes|first2=T. G.|year=2001|title=Magnetohydrodynamics|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/z/zita/research/thru02/articles/MHD%20priest.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;F = \int_{S} \vec{B(t)} \cdot dS &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Flux conservation ===
{{Main|Alfvén's theorem}}

From the condition of perfect conductivity in ideal [[Ohm's law|Ohm's Law]], (&lt;math&gt;\sigma \longrightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;), in ideal [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the change in [[magnetic flux]], &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;,  is zero in a flux tube, known as [[Alfvén's Theorem]] of flux conservation. With flux conservation, the [[topology]] of the flux tube does not change. This effect arises when there is a high [[Magnetic Reynolds number]], R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; 1, where [[Induction equation|induction]] dominates and [[diffusion]] is neglected, allowing for the magnetic field to follow the flow of the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] resulting in "frozen-in" [[flux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmic Magnetic Fields Their Origin and Their Activity|last=Parker|first=E. N.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1979|isbn=0-19-851290-2|location=Bristol, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_{m} = \frac{UL}{\eta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;where
* U is the velocity scale of the flow
* L is the length scale of the flow
* η is the [[viscosity]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Viscosity|&lt;math&gt;{\partial  \vec{B} \over\partial t} = \vec{\nabla}\times (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;The rate of change of the magnetic flux is given by:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\Phi(S, t) = \frac{d }{dt}\int_{S} \vec{B(t)} \cdot dS = \int_{S}\left ( \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} - \nabla \times (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \right ) \cdot dS = 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Compression and extension ===
In [[Magnetohydrodynamics|ideal magnetohydrodynamics]], if a cylindrical flux tube of length L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is compressed while the length of tube stays the same, the [[magnetic field]] and the density of the tube increase with the same proportionality. If a flux tube with a configuration of a [[magnetic field]] of B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] density of ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; confined to the tube is compressed by a scalar value defined as λ, the new [[magnetic field]] and density are given by:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{B_{0}}{\lambda^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{\rho_{0}}{\lambda^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If λ &lt; 1, known as traverse compression, B and ρ increase and are scaled the same while transverse expansion decreases B and ρ by the same value and proportion where B/ρ = constant value.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Extending the length of the flux tube by λ* gives a new length of L = λ*L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; while the density of the tube remains the same, ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which then results in the [[magnetic field]] strength increasing by B = λ*B&lt;sub&gt;0.&lt;/sub&gt; Reducing the length of the tubes results in a decrease of the [[Magnetic field|magnetic field's]] strength.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Plasma pressure ===
In magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, the following condition is met for the equation of motion of the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] confined to the flux tube:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;0 = - \nabla p + j \times B - \rho g&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;where
* p is the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] pressure
* j is the current density of the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]
* ρg is the [[Gravity|gravitational force]]
With the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium condition met, a cylindrical flux tube's [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] pressure of p(R) is given by the following relation written in [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] with R as the distance from the axis radially:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{dp}{dR} + \frac{d}{dR} \left ( \frac{B_{\phi}^{2} + B_{z}^{2}}{2\mu} \right ) + \frac{B_{\phi^{2}}}{\mu R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The second term in the above equation gives the [[magnetic pressure]] force while the third term represents the [[Magnetic tension force|magnetic tension]] force.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The field line's twist around the axis from one end of the tube of length L to the other end is given by:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Phi(R) = \frac{LB_{\phi}(R)}{RB_{z}(R)}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Solar ===
[[File:Cartoonloops.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartoonloops.png|thumb|Diagram of coronal loops that consist of plasma confined to magnetic flux tubes.]]
Examples of solar flux tubes include [[sunspot]]s and intense magnetic tubes in the [[photosphere]] and the field around the [[solar prominence]] and [[coronal loop]]s in the [[corona]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Sunspot]]s occur when small flux tubes combine into a large flux tube that breaks the surface of the [[photosphere]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The large flux tube of the sunspot has a field intensity of around 3 kG with a diameter of typically 4000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are extreme cases of when the large flux tubes have diameters of &lt;math&gt;6 \times 10^{4}&lt;/math&gt; km with a field strength of  3 kG.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Sunspot]]s can continue to grow as long as there is a constant supply of new [[flux]] from small flux tubes on the surface of the sun.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[magnetic field]] within the flux tube can be compressed by decreasing the gas pressure inside and therefore the internal temperature of the tube while maintaining a constant pressure outside.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Intense magnetic tubes are isolated flux tubes that have diameters of 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;km with an overall field strength of 1 to 2 kG and a flux of around &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^{9}&lt;/math&gt;Wb.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These flux tubes are concentrated strong [[magnetic field]]s that are found between solar [[Granule (solar physics)|granules]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=B.|date=2001|title=Solar Photospheric Magnetic Flux Tubes: Theory|url=http://www-solar.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bernie/fluxtubes.pdf|journal=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magnetic field]] causes the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] pressure in the flux tube to decrease, known as the plasma density depletion region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If there is a significant difference in the temperatures in the flux tube and the surroundings, there is a decrease in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] pressure as well as a decrease in the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] density causing some of the [[magnetic field]] to escape the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] that is trapped within magnetic flux tubes that are attached to the [[photosphere]], referred to as footpoints, create a loop-like structure known as a [[coronal loop]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reale|first=F.|date=2014|title=Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma|url=|journal=Living Reviews in Solar Physics|volume=11|pages=|doi=10.12942/lrsp-2014-4|bibcode=2014LRSP...11....4R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] inside the loop has a higher temperature than the surroundings causing the pressure and density of the plasma to increase.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These [[coronal loop]]s get their characteristic high [[luminosity]] and ranges of shapes from the behavior of the magnetic flux tube.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These flux tubes confine [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and are characterized as isolated. The confined magnetic field strength varies from 0.1 to 10 G with diameters ranging from 200 to 300&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=H., et. al.|date=2013|title=Structure of Solar Coronal Loops: from Miniature to Large-Scale|url=|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201321826|arxiv=1306.4685|bibcode=2013A&amp;A...556A.104P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of emerging twisted flux tubes from the interior of the [[sun]] cause twisted magnetic structures in the [[corona]], which then lead to [[solar prominence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Solar Prominences|last=Fan|first=Y.|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3-319-10416-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar prominence]]s are modeled using twisted magnetic flux tubes known as flux ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jibben|first=P.R. et. al.|date=2016|title=Evidence for a Magnetic Flux Rope in Observations of a Solar Prominence-Cavity System|url=|journal=Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences|volume=3|pages=|bibcode=2016FrASS...3...10J|doi=10.3389/fspas.2016.00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flux tubes that occur from [[magnetic reconnection]] forms into a [[dipole]]-like configuration around the planet where [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] flow occurs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An example of this case is the flux tube between [[Jupiter]] and its moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] approximately 450&amp;nbsp;km in diameter at the points closest to [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhardwaj|first=A.|last2=Gladstone|first2=G.

{{Sustainable energy}}
'''Green building''' (also known as '''green construction''' or '''sustainable building''') refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are [[environmentally responsible]] and [[resource-efficient]] throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenbuilding/pubs/about.htm|title=Green Building -US EPA|website=www.epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages.&lt;ref name="plainiotis"&gt;Yan Ji and Stellios Plainiotis (2006): Design for Sustainability. Beijing: China Architecture and Building Press. {{ISBN|7-112-08390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was Developed by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]]. Other certificates system that confirms the sustainability of buildings is the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments. Currently, [[World Green Building Council]] is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with [[World Bank]] to promote Green Buildings in [[Emerging Markets]] through EDGE ([[International Finance Corporation#Green buildings in developing countries|Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies]]) Market Transformation Program and certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgebuildings.com|title=EDGE Buildings - Build and Brand Green|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia.

Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by:
* Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources
* Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see [[healthy building]])
* Reducing waste, pollution and [[environmental degradation]]&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;

A similar concept is [[natural building]], which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of [[natural material]]s that are available locally.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, R. 2002.

Retrieved: 2007-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other related topics include [[sustainable design]] and [[green architecture]]. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen &amp; Iano, 2008[Allen, E, &amp; Iano, J. (2008). Fundamentals of building construction: materials and methods. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some green building programs don't address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through [[public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment]]. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.

A 2009 report by the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were overall more satisfied with the building than those in typical commercial buildings. These are eco-friendly buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalmarketspartnership.com/UserFiles/Admin%20GSA%20June%202008%20-%20Assessing%20Green%20Building%20Performance.pdf|title=GSA Public Buildings Service Assessing Green Building Performance|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722180030/http://www.capitalmarketspartnership.com/UserFiles/Admin%20GSA%20June%202008%20-%20Assessing%20Green%20Building%20Performance.pdf|archivedate=2013-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reducing environmental impact==
[[File:Hanging gardens of One Central Park, Sydney.jpg|thumb|Hanging gardens of [[Central Park, Sydney|One Central Park]], [[Sydney]]]]
Globally, buildings are responsible for a huge share of energy, electricity, water and materials consumption. The building sector has the greatest potential to deliver significant cuts in emissions at little or no cost. Buildings account for 18% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/presentations/poznan-COP-14/diane-urge-vorsatz.pdf |title=Presentation |website=www.ipcc.ch |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; of global emissions today, or the equivalent of 9 billion tonnes of CO2 annually. If new technologies in construction are not adopted during this time of rapid growth, emissions could double by 2050, according to the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Program]]. Green building practices aim to reduce the [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] of building. Since construction almost always degrades a building site, not building at all is preferable to green building, in terms of reducing environmental impact. The second rule is that every building should be as small as possible. The third rule is not to contribute to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]], even if the most energy-efficient, environmentally sound methods are used in design and construction.

Buildings account for a large amount of land. According to the National Resources Inventory, approximately {{convert|107|e6acre|km2}} of land in the United States are developed. The [[International Energy Agency]] released a publication that estimated that existing buildings are responsible for more than 40% of the world’s total primary energy consumption and for 24% of global carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref Howe,2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.libdb.njit.edu:8888/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=110&amp;sid=ec81964f-7b1a-4e08-b743-39ba9ecb187d%40sessionmgr113|title=Howe, J.C.

The concept of [[sustainable development]] can be traced to the energy (especially fossil oil) crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=Mao2009&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5303546 |chapter=A Comparison Study of Mainstream Sustainable/Green Building Rating Tools in the World |title=2009 International Conference on Management and Service Science |page=1 |year=2009 |last1=Mao |first1=Xiaoping |last2=Lu |first2=Huimin |last3=Li |first3=Qiming |isbn=978-1-4244-4638-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rachel Carson]] book, “[[Silent Spring]]”,&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Rachel. Silent Spring. N.p.: Houghton Mifflin, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1962, is considered to be one of the first initial efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building.&lt;ref name=Mao2009/&gt; The green building movement in the U.S. originated from the need and desire for more energy efficient and [[environmentally friendly]] construction practices. There are a number of motives for building green, including environmental, economic, and social benefits. However, modern sustainability initiatives call for an integrated and synergistic design to both new construction and in the [[retrofitting]] of existing structures. Also known as [[sustainable design]], this approach integrates the building life-cycle with each green practice employed with a design-purpose to create a synergy among the practices used.

Green building brings together a vast array of practices, techniques, and skills to reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health. It often emphasizes taking advantage of [[renewable resource]]s, e.g., using sunlight through [[passive solar]], [[active solar]], and [[photovoltaic]] equipment, and using plants and trees through [[green roof]]s, [[rain gardens]], and reduction of rainwater run-off. Many other techniques are used, such as using low-impact building materials or using packed gravel or permeable concrete instead of conventional concrete or asphalt to enhance replenishment of ground water.

While the practices or technologies employed in green building are constantly evolving and may differ from region to region, fundamental principles persist from which the method is derived: siting and structure design efficiency, energy efficiency, [[water efficiency]], materials efficiency, indoor environmental quality enhancement, operations and maintenance optimization and waste and toxics reduction.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (October 28, 2010). Green Building Home. Retrieved November 28, 2009, from http://www.epa.gov/greenbuilding/pubs/components.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WBDG Sustainable Committee. (August 18, 2009). Sustainable. Retrieved November 28, 2009, from http://www.wbdg.org/designsustainable.php{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of green building is an optimization of one or more of these principles. Also, with the proper synergistic design, individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect.

On the aesthetic side of [[green architecture]] or [[sustainable design]] is the philosophy of designing a building that is in harmony with the natural features and resources surrounding the site. There are several key steps in designing sustainable buildings: specify 'green' building materials from local sources, reduce loads, optimize systems, and generate on-site renewable energy.

===Life cycle assessment===
A [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA) can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concerns&lt;ref&gt;[[Life cycle assessment#cite note-1]]&lt;/ref&gt; by assessing a full range of impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process: from extraction of raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. Impacts taken into account include (among others) [[embodied energy]], [[global warming potential]], resource use, [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]], and waste.

In terms of green building, the last few years have seen a shift away from a ''prescriptive'' approach, which assumes that certain prescribed practices are better for the environment, toward the scientific evaluation of actual performance through LCA.

Although LCA is widely recognized as the best way to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings (ISO 14040 provides a recognized LCA methodology), it is not yet a consistent requirement of green building rating systems and codes, despite the fact that embodied energy and other life cycle impacts are critical to the design of environmentally responsible buildings.

In North America, LCA is rewarded to some extent in the Green Globes® rating system, and is part of the new American National Standard based on Green Globes, ''ANSI/GBI 01-2010: Green Building Protocol for Commercial Buildings''. LCA is also included as a pilot credit in the LEED system, though a decision has not been made as to whether it will be incorporated fully into the next major revision. The state of California also included LCA as a voluntary measure in its 2010 draft ''Green Building Standards Code''.

Although LCA is often perceived as overly complex and time consuming for regular use by design professionals, research organizations such as BRE in the UK and the Athena Sustainable Materials Institute in North America are working to make it more accessible.

In the UK, the BRE ''Green Guide to Specifications'' offers ratings for 1,500 building materials based on LCA.

In North America, the ATHENA® ''EcoCalculator for Assemblies'' provides LCA results for several hundred common building assembles based on data generated by its more complex parent software, the ATHENA® ''Impact Estimator for Buildings''. (The EcoCalculator is available free at www.athenasmi.org.) Athena software tools are especially useful early in the design process when material choices have far-reaching implications for overall environmental impact. They allow designers to experiment with different material mixes to achieve the most effective combination.

===Siting and structure design efficiency===
{{See also|Sustainable design}}

The foundation of any construction project is rooted in the concept and design stages. The concept stage, in fact, is one of the major steps in a project life cycle, as it has the largest impact on cost and performance.&lt;ref&gt;Hegazy, T. (2002). Life-cycle stages of projects. Computer-Based Construction Project Management, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In designing environmentally optimal buildings, the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project. [[File:Exterior Light Shelves - Green Office Building, Denver Colorado.jpg|thumb|Exterior Light Shelves - Green Office Building, Denver Colorado]]However, building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process, and varies from one building to the other, never repeating itself identically. In addition, buildings are much more complex products, composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage. A variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building's relevant life-cycle stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2004.09.004 |title=A methodology for design of environmentally optimal buildings by variable grouping |journal=Building and Environment |volume=40 |issue=8 |page=1126 |year=2005 |last1=Pushkar |first1=S |last2=Becker |first2=R |last3=Katz |first3=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy efficiency===

Green buildings often include measures to reduce energy consumption – both the embodied energy required to extract, process, transport and install building materials and operating energy to provide services such as heating and power for equipment.

As high-performance buildings use less operating energy, embodied energy has assumed much greater importance – and may make up as much as 30% of the overall life cycle energy consumption.  Studies such as the U.S. LCI Database Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/lci/|title=NREL: U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database Home Page|website=www.nrel.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick, concrete, or steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Green_Building/Module-3_Energy_Conservation.pdf|title=Naturally:wood Building Green with Wood Module 3 Energy Conservation|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722140227/http://www.naturallywood.com/sites/default/files/Module-3-Energy-Conservation.pdf|archivedate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce operating energy use, designers use details that reduce air leakage through the building envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, [[passive solar building design]], is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J.R. Energy and Buildings, Improved Estimates of tree-shade effects on residential energy use, February 2002.[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V2V-45CDGYM-1&amp;_user=1516330&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000053443&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1516330&amp;md5=53953efbeaec609a01bb19f0727c9451] Retrieved:2008-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement ([[daylighting]]) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. [[solar hot water|Solar water heating]] further reduces energy costs.

Onsite generation of [[renewable energy]] through [[solar power]], [[wind power]], [[hydro power]], or [[biomass]] can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the building. Power generation is generally the most expensive feature to add to a building.

===Water efficiency===
{{See also|Water conservation}}

Reducing water consumption and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building. One critical issue of water consumption is that in many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout the life of a building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper, reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site. [[Point of use water treatment]] and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation. The use of non-sewage and [[greywater]] for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"&gt;California Integrated Waste Management Board.

===Indoor environmental quality enhancement===
{{See also| Indoor air quality}}

The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) category in LEED standards, one of the five environmental categories, was created to provide comfort, well-being, and productivity of occupants. The LEED IEQ category addresses design and construction guidelines especially: indoor air quality (IAQ), thermal quality, and lighting quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Facilities Tool: Relevant Mandates and Rating Systems|url=https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/34/ieq/relevant-mandates-and-rating-systems|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2009.10.019 |title=Indoor environmental quality differences between office types in LEED-certified buildings in the US |journal=Building and Environment |volume=45 |issue=5 |page=1104 |year=2010 |last1=Lee |first1=Young S |last2=Guerin |first2=Denise A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=What's Your IQ on IAQ and IEQ?|url=http://blog.kmccontrols.com/index.php/2015/09/24/whats-your-iq-on-iaq-ieq/|accessdate=5 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516212043/http://blog.kmccontrols.com/index.php/2015/09/24/whats-your-iq-on-iaq-ieq/|archivedate=16 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indoor Air Quality]] seeks to reduce [[volatile organic compound]]s, or VOCs, and other air impurities such as microbial contaminants. Buildings rely on a properly designed ventilation system (passively/naturally or mechanically powered) to provide adequate ventilation of cleaner air from outdoors or recirculated, filtered air as well as isolated operations (kitchens, dry cleaners, etc.) from other occupancies. During the design and construction process choosing construction materials and interior finish products with zero or low VOC emissions will improve IAQ. Most building materials and cleaning/maintenance products emit gases, some of them toxic, such as many VOCs including formaldehyde. These gases can have a detrimental impact on occupants' health, comfort, and productivity. Avoiding these products will increase a building's IEQ.

Also important to indoor air quality is the control of moisture accumulation (dampness) leading to mold growth and the presence of bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological concerns. Water intrusion through a building's envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the building's interior can enhance and sustain microbial growth. A well-insulated and tightly sealed envelope will reduce moisture problems but adequate ventilation is also necessary to eliminate moisture from sources indoors including human metabolic processes, cooking, bathing, cleaning, and other activities.

Personal temperature and airflow control over the HVAC system coupled with a properly designed [[building envelope]] will also aid in increasing a building's thermal quality. Creating a high performance luminous environment through the careful integration of daylight and electrical light sources will improve on the lighting quality and energy performance of a structure.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WBDG Sustainable Committee.

Solid wood products, particularly flooring, are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates. Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recommends hardwood, vinyl, linoleum tile or slate flooring instead of carpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&amp;sub=18&amp;cont=231|title=Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America Home Remodelling|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422173721/http://aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&amp;sub=18&amp;cont=231|archivedate=2011-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Green_Building/Module-6_Health_and_Wellbeing.pdf|title=Naturally:wood Building Green with Wood Module 6 Health and Wellbeing|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402052948/http://www.naturallywood.com/sites/default/files/Module-6-Health-and-Wellbeing.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactions among all the indoor components and the occupants together form the processes that determine the indoor air quality. Extensive investigation of such processes is the subject of indoor air scientific research and is well documented in the journal Indoor Air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0905-6947|title=Indoor Air - Wiley Online Library|website=www.blackwellpublishing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations and maintenance optimization===
No matter how sustainable a building may have been in its design and construction, it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly. Ensuring operations and maintenance(O&amp;M) personnel are part of the project's planning and development process will help retain the green criteria designed at the onset of the project.&lt;ref&gt;WBDG Sustainable Committee.

The addition of new green technologies also falls on the O&amp;M staff. Although the goal of waste reduction may be applied during the design, construction and demolition phases of a building's life-cycle, it is in the O&amp;M phase that green practices such as recycling and air quality enhancement take place. O&amp;M staff should aim to establish best practices in energy efficiency, resource conservation, ecologically sensitive products and other sustainable practices. Education of building operators and occupants is key to effective implementation of sustainable strategies in O&amp;M services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/268/building-operations-maintenance-services|title=Building Operations and Maintenance Services - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste reduction===
Green architecture also seeks to reduce waste of energy, water and materials used during construction. For example, in California nearly 60% of the state's waste comes from commercial buildings&lt;ref&gt;Kats, Greg; Alevantis Leon; Berman Adam; Mills Evan; Perlman, Jeff. The Cost and Financial Benefits of Green Buildings, October 2003 [http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/News/News477.pdf] Retrieved:November 3rd, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During the construction phase, one goal should be to reduce the amount of material going to [[landfill]]s. Well-designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well, by providing on-site solutions such as [[composting|compost bins]] to reduce matter going to landfills.

To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill, Neutral Alliance (a coalition of government, NGOs and the forest industry) created the website dontwastewood.com. The site includes a variety of resources for regulators, municipalities, developers, contractors, owner/operators and individuals/homeowners looking for information on wood recycling.

When buildings reach the end of their useful life, they are typically demolished and hauled to landfills. Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered "waste" and reclaiming it into useful building material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jgpress.com/inbusiness/archives/_free/000648.html In Business magazine Green Builders Get Big Help from Deconstruction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121092246/http://www.jgpress.com/inbusiness/archives/_free/000648.html |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extending the useful life of a structure also reduces waste – building materials such as wood that are light and easy to work with make renovations easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Green_Building/Module-5_Durability_and_Adaptability.pdf|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517113844/http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Green_Building/Module-5_Durability_and_Adaptability.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-05-17|title=Naturally:wood Building Green with Wood Module 5 Durability and Adaptability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce the impact on [[water well|wells]] or [[sewage treatment|water treatment plants]], several options exist. "[[Greywater]]", wastewater from sources such as dishwashing or washing machines, can be used for subsurface irrigation, or if treated, for non-potable purposes, e.g., to flush toilets and wash cars. Rainwater collectors are used for similar purposes.

Centralized wastewater treatment systems can be costly and use a lot of energy. An alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer, which avoids these costs and shows other benefits. By collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized [[biogas]] plant with other biological waste, liquid fertilizer can be produced. This concept was demonstrated by a settlement in Lubeck Germany in the late 1990s. Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create [[carbon sink]]s that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offsetting [[greenhouse gas]] emission. Producing artificial [[fertilizer]] is also more costly in energy than this process.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Jorg; Grottker, Mathias; Otterpohl, Ralf.

===Reduce impact onto electricity network===
Electricity networks are built based on peak demand (another name is peak load). Peak demand is measured in the units of [[watt]]s (W). It shows how fast electrical energy is consumed. Residential electricity is often charged on electrical energy ([[kilowatt hour]], kWh). Green buildings or sustainable buildings are often capable of saving electrical energy but not necessarily reducing [[peak demand]].

When sustainable building features are designed, constructed and operated efficiently, peak demand can be reduced so that there is less desire for electricity network expansion and there is less impact onto carbon emission and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4225/50/58107ce163e0c |title=Community centre improvement to reduce air conditioning peak demand |first1=Lei |last1=Liu |first2=Gerard |last2=Ledwich |first3=Wendy |last3=Miller |date=November 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These sustainable features can be good orientation, sufficient indoor thermal mass, good insulation, photovoltaic panels, thermal or electrical energy storage systems, smart building (home) energy management systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2017.10.008 |title=Involving occupants in net-zero-energy solar housing retrofits: An Australian sub-tropical case study |journal=Solar Energy |volume=159 |page=390 |year=2018 |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Lei Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Gray |first4=Matthew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost and payoff==
The most criticized issue about constructing environmentally friendly buildings is the price. Photo-voltaics, new appliances, and modern technologies tend to cost more money. Most green buildings cost a premium of &lt;2%, but yield 10 times as much over the entire life of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Kats, Greg, Leon Alevantis, Adam Berman, Evan Mills, Jeff Perlman. The Cost and Financial Benefits of Green Buildings, November 3rd, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In regards to the financial benefits of green building, “Over 20 years, the financial payback typically exceeds the additional cost of greening by a factor of 4-6 times. And broader benefits, such as reductions in greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other pollutants have large positive impacts on surrounding communities and on the planet.”&lt;ref&gt;Kats, Gregory.

It is projected that different sectors could save $130 billion on energy bills.&lt;ref&gt;Fedrizzi, Rick,"Intro – What LEED Measures." United States Green Building Council, October 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, higher worker or student productivity can be factored into savings and cost deductions.

Numerous studies have shown the measurable benefit of green building initiatives on worker productivity. In general it has been found that, "there is a direct correlation between increased productivity and employees who love being in their work space.”&lt;ref&gt;Green building impacts worker productivity. (2012). CAD/CAM Update, 24(5), 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, worker productivity can be significantly impacted by certain aspects of green building design such as improved lighting, reduction of pollutants, advanced ventilation systems and the use of non-toxic building materials.&lt;ref&gt;Boué, George.

EPA studies indicate indoor levels of pollutants may be up to ten times higher than outdoor levels. LEED-certified buildings are designed to have healthier, cleaner indoor environmental quality, which means health benefits for occupants."&lt;ref&gt;United States Green Building Council.

==Regulation and operation==
As a result of the increased interest in green building concepts and practices, a number of organizations have developed standards, codes and rating systems that let government regulators, building professionals and consumers embrace green building with confidence. In some cases, codes are written so local governments can adopt them as bylaws to reduce the local environmental impact of buildings.

Green building rating systems such as BREEAM (United Kingdom), LEED (United States and Canada), DGNB (Germany), CASBEE (Japan), and VERDE&lt;sup&gt;GBCe&lt;/sup&gt; (Spain) help consumers determine a structure’s level of environmental performance. They award credits for optional building features that support green design in categories such as location and maintenance of building site, conservation of water, energy, and building materials, and occupant comfort and health. The number of credits generally determines the level of achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallywood.com/sites/default/files/Building-Green-and-Benefits-of-Wood.pdf|title=Naturally:wood Building Green and the Benefits of Wood|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529044646/http://www.naturallywood.com/sites/default/files/Building-Green-and-Benefits-of-Wood.pdf|archivedate=2012-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green building codes and standards, such as the International Code Council’s draft International Green Construction Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccsafe.org|title=ICC - International Code Council|website=www.iccsafe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sets of rules created by standards development organizations that establish minimum requirements for elements of green building such as materials or heating and cooling.

Some of the major building environmental assessment tools currently in use include:
*United States: [[International Green Construction Code|International Green Construction Code (IGCC)]]

==International frameworks and assessment tools==
'''IPCC Fourth Assessment Report'''

Climate Change 2007, the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]), is the fourth in a series of such reports. The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change, its potential effects and options for adaptation and mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/|title=IPCC - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|website=www.ipcc.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UNEP and Climate change'''

United Nations Environment Program [[UNEP]] works to facilitate the transition to low-carbon societies, support climate proofing efforts, improve understanding of climate change science, and raise public awareness about this global challenge.

'''GHG Indicator'''

The Greenhouse Gas Indicator: UNEP Guidelines for Calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Businesses and Non-Commercial Organizations

'''Agenda 21'''

[[Agenda 21]] is a programme run by the United Nations (UN) related to sustainable development. It is a comprehensive blueprint of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the UN, governments, and major groups in every area in which [[human impact on the environment|humans impact on the environment]]. The number 21 refers to the 21st century.

'''FIDIC's PSM'''

The International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) Project Sustainability Management Guidelines were created in order to assist project engineers and other stakeholders in setting sustainable development goals for their projects that are recognized and accepted by as being in the interests of society as a whole. The process is also intended to allow the alignment of project goals with local conditions and priorities and to assist those involved in managing projects to measure and verify their progress.

The Project Sustainability Management Guidelines are structured with Themes and Sub-Themes under the three main sustainability headings of Social, Environmental and Economic. For each individual Sub-Theme a core project indicator is defined along with guidance as to the relevance of that issue in the context of an individual
project.

The Sustainability Reporting Framework provides guidance for organizations to use as the basis for disclosure about their sustainability performance, and also provides stakeholders a universally applicable, comparable framework in which to understand disclosed information.

The Reporting Framework contains the core product of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, as well as Protocols and Sector Supplements.
The Guidelines are used as the basis for all reporting. They are the foundation upon which all other reporting guidance is based, and outline core content for reporting that is broadly relevant to all organizations regardless of size, sector, or location. The Guidelines contain principles and guidance as well as standard disclosures – including indicators – to outline a disclosure framework that organizations can voluntarily, flexibly, and incrementally, adopt.

Protocols underpin each indicator in the Guidelines and include definitions for key terms in the indicator, compilation methodologies, intended scope of the indicator, and other technical references.

Sector Supplements respond to the limits of a one-size-fits-all approach. Sector Supplements complement the use of the core Guidelines by capturing the unique set of sustainability issues faced by different sectors such as mining, automotive, banking, public agencies and others.

'''IPD Environment Code'''

The IPD Environment Code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msci.com/real-estate|title=Real estate - MSCI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in February 2008. The Code is intended as a good practice global standard for measuring the environmental performance of corporate buildings. Its aim is to accurately measure and manage the environmental impacts of corporate buildings and enable property executives to generate high quality, comparable performance information about their
buildings anywhere in the world. The Code covers a wide range of building types (from offices to airports) and aims to inform and support
the following;
* Creating an environmental strategy
* Inputting to real estate strategy
* Communicating a commitment to environmental improvement
* Creating performance targets
* Environmental improvement plans
* Performance assessment and measurement
* Life cycle assessments
* Acquisition and disposal of buildings
* Supplier management
* Information systems and data population
* Compliance with regulations
* Team and personal objectives

IPD estimate that it will take approximately three years to gather significant data to develop a robust set of baseline data that could be used across a typical corporate estate.

'''ISO 21931 '''

ISO/TS 21931:2006, Sustainability in building construction—Framework for methods of assessment for environmental performance of construction works—Part 1: Buildings, is intended to provide a general framework for improving the quality and comparability of methods for assessing the environmental performance of buildings. It identifies and describes issues to be taken into account when using methods for the assessment of environmental performance for new or existing building properties in the design, construction, operation, refurbishment and deconstruction stages. It is not an assessment system in itself but is intended be used in conjunction with, and following the principles set out in, the ISO 14000 series of standards.

'''''Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence'''''  is a college educational guide published in 2000. It focuses on [[college admissions in the United States]].  The authors define both the title of this book as well as their goals in writing it as: "to create greater awareness of the small, distinctive cluster of colleges and universities of excellence that are available to gifted college-bound students."&lt;ref name="greene's"/&gt; In the introduction, the authors further explain their aim by referring specifically to "the group historically known as the '[[Little Ivies]]' (including [[Amherst College|Amherst]], [[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]], [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]], [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]], [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]], and [[Williams College|Williams]])" which the authors say have "scaled the heights of prestige and selectivity and also turn away thousands of our best and brightest young men and women."&lt;ref name="greene's"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene |first1=Howard | first2= Matthew | last2= Greene| url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060953621/Greenes_Guides_to_Educational_Planning_The_Hidden_Ivies/excerpt.aspx |title=Excerpt from Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies Thirty Colleges of Excellence by Howard Greene | website=HarperCollins.com |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "green"&gt;Greene, Howard and Matthew Greene (2000) ''Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence'', HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0-06-095362-4}}, book description at [http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0060953624&amp;tc=cx HarperCollins.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321143927/http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0060953624&amp;tc=cx |date= 2005-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition includes the assessment of all the institutions considered "Little Ivies" except [[Connecticut College]], which is referenced on three occasions in the book for its affiliation and student exchange program with other Little Ivies; the college is included in Appendix II as another college of excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Greene |first1=Howard | first2= Matthew | last2= Greene |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2613mp_QbBgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |title=The Hidden Ivies: 50 Top Colleges-from Amherst to Williams| edition= 2nd |via= books.google.com |accessdate= 2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine of the 50 schools in the second edition are located in the [[Midwestern United States]], 24 in the [[Northeastern United States]], 11 in the [[Southern United States]], and six in the [[Western United States]].

==Overview==
''Hidden Ivies'' discusses the college admissions process and attempts to evaluate 63 colleges in comparison to Ivy League colleges. The schools are examined based on academics, admissions process, financial aid, and student experiences. The book argues the importance of a liberal arts education and goes on to inquire about the qualities of Ivy League schools in general, and how such qualities apply to higher education.

[[Image:The Stranger at the Door.jpg|thumb|"The Stranger at the Door" (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]
'''''Hávamál''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|h|ɑː|v|ə|m|ɑː|l}} {{respell|HAH|və-mahl}}; "sayings of the high one"; {{IPA-non|ˈhɒːwaˌmɒːl}}, {{IPA-is|ˈhauvaˌmaul̥}}) is presented as a single poem in the [[Codex Regius]], a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems from the Viking age. The poem, itself a combination of different poems, is largely [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]], presenting advice for living, proper conduct and wisdom.

The verses are attributed to [[Odin]]; the implicit attribution to Odin facilitated the accretion of various mythological material also dealing with the same deity.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows (1936), introductory note.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part composed in the [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] [[Alliterative verse#Ljóðaháttr|''Ljóðaháttr'']], a metre associated with wisdom verse, ''Hávamál'' is both practical and philosophical in content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=Df3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=havamal+reviewed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uUAdThDbNA&amp;sig=a-EUTIfEqnRFftft1qMgfXYfwqM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifxc-L0vzVAhXizIMKHYmrAewQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Church Review|last=Richardson|first=Nathaniel Smith|last2=Boggs|first2=Edward Brenton|last3=Baum|first3=Henry Mason|date=1872|publisher=Bassett and Bradley|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the gnomic  "''Hávamál'' proper" comes the ''Rúnatal'', an account of how Odin won the [[rune]]s, and the ''Ljóðatal'', a list of magic chants or [[galdr|spells]].&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON14&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 14. [[Oxford World's Classics]] {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==
The only surviving source for ''Hávamál'' is the 13th century [[Codex Regius]]. The part dealing with ethical conduct (the ''Gestaþáttr'') was traditionally identified as the oldest portion of the poem by scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century.
Bellows (1936) identifies as the core of the poem a "collection of proverbs and wise counsels" which dates to "a very early time", but which, by the nature of oral tradition, never had a fixed form or extent.
[[Von See]] (1981) identifies direct influence of the ''[[Disticha Catonis]]'' on the ''Gestaþáttr'', suggesting that also this part is a product of the high medieval period and casting doubt on the "unadulterated Germanic character" of the poem claimed by earlier commentators.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von See: „Disticha Catonis und Hávamál.“ In: Klaus von See: Edda, Saga, Skaldendichtung. Heidelberg 1981, 27-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] core of the poem, other fragments and poems dealing with wisdom and proverbs accreted over time. A discussion of authorship or date for the individual parts would be futile, since almost every line or stanza could have been added, altered or removed at will at any time before the poem was written down in the 13th century.
Individual verses or stanzas nevertheless certainly date to as early as the 10th, or even the 9th century. Thus, the  line ''deyr fé, deyja frændr'' ("cattle die, kinsmen die") found in verses 76 and 77 of the ''Gestaþáttr'' can be shown to date to the 10th century, as it also occurs in the ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' by [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]].

==Structure==
The ''Hávamál'' is edited in 165 stanzas by Bellows (1936). Other editions give 164 stanzas, combining Bellow's stanzas 11 and 12, as the manuscript abbreviates the last two lines of stanzas 11. Some editors also combine Bellow's stanzas 163 and 164. In the following, Bellow's numeration is used.

The poems in ''Hávamál'' is traditionally taken to consist of at least five independent parts,
#the ''Gestaþáttr'', or ''Hávamál'' proper,  (stanzas 1–80), a collection of proverbs and [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] wisdom
#a dissertation on the faithlessness of women (stanzas 81–95), prefacing an account of the love-story of Odin and the [[daughter of Billingr]] (stanzas 96-102) and the story of how Odin got the [[mead of poetry]] from the maiden [[Gunnlöð]]  (stanzas 103–110)
#the ''Loddfáfnismál'' (stanzas 111–138), a collection of gnomic verses similar to the ''Gestaþáttr'', addressed to a certain Loddfáfnir
#the  ''Rúnatal'' (stanzas 139–146), an account of how Odin won the runes, introductory to the  ''Ljóðatal''
#the '' Ljóðatal'' (stanzas 147–165), a collection of charms

Stanzas 6 and 27 are expanded beyond the standard four lines by an additional two lines of "commentary". Bellow's edition inverses the manuscript order of stanzas 39 and 40. Bellow's stanza 138 (''Ljóðalok'') is taken from the very end of the poem in the manuscript, placed before
the ''Rúnatal'' by most editors following Müllenhoff. Stanzas 65, 73–74, 79, 111, 133–134, 163 are defective.

Stanzas  81-84 are in ''[[málaháttr]]'', 85–88 in ''[[fornyrðislag]]''. The entire section of 81–102 appears to be an ad hoc interpolation. Stanza 145 is also an interpolation in  ''málaháttr''.

==Contents==

===''Gestaþáttr''===
The first section '''''Gestaþáttr''''', the "guest's section". Stanzas 1 through 79 comprise a set of maxims for how to handle oneself when a guest and traveling, focusing particularly on [[manners]] and other behavioral relationships between hosts and guests and the sacred [[Folklore|lore]] of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] and [[hospitality]] to the [[Norse paganism|Norse pagans]].

The first stanza exemplifies the practical behavioral advice it offers:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
All the entrances, before you walk forward,
you should look at,
you should spy out;
for you can't know for certain where enemies are sitting,
ahead in the hall''&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON14/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Number 76 is possibly the most known section of ''Gestaþáttr'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Deyr fé,

deyr sjálfur ið sama; 
en orðstír 
deyr aldregi
hveim er sér góðan getur." }}

===On women===
[[File:Billingr's girl, bitch, and Odin by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Billingr's girl watches on while Odin encounters the bitch tied to her bedpost (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
Stanzas 83 to 110 deal with the general topic of [[romantic love]] and the character of [[women]].

It is introduced by a discussion of the faithlessness of women and advice for the seducing of them in stanzas 84–95, followed by two mythological accounts of Odin's interaction with women also known as "Odin's Examples" or "Odin's Love Quests". The first is an account of Odin's thwarted attempt of possessing the daughter of [[Billingr|Billing]]  (stanzas 96–102), followed by the story of the [[mead of poetry]] which Odin won by seducing its guardian, the maiden [[Gunnlöð]] (stanzas 103–110).

===''Loddfáfnismál''===
The '''''Loddfáfnismál'''''  (stanzas 111–138) is again gnomic, dealing with morals, ethics, correct action and codes of conduct. The section is directed to [[Loddfáfnir]] ("stray-singer").

===''Rúnatal''===
[[Image:Odin's Self-sacrifice by Collingwood.jpg|thumb|"Odin's Self-sacrifice" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]]
[[File:Jelling gr Stein 3.JPG|thumb|The younger [[Jelling stone]] (erected by [[Harald Bluetooth]] ca. 970) shows the [[crucifixion of Christ]] with the victim suspended in the branches of a tree instead of on a cross.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Patton 2009:271.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Rúnatal''''' or '''''Óðins Rune Song''''', ''Rúnatáls-þáttr-Óðins'' (stanzas 139-146) is a section of the ''Hávamál'' where Odin reveals the origins of the [[runes]].
In stanzas 139 and 140, Odin describes his  sacrifice of himself to himself:
{{Verse translation|lang=non|
Veit ec at ec hecc vindga meiði a
netr allar nío,
geiri vndaþr oc gefinn Oðin,
sialfr sialfom mer,
a þeim meiþi, er mangi veit, hvers hann af rótom renn.

Við hleifi mic seldo ne viþ hornigi,
nysta ec niþr,
nam ec vp rvnar,
opandi nam,
fell ec aptr þaðan.
|
I know that I hung on a windy tree
[[Numbers in Norse mythology|nine]] long nights,
wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,
myself to myself,
on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.

No bread did they give me nor a [[Drinking horn|drink from a horn]],
downwards I peered;
I took up the runes,
screaming I took them,
then I fell back from there.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON34&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 34. [[Oxford World's Classics]] {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "windy tree" from which the victim hangs is often identified with the world tree [[Yggdrasil]] by commentators. The entire scene, the sacrifice of a god to himself, the execution method by hanging the victim on a tree, and the wound inflicted on the victim by a spear, is often compared to the [[crucifixion of Christ]] as narrated in the [[gospel]]s.
The parallelism of Odin and Christ during the period of open co-existence of Christianity and Norse paganism in Scandinavia (the 9th to 12th centuries, corresponding with the assumed horizon of the poem's composition) is also evident from other sources. To what extent this parallelism is an incidental similarity of the mode of [[human sacrifice]] offered to Odin and the crucifixion, and to what extent a Pagan influence on Christianity, or vice versa, may have occurred, is a complex question on which scholarly opinions vary.&lt;ref&gt;a sketch of the problem is given by  Kimberley Christine Patton, ''Religion of the gods: ritual, paradox, and reflexivity'' Oxford University,  {{ISBN|978-0-19-509106-9}}, chapter 7 "Myself to Myself: The Norse Odin and Divine Autosacrifice".&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ljóðatal''===
The last section, the '''''Ljóðatal''''' enumerates eighteen songs (''ljóð''), sometimes called "charms", prefaced with
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Ljóð ek þau kann
er kann-at þjóðans kona
ok mannskis mǫgr}}
|attr1=stanza 147|
The songs I know
that king's wives know not
Nor men that are sons of men.}}

The songs themselves are not given, just their application or effect described.
They are explicitly counted from "the first" in stanza 147, and "a second" to "an eighteenth" in stanzas 148 to 165, given in Roman numerals in the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows separates the "seventeenth" item into stanzas 163 and 164. There is a gap in stanza 163, and some editors have also combined 163 and 164 into a single stanza.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no explicit mention of runes or [[runic magic]] in the ''Ljóðatal'' excepting in
the twelfth song (stanza 158), which takes up the motif of Odin hanging on the tree and its association with runes,
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|svá ek ríst
ok í rúnum fá'k}}
|
So do I write
and color the runes}}

Nevertheless, because of the ''Rúnatal'' preceding the list, modern commentators sometimes reinterpret the ''Ljóðatal'' as referring to runes, specifically with the sixteen letters of the [[Younger Futhark]].

Müllenhoff takes the original ''Ljóðatal'' to have ended with stanza 161, with the final three songs (16th to 18th) taken as late and obscure additions.

==Germanic Neopaganism==
The difference of sixteen runes of the [[Younger Futhark]] vs. eighteen charms in the ''Ljóðatal'' has notably motivated proponents of [[Ariosophy|Germanic mysticism]] to expand the row by two extra runes. The best-known attempt to this effect are the [[Armanen runes]] by [[Guido von List]] (1902).

Various proponents of [[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagan]] groups place an emphasis on ''Hávamál'' as a source of a Norse pagan ethical code of conduct. The  "[[Nine Noble Virtues]]", first compiled by [[Odinic Rite]] founder John "Stubba" Yeowell in the 1970s are "loosely based" on the Hávamál.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
The [[Northvegr Foundation]] cites the Hávamál among other Old Norse and Old English sources to illustrate "the ethical ideal of the Northern spiritual faith of Heithni."&lt;ref&gt;Alfta Lothursdottir, ''Trulog and Sogumal'', Northvegr (2006); [http://www.northvegr.org/northern/book/trulog.php Trúlög: Northern Truisms] (northvegr.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]], leader of the Icelandic ''[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]'', published his performance of a number of Eddaic poems, including the Hávamál,  chanted in [[rímur]] style.&lt;ref&gt;"Edda", Current 93 (1991); [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY7dtuYH7B0 youtube.com link]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1937">The '''Institute of Wood Science''' was a British organisation that researched wood.

==History==
It was established in 1955. It is a research institute for the [[British timber trade|wood industry in the UK]].

The Institute of Wood Science is now known as the Wood Technology Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom3.org/wood-technology-society/about-wood-technology-society Wood Technology Society]&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining]].

==Structure==
It was situated in [[Hughenden Valley]] in Hughenden, north of [[High Wycombe]] west of the A4128, home of the British furniture industry. The site is also the headquarters of the [[Timber Research and Development Association]], or TRADA. The site is also known as Trada Technology. It is not a government organisation.

TRADA is owned by [[Exova]] BM TRADA.

==Function==
It researches wood products. Its journal is the [[International Wood Products Journal]].

===UK timber industry===
It is the UK's examining body for the UK timber trade. It organises training at its site and at [[The Horse Trust]] nearby.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33974">[[File:Cerebral lobes.png|150px|thumb|The [[human brain]] with its [[brain lobes|lobes]] highlighted.]]
An '''isolated brain''' is a [[brain]] kept alive [[in vitro]], either by [[perfusion]] or by a [[Blood substitutes|blood substitute]], often an oxygenated solution of various salts, or by submerging the brain in oxygenated artificial [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).&lt;ref&gt;von Bohlen and Halbach O. The isolated mammalian brain: an in vivo preparation suitable for pathway tracing. Eur J Neurosci. 1999 Mar;11(3):1096-100. {{PMID|10103102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the biological counterpart of [[brain in a vat]]. A related concept, attaching the brain or head to the [[circulatory system]] of another organism, is called a [[head transplant]]. An isolated brain however is more typically attached to an artificial perfusion device rather than a biological body.

The brains of many different organisms have been kept alive in-vitro for hours, or in some cases days. The central nervous system of [[invertebrate]] animals is often easily maintained as they need less oxygen and to a larger extent get their oxygen from CSF; for this reason their brains are more easily maintained without perfusion.&lt;ref&gt;Luksch H, Walkowiak W, Muñoz A, ten Donkelaar HJ. The use of in vitro preparations of the isolated amphibian central nervous system in neuroanatomy and electrophysiology. J Neurosci Methods. 1996 Dec;70(1):91–102. {{PMID|8982986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mammalian brain]]s on the other hand have a much lesser degree of survival without perfusion and an artificial blood perfusate is usually used.

For methodological reasons, most research on isolated mammalian brains has been done with guinea pigs. These animals have a significantly larger basilar artery (a major artery of the brain) compared to rats and mice, which makes cannulation (to supply CSF) much easier.

== In philosophy ==
In [[philosophy]], the [[brain in a vat]] is any of a variety of [[thought experiment]]s intended to draw out certain features of our ideas about [[knowledge]], [[reality]], [[truth]], [[mind]], and [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]]. A contemporary version of the argument originally given by [[René Descartes|Descartes]] in ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (i.e., that he could not trust his perceptions on the grounds that an [[evil demon]] might, conceivably, be controlling his every experience), the ''brain in a vat'' is the idea that a brain can be fooled into anything when fed appropriate stimuli.

The inherently philosophical idea has also become a staple of many [[science fiction]] stories, with many such stories involving a [[mad scientist]] who might remove a person's [[brain]] from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its [[neurons]] by wires to a supercomputer which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives. According to such science fiction stories, the computer would then be simulating a [[virtual reality]] (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the person with the "disembodied" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences without these being related to objects or events in the real world.

No such procedure in humans has ever been reported by a research paper in a scholarly journal, or other reliable source. Also, the ability to send external electric signals to the brain of a sort that the brain can interpret, and the ability to communicate thoughts or perceptions to any external entity by wire, is, except for very basic commands, well beyond current (2017) technology.

== Grown ==
Isolated biological "brains", grown from cultured neurons which were originally separated, have been developed.  These are not the same thing as the brains of organisms, but they have been used to control some simple robotic systems.

In 2004 Thomas DeMarse and Karl Dockendorf made an "adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays".&lt;ref&gt;[http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf Thomas DeMarse, Karl Dockendorf, ''Adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041022104658.htm Brain in a dish acts as autopilot, living computer], Science Daily. 22 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Reading have created neurological entities integrated with a robot body. The brain receives input from sensors on the robot body and the resultant output from the brain provides the robot's only motor signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78317-6_3|authors=D.

{{More citations needed|date=July 2016}}
The concept of a brain in a jar (or [[brain in a vat]]) is a common theme in science fiction:

=== Literature ===

*In [[Alexander Beliaev]]'s novel ''Head of Prof. Dowell'' (1925), Professor Dowell discovers a way of keeping heads of dead people alive and even to give them new bodies. After his death Dowell himself becomes a subject of such an experiment.
*The [[Mi-go]] aliens in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], first appearing in the story "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" (1931), can transport humans from Earth to [[Pluto]] (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's brain and placing it into a "brain cylinder", which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.
*In [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s ''[[Captain Future]]'' novels series (1940), the character Prof. Simon Wright is a human brain living in a transparent case.
*In ''[[Donovan's Brain]]'' (see term), the 1942 science fiction novel by [[Curt Siodmak]] (filmed three times in different versions: 1944, 1953 and 1962), the brain of a ruthless millionaire is kept alive in a tank where it grows to monstrous proportions and powers.
*The final novel in [[C.S. Lewis]]'s "[[Space Trilogy]]", ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945), uses the isolated brain of Francois Alcasan, an Algerian radiologist guillotined for murder, as a plot device. At some point in the novel, it is revealed that Alcasan's artificially-perfused head is used to allow evil intelligence to communicate with humans directly.
*In [[Roald Dahl]]'s short story "[[William and Mary (short story)|William and Mary]]" (1960), after William's death his brain is kept alive on an artificial heart.&lt;ref name=vice1/&gt;
*In [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'' (1963), the character [[A Wrinkle in Time#IT|IT]] is a disembodied telepathic brain that dominates the planet of Camazotz.
*The [[Humans as Gods#Ruinators|Ruinators]], later known as the Demiurges, are the immensely cyborgized alien society in ''[[Humans as Gods]]'', the 1966–1977 sci-fi trilogy by [[Sergey Snegov]]. They use the isolated brains of the highly intelligent species [[Humans as Gods#Galaxians|Galaxians]] as the organic supercomputers in charge of the [[Humans as Gods#Metrics Stations|Metrics Stations]], the primary and most secret military defense structure of the Ruinators' Empire. The brains are being extracted from the prisoners' babies and grown artificially in the spheres filled with the nutrient liquid. Among the most important characters of the second and third novels comes the [[Humans as Gods#Vagrant|Brain of the Third Planet]], later known as Vagrant or Voice, who has somehow developed self-consciousness and later rebelled against the Ruinators. Due to the Vagrant's fervent desire for a life of those embodied, the Brain has been surgically put into a dragon's body, whose inherent brain was destroyed in a recent battle. Vagrant enjoyed a sentient dragon's life for a few decades after that, until the body grew too senile, and on the threshold of the dragon's death the brain was removed again to assume control over a starship.&lt;ref name=vice1/&gt;
*In the 1971 novel ''[[Gray Matters (novel)|Gray Matters]]'' by [[William Hjortsberg]], the protagonist and his acquaintances are all disembodied brains, preserved underground after a nuclear war.
*In the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' prequel trilogy to the novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', [[cymek]]s are disembodied brains that wear robotic bodies.

===Film and television===
[[File:Brainthatwouldntdie film poster.jpg|thumb|A monstrous brain in a jar, in a poster for ''[[The Brain That Wouldn't Die]]'']]

*Isolated brains also appeared in ''[[Star Trek]]''.  In the episode "[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]", the Providers are disembodied brains that kidnap individuals in order to force them to fight against each other.  Later, in the episode "[[Spock's Brain]]", [[Spock|Mr. Spock's]] brain is removed by a native of the Sigma Draconis system in order to serve as the Eymorg Controller. Due to Vulcan physiology, Spock's body remains alive. The crew of the ''Enterprise'' follow an ion trail to Sigma Draconis VI where, using the knowledge of the Eymorg, Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] is able to restore Spock's brain to his body.
*Isolated brains also appear in ''[[The Wild Wild West]]''.  In the episode "[[The Night of the Druid's Blood]]", one of [[James West's]] old tutors is killed and West discovers that it is Dr Tristam who has removed the brains from the bodies and is forcing them to work for him.  Finally West manages to communicate to the isolated brains that if they all work together they can destroy Dr Tristam and have peace.
*In the 1970s ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'', Solon, an authority on micro-surgical techniques, transplants Morbius's brain into an artificial translucent brain cylinder casing.  Additionally, in the modern ''Doctor Who'' series (2005–present), the recurring antagonists known as the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] are presented as human brains (in [[The Pandorica Opens|one instance]], an entire human head) encased in mechanical exoskeletons, connected by an artificial nervous system; this is ostensibly done as an "upgrade" from the comparatively fragile human body to a far more durable and longer-lasting shell. Another group of modern ''Doctor Who'' foes, the [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Toclafane|Toclafane]], were revealed to be human heads encased in flying, weaponized spheres, the final forms of humans from the far future who turned to desperate measures in order to survive the conditions of the impending [[heat death of the universe]].
*In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes "[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]" and "[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]", [[Cassandra (Doctor Who)|Lady Cassandra]] is an isolated brain attached to a canvas of skin with a face.
*The mad scientist in the French film ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' has a "brain in a vat" for a companion.
*In ''[[RoboCop 2]]'', the brain, eyes, and much of the nervous system of the Detroit drug lord Cain is harvested by OCP officials to use in their plans for an upgraded "RoboCop 2" [[cyborg]]. These systems are stored in a vat shortly after the surgery, where the disembodied Cain can still see the remains of his former body being discarded before being placed into the fitted robotic skeleton.
*[[Observer (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Observer]] from ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' carries his brain in a [[Petri dish]].
*In the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', numerous technological advances have been made by the 31st century. The ability to keep heads alive in jars was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]") and also apparently [[Dick Clark]] of [[Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve]] fame still doing the countdown in the year 2999, has resulted in many political figures and celebrities being active; this became the writers' excuse to feature and poke fun at celebrities in the show. In "[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]" the Big Brain, an isolated brain and leader of the Brainspawn, is outwitted by Fry. The brain's disciples have been attempting to dumb down every lifeform they meet to enable them to steal all the universe's data and hoard it in the infosphere.&lt;ref name=vice1/&gt;
* In the animated series ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'', the main character Hector Con Carne was reduced to a brain and a stomach in two jars. Both of them are able to move and talk, even without jars. Hector's brain sometimes controls the bear Boskov while Hector's stomach digests parts of Boskov's food.
*The [[science fantasy]] [[television series]] ''[[LEXX]]'' includes a robot head containing human brain tissue. Also whenever the current Divine Shadow body dies his brain is removed and placed in a device that allows him to speak and kept with rest of the Divine Predecessors.
*In the movie ''[[Blood Diner]]'', two cannibal brothers bring their uncle's (isolated) brain back to life to help them in their quest to restore life to the five-million-year-old goddess Shitaar. Their uncle's brain instructs them to collect the required parts to resurrecting Shitaar – virgins, assorted body parts, and the ingredients for a "blood buffet".
*In the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy film]] ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'', the [[protagonist]], a pioneering [[neurosurgeon]], falls in love with a disembodied brain that was able to communicate with him [[Telepathy|telepathically]].
*''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' episode "[[The Brain of Colonel Barham]]" details the story of a dying [[astronaut]], Colonel Barham. It is decided to separate his brain from his body and keep it alive, with neural implants connecting it to visual and audio input/output for the mission. But without a body, the brain becomes extremely powerful and megalomaniacal.
* The 2011 web series ''[[The Mercury Men]]'' features a brain in a jar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weprin|first1=Alex|title=Syfy Picks Up Original Web Series 'The Mercury Men'|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/syfy-picks-up-original-web-series-the-mercury-men/12549|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("The Battery") that can communicate telepathically and over a walkie-talkie-like devices and is revealed to control the "mercury men" for a catastrophic plan to destroy Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mercury Men Are Here|url=http://www.needcoffee.com/2011/09/12/mercury-men/|website=needcoffee.com|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Randy|title=The Mercury Men|url=http://www.fanfilmfollies.com/featured/the-mercury-men|website=fanfilmfollies.com|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comics ===
* ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #62 (Dec. 1940) had the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] battle a human brain in a vat that had developed enormous powers and become mobile and sprouted an arm.
* [[The Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]] Annual #1 (1987) had the inhabitants of Trudeau, [[South Dakota]], reduced to disembodied brains by the [[Word-Bringer]].

===Anime and manga===
* Many people in the ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' manga and anime franchise possess [[cyberbrain]]s, which can sustain a modified human brain within a cybernetic body indefinitely.

===Video games===
* In the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'']] series of games, isolated brains are used to control robots called "Robobrains".&lt;ref name=vice1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top 5 Fictional Characters That Are Literally Just Brains|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-top-5-fictional-characters-that-are-literally-just-brains|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Old World Blues'' downloadable content for the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' a group of scientists, dubbed the "Think Tank", have a more advanced version of the technology.
* The video game ''[[Cortex Command]]'' revolves around the idea of brains being separated from physical bodies, and used to control units on a battlefield.
* The Mother Brain from the game ''[[Metroid]]''.&lt;ref name=vice1/&gt;

===Other===
*A [[brainship]] is a fictional concept of an interstellar starship. A brainship is made by inserting the disembodied brain and nervous system or malformed body of a human being into a life-support system, and connecting it surgically to a series of computers via delicate synaptic connections (a [[brain–computer interface]]). The brain "feels" the ship (or any other connected peripherals) as part of its own body. An example, ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' (1969) short story collection by science fiction author [[Anne McCaffrey]] is about the brainship ''Helva''. "[[Mr. Spaceship]]" (1959)  is an earlier story by Phillip K. Dick about a brainship. 
*The B'omarr Monks, of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' Universe, would surgically remove their brains from their bodies and continue their existence as a brain in a jar. They believe that cutting themselves off from civilization and all corporeal distractions leads to enlightenment. These monks are easily identified in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' as the spider-like creature that walks past [[C-3PO]] as he enters [[Jabba’s Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE 7 CREEPIEST, FREAKIEST DENIZENS OF JABBA’S PALACE|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-7-creepiest-freakiest-denizens-of-jabbas-palace|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the [[ice cream]] varieties around the world.

==Argentina==
[[File:Helado.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice cream cone in [[Salta]], Argentina]]
While industrial ice cream exists in Argentina and can be found in supermarkets, restaurants or kiosks, and ice cream pops are sold on some streets and at the beaches, the most traditional Argentine ''helado'' (ice cream) is very similar to Italian [[gelato]], rather than US-style ice cream, and it has become one of the most popular desserts in the country. Among the most famous manufacturers are "Freddo," "Persicco," "Chungo", "Cremolatti" and "Munchi's," all of them located in [[Buenos Aires]]. Each city has its own ''heladerías'' (ice cream parlours) which offer different varieties of creamy and water-based ice creams, including both standard and regional flavours. There are hundreds of flavors but Argentina's most traditional and popular one is [[dulce de leche]], which has become popular abroad, especially in the US.

There are two kinds of ''heladerías'' in Argentina: the cheaper ones which sell ice cream with artificial ingredients (like ''Helarte'', ''Pirulo'', ''Sei Tu'' and the largest one, ''[[Grido Heladería|Grido]]''), and the ones that sell ''helado artesanal'',&lt;ref name = "helado artesanal"&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |url=http://www.heladoartesanal.com/ | title=Helado Artesanal (in Spanish) |publisher=INNOVAR |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; made with natural ingredients and usually distinguished by a logo featuring an ice cream cone and the letters HA. There are no regulations in Argentina regarding the amount of milk an ice cream can have. In fact, all ice cream parlors serve both cream-based and water-based ice cream (''helado a la crema'' and ''helado al agua'' respectively). Instead, the distinctions are made according to the quality of the ingredients.

A standard Argentine cone or cup contains two different flavours of ice cream. In addition to these, most ''heladerías'' offer ice-cream-based desserts like ''Bombón Suizo'' (Swiss Bonbon: chocolate-covered chantilly ice cream filled with dulce de leche and sprinkled with nuts), ''Bombón Escocés'' (Scottish Bonbon: same as the Swiss Bonbon, only with chocolate ice-cream and [[white chocolate]] topping), ''Cassata'' (strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream) and ''Almendrado'' (almond ice cream sprinkled with almond [[praline]]).

==Australia and New Zealand==
[[File:IcecreamVanBatemansBayNSWAustralia.jpg|thumb|left|An ice cream van at [[Batemans Bay, New South Wales]], Australia]]
Per capita, [[Australia]]ns and [[New Zealand]]ers are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the [[United States]] where people eat 23 litres each per year.&lt;ref name="Ibisworld"&gt;{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/31/0c02a331.asp |title=Business Outlook: ice cream manufacturing (based on a report to be found through www.ibisworld.com.au) |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=2006-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427031709/http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/31/0c02a331.asp |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brands include [[Tip Top (icecream)|Tip Top]], [[Streets (ice cream)|Streets]], [[Peters Ice Cream|Peters]], [[Sara Lee (corporation)|Sara Lee]], [[New Zealand Natural]], [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]], [[Baskin-Robbins]] and [[Bulla Dairy Foods]]. A popular ice cream flavour in New Zealand, Australia and Japan that originated in New Zealand is [[hokey pokey (ice cream)|hokey pokey]].

==China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan==
Besides the popular flavour such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers also introduced other traditional flavours such as black sesame, red beans.

In recent years, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan dessert houses also serve ice-cream [[moon cake]] during the [[Mid-Autumn festival]] (moon festival).

[[Fried ice cream]] is served at street food stalls in Beijing.

==Cuba==
[[File:Coppelia2.jpeg|thumb|Interior of the landmark Coppelia ice cream parlor, Havana, Cuba]]

In [[Cuba]], ice cream is sold at the state-run [[Coppelia (ice cream parlor)|Coppelia]] chain of ice cream parlors. Coppelia was founded in 1966 by [[Fidel Castro]], his aim to introduce his love of dairy products to the Cuban masses and to prove that a communist enterprise could provide better ice cream and flavor selection than American brands. In the capital [[Havana]], the Coppelia parlor is an architectural icon and a major landmark and meeting place in the city.  In 2012, the Cuban newspaper ''[[Trabajadores]]'' exposed the short supply, poor service, and melted ice cream served at the landmark.&lt;ref name=kcet&gt;[http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/a-california-architect-visits-cuba.html "A California Architect Visits Cuba", Patrick McGrew, ''KCET-TV'' (PBS Los Angeles), August 8, 201]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trab1&gt;[http://www.trabajadores.cu/news/20120401/258669-con-bolas-huecas-no-hay-jonron Sundred Suzarte Medina, "Con bolas huecas no hay jonrón", Trabajadores, April 1, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
The first ice cream manufacturer in Finland was the Italian Magi family, who opened the ''Helsingin jäätelötehdas'' in 1922 and ''Suomen Eskimo Oy''. Other manufacturers soon spawned, like ''Pietarsaaren jäätelötehdas'' (1928–2002).

Finland's first ice cream bar opened at the [[Lasipalatsi]] in 1936, and at the same time another manufacturer, ''Maanviljelijäin Maitokeskus'' started their production.

Today, the two largest ice cream manufacturers are [[Ingman]] and [[Nestlé]] (who bought [[Valio]]jäätelö). Finland is also the leading consumer of ice cream in Europe, with 13.7 litres per person in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmmtike.fi/fi/index/tiedotteet/tiedotteet2004/040629_ravintotase03.html Tike web page on consumer habits]&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream café in [[Paris]] and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 cafés opened in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Visser|first=Margaret|title=Much Depends on Dinner|publisher=Grove Atlantic Press|year=1999|edition=illustrated|page=297|isbn=978-0-8021-3651-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iijF4QSwPssC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA297,M1|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procope.com/|title=Restaurant Le Procope|publisher=procope.com|language=Italian|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people eat heart or log shaped cakes made of ice cream on [[New Year's Eve]] or [[New Year's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in France|publisher=timanddate.com|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==

[[File:Spaghettieis fcm.jpg|thumb|[[Spaghettieis]], a German ice cream dish made to look like a plate of Spaghetti.]]

One of the first well known Italian ice cream parlors (''Eisdiele'') was founded in Munich in 1879 and run by the Sarcletti family. This traditional family business was handed from generation to generation ever since. Since the 1920s, when many Italians immigrated and set up business, the traditional ice cream parlors became very popular. A popular German ice cream dish is [[Spaghettieis]], created by Dario Fontanella in the 1960s and made to look like a plate of spaghetti. 

About 80% percent of the ice cream sold in Germany is produced industrially, with the leading manufacturer being [[Unilever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Cream in Germany|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/ice-cream-in-germany/report|publisher=EuroMonitor.com|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 17% is produced commercially and the remaining 3% is produced for the [[soft serve]] sector. In 2013, Germany had the largest market for ice cream in Europe at $2.7 billion revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice cream nation: German market most valuable in Europe|url=http://www.dw.com/en/ice-cream-nation-german-market-most-valuable-in-europe/a-17827040|publisher=DW.com|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghana==
In 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fanmilk-gh.net/internet/index.php?CatId=87 :: Fan Milk Limited :: - The Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024025713/http://www.fanmilk-gh.net/internet/index.php?CatId=87 |date=2008-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ghanaian treat FanIce was created by the Fan Milk Limited Company. FanIce comes in [[garden strawberry|strawberry]], [[chocolate]], and [[vanilla]]. FanMilk also makes additional products, though FanIce is the closest to Western ice cream. Pouches of FanIce and other FanMilk products can be bought from men on bikes equipped with chill boxes in any moderately sized town, and in cities large enough for grocery stores. FanMilk can also be bought in tubs for eating at home. In 2006, FanMilk was voted best ice-cream in the world.{{who|date=December 2010}}

==Greece==

[[File:20140412 lefkada356.JPG|thumb|An ice cream shop in Lefkada]]

Ice cream in its modern form, or pagotó ({{lang-el|παγωτό}}), was introduced in Greece along its development in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century. Earlier than that, ice treats have been enjoyed in the country since ancient times. During the 5th century BC, ancient [[Greeks]] ate snow mixed with honey and fruit in the markets of Athens. The father of modern medicine, [[Hippocrates]], encouraged his Ancient Greek patients to eat ice ''"as it livens the lifejuices and increases the well-being."''&lt;ref name="Norway"&gt;
{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.norway.org/food/recipes/sorbet_and_ice_cream.htm |title=Norway - the official site in the United States |work=What's Cooking: (N)ice and cold |publisher=The Government of Norway et al. |accessdate=2006-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century BC, it was well known that a favorite treat of [[Alexander the Great]] was snow ice mixed with honey and [[nectar]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |year=2006 |url=http://www.readwritethink.org/calendar/calendar_day.asp?id=510 |title=ReadWriteThink |work=Commercial ice cream is first sold in the U.S. in 1786 |publisher=The International Reading Association (IRA), the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), and the Verizon Foundation |accessdate=2006-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern Day Greek ice cream has been heavily influenced by Turkish Ice cream [[Dondurma]] thus the name used to be called Dudurmas but, because of [[Greco-Turkish relations]] most Turkish related foods are coined a more Greek idiom. Greek ice cream recipes have some unique flavours such as '''Pagoto Kaimaki''' ({{lang-el|Παγωτό Καϊμάκι}}), made from [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]]-[[resin]] which gives it an almost chewy texture, and '''Salepi''', used as a thickening agent to increase resistance to melting, both giving a unique taste to the ice cream; '''Pagoto Elaeolado me syko''' ({{lang-el|Ελαιόλαδο με σύκο}}), made of olive oil and [[ficus|figs]]; '''Pagoto Kataifi cocoa''' ({{lang-el|Παγωτό Καταΐφι κακάο}}), made from the shredded filo dough pastry that resembles angel's hair pasta, similar to [[vermicelli]] but much thinner; and '''Pagoto Mavrodaphne''' ({{lang-el|Μαυροδάφνη Παγωτό}}), made from a Greek [[dessert wine]]. Fruity [[Spoon sweets|Greek Sweets of the Spoon]] are usually served as toppings with Greek-inspired ice cream flavors.

==India==
India is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically. India also has a domestic ice cream product known as "[[Kulfi]]" or "Matka Kulfi", which is famous in small towns and villages. Major brands are AMUL, Kwality, Vadilal, Mother Dairy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://dare.co.in/opportunities/other-business-opportunities/ice-cream-industry-in-india.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euromonitor.com/ice-cream-in-india/report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolorsofindia.com/interesting-facts/business/india-largest-selling-icecream.html&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, many domestic ice cream companies have opened their exclusive outlets in metros and several international ice-cream companies also started their operation in India.

==Indonesia==
In [[Indonesia]] there is a type traditional ice cream called "Es Puter" or "stirred ice cream". It's made from some ingredients: [[coconut milk]], pandanus leaves and [[sugar]], with flavouring: [[avocado]], [[jackfruit]], [[durian]], [[palm sugar]], [[chocolate]], [[Adzuki bean|red bean]], [[mung bean]] or our favourite flavor.

==Iran==
{{main|Bastani Sonnati}}
[[Faloodeh|Fālūde]] (Persian: فالوده) or Pālūde (Persian: پالوده) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles frozen with corn starch, rose water, lime juice, and often ground pistachios. It is a traditional dessert in Iran and Afghanistan. It was brought to the Indian subcontinent during the Mughal period. The faloodeh of Shiraz is famous.

Faloodeh is one of the earliest forms of frozen desserts, having existed as early as 400 BC. Ice was brought down from high mountains and stored in tall refrigerated buildings called yakhchals, which were kept cool by windcatchers.

There is also a drink called faloodeh, but it is made using other ingredients.

==Italy==
{{Main|Italian ice cream|Neapolitan ice cream}}
[[File:Ponte-Vecchio-ice-cream-0851.jpg|right|thumb|A gelato stall on [[Ponte Vecchio]], [[Florence]]]]

Italian ice cream or [[Gelato]] as it is known, is a traditional and a popular dessert in [[Italy]]. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in "produzione propria" gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7-8% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%. Before the cone became popular for serving ice cream, in English speaking countries, Italian street vendors would serve the ice cream in a small glass dish referred to as a "[[penny lick]]" or wrapped in [[Wax paper|waxed paper]] and known as a [[hokey pokey (ice cream)|hokey-pokey]] (possibly a corruption of the [[Italian language|Italian]] "ecco un poco" - "here is a little").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hokey Pokey and All That: The history of ice cream |author=Edmund Forte |url=http://www.edmundforte.co.uk/141633.html}} — Forte presents this and several alternative hypotheses.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most known artisanal gelato machine makers are Italian companies [[Carpigiani]], Crm-Telme, Corema-Telme, Technogel, Cattabriga and high capacity industrial plants made by Catta 27 and Cogil and Teknoice.

==Japan==
[[File:Mochi Ice Cream.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mochi ice cream]] sold in Japan]]
Ice cream is also a popular dessert in Japan, with almost two in five adults eating some at least once a week, according to a 2007 survey.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Since 1999, the Japanese Ice Cream Association has been publishing the Ice Cream [[White paper|White Paper]] once a year, and the four most popular ice cream flavours in Japan have not changed (including their order) since 1999, according to the paper.&lt;ref name="JICA"&gt;[http://www.icecream.or.jp/data/hakusho05.html ''Vanilla holds an unshakable top position in favorite ice cream flavours.''], Japanese Ice Cream Association, Ice Cream White Paper 2006. Tokyo, Japan. Retrieved on 2006-10-21 (Japanese).&lt;/ref&gt; The top four flavours are [[vanilla]], [[chocolate]], ''[[matcha]]'' (powdered [[green tea]]), and [[garden strawberry|strawberry]]. Other notable popular flavours are [[milk]], [[caramel (aroma)|caramel]], and [[azuki]] (red bean) also according to the paper.&lt;ref name="JICA"/&gt; ''Azuki'' is particularly favored by people in their 50s and older.&lt;ref name="JICA"/&gt;

==Laos==
A typical variety is [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|Laotian vanilla]] ice cream made from pandan ("Laotian vanilla").

==Norway==
It is known that the Italian [[Giovanni Zazzera]] made and sold "iscrem" in Stavanger from 1910. He had been living in Oslo for five years before that, and could therefore have sold ice cream in Norway as early as 1905.

==Pakistan==
Pakistan has an ice cream brand [[OMORÉ]], the products of which are exported to Europe and America. Beside this other large ice cream brands from Pakistan include [[Eat More Ice Cream]] and [[Yummy (ice cream)|Yummy]]. These companies receive most of their profit from within the country. Pakistani Peshawari ice cream is very famous in [[South Asia]] and [[Middle East]].

The most popular flavours in Pakistan are Pista, Kulfa, Vanilla and Chocolate.

==Philippines==
{{Main|Sorbetes}}
[[File:Sorbetes.jpg|thumb|A woman purchasing strawberry sorbetes from a street vendor in the Philippines]]

[[Sorbetes]] is a Philippine version for common ice cream usually peddled from carts that roam streets in the Philippines. This should not be confused with the known sorbet. It is also commonly called 'dirty ice cream' because it is sold along the streets exposing it to [[pollution]] and that the factory where it comes from is usually unknown; though it is not really "dirty" as the name implies. It is usually served with small wafer or sugar cones and recently, bread buns.

==Spain==
Ice cream, in the style of Italian gelato, can be found in many cafes or specialty ice cream stores throhoughout Spain. Usually the flavours reflect local tastes like nata, [[crema catalana]], or [[tiramisu]].

There are also industrial producers like [[Unilever|Frigo]] (owned by [[Unilever]]), [[Camy]] (later merged into Nestlé), [[Avidesa]], [[Menorquina]], many of them are part of transnational groups. The industrial producers also serve [[ice cream sandwich]]es and ''polos'', ice cream on a stick, such as [[Magnum (ice cream)|Magnum]], sometimes with whimsical shapes like the foot-shaped ''Frigopié''.

Unlike in Northern Europe, ice cream is consumed mostly in summer. Hence, some ice cream stores become hot-chocolate cafés in winter.

==Syria==
{{main|Booza}}
[[File:Bakdash ice-cream shop in the old souk in Damascus.jpg|thumb|200px|Booza being sold in the [[Bakdash (ice cream parlor)|Bakdash]] ice cream shop in the [[Al-Hamidiyah Souq]] in Old city of Damascus]]

Booza ({{lang|ar|الآيس كريم واللبن}} in [[Arabic]]: "milk ice cream", also called "Arabic ice cream") is a [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]]-based [[ice cream]].  It is elastic, sticky, and resistant to melting in the hotter climates of the [[Arab world]], where it is most commonly found.

The ice cream is usually and traditionally made with an ingredient called ''sahlab'' ({{lang|ar|سَحْلَب}})  or ''[[salep]]'', which provides it with the ability to resist melting. ''Salep'' is also a primary ingredient in the Turkish version of this style of ice cream called ''[[dondurma]]''.

==Turkey==
{{main|Dondurma}}
[[File:İstiklal Caddesi 102.JPG|thumb|A man purchasing dondurma from a street vendor in Turkey]]

Dondurma (in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Maraş dondurması'', meaning "the ice cream of the city of [[Kahramanmaraş|Maraş]]", also called ''Dövme dondurma'', meaning "battered ice cream") is a Turkish [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]] [[ice cream]].  It is similar to the [[Syria]]n dessert [[booza]].

Dondurma typically includes the ingredients [[cream]], [[whipped cream]], ''[[salep]]'', [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], and [[sugar]]. It is believed to originate from the city and region of [[Kahramanmaraş|Maraş]] and hence also known as Maraş ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;Naver Kowledgeins, "Turkey Ice-cream". Naver. 2004, February 8th. 24 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth £1.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-food.com/store/product.aspx?id=81857|title=Ice Cream - UK - September 2009|date=September 2009|work=just-food.com|publisher=Aroq Ltd|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product may be sold as "ice cream" if it contains 5 per cent fat and not less than 2.5 per cent milk protein, but may contain non-milk [[vegetable fats and oils]], usually [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] [[palm kernel]] oil, a rule that is more permissive than many other countries. Only true ice cream made only with milk fats (though not necessarily cream) can be described as ''dairy ice cream'', and many companies make sure that ''dairy'' is prominently displayed on their packaging and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/schedule/8/made Schedule 8, the (UK) Food Labelling Regulations 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as "Philadelphia style"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/PEACH-ICE-CREAM-PHILADELPHIA-STYLE-101911 |title=Peach Ice Cream, Philadelphia Style |accessdate=2008-09-24 |publisher=CondéNet, Inc., reprinted from William Morrow and Co.'s ''The Ultimate Ice Cream Book'' |author=Weinstein, Bruce |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ice cream. Ice creams made with eggs, usually in the form of [[frozen custard]]s, are sometimes called "French" ice creams or traditional ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Irma S. |last=Rombauer |author2=Marion R.

American federal labeling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% [[Butterfat|milk fat]] (about 7&amp;nbsp;grams (g) of fat per 1/2 cup [120 mL] serving), 20% total milk solids by weight, to weigh no less than 4.5 pounds per gallon (in order to put a limit on replacing ingredients with air), and to contain less than 1.4% egg yolk solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdairy.com/OtherDairyProductInfo/IceCream/Default.aspx |title=Ice Cream |accessdate=2008-08-09 |publisher=Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board |author=National Dairy Council |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827205633/http://wisdairy.com/OtherDairyProductInfo/IceCream/Default.aspx |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Frozen Desserts 21 CFR 135.110(a)(2)|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/aprqtr/21cfr135.110.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal government regulations pertaining to the process of making ice cream, allowable ingredients, and standards, may be found in Part 135 of Title 21 of the ''Code of Federal Regulations''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate2.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=76465419768+1+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve 21 CFR Part 135]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;21 CFR § 135.110(a)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans consume about 23 liters of ice cream per person per year&amp;nbsp;— the most in the world. As a foodstuff it is deeply ingrained into the American psyche and has been available in America since its founding in 1776: there are records of Thomas Jefferson serving it as a then-expensive treat to guests at his home in Monticello. In American supermarkets it is not uncommon for ice cream and related products to take up a wall full of freezers.  All different kinds of ice cream fill the walls with strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, among other flavors.

Although chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry are the traditional favorite flavors of ice cream, and once enjoyed roughly equal popularity, [[vanilla]] has grown to be the most popular, most likely because of its use as a topping for fruit based [[pie]]s and its use as the key ingredient for [[milkshakes]]. According to the International Ice Cream Association (1994), supermarket sales of ice cream break down as follows: vanilla, 28%; fruit flavours, 15%; nut flavours, 13.5%; candy mix-in flavours, 12.5%; chocolate, 8%; cake and cookie flavours, 7.5%; Neapolitan, 7%; and coffee/mocha, 3%. Other flavours combine to make 5.5%. Sales in ice cream parlors are more variable, as new flavours come and go, but about three times as many people call vanilla their favorite compared to chocolate, the runner-up.

'''The London School of Philosophy''' is an independent [[adult education]] college located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It offers part-time non-degree courses on a wide range of topics within [[philosophy]]. It was founded in 2010 by lecturers from Birkbeck College. It is based within [[Conway Hall]], in [[Bloomsbury]].

==History==

In 2009, the long-established School of Continuing Education at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], which specialised in [[extra-mural studies]], was abolished and its activities integrated into the main college. The following year, as part of this re-organisation, the number of part-time philosophy courses for adults was sharply reduced. Seven of Birkbeck's philosophy lecturers responded to the cancellation of their courses by meeting to establish a new college, the London School of Philosophy (LSP).&lt;ref name="LSP1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://londonschoolofphilosophy.org/ |title=Philosophy For the Capital |work=LSP website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="ER1"&gt;{{cite |title=The London School of Philosophy at Conway Hall|work=Ethical Record (Vol.116 No.9, October 2011) |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSP's seven founders organised themselves on a cooperative basis and agreed a constitution in 2010. The first lectures took place in January 2011. A launch event was held on 6 September 2011.&lt;ref name="LSP2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://londonschoolofphilosophy.org/?page_id=477 |title=Launch Event |work=LSP website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
In 2011 the London School of Philosophy announced a collaborative agreement with [[Conway Hall]] to base all its teaching activities there.&lt;ref name="PN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue86/News_September_October_2011 |title=London’s first adult education college devoted entirely to philosophy |work=Philosophy Now (September/October 2011) |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conway Hall is a large [[art-deco]] building on Red Lion Square in [[Bloomsbury]], built in 1929. It is the venue for a wide range of concerts, lectures and other cultural events.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conwayhall.org.uk |title=Conway Hall |work=Conway Hall website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building also houses the Humanist Library,&lt;ref name="HL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conwayhall.org.uk/our-library |title=Library |work=Conway Hall website |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a sizeable philosophy section.

==Courses==
Courses at the college cover topics such as ‘Philosophy and Theatre’, ‘Philosophy of Love’; ‘Existentialism’; and ‘Philosophy and Biology’ alongside others on ethics, aesthetics and the history of philosophy.

==Summer Schools==
In 2013 the London School of Philosophy for the first time entered a collaborative arrangement with [[Birkbeck,_University_of_London|Birkbeck]]'s Department of Philosophy and with Conway Hall, to offer a Summer School on philosophy, which was held over several days at the beginning of July.

The LSP's second annual Summer School, in 2014, was a collaboration with [[Heythrop College]] and Conway Hall. The speakers included Professor [[John Cottingham]], Professor [[Keith Ward]], Dr Anna Abram, Dr [[Piers Benn]], Dr [[Stephen Law]] and Dr Adam Stewart-Wallace (all from Heythrop), Dr Shahrar Ali, Dr Keith Barrett and Dr [[Anja Steinbauer]] (from London School of Philosophy) and special guest speakers Dr [[Roger Scruton]], Emeritus Professor [[Richard Norman]] (Kent) and Professor [[Ken Gemes]] (Birkbeck). &lt;ref name="LS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonschoolofphilosophy.org |title=LSP Summer School |work=LSP website |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
[[File:Bertrand Russell and Conway Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1801595.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Bertrand Russell]] in front of Conway Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1801595]]
As the London School of Philosophy offers only part-time courses, student life is not centralised. The college does not offer [[halls of residence]]. At lunchtimes, LSP students often gather at the open-air Park Café in Red Lion Square Gardens.

'''Lucretia Johanna van Winter''' (1785 – 1845) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] art collector.

Winter was born in [[Amsterdam]] as the oldest child of the wealthy merchant Pieter van Winter who received visitors to his art gallery that he had installed at the rear of his house ''Saxenburg'', [[Keizersgracht]] 244. He had purchased the house for the astronomical sum of Dfl. 100,000 from [[Jean de Neufville]]. In 1800 her mother died and in 1807 her father died, leaving the collection as it then was in the family home, the portraits of which became the property of Lucretia's brother. The rest of the paintings were to be divided between Lucretia and her younger sister [[Annewies van Winter|Anna Louisa]], who would later amass her own art collection.

After her brother's marriage Lucretia bought the house [[Herengracht]] 440 in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/WinterLucretia Lucretia Johanna van Winter] in [[1001 Vrouwen]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's art gallery remained available for viewing at her parent's home (now her brother's residence) and were to be split after the youngest sister Anna Louisa came of age. Anna Louisa took her portion of the collection when she married jonkheer Willem van Loon in 1815, but Lucretia had already made her first art purchases since 1810 with a view to forming her own art gallery and united her half of her father's collection with this modest collection of her own. She continued collecting in her own name until 1820, purchasing in total 71 paintings on her own. In 1822 at the age of 37 Lucretia married Hendrik Six van Hillegom (1790-1847) and the couple moved into his house at Herengracht 509-511. After that all art purchases were made in his name, but it is assumed that she remained an avid collector since there are no records of him making art purchases before his marriage. 

Among the most notable of the paintings Lucretia bought herself are Vermeer's ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|Milkmaid]]'' and ''[[The Little Street]]''. After the death of Lucretia the collection went to her husband and on his death in 1847 it fell to their sons. In 1877 the heirs of Anna Louisa sold the Van Loon-Winter collection as a block to the Paris Rothschild family, which caused a stir in the Dutch papers (it included the ''[[Pendant portraits of Maerten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit]]'', among others). When Lucretia's children died her grandchildren also expected to sell the collection, but a large portion was acquired by the Rijksmuseum amidst debates about the value. They accepted an offer from the heirs for Vermeer's milkmaid plus 38 other paintings for Dfl. 750.000.

In addition to its own image holdings, around 1 million images from 50 partner institutions also are available online. Not all images are of German objects. During the years 1977-2008, 1.4 million photographs from 15 different institutions were made available on [[microfiche]] by Bildarchiv Foto Marburg as the "Marburger Index - the list of art in Germany". Published digital reproductions of these microfiche photographs from the original partner institutions now form the basis of the image index.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7034">'''Microhistory''' is the intensive [[History|historical]] investigation of a well-defined smaller unit of research (most often a single event, the community of a village, or an individual). In its ambition, however, microhistory can be distinguished from a simple [[case study]] insofar as microhistory aspires to "[ask] large questions in small places", to use the definition given by Charles Joyner.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, C. W. ''Shared Traditions: Southern History and Folk Culture'', (Urbana: University of Illinois, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH0gSiHYhrQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Joyner,+search+for+answers+to+large+questions+in+small+places&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0urxT7_2DKas2wWZ3bHDCg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=answers%20to%20large%20questions&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Microhistory originally developed in Italy in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giovanni Levi]], one of the pioneers of the approach, it began as a reaction to a perceived crisis in existing historiographical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Giovanni|chapter=On Microhistory|year=1991|editor-last=Burke|editor-first=Peter|title=New Perspectives on Historical Writing|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|pages=93&amp;ndash;94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carlo Ginzburg]], another of microhistory's founders, has written that he first heard the term used around 1977, and soon afterwards began to work with Levi and [[Simona Cerutti]] on ''Microstorie'', a series of microhistorical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "microhistory" dates back to 1959, when the American historian [[George R. Stewart]] published ''Pickett's Charge: A Microhistory of the Final Attack on Gettysburg, July 3, 1863'', which tells the story of the final day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early use was by the [[Annales School|Annales]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]], for whom the concept had negative connotations, being overly concerned with the history of events.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A third early use of the term was in the title of Luis González's 1968 work ''Pueblo en vilo: Microhistoria de San José de Gracia''.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12/&gt;  González distinguished between microhistory, for him synonymous with local history, and "''petite histoire''", which is primarily concerned with anecdotes.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12/&gt;

==Approach==
The most distinctive aspect of the microhistorical approach is the small scale of investigations.&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26/&gt;  Microhistorians focus on small units in society, as a reaction to the generalisations made by the social sciences which do not necessarily hold up when tested against these smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magnússon|first=Sigurdur Gylfi|title='The Singularization of History': Social History and Microhistory within the Postmodern State of Knowledge|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=36|issue=3|year=2003|page=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, Ginzburg's 1976 work ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'' &amp;ndash; "probably the most popular and widely read work of microhistory"&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26/&gt; &amp;ndash; investigates the life of a single sixteenth-century Italian miller, Menocchio.  The individuals microhistorical works are concerned with are frequently those Robert Tristano describes as "little people", especially those considered heretics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|pages=26&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Ginzburg has written that a core principle of microhistory is making obstacles in sources, such as [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], part of the historical account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, Levi has said that the point of view of the researcher becomes part of the account in microhistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Giovanni|chapter=On Microhistory|year=1991|editor-last=Burke|editor-first=Peter|title=New Perspectives on Historical Writing|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable aspects of microhistory as a historical approach are an interest in the interaction of elite and popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interest in the interaction between micro- and macro-levels of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">The '''Ministry of Stories''' is a non-profit organisation in East London dedicated to helping children and young adults develop writing skills and to helping teachers inspire their students to write.

==Overview==
Located in [[Hoxton]], a district in the [[London Borough of Hackney]], England, The Ministry of Stories was founded in 2010 by the British author [[Nick Hornby]] and co-directors Lucy Macnab and Ben Payne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ministry of Stories offers magical writing classes|first=Ben|last= East|work=The National| date=30 October 2011|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/ministry-of-stories-offers-magical-writing-classes|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company provides mentoring and advice to young writers, relying on the work of volunteer writers, teachers and artists. The MoS aims to inspire young people to transform their lives through creative writing. The company works closely with schools, supporting teachers, but also provides one-to-one mentoring for young people to enjoy imaginative stories, improve language skills, increase abilities in communication, and develop social and educational confidence.&lt;ref name=stratton&gt;{{cite news|first=Allegra | last=Stratton |title=Nick Hornby opens Ministry of Stories to get Britain's kids writing again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/18/nick-hornby-ministry-stories|work=The Guardian|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2012, 5,000 young people have taken part in activities sponsored by the MoS. About 500 trained volunteers have contributed to the effort, as have writers including [[Joe Dunthorne]], [[David Nicholls (writer)|David Nicholls]] and [[Zadie Smith]], as well as actors [[Colin Firth]] and [[Emma Thompson]].&lt;ref name=curtis&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/nick-hornby-minister-of-stories-8381239.html|title=Nick Hornby: Minister of Stories|work=London Evening Standard| first=Nick|last= Curtis|date=4 December 2012|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MoS is patterned after [[Dave Eggers]]' [[826 Valencia]], founded in 2002 in San Francisco, and [[Roddy Doyle]]'s Fighting Words, founded in 2009 in Dublin.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite news|first=Elizabeth | last=Day |title=Roddy Doyle: the joy of teaching children to write|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/11/roddy-doyle-fighting-words-project|work=The Guardian|date=March 11, 2012|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MoS receives funding from the [[Arts Council England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Arts Council England|title=The Ministry of Stories|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/the-ministry-of-stories/|accessdate=24 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311155654/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/the-ministry-of-stories/|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3669">The '''Morphs collaboration''' was a coordinated study to determine the morphologies of galaxies in distant clusters and to investigate the evolution of galaxies as a function of environment and epoch. Eleven clusters were examined and a detailed ground-based and space-based study was carried out. 

The project was begun in 1997 based upon the earlier observations by two groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Couch|first1=W.J.|last2=Ellis|first2=R.S.|last3=Sharples|first3=R.M.|last4=Smail|first4=Ian|authorlink1=Warrick Couch|title=Morphological Studies of the Galaxy Populations in Distant "Butcher-Oemler" Clusters with HST.

It was a collaboration of [[Alan Dressler]] and Augustus Oemler, Jr., at [[Carnegie Institution for Science#Observatories of the CIW|Observatory of the Carnegie Institute of Washington]], [[Warrick Couch|Warrick J. Couch]] at the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Richard Ellis (astronomer)|Richard Ellis]] at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], Bianca M. Poggianti at the [[University of Padua]], [[Amy Barger]] at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawaii's]] [[Institute for Astronomy]], [[Harvey Raymond Butcher|Harvey Butcher]] at [[ASTRON]], and Ray M. Sharples and Ian Smail at [[Durham University]]. Results were published through 2000.

The collaboration sought answers to the differences in the origins of the various galaxy types — [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]], [[Lenticular galaxy|lenticular]], and [[Spiral galaxy|spiral]]. The studies found that elliptical galaxies were the oldest and formed from the violent merger of other galaxies about two to three billion years after the [[Big Bang]]. Star formation in elliptical galaxies ceased about that time. On the other hand, new stars are still forming in the spiral arms of spiral galaxies. Lenticular galaxies (SO) are intermediate between the first two.  They contain structures similar to spiral arms, but devoid of the gas and new stars of the spiral galaxies. Lenticular galaxies are the prevalent form in rich galaxy clusters, which suggests that spirals may be transformed into lenticular galaxies as time progresses.  The exact process may be related to high galactic density, or to the total mass in a rich cluster’s central core. The Morphs collaboration found that one of the principal mechanisms of this transformation involves the interaction among spiral galaxies, as they fall toward the core of the cluster.

The Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) Cluster Building Survey is the follow-on project to the Morphs collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/research/adressler/ "Alan Dressler"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925110325/http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/research/adressler/ |date=2011-09-25 }} Carnegie Institution for Science&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Coding Week''' was founded by former headteacher [[Richard Rolfe]] and tech entrepreneur Jordan Love, who was appointed EU Code Week Ambassador for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Love|first1=Jordan|title='DIGITAL JERSEY HUB RESIDENT APPOINTED AS EU CODE WEEK AMBASSADOR'|url=https://www.digital.je/news/eucodeweekambassador|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Digital Jersey|publisher=Digital Jersey|date=16 September 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place during the week commencing September 21, 2014 with the aim of helping adults to improve their digital literacy  in order to fill the growing skills gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bateman|first1=Kayleigh|title='Training firm Codex DLD launches National Coding Week for Adults'|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227952/Training-firm-Codex-DLD-launches-National-Coding-Week-for-Adults|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Computer Weekly|publisher=TechTarget|date=2 September 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The week is run by volunteers in hubs, libraries, schools, businesses and NGOs with the intention of supporting adults to learn digital skills including coding. [[Richard Rolfe]] and Jordan Love were inspired to create the week when they trained a group of unemployed people in coding skills which eventually led to many of them getting jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Training course for coders launched'|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2014/Pages/CodingTrainingCourse.aspx|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Gov.je|publisher=Government of Jersey|date=28 March 2014|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU predicts a significant number of digital jobs being unfilled by 2020 due to a skills shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs'|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs-0|website=DIGITAL AGENDA FOR EUROPE|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 February 2016|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard and Jordan saw an opportunity to try to inspire adults to gain the skills necessary to fill the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Coding Week|url=http://www.bailiwickexpress.com/jsy/business/national-coding-week/#.VrcrA_mLTIU|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Bailiwick Express|publisher=Bailiwick Express|date=22 September 2014|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2015 National Coding Week ran from 21 September and spread beyond the UK. The week gained coverage and support in the EU and in the US. 
A  number of  prominent business leaders offered support to National Coding Week including Brian Doll VP of GitHub,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=STYLES|first1=KIRSTY|title='Q&amp;A: National Coding Week with Github'|url=http://techcitynews.com/2015/09/24/qa-national-coding-week-with-github/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Tech City News|agency=Tech City Ventures Ltd.|publisher=Publishing Group|date=24 September 2015|ref=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Andrew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Code club: the interview'|url=https://twitter.com/TheDukeOfYork/status/646324359037100033|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=7 February 2016|ref=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Kevin|title='It's National Coding Week!'|url=https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/646038102985850880|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=7 February 2016|ref=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
[[Tim Lovejoy]].

[[Boris Johnson]] the Mayor of London stated that “Coding is a language that is increasingly important for both young people and adults to understand, but it can be an intimidating prospect. National Coding Week will help to make whole generations of Brits more comfortable with coding, allowing them to embrace the business opportunities of the future.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='National Coding Week aims at adult learners'|url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/design/legislation/national-coding-week-aims-adult-learners-2015-09/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Electronics Weekly|publisher=Electronics Weekly|date=8 September 2015|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of the week was to also encourage women to get involved in coding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Atcheson|first1=Sheree|title='National Coding Week - A Great Opportunity to Reflect on the State of Play for Women in Tech'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sheree-atcheson/national-coding-week_b_8170292.html|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Huffington Post Tech|publisher=Huffington Post|date=22 September 2015|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Lane Fox’s drive to bridge the gender gap in tech gave prominence  to the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Card|first1=Jon|title='Gender imbalance in tech sector must change for startups to thrive'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/apr/13/gender-imbalance-tech-sector-martha-lane-fox|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=13 April 2015|ref=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 events and 1000 people took part in 2015. Events occurred all over Wales in libraries and hubs and was supported by [[WEA YMCA Community College Cymru]] and the [[Welsh Government]]

Speaking at the launch event in [[Cardiff Central Library]] Hub’s new digital floor, the Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism, [[Ken Skates]], said “Learning new skills such as coding can open new doors to people. We are increasingly moving into an online world and it is important that people do not miss out on opportunities to develop these skills, which have the potential to create employment opportunities. I’m delighted to launch the National Coding Week in Wales and am pleased this is taking place in a library, which is the ideal place to get support to learn new skills. It’s particularly good to launch it in the new digital floor of Cardiff Central Library, which received a grant from the Welsh Government towards its modernisation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Developing Wales as a nation of Coders'|url=http://www.weacymru.org.uk/en/news/109/0/developing-wales-as-a-nation-of-coders|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=WEA YMCA CC Cymru|publisher=WEA YMCA CC Cymru|date=28 August 2015|ref=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Networking and Information Technology Research and Development''' (NITRD) program consists of a group of [[List of United States federal agencies|U.S. federal agencies]] to research and develop [[information technology]] (IT) capabilities to empower Federal missions; support U.S. science, engineering, and technology leadership; and bolster U.S. economic competitiveness. &lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for American Innovation: Securing Our Economic Growth and Prosperity," President Barack Obama, February 4, 2011 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/InnovationStrategy.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The NITRD Program is managed by the NITRD Subcommittee of the [[National_Science_and_Technology_Council | National Science and Technology Council]]’s (NSTC) Committee on Technology and supported by the NITRD National Coordination Office (NCO).

===Working Groups===
NITRD Program’s member agencies coordinate their NITRD research activities and plans by Interagency Working Groups (IWGs). For each IWG, agency representatives meet to exchange information and collaborate on research plans and activities such as testbeds, workshops, and cooperative proposal solicitations. 

===Program Component Areas===
The annual NITRD Supplement to the President’s Budget is organized by Program Component Areas (PCAs), where the PCAs are major subject areas for federal IT R&amp;D. PCAs are intended to facilitate budgetary comparisons from year to year in each area. The PCA set evolves over time, reflecting changes in IT R&amp;D activities at federal agencies and IT R&amp;D priorities of the Administration&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nitrd.gov/subcommittee/NITRD-PCAs.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. In its first annual report to Congress, the Supplement to the President’s Fiscal Year 1992 Budget, HPCC reported a FY 1991 base budget of $489 million, with eight federal agencies participating, and four R&amp;D components. The FY 2017 NITRD Supplement to the President’s Budget reports to Congress an estimated budget of $4.54 billion across 21 Federal agencies and 10 R&amp;D focus areas.

=== Participating agencies ===
The following federal agencies report their IT research budgets in the NITRD "crosscut" and provide proportional funding to support NITRD's operations:

'''Department of Commerce'''
* [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) 
* [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) 

'''Department of Defense'''
* [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) 
* [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) 
* [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] (OSD) and Service Research Organizations 
* [[Air Force Office of Scientific Research]] (AFOSR)

* [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) 
* [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]] (ONC) 

'''Department of Justice'''
* [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ)

'''Independent Agencies'''
* [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)
* [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA)
* [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA)
* [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO)
* [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF)
Representatives of other agencies also participate.

=== Coordination ===
NITRD's National Coordination Office (NCO) supports NITRD's planning, budget, and assessment activities. The NCO also supports the NITRD Subcommittee, which coordinates the NITRD Program, and the organizations that report to the Subcommittee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nitrd.gov/About/about_nco.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The NCO's director is appointed by the Director of the White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]].

The NCO works with the NITRD agencies, IWGs, CGs and the White House [[Office of Management and Budget]] to prepare, publish, and disseminate the Program's annual supplement to the President's Budget, Federal networking and IT R&amp;D plans, and networking and IT research needs reports.

The NCO provides technical support for the activities of the Networking and Information Technology Subcommittee of the [[President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]], a panel of experts from industry and academia, in assessing the NITRD Program and preparing associated reports.

The NCO maintains the NITRD Web site - https://www.nitrd.gov - which contains information about the Program and electronic versions of NITRD documents

== History and legal background ==
The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program (formerly known as High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program) was created by the [[High Performance Computing Act of 1991]], (P.L. 102-194)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/272/text High Performance Computing Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-194)]&lt;/ref&gt; and amended by the Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-305) &lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/105th-congress/senate-report/173/1&lt;/ref&gt;, and the America COMPETES (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/2272&lt;/ref&gt;. NITRD was reauthorized by Congress in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 (P.L. 114-329)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3084/text&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dr. [[Donald_A.B._Lindberg | Donald A.B. Lindberg]] was the founding Director of the National Coordination Office (NCO) for NITRD, formerly the NCO for High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC). The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 called for the coordination of activities in high-performance computing and the establishment of a National Research and Education Network (NREN) across Federal agencies. Dr. Lindberg led this effort from 1992 to 1995 while serving concurrently as the Director of the National Library of Medicine (NLM).

[[Image:Old City Hall and Terauley Street.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Old City Hall (Toronto)|Old City Hall]] in Toronto in 1907.  Its proposed demolition in the 1960s contributed to increased heritage awareness in Ontario, which led to heritage protection measures such as the ''Ontario Heritage Act''.]]
The '''''Ontario Heritage Act''''', (the ''Act'') first enacted on March 5, 1975,  allows [[municipality|municipalities]] and the [[province|provincial]] government to designate individual properties and districts in the Province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], as being of [[cultural heritage]] value or interest.

==Designation under the Ontario Heritage Act==
Once a property has been designated under Part IV of the ''Act'', a property owner must apply to the local municipality for a permit to undertake alterations to any of the identified heritage elements of the property or to [[demolition|demolish]] any buildings or structures on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/Resources-and-Learning/Ontario-Heritage-Act-Register.aspx|title=Ontario Heritage Act Register|website=Heritagetrust.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part V of the ''Act'' allows for the designation of [[Historic district|heritage conservation districts]].

==Amendments to the legislation==
Until 2005, a designation of a property under the ''Act'' allowed a municipality to delay, but not ultimately prevent, the demolition of a heritage property.  Heritage advocates were highly critical of the 180-day "cooling off" period provided for under the legislation, which was intended to allow time for municipalities and landowners to negotiate an appropriate level of heritage preservation, but often simply resulted in the landowner "waiting out the clock" and demolishing the heritage building once the protection of the ''Ontario Heritage Act'' had expired.

In 2005, the provincial government enacted changes to strengthen the Act.  Under the amended legislation, a landowner who is refused a demolition permit under the ''Act'' no longer has an automatic right to demolish a designated building once the cooling off period has expired.  Instead, the landowner has the option to [[appeal]] the permit refusal to the [[Conservation Review Board]] for individual properties or the [[Ontario Municipal Board]] for properties within a Heritage Conservation District and the appropriate board would make the final decision on whether or not a demolition permit is issued. Where the OMB refuses to issue a permit, the landowner would have no choice but to preserve the heritage building.

The amended legislation also contains provisions which enable municipalities to enact by-laws to require owners of designated buildings to maintain the structures and their heritage elements.  Such by-laws are intended to prevent "demolition by neglect", although the collapse of [[Walnut Hall]] in Toronto demonstrates that such buildings are still at risk.

==Implementation and issues==
[[File:Edward Pease house sign.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plaque on a structure in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], showing that the building is protected under the Act.]]
Heritage designation is not universally welcomed. Because it imposes restrictions, or at least delay, on alteration or demolition of protected properties, some owners and would-be developers feel their property rights are compromised. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page215.aspx|title=Provincial Policy Statement|website=Mah.gov.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcliffepark.ca/heritage.html|title=Rockcliffe Park Residents Association|first=Carmine|last=Domenicucci|website=Rockcliffepark.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also concern that the restrictions will make it more difficult to sell and/or develop affected properties, with a negative impact on market values.

[[Ottawa]]: As part of the city’s heritage inventory project, the city is reviewing properties in Old Ottawa East and Old Ottawa South and placing those considered to have “cultural heritage value” on a registry. Owners will be required to give 60 days notice to the city before demolishing a listed property. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2017/07/13/landowners-dont-buy-citys-sell-job-on-heritage-registry|title=Landowners don't buy city's sell job on heritage registry|website=Ottawasun.com|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rockcliffe Park]]: The entire village, which is now part of the City of Ottawa, became a [[Heritage Conservation District]] in 2016&lt;ref&gt;City of Ottawa By-Law No. 2016 - 89&lt;/ref&gt;. The objective is not just conservation of individual buildings but of the park-like qualities of the area as a whole. This means that lot sizes, spacings between houses, and streetscapes are also protected; for example, new circular driveways are no longer permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcliffepark.ca/Final%202016%20-%20%20RPHCDPlan.pdf|format=PDF|title=ROCKCLIFFE PARK HERITAGE CONSERVATION DISTRICT PLAN|website=Rockcliffepark.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a current appeal by a home-owner who is also a developer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/richcraft-lobby-council-270-buchan-city-hall-access-1.4132749|title=Rockcliffe home debate feeds fears about developers' access to city hall|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/rockcliffe-park-residents-oppose-housing-development&lt;/ref&gt;. Pending the outcome of a September 2017 hearing before the [[Ontario Municipal Board]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omb.gov.on.ca/e-decisions/mm160031-Mar-20-2017.pdf|format=PDF|title=This is the first Pre-Hearing in the appeal before the Board relating to the passing of Heritage By-law No. 2016-89 by the City of Ottawa (the “City”), which adopted the Rockcliffe Park Heritage Conservation District Plan for the Rockcliffe Park Heritage Conservation District|website=Omb.gov.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, City of Ottawa policy is to continue to apply the Heritage Conservation Plan.

Experience with the new provisions of the Act has been mixed.  Municipalities, who were given significantly greater authority with the amendments, have, in some cases, used the authority to prevent or delay development proposals, with questionable intent.  In one case a golf course was designated when the local Council received a proposal to develop it for housing.

Another flashpoint has been proposals to develop or significantly alter church properties. The government of Ontario has recently published a guideline that provides a context for the inherent conflict between religious beliefs and the civil authority over religious property that is enabled by the Act.  The "Guide to Conserving Heritage Places of Worship in Ontario Communities" is part of the Ontario Heritage Toolkit.  The Guide provides an understanding of how religious and heritage preservation goals can be balanced.

Properties under federal jurisdiction are also problematic; enterprises such as banking, navigation and interprovincial rail operate beyond the jurisdiction of Ontario's government. Various federal [[private member's bill]]s (''[[Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act]]'', ''[[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act]]'') attempt to restrict demolition of historic properties, but all are narrow in scope and provide no protection against demolition by neglect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3724">'''Pacific studies''' is the study of the [[Pacific]] region ([[Oceania]]) across [[academic disciplines]] such as [[anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[art]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[politics]], or [[sociology]].

In the fields of anthropology and linguistics, Oceania is often subdivided into [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Polynesia]], while also including [[Australasia]]. In archeology and prehistory, [[Oceania]] extends into the southern [[Pacific Rim]] of [[Asia]], especially the islands now comprising [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Taiwan]]. Study of the history, economics, and politics from the [[Colonialism|colonial period]] on is inextricably bound to that of the major colonial powers: [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]], and later [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Indonesia]].

For many [[Pacific Islanders]], Pacific studies involves projects of cultural renaissance, the reclamation and reassertion of cultural identity, while for many others, Pacific studies tends to focus more on modernization and development, on how to understand the region in ways that will improve people's lives (Firth 2003).

A '''prank call''' (also known as a '''crank call''', '''phony call''' or '''hoax call''') is a telephone [[practical joke]]. Prank phone calls began to gain a worldwide following since the invention of telephones, as they became a staple of the obscure and amusing [[cassette tape]]s traded among musicians, [[sound engineer]]s, and media traders beginning in the late 1970s. Among the most famous and earliest recorded prank calls are the [[Tube Bar prank calls]] tapes, which centered on [[Louis "Red" Deutsch]]. Comedian [[Jerry Lewis]] was an incorrigible phone prankster, and recordings of his hijinks, dating from the 1960s and possibly earlier, still circulate to this day.

Very prominent people have fallen victim to prank callers, for example [[Elizabeth II]], who was fooled by Canadian DJ [[Pierre Brassard]] posing as Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]], asking her to record a speech in support of Canadian unity ahead of the [[1995 Quebec referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | author2= | title=Hoaxing: A national pastime | date=2000-01-25 |publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/618065.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | quote = In 1995, Canadian DJ Pierre Brassard got through to [[Buckingham Palace]] pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. He chatted to the Queen for 15 minutes on air – eliciting a promise that she would try to influence [[Quebec]]'s [[referendum]] on proposals to break away from Canada – and she never realised it was a hoax.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other notable examples of prank calls were made by the Miami-based radio station [[WLZL|Radio El Zol]]. In one, they telephoned Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]], and spoke to him pretending to be Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Chavez falls for Castro hoax | date=2003-01-08 &lt;!-- 02:57 GMT --&gt; | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2637395.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | quote = A radio station in the American state of Florida Hasplayed a practical joke on President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela with a hoax phone call he believed was from his friend and ally, the Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

Castro began swearing at the pranksters live on air after they revealed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/fidel/transcript.htm|title=Transcript of Castro's prank call|first=Tony de la|last=Cova|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anonymity ==
Prank callers can now be easily found through [[Caller ID]], so it is often asserted that since the 1990s, prank calls have been harder to accomplish and thus waning in popularity.&lt;ref name="vanishing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/06/14/the-vanishing-underappreciated-prank-call/yNo0aIoOo5yXeadKt8EmsI/story.html|title=The vanishing, underappreciated prank call - The Boston Globe|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most telephone companies permit callers to withhold the identifying information from calls using the [[vertical service code]] [[*67]] that blocks the caller's ID (141 in the UK), but potential victims may be reluctant to answer a call from an ID-blocked number.&lt;ref name="vanishing" /&gt; [[Wiretapping]] by several governments have also made prank calls easier to trace. Callers can also call from [[payphones]] in order to hide their identity, although this is becoming less common as pay phones are beginning to phase out starting in the late 2000s. The advent and advancements in digital switching technologies such as those found in [[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]], unspoofable [[Automatic number identification|ANI]], as well as outbound and inbound calls being logged at [[telephone exchange|carrier exchange]] equipment, further complicate the pranksters will to remain anonymous while carrying out such activities.

Another increasingly popular option is to use some form of [[VoIP]]. With some VoIP services, the telephone number will simply not exist. These calls are extremely difficult to trace since they may pass through servers and routers operated by multiple corporations or entities in various countries. Although law enforcement agencies may theoretically be able to find where a [[VoIP]] call originates from if they tried, in practice the amount of time, effort, and resources required would be too great to use on ordinary prank calls.

== Political leaders ==
Sometimes, prank callers are able to connect with political leaders. In December 2005, a commercially operated radio station in Spain ([[COPE (radio station)|COPE]] – owned by a series of institutions affiliated with the Catholic Church) played a prank on Bolivian president-elect [[Evo Morales]]. The hoaxster pretended to be Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]], congratulating Morales on his election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quepasa.com/english/news/latinamerica/Zapatero.Morales.prank/406542.html |title=Prank call to Evo Morales |access-date=September 10, 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saying things like, "I imagine the only one not to have called you was George Bush. I've been here two years and he still hasn't called me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/cope/zapatero/broma_morales/dn_17521.htm|title=Noticias, última hora en Informativos Telecinco|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prank calls and the Internet ==
Ever since the opportunity has been available, there have been multiple internet radio stations dedicated to prank calls. Most of them feature a so-called "rotation" of prank calls, which is a constant broadcast of various prank calls submitted by the community, usually streamed from a [[SHOUTcast]] server host. Software such as [[Ventrilo]] has allowed prank calls to be carried out to a more private user-base, however, in real-time.

The internet has allowed many people to share their own personal prank calls and develop into communities. Prank calls can be carried out in many ways; live or pre-recorded. Sites such as [[Stickam]] and [[Ustream]] allow hosts to carry out prank calls live to thousands of listeners, who can also chat and discuss on-goings in real-time. The use of [[social networking]] and the popularity of [[user generated content]] also allows these prank calls to spread and popularity to grow. 

== Legal issues ==
Some prank calls are criminalized in many jurisdictions, for instance if the call involves calling the emergency services, while others may be protected as [[freedom of expression]].  For example, in the US, for a prank call to fall afoul of the Telecommunications Act, {{uscsub|47|223|a|1}}, the call must be done with the intent to "abuse, threaten, or harass". In Australia, the 2Day FM incident is alleged by ACMA to have violated Australian law, but on the grounds that the recorded call was publicly broadcast without the other party's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=India-born nurse's death: Watchdog finds radio station guilty | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-20/other-news/42251296_1_radio-station-mel-greig-jacintha-saldanha | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130927161026/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-20/other-news/42251296_1_radio-station-mel-greig-jacintha-saldanha | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2013-09-27 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudimentary criminal 'pranks' may range from simple [[telephone harassment]] to [[bomb threats]]. One such hoax call occurred in [[Perth]], Western Australia, on New Year's Eve 2002, when a drunk teenager called the new anti-terrorist hot line to report a bomb threat against the New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/attorneygeneralHome.nsf/Page/Media_Releases_2003_January_2003_WA_man_charged_over_hoax_hotline_call_(1_January_2003) |title= Perth, Australia bomb threat hoax |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504182614/http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/attorneygeneralHome.nsf/Page/Media_Releases_2003_January_2003_WA_man_charged_over_hoax_hotline_call_(1_January_2003) |archivedate=May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat was taken seriously, and the celebrations were about to be cancelled when police discovered that no such threat existed. The teenager was then arrested for the false report.

More elaborate pranks rely on tricking the recipient into harmful behavior. An example of these was the 1996–2004 [[strip search phone call scam]], in which a prankster posing as a police officer was able to cause store managers to [[strip search]] female employees. More recently, the [[Pranknet]] [[virtual community]] has been credited for causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage to many hotels and [[fast food restaurant]]s. Posing as [[Authority|authority figures]], such as [[fire alarm]] company representatives and hotel corporate managers, Pranknet participants called unsuspecting employees and customers in the United States via [[Skype]] and tricked them into damaging property, setting off [[fire sprinkler]]s and other humiliating acts such as disrobing. They also post fraudulent ads on [[Craigslist]], and then shout racial epithets and make violent threats of rape and murder against the people who call them to respond to the ads. Pranknet members listen in real-time and discuss the progress together in a private [[chat room]]. The group, who flaunted their anonymity, were outed when editors of ''[[The Smoking Gun]]'', posing as journalists, persuaded them to visit unique URLs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0803091pranknet1.html Telephone Terrorist] The Smoking Gun, August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of prank calls by Joseph Sherer led to convictions and a twenty-year prison sentence for impersonating a physician, criminal endangerment, and [[aggravated assault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-01-21/news/0001201213_1_mutilation-mclane-bozeman|title=Caller Prompted Mutilation, Police Say |newspaper=Sun-Sentinel |location=Ft.

The victim's obedient actions flowed directly from Sherer's instructions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/mt-supreme-court/1314983.html|title=STATE of Montana, Plaintiff and Respondent, v.

Until his death in 2011, Oklahoma construction worker Frank Garrett was prank called and recorded countless times for his vitriolic reactions. The [[Soundboard (computer program)|soundboard]] community that followed him caused at least three known incidents with the law: two in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and a third in [[Houston]]; both were for threats of violence against residents and the police with his name being used in the process. Both incidents were covered by local [[FOX News]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Frank Garrett (Aka Duncan) has died July 3, 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmb5775DLGQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.net/article/20100223/NEWS/302239712|last=Glover|first=Michael|title=Angry, threatening calls alarm Sugar Creek|date=February 23, 2010|accessdate=January 22, 2014|publisher=[[GateHouse Media]]|newspaper=[[The Examiner (Missouri)|The Examiner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104541/http://www.myfoxhouston.com/story/18232189/caller-threatens-to-blow-up-hpd|url=http://www.myfoxhouston.com/story/18232189/caller-threatens-to-blow-up-hpd|title=Caller Threatens to Blow Up HPD|date=April 26, 2011| accessdate=January 22, 2014|archivedate=February 2, 2014|publisher=[[KRIV (TV)|Fox 26 News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulley|first=Mary|title=Man makes repeated threatening, obscene phone calls to people in Independence|url=http://fox4kc.com/2014/12/08/woman-worried-by-threatening-obscene-phone-calls-made-to-her-home/|publisher=[[WDAF-TV|Fox 4KC]]|date=December 9, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Main|Suicide of Jacintha Saldanha}}

In 2012, Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse at [[King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes|King Edward VII hospital]] who was attending a pregnant [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], was deceived into transferring a prank call from [[Mel Greig]] and [[Mike Christian]], the hosts of the ''[[Hot30 Countdown]]'' radio program broadcast on [[2Day FM]] in Sydney, Australia, who were impersonating [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. The hoaxsters were able to ask the duty nurse questions about the duchess' health, making the answers public. Saldanha was later found dead in a suspected suicide. The incident and the following death received intense media coverage and triggered an investigation, but no charges were laid.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9731359/Cruel-hospital-hoax-still-playing-on-radio.html |title='Cruel' hospital hoax still playing on radio|author=Gordon Rayner |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 8 December 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20130202StuffCoNz&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/8254302/No-charges-for-royal-hoaxters |title=No charges for royal hoaxters |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2 February 2013 | accessdate=2 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
{{examplefarm|date=October 2018}}
Prank calls frequently appear in many earlier episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] calls [[Moe's Tavern]] asking for people whose names are actually double entendres. Examples include "Mike Rotch" (my crotch), "Bea O'Problem" ([[Body odor|B.O.]] problem), "Al Coholic" (alcoholic), "Amanda Hugginkiss" (a man to hug and kiss), and "Anita Bath" (I need a bath). [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] then asks his clientele if the person is present, embarrassing himself in the process. However, in the episode "[[Flaming Moe's]]", Bart's prank call backfires when he calls up asking for a "Hugh Jass" (huge ass), only for a man with the same name to answer. And in "[[Donnie Fatso]]", [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony]] accidentally calls Moe asking for his business partner, "Yuri Nator" (urinator).

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s song "Phony Calls" (a parody of "[[Waterfalls (TLC song)|Waterfalls]]" by [[TLC (group)|TLC]], featured on his 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'') deals with prank phone calls. Specifically, it talks about the "Is your refrigerator running?" gag and the "Do you have Prince Albert in a can?" gag. It also incorporates Bart Simpson's aforementioned "Mike Rotch" prank phone call. 

On an episode of ''[[Pee-Wee's Playhouse]]'', the mischievous Randy makes a prank call (the classic "Is your refrigerator running? Then you better catch it!" gag) and talks Pee-Wee into doing so also. The recipient of the call is irritated and gets her husband on the phone, who happens to be a police officer. The officer sternly warns Pee-Wee that making prank calls is against the law and that it can result in going to jail and a lifetime criminal record.

The [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[Regular Show]]'' featured an episode centered around prank calls in its first season, entitled "Prank Callers". Inspired by watching online videos of the "world's best prank caller", the show's protagonists, Mordecai and Rigby, attempt to make several prank calls of their own. After the two fail to prank the world's best prank caller, they are sent back in time to 1982, and are later joined by the rest of the show's main cast. The episode then focuses on the group's efforts to return to their proper time period, by pranking the aforementioned prank caller. in the episode entitled "House Rules" Benson decrees a series of dubious rules. one of which forbids the use of making prank calls, causing Mordecai and Rigby to abandon him of their own free will. Later on, Mordecai receives a prank call(the classic, but derogatory "Loser says what?" prank). Mordecai attempts to dismiss the caller, but inadvertently falls for it.

In John Carpenter's spooky thriller, ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', during the scene when [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] appears before Lynda while disguising himself as her boyfriend, Bob, in a ghost costume, and she teases him before calling Laurie, during which Michael strangles her, Laurie thinks it's just Annie making another prank call. 

Prank calls are common in morning radio talk shows with a comedy theme, radio broadcasts a Carmen Prank Call will occur, where "Carmen" calls random people and annoys them to the point of them hanging up, irritated, once, and after a second call, twice. Prank calls are generally done for the amusement of the pranksters (and their listening audiences). Some performers such as [[The Jerky Boys]], [[Tom Mabe]] and [[Roy D. Mercer]] made a name for themselves producing albums of their recorded prank calls.

The [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Spongebob SquarePants]]'' features an episode in which SpongeBob is distracted by a prank call, before realizing he could fly as a result of his hair dryer being stuck in his pants. SpongeBob receives a prank call from someone asking for "The Birdman of Bikini Bottom", before asking SpongeBob if he lived in a birdcage, annoying him to the point of asking him who's calling him, before being given a joke name (The Classic "Joe Mama" gag), before SpongeBob admonishes the caller and hangs up.

[[Sal "the Stockbroker" Governale]] and [[Richard Christy]], writers on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', have made various prank calls to [[public access]] shows, [[talk radio]], radio stations, and normal people at home. They also have a fictional radio show called the "Jack and Rod show" where they call a major celebrity for an interview and prank them with sound effects or fake guests such as [[Bruce Morrow|Cousin Brucie]] (where Howard imitates a famous radio host while using an exaggerated version of his signature speech patterns) and many other pranks.

The television show ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' is a series of real-life prank calls made by celebrities and re-enacted on-screen by [[puppet]]s for a humorous effect.

''[[Fonejacker]]'', a show started on April 5, 2007 on [[E4 (channel)|E4]], stars [[Kayvan Novak]] performing prank calls to the general public and being shown with animated pictures in a [[Monty Python]] style with their mouths moving and live recordings as the victim receives the call.

Beginning in early 2011, the image board [[4chan]] organized a prank calling of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], location of the popular television show ''[[Pawn Stars]]''. The callers repeatedly asked the employees if they sold ''[[Battletoads]]'', a video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] notorious for its difficulty. This call led Rick, star of ''Pawn Stars'' and owner of the store, to repeatedly swear and yell at the prank callers. The 4chan callers recorded this and uploaded it to [[YouTube]], and subsequently many videos related to prank callers dialing random establishments and asking about ''Battletoads'' have been uploaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ReadyToPrank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpmWNpUZmcA|website=YouTube|publisher=ReadyToPrank|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PrankCallsByReV|title=Prank Call ReV Calls (Pawn Stars) Rick Harrison Cellphone # "Battletoads"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ3yTVkL7bQ|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prank Website|url=https://www.ownagepranks.com|website=OwnagePranks|publisher=OwnagePranks|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">In [[computer science]], particularly in [[human-computer interaction]], '''presentation semantics''' specify how a particular piece of a [[formal language]] is represented in a distinguished manner accessible to [[human senses]], usually human vision. For example, saying that &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;bold&gt; ... &lt;/bold&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must render the text between these constructs using some [[bold typeface]] is a specification of presentation semantics for that [[syntax]]. An example of  interactive presentation semantics is defining the expected behavior of a [[Hyperlink|hypertext link]] on a suitable syntax.

Many [[markup languages]] like [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[DSSSL]], [[XSL-FO]] or [[troff]] have presentation semantics, but others like [[XML]], [[XLink]] and [[XPath]] do not.&lt;ref&gt; H. P. Alesso, Craig Forsythe Smith, ''Developing Semantic Web services'', A K Peters, Ltd., 2005, {{ISBN|1-56881-212-4}}, p. 62 and p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.

{{Marketing}}
'''Printing''' is a process for reproducing text and [[Printmaking|images]] using a master form or template. The earliest non-paper products involving printing  include [[cylinder seal]]s and objects such as the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] and the [[Cylinders of Nabonidus]]. The earliest known form of printing as applied to paper was [[woodblock printing]], which appeared in China before 220 A.D.&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later developments in printing technology include the [[movable type]] invented by [[Bi Sheng]] around 1040 AD&lt;ref name="Great Chinese Inventions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota-china.com |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the 15th century.

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[Woodblock printing]] is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a method of printing on [[textiles]] and later on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 A.D.

{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China. They are of silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before 220 A.D.). They are the earliest example of woodblock printing on paper appeared in the mid-seventh century in China.

By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first extant complete printed book containing its date is the [[Diamond Sutra]] ([[British Library]]) of 868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |title=Oneline Gallery: Sacred Texts |publisher=British Library |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110093610/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;

Printing spread early to [[Korea]] and Japan, which also used Chinese [[logogram]]s, but the technique was also used in [[Turpan]] and [[Vietnam]] using a number of other scripts. This technique then spread to Persia and Russia.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;[[Thomas Franklin Carter]], ''The Invention of Printing in China and its Spread Westward'', The Ronald Press, NY 2nd ed. 1955, pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was transmitted to Europe via the Islamic world, and by around 1400 was being used on paper for [[old master print]]s and [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayor |first=A Hyatt |title=Prints and People |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=Princeton |volume=5-18 |isbn=0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Arabs never used this to print the [[Quran]] because of the limits imposed by Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

====In the Middle East====
Block printing, called ''tarsh'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], developed in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]] during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and [[amulet]]s. There is some evidence to suggest that these print blocks made from non-wood materials, possibly [[tin]], lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the [[Muslim world]]. Though Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Muslim world, initially for fabric, the technique of metal block printing remained unknown in Europe. Block printing later went out of use in Islamic Central Asia after movable type printing was introduced from China.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), "[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]". ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), p. 427-438.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Europe====
[[File:Saint Christopher 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The earliest known [[woodcut]], 1423, [[Buxheim]], with hand-colouring]]
Block printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing card]]s printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.&lt;!-- This may be supported by the reference - An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}} (recovered from a previous version of this article) --&gt;

Around the mid-fifteenth-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common.  There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of [[movable type]], with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440 and 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Movable type}}
{{See also|History of Western typography}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of printing and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]]. [[Movable type]] allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.

Around 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by [[Bi Sheng]] out of [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name="Great Chinese Inventions"/&gt; Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing (xylography), which "proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I., ''Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used in large-scale printing of paper money
issued by the Northern Song dynasty. Movable type spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty.

Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing using bronze. The [[Jikji]], published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould, and bronze poured into the mould, and finally the type was polished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean form of metal movable type was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp. 15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;{{cite book |last=Polenz |first=Peter von. |title=Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

===The printing press===
{{main|Printing press}}
Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]], adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer and more absorbent paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinberg |first=S. H. |authorlink=S. H. Steinberg |title=Five Hundred Years of Printing |edition=3rd |year=1974 |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex |isbn=0140203435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, [[tin]], [[antimony]], copper and bismuth – the same components still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 27, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] – entry "printing"&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Gutenberg started work on his [[printing press]] around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69" /&gt;

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page setting and printing using a press was faster and more durable. Also, the metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to [[typography]] and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type for Western languages. The printing press rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[Spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. 
[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Page-setting room - c. 1920]]
Gutenberg's innovations in movable type printing have been called the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg "Man of the Millennium".

===Rotary printing press===
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
The '''rotary printing press''' was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843. It uses impressions curved around a cylinder to print on long continuous rolls of paper or other substrates. Rotary drum printing was later significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]].

==Conventional printing technology==
All printing process are concerned with two kinds of areas on the final output:
# Image Area (printing areas)
# Non-image Area (non-printing areas)

After the information has been prepared for production (the prepress step), each printing process has definitive means of separating the image from the non-image areas.

Conventional printing has four types of process:
# Planographics, in which the printing and non-printing areas are on the same plane surface and the difference between them is maintained chemically or by physical properties, the examples are: offset lithography, collotype, and screenless printing.
# Relief, in which the printing areas are on a plane surface and the non printing areas are below the surface, examples: flexography and letterpress.
# Intaglio, in which the non-printing areas are on a plane surface and the printing area are etched or engraved below the surface, examples: steel die engraving, gravure
# Porous, in which the printing areas are on fine mesh screens through which ink can penetrate, and the non-printing areas are a stencil over the screen to block the flow of ink in those areas, examples: screen printing, stencil duplicator.

===Letterpress===
[[File:Commercial. Le Samedi BAnQ P48S1P03551.jpg|thumb|Miehle press printing Le Samedi journal. [[Montreal]], 1939.]]
{{Main|Letterpress printing}}
'''Letterpress printing''' is a technique of [[relief printing]]. A worker composes and locks [[movable type]] into the bed of a press, [[ink]]s it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper.

Letterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century and [[Global spread of the printing press|remained in wide use for books and other uses]] until the second half of the 20th century, when [[offset printing]] was developed. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.

===Offset===
{{Main|Offset press}}
'''Offset printing''' is a widely used printing technique. Offset printing is where the inked image is transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket. An offset transfer moves the image to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, a process based on the repulsion of oil and water; the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier. So, the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.

Currently, most books and newspapers are printed using the technique of offset lithography.

===Gravure===
{{Main|Rotogravure}}
'''Gravure printing''' is an [[intaglio printing]] technique, where the image being printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or [[laser]] ablation.

Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.

===Other printing techniques===
The other significant printing techniques include:

* [[Flexography]], used for packaging, labels, newspapers
* [[Dye-sublimation printer]]
* [[Inkjet]], used typically to print a small number of books or packaging, and also to print a variety of materials: from high quality papers simulating offset printing, to floor tiles. Inkjet is also used to apply mailing addresses to direct mail pieces
* [[Laser printing]] (toner printing) mainly used in offices and for transactional printing (bills, bank documents). Laser printing is commonly used by direct mail companies to create variable data letters or coupons.
*[[Pad printing]], popular for its unusual ability to print on complex three-dimensional surfaces
*[[Relief print]], mainly used for [[Mail-order catalog|catalogue]]s
*[[Screen-printing]] for a variety of applications ranging from T-shirts to floor tiles, and on uneven surfaces
*[[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], used mainly for high value documents such as currencies.
*[[Thermal printing]], popular in the 1990s for fax printing. Used today for printing labels such as airline baggage tags and individual price labels in supermarket deli counters.

==Impact of German movable type printing press==
===Quantitative aspects===
[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450–1800.png|thumb|European output of books printed by movable type from ca. 1450 to 1800&lt;ref name="Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009"/&gt;]]
{{Main|History of printing}}

It is estimated that following the innovation of Gutenberg's printing press, the European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref name="Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009"&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: "Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–445 (417, table 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious impact===
[[Samuel Hartlib]], who was exiled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that "the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppression".&lt;ref name="Briggs-Burke"&gt;Ref: Briggs, Asa and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Burke, Peter]] (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PrintMus 038.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the Gutenberg press at the [[International Printing Museum]] in Carson, California]]

In the Muslim world, printing, especially in Arabic scripts, was strongly opposed throughout the [[early modern period]], though sometimes printing in [[Hebrew]] or [[Armenian script]] was permitted.  Thus the first movable type printing in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was in Hebrew in 1493.&lt;ref&gt;or soon after; Naim A. Güleryüz, ''Bizans'tan 20. Yüzyıla - Türk Yahudileri'', Gözlem Gazetecilik Basın ve Yayın A.Ş., İstanbul, January 2012, p.90 {{ISBN|978-9944-994-54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an imperial ambassador to [[Istanbul]] in the middle of the sixteenth century, it was a sin for the [[Turkish people|Turks]] to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan [[Selim I]] issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death. At the end of the sixteenth century, Sultan [[Murad III]] permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in [[Arabic]] characters, yet the majority were imported from [[Italy]].  [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]]
established the first press for printing in Arabic in the Ottoman Empire, against opposition from the calligraphers and parts of the [[Ulama]]. It operated until 1742, producing altogether seventeen works, all of which were concerned with non-religious, utilitarian matters.  Printing did not become common in the Islamic world until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, William J., "İbrāhīm Müteferriḳa and Turkish Incunabula", ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'', 1968, volume 88, issue 3, page 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews were banned from German printing [[guild]]s; as a result Hebrew printing sprang up in [[Italy]], beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua. Local rulers had the authority to grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/books/12hebr.html?_r=1 A Lifetime's Collection of Texts in Hebrew, at Sotheby's]", [[Edward Rothstein]], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and many of those printed during this period carry the words 'con licenza de superiori' (indicating their printing having been licensed by the censor) on their title pages.

It was thought that the introduction of the printing medium 'would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.'&lt;ref name="Meyrowitz41"&gt;Meyrowitz: "Mediating Communication: What Happens?" in "Questioning the Media", p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The consequences of printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz&lt;ref name="Meyrowitz41" /&gt; used the example of [[William Carter (martyr)|William Carter]] who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was [[hanging]].

===Social impact===
Print gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print, according to [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] in his lecture ''On the Study of History'' (1895), gave "assurance that the work of the [[Renaissance]] would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the [[Middle Ages]] would never recur, that not an idea would be lost".&lt;ref name="Briggs-Burke" /&gt;
[[File:Press1520.png|thumb|upright|Bookprinting in the 16th century]]
Print was instrumental in changing the nature of reading within society.

[[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] identifies two long-term effects of the invention of printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for knowledge as well as allowing for comparison between incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein in Briggs and Burke, 2002: p21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asa Briggs]] and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] identify five kinds of reading that developed in relation to the introduction of print:
# Critical reading: due to the fact that texts finally became accessible to the general population, critical reading emerged because people were given the option to form their own opinions on texts
# Dangerous Reading: reading was seen as a dangerous pursuit because it was considered rebellious and unsociable especially in the case of women, because reading could stir up dangerous emotions such as love and that if women could read, they could read love notes
# Creative reading: printing allowed people to read texts and interpret them creatively, often in very different ways than the author intended
# Extensive Reading: print allowed for a wide range of texts to become available, thus, previous methods of intensive reading of texts from start to finish, began to change and with texts being readily available, people began reading on particular topics or chapters, allowing for much more extensive reading on a wider range of topics
# Private reading: became linked to the rise of individualism because before print, reading was often a group event, where one person would read to a group of people and with print, literacy rose as did availability of texts, thus reading became a solitary pursuit

The invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. [[Printer (publisher)|Printers]] emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, although the much more labour-intensive occupation of the [[scribe]] naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the amount of [[bookselling|booksellers]] and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.

=== Educational Impact ===
Gutenberg's printing press had profound impacts on universities as well. Universities were influenced in their "language of scholarship, libraries, curriculum, [and] pedagogy" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modie|first=G|date=2014|title=Gutenberg’s Effects on Universities|url=|journal=History of Education|volume=43 |issue=4|pages=17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The language of Scholarship ====
Before the invention of the printing press, most written material was in Latin. However, after the invention of printing the number of books printed expanded as well as the vernacular. Latin was not replaced completely, but remained an international language until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== University Libraries ====
At this time, universities began establishing accompanying libraries. "Cambridge made the chaplain responsible for the library in the fifteenth century but this position was abolished in 1570 and in 1577 Cambridge established the new office of university librarian. Although, the University of Leuven did not see a need for a university library based on the idea that professor were the library. Libraries also began receiving so many books from gifts and purchases that they began to run out of room. This issue was solved, however, by a man named Merton (1589) who decided books should be stacked horizontally on shelves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Curriculum ====
The printed press changed university libraries in many ways. Professors were finally able to compare the opinions of different authors rather than being forced to look at only one or two specific authors. Textbooks themselves were also being printed in different levels of difficulty, rather than just one introductory text being made available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Digital printing==
By 2005, [[Digital printing]] accounts for approximately 9% of the 45 trillion pages printed annually around the world.&lt;ref name="vj_ipg2-0_keynote"&gt;"[http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html When 2% Leads to a Major Industry Shift] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032849/http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html |date=February 16, 2008 }}" Patrick Scaglia, August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing at home, an office, or an engineering environment is subdivided into:
*small format (up to ledger size paper sheets), as used in business offices and libraries
*wide format (up to 3' or 914mm wide rolls of paper), as used in drafting and design establishments.

Some of the more common printing technologies are:

*[[blueprint]] – and related chemical technologies
*[[daisy wheel]] – where pre-formed characters are applied individually
*[[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix]] – which produces arbitrary patterns of dots with an array of printing studs
*[[line printer|line printing]] – where formed characters are applied to the paper by lines
*[[thermal printer|heat transfer]] – such as early fax machines or modern receipt printers that apply heat to special paper, which turns black to form the printed image
*[[inkjet]] – including bubble-jet, where ink is sprayed onto the paper to create the desired image
*[[electrophotography]] – where [[toner]] is attracted to a charged image and then developed
*[[laser printing|laser]] – a type of [[xerography]] where the charged image is written pixel by pixel using a laser
*[[solid ink]] printer – where [[cube]]s of ink are melted to make ink or liquid toner

Vendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems are more economical than inkjet in the long run, even though inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.

Professional [[digital printing]] (using [[toner]]) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto which it is printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP [[Indigo Digital Press]] series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.

Small press and fanzines generally use [[digital printing]]. Prior to the introduction of cheap photocopying the use of machines such as the [[spirit duplicator]], [[hectograph]], and [[mimeograph]] was common.

==3D printing==
[[3D printing]] is a form of manufacturing technology where physical objects are created from [[3D modeling|three-dimensional digital models]] using 3D printers. The objects are created by laying down or building up many thin layers of material in succession.  The technique is also known as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, or fabricating.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Gang run printing==
[[Gang run printing]] is a method in which multiple printing projects are placed on a common paper sheet in an effort to reduce printing costs and paper waste. Gang runs are generally used with sheet-fed printing presses and CMYK process color jobs, which require four separate plates that are hung on the plate cylinder of the press.  Printers use the term "gang run" or "gang" to describe the practice of placing many print projects on the same oversized sheet. Basically, instead of running one postcard that is 4 x 6 as an individual job the printer would place 15 different postcards on 20 x 18 sheet therefore using the same amount of press time the printer will get 15 jobs done in the roughly the same amount of time as one job.

==Printed electronics==
[[Printed electronics]] is the manufacturing of electronic devices using standard printing processes. Printed electronics technology can be produced on cheap materials such as paper or flexible film, which makes it an extremely cost-effective method of production. Since early 2010, the printable electronics industry has been gaining momentum and several large companies, including [[Bemis Company]] and [[Illinois Tool Works]] have made investments in printed electronics and industry associations including OE-A and FlexTech Alliance are contributing heavily to the advancement of the printed electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Announcements Show Gains Being Made by PE Industry|url=http://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/articles/2012/07/recent-announcements-show-gains-being-made-by-pe-i|publisher=Printed Electronics Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Printable transistors usher in 'internet of things'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/21/thinfilm/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues of authenticity ==
The issue of authenticity of Moai heads may never be fully resolved. The fact is that the rocks used to carve the heads are as old as the volcano eruption that formed them, so carbon 14 testing reveals no evidence of authenticity. The age of the Moai heads on the island cannot be determined, and off the island, heads can only be determined to be made from Easter Island volcanic rock or not made from Easter Island volcanic rock. Determining the age of an Easter Island Moai head is therefore an art, and not a science. Field experts make judgments and express opinions about what tools they feel were used and attempt to tie an age to that
opinion.
Such a condition means that Moai Heads cannot be tested with hope of determining authenticity; they may, however, be brought under suspicion of being fakes. As with any object of antiquity, the patrimony, the history and story of the heads, is an important part in determining authenticity. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
 
An unauthenticated moai head entitled "Henry" currently stands in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale]], California. It was obtained in the first half of the 20th century by the founder of the park Dr. Hubert Eaton. Dr. Eaton received the moai in a legal transaction between Rapanui fishermen at Easter Island who were using the head (approx 1m height) as ballast for a boat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapidaryjournal.com/archive/50/nov1954.cfm Lapidary Journal, (November/December 1954) "The story behind Henry".]&lt;/ref&gt; The Memorial Park has no plans for authenticating or testing the moai in the near future.

In 2003, the Chilean government began an investigation into two moai heads within a set of 15 other Easter Island artefacts&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2633865.stm Porteous, Clinton. BBC News (January 7, 2003) "Chile probes Easter Island artefacts".]&lt;/ref&gt; — the possessions of Hernan Garcia de Gonzalo Vidal — which were put on sale at The Cronos gallery in Miami. After a photographic inspection by Patricia Vargas, an archaeologist at the University of Chile's Easter Island institute, she commented that ""They might be nice art pieces, but I doubt any one is 500 years old. It appears that the cuts have been made with modern machinery and not with stone tools." A meeting arranged between the Chilean newspaper [[El Mercurio]] which first reported the sale, and Hernan Garcia Gonzalo de Vidal, later failed to take place when Mr Gonzalo de Vidal became unavailable due to a "family emergency".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,872690,00.html Franklin, Jonathan. The Guardian, (January 11, 2003), "Mystery looms over stone heads".]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Replicas ===
In 1968, a moai (possibly Moai 35-001) was taken from [[Rapa Nui]] and displayed in [[New York City]] as a publicity stunt to oppose the building of a jet refueling facility on Easter Island.&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. New York Times, (October 22, 1968) "5-Ton Head From Easter Island is put on a Pedestal".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landmarksfoundation.org/articles/MadisonSiteSpecificArticle.html Slonim, Jeffrey. Madison Magazine, (1999), "Site Specific".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelope.com/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html Holmes, Greg. The Lope, (April 15, 2006) "Happy Easter Island", correspondence with Samuel Adams Green.]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of the campaign and the following tour to Washington D.C. and Chicago, the moai was received by the Lippincott company of North Haven, [[Connecticut]], which since its inception in 1966 had provided a "place for artists to create large sculptures and receive help in transportation and installation of their work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collections_list.cfm/fuseaction/Collections.ViewCollection/CollectionID/9147/search_letter/L Smithsonian archives of American art. (September 23, 2007) List of Collections and Interviews A-Z.]&lt;/ref&gt; In co-operation with the [[World Monuments Fund|International Fund for Monuments Inc]], Lippincott produced a copy from the original moai (before it was confiscated by the Chilean government) and claimed the rights to execute the work on 100 further replicas.

In 1974, Object No. 3 was produced from the copy, and now stands outside the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]].

A '''residue numeral system''' ('''RNS''') is a [[numeral system]] representing [[integer]]s by their values [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] several [[pairwise coprime]] integers called the moduli. This representation is allowed by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], which asserts that, if {{mvar|N}} is the product of the moduli, there is, in an interval of length {{mvar|N}}, exactly one integer having any given set of modular values. The [[arithmetic operation|arithmetic]] of a residue numeral system is also called '''multi-modular arithmetic'''.

Multi-modular arithmetic is widely used for computation with large integers, typically in [[linear algebra]], because it provides faster computation than with the usual numeral systems, even when the time for converting between numeral systems is taken into account. Other applications of multi-modular arithmetic include [[polynomial greatest common divisor#Modular GCD algorithm|polynomial greatest common divisor]], [[Gröbner basis]] computation and [[cryptography]].

==Definition==

A residue numeral system is defined by a set of {{mvar|k}} integers
:&lt;math&gt;\{ m_1, m_2, m_3,\ldots, m_k\},&lt;/math&gt;
called the ''moduli'', which are generally supposed to be [[pairwise coprime]] (that is, any two of them have a [[greatest common divisor]] equal to one). 
referred to as the ''moduli''. Residue number systems have been defined for non-coprime moduli, but are not commonly used because of worse properties. Therefore, they will not be considered in the remainder of this article.&lt;ref&gt;Behrooz Parhami, [http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~parhami/text_comp_arit.htm Computer Arithmetic: Algorithms and Hardware Design]. 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 2010. 641+xxv p. {{ISBN|978-0-19-532848-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An integer {{mvar|x}} is represented in the residue numeral system by the set of its remainders
:&lt;math&gt;\{ x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots,x_k \}&lt;/math&gt;
under [[Euclidean division]] by the moduli. That is 
:&lt;math&gt; x_i = x \operatorname{mod}m_i,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;0\le x_i&lt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;
for every {{mvar|i}}

Let {{mvar|M}} be the product of all the &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;. Two integers whose difference is a multiple of {{mvar|M}} have the same representation in the residue numeral system defined by the {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}s. More precisely, the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] asserts that each of the {{mvar|M}} different sets of possible residues represents exactly one [[residue class]] modulo {{mvar|M}}. That is, each set of residues represents exactly one integer in the interval {{math|0, ..., ''M''}}.

In applications where one is also interested with negative integers, it is often more convenient to represent integers belonging to an interval centered at 0. In this case, if {{mvar|M}} is odd, each set of residues represents exactly one integer of [[absolute value]] at most {{mvar|M}}.

==Arithmetic operations==

For adding, subtracting and multiplying numbers represented in a residue number system, it suffices to perform the same [[Modular arithmetic|modular operation]] on each pair of residues. More precisely, if 
:&lt;math&gt;[m_1, \ldots, m_k]&lt;/math&gt;
is the list of moduli, the sum of the integers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, respectively represented by the residues &lt;math&gt;[x_1,\ldots, x_k]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[y_1,\ldots, y_k],&lt;/math&gt; is the integer {{mvar|z}} represented by &lt;math&gt;[z_1,\ldots, z_k],&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;z_i= (x_i+y_i)\operatorname{mod} m_i,&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''k''}} (as usual, mod denotes the [[modulo operation]] consisting of taking the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] by the right operand). Subtraction and multiplication are defined similarly.

For a succession of operations, it is not necessary to apply the modulo operation at each step. It may be applied at the end of the computation, or, during the computation, for avoiding [[integer overflow|overflow]] of hardware operations.

===Comparison===

If two integers are equal, then all their residues are equal. Conversely, if all residues are equal, then the two integers are equal, or their differences is a multiple of {{mvar|M}}. It follows that testing equality is easy.

At the opposite, testing inequalities ({{math|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}) is difficult and, usually, requires to convert integers to the standard representation. As a consequence, this representation of numbers is not suitable for algorithms using inequality tests, such [[Euclidean division]] and [[Euclidean algorithm]].

===Division===

Division in residue numeral systems is problematic.  A paper describing one possible algorithm is available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20050217165652/http://www.cs.rpi.edu/research/ps/93-9.ps]. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is coprime with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (that is &lt;math&gt;b_i\not =0&lt;/math&gt;) then
:&lt;math&gt;C=A\cdot B^{-1} \mod M&lt;/math&gt;
can be easily calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;c_i=a_i \cdot b_i^{-1} \mod m_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[multiplicative inverse]] of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is multiplicative inverse of &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}

RNS have applications in the field of [[Digital data|digital]] [[computer arithmetic]]. By decomposing in this a large integer into a set of smaller integers, a large calculation can be performed as a series of smaller calculations that can be performed independently and in parallel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6042">'''Resupination''' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''resupinus'', meaning "bent back
with the face upward" or "on the back".&lt;ref name="RWB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Roland Wilbur|title=The Composition of Scientific Words|date=1956|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[wikt:Resupination|Resupination]]" is the [[wikt:noun|noun]] form of the [[wikt:adjective|adjective]] "resupine" which means "being upside-down, supine or facing upward".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, College Edition'' 1964, The World Publishing Company, Cleveland and New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "resupinate" is generally only used in a [[Botany|botanical]] context - in everyday language, "supine" has a similar meaning.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|title=supine|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supine|publisher=Merriam-Webster dictionary|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AOD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Bruce (ed.)|title=The Australian Oxford Dictionary|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=South Melbourne, Vic|isbn=0195507932|page=1348|edition=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In botany, resupination refers to the "twisting"  of flowers or leaves through about 180° as they open. Resupinate leaves have the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] or "stalk" twisted - respuinate flowers twist as they open.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Arthur W.|title=Resupination Studies of Flowers and Leaves|journal=Annals of Botany|date=1939|volume=3|issue=4|pages=871–887|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a085096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== Alstroemeriaceae === 
Plants in the [[genus]] ''[[Alstroemeria]]'' have more or less resupinate leaves.&lt;ref name="burwur"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resupination|url=http://www.burwur.net/sinns/3resupe.htm|publisher=Sinningia and Friends|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orchidaceae ===
The flower of a typical plant in the orchid [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Orchidaceae]] has three [[sepal]]s and three [[petal]]s. One petal, called the [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]], "lip" or "tongue", is typically quite different from the other two. It usually functions to attract an insect pollinator. As an orchid flower bud develops, the attachment of the lip to the axis of the flower is above (or [[wikt:adaxial|adaxial]] to) that of the other two petals. In many orchid [[genus|genera]], as the flower opens, it twists so that the attachment of the "lip" is below that of the other two petals, the three sepals and the sexual parts of the flower known as the [[Column (botany)|column]]. Orchid flowers that undergo this twist are called "resupinate" - those that do not are "non-resupinate".&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ames|first1=Oakes|title=Resupination as a diagnostic character in the Orchidaceae with special reference to ''Malaxis monophyllos''|journal=Botanical Museum leaflets, Harvard University|date=1938|volume=6|issue=8|pages=145–183|jstor=41762701}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZNOG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=St George|first1=Ian|title=Resupination|url=https://www.nativeorchids.co.nz/Journals/102/page4.htm|publisher=New Zealand Native Orchid Group|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milligan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milligan|first1=Brian|title=Resupination|url=http://www.oscov.asn.au/articles2/respun.htm|publisher=Orchid Societies Council of Victoria Inc.|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CANBR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flower resupination|url=http://keys.trin.org.au/key-server/data/08090a09-0d0e-410b-860c-020705070e0e/media/Html/characters/Flower_resupination.htm|publisher=Australian Tropical Rainforest Orchids|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Charles Darwin]] did not use the term "resupination", he suggested that having the labellum on the lower part of the flower aids [[pollination]] by providing a landing place for visiting insects. However, the [[South America]]n bee ''[[Euglossa cordata]]'' pollinates both resupinate and non-resupinate orchid flowers. It has also been suggested that resupination exposes the labellum to sunlight, emphasizing patterns and nectar guides and increases the temperature and thus the vaporisation of floral scents.&lt;ref name="Arditti"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arditti|first1=Joseph|title=Resupination|journal=Lankesteriana|date=2003|volume=3|issue=2|pages=95–96|doi=10.15517/lank.v3i2.23025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Australian genera with non-resupinate flowers are ''[[Prasophyllum]]'', ''[[Cryptostylis]]'' and ''[[Caleana]]''.&lt;ref name="Milligan" /&gt;

The '''Royal Pioneer Corps''' was a [[British Army]] combatant corps used for light engineering tasks. It was formed in 1939 and amalgamated into the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] in 1993. Pioneer units performed a wide variety of tasks in all theatres of war, including stretcher-bearing, handling all types of stores, laying prefabricated track on beaches, and effecting various logistical operations. Under [[Royal Engineers]] supervision, they constructed airfields and roads and erected bridges; they constructed the [[Mulberry Harbour]] and laid the [[Operation Pluto|Pipe Line Under the Ocean]] (PLUTO).

==History==
The first record of [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]s in a British army goes back to 1346 at [[Pale of Calais|Calais]] where the pay and muster rolls of the English Garrison show pay records for pioneers.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main1.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=1|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, there was a designated pioneer for each [[Company (military unit)|company]] in a [[regiment]], when, about 1750, it was proposed that a Corps of Pioneers be formed. Nothing came of this for nearly one hundred years, until the '''Army Works Corps''' was established during the [[Crimean War]] in 1854.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The '''Labour Corps''' was formed in 1917 during [[World War I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|title=The Labour Corps of 1917-1918|url=http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-labour-corps-of-1917-1918/|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employed 325,000 British troops, 98,000 Chinese, 10,000 Africans and at least 300,000 other labourers.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In September 1939, a number of infantry and cavalry reservists were formed into Works Labour Companies, which were soon made the '''Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps''' (AMPC); a Labour Directorate was created to control all labour force matters. A large number of Pioneers served in France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (WWII)|British Expeditionary Force]]. During the [[Battle of France]], an infantry [[brigade]] was improvised from several AMPC Companies under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel J. B. H. Diggle. Known as "Digforce", the brigade became part of [[Beauman Division]] and fought in defence of the [[Andelle]] and [[Béthune (river)|Béthune]] rivers on 8 June 1940 against the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th]] and [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]]s. Digforce brigade and thousands of other BEF Pioneers were evacuated to England in [[Operation Ariel]].&lt;ref&gt;*Ellis, L. F. (1954) [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/index.html#contents The War in France and Flanders 1939–1940]. J. R. M. Butler (ed.). HMSO. London p.280-282&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown number of AMPC troops were killed when the [[HMT Lancastria|HMT ''Lancastria'']] was sunk off [[St Nazaire]] on 17 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_lancastria.htm|title=The Pioneer: The Lancastria Story|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 1940, the name AMPC was changed to '''Pioneer Corps'''.&lt;ref name=history2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main2.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=2|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1941, [[James Scully (GC)|James Scully]] became the only member of the Pioneer Corps to be awarded the [[George Cross]].

A total of 23 pioneer companies took part in the [[Normandy landings]].&lt;ref name=history3&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main3.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=3|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Alexander Baron]] served in one of these Beach Groups and later included some of his experiences in his novels ''From the City From the Plough'' and ''The Human Kind''. He also wrote a radio play about the experience of being stranded on a craft attempting to land supplies on the beaches of [[Normandy]]. Nos. 85 and 149 Companies, Pioneer Corps served with the [[6th Beach Group]] assisting the units landing on [[Sword Beach]] on D Day, 6 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/invisible-ink-no-83--alexander-baron-2302756.html|title=Invisible Ink: No 83 - Alexander Baron|publisher=The Independent|date=26 June 2011|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 1946, in recognition of their performance during the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[King George VI]] decreed that the Pioneer Corps should have the distinction "Royal" added to its title.&lt;ref name=history3/&gt;

In April 1993, following the [[Options for Change]] review, the Royal Pioneer Corps was joined with the [[Royal Corps of Transport]], the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], the [[Army Catering Corps]], and the Postal and Courier Service of the [[Royal Engineers]] to form the [[Royal Logistic Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Royal Logistic Corps and Forming Corps|url=http://www.rlcmuseum.co.uk/docs/history.html|publisher=[[The Royal Logistic Corps Museum]]|accessdate=13 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814155505/http://rlcmuseum.co.uk/docs/history.html|archivedate=14 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
In the early part of World War II, the Pioneer Corps was apparently the only British military unit in which [[enemy alien]]s could serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1941/jul/22/aliens-in-the-pioneer-corps|title=House of Lords Questions - Aliens in the Pioneer Corps|website=Hansard|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=22 July 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of German and Austrian nationals joined the Pioneer Corps to assist Allied war efforts and the liberation of their home countries. They typically were Jews and political opponents of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Regime]] who had fled to Britain, including film production designer [[Ken Adam]], writer [[George Clare (writer)|George Clare]], and publisher [[Robert Maxwell]].

Later, some members of Pioneer Corps—often dubbed "The King's Most Loyal Enemy Aliens"—transferred to serve in various fighting units. Some were recruited by the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) to serve as secret agents and were parachuted behind enemy lines.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Colin MacGregor Stevens with Major George Bryant (aka George Breuer)&lt;/ref&gt;

Serving as a German or Austrian national in the British forces was especially dangerous because, in case of being taken captive, there was a high probability of being executed as a traitor by the Germans. Still, the number of German-born Jews joining the British forces was exceptionally high; by the end of the war, one in seven Jewish refugees from Germany had joined the British forces. Their knowledge of the German language and customs proved particularly useful; many served in the administration of the British occupation army in Germany and Austria after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natgeotv.com/ca/churchills-german-army National Geographic documentary ''Churchill's German Army'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It has wrongly been claimed at various times and in various places that British [[conscientious objector]]s were sometimes ordered into the Pioneer Corps by Conscientious Objection Tribunals in the [[Second World War]]; the error may have arisen from a misunderstanding of a misleadingly drafted question in the House of Lords on 22 July 1941 and a reply by Lord Croft, Joint Under-Secretary of State for War, that was not expressed with the clarity that might have been expected. The War Office was asked about "British conscientious objectors who have been ordered by the Tribunals to undertake service with the Pioneer Corps", whereas the Tribunals had no power to make such an order; the only power they had relating to conscientious objectors in the armed forces was to order non-combatant military service, meaning call-up in most cases to the [[Non-Combatant Corps]], or occasionally to the Royal Army Medical Corps; the Pioneer Corps, as a combatant unit, was by definition excluded. In his reply, Lord Croft referred to "conscientious objectors ordered for attachment to the Pioneer Corps", only obliquely correcting the language of the question. To spell it out in full, what Lord Croft meant was "conscientious objectors ordered by the Tribunals to serve in the Non-Combatant Corps and then, as members of the NCC, attached at certain times and for certain purposes to the Pioneer Corps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Lords question: conscientious objectors|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1941/jul/22/conscientious-objectors|website=Hansard|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=22 July 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''skeleton'''  is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an [[organism]]. There are several different skeletal types: the [[exoskeleton]], which is the stable outer shell of an organism, the [[endoskeleton]], which forms the support structure inside the body, the [[hydroskeleton]], and the [[cytoskeleton]]. The term comes {{ety|el|σκελετός (skeletós)|dried up}}.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English 2nd edition 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of skeletons==
There are two major types of skeletons: solid and fluid. Solid skeletons can be internal, called an [[endoskeleton]], or external, called an [[exoskeleton]], and may be further classified as '''pliant''' (elastic/movable) or '''rigid''' (hard/non-movable).&lt;ref name="Barnes et al"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Edward E.|last2=Fox|first2=Richard S.|last3=Barnes|first3=Robert D.|title=Invertebrate zoology : a functional evolutionary approach|date=2003|publisher=Thomson, Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=0-03-025982-7|edition=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluid skeletons are always internal.

===Exoskeleton===
{{Main article|Exoskeleton}}
[[Image:Hym-myrmicinae.gif|thumb|[[Exoskeleton]] of an [[ant]]]]

[[Exoskeleton]]s are external, and are found in many [[invertebrate]]s; they enclose and protect the soft tissues and organs of the body. Some kinds of exoskeletons undergo periodic [[moult]]ing as the animal grows, as is the case in many [[arthropod]]s including insects and [[crustacean]]s.

The exoskeleton of insects is not only a form of protection, but also serves as a surface for muscle attachment, as a watertight protection against drying, and as a sense organ to interact with the environment. The [[mollusc shell|shell]] of mollusks also performs all of the same functions, except that in most cases it does not contain sense organs.

An external skeleton can be quite heavy in relation to the overall mass of an animal, so on land, organisms that have an exoskeleton are mostly relatively small. Somewhat larger aquatic animals can support an exoskeleton because weight is less of a consideration underwater. The [[southern giant clam]], a species of extremely large saltwater clam in the Pacific Ocean, has a shell that is massive in both size and weight. ''[[Syrinx aruanus]]'' is a species of sea snail with a very large shell.

===Endoskeleton===
{{Main article|Endoskeleton}}
[[Image:Eptesicus fuscus skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[Endoskeleton]] of a [[bat]].]]
[[Image:Beaver skeleton.jpg|thumb|A [[beaver]] skeleton on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma.]]

The [[endoskeleton]] is the internal support structure of an animal, composed of [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]] and is typical of [[vertebrate]]s. Endoskeletons vary in complexity from functioning purely for support (as in the case of [[Porifera|sponges]]), to serving as an attachment site for muscles and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesodermal]] tissue. Such a skeleton is present in [[echinoderms]] and [[chordate]]s.

===Pliant skeletons===

Pliant skeletons are capable of movement; thus, when [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] is applied to the skeletal structure, it deforms and then reverts to its original shape. This skeletal structure is used in some invertebrates, for instance in the hinge of [[bivalve shell]]s or the [[mesoglea]] of [[cnidarians]] such as [[jellyfish]]. Pliant skeletons are beneficial because only [[muscle]] contractions are needed to bend the skeleton; upon muscle relaxation, the skeleton will return to its original shape. [[Cartilage]] is one material that a pliant skeleton may be composed of, but most pliant skeletons are formed from a mixture of [[proteins]], [[polysaccharides]], and water.&lt;ref name="Barnes et al" /&gt; For additional structure or protection, pliant skeletons may be supported by rigid skeletons. Organisms that have pliant skeletons typically live in water, which supports body structure in the absence of a rigid skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pechenik|first1=Jan A.|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|date=2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352418-4|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rigid skeletons===

Rigid skeletons are not capable of movement when stressed, creating a strong support system most common in [[terrestrial animals]]. Such a skeleton type used by animals that live in water are more for protection (such as [[barnacle]] and [[snail]] shells) or for fast-moving animals that require additional support of musculature needed for swimming through water. Rigid skeletons are formed from materials including [[chitin]] (in arthropods), [[calcium]] compounds such as [[calcium carbonate]] (in [[stony coral]]s and [[mollusk]]s) and [[silicate]] (for [[diatom]]s and [[radiolarian]]s).

===Cytoskeleton===
{{Main article|Cytoskeleton}}
The cytoskeleton (gr. ''kytos'' = cell) is used to stabilize and preserve the form of the cells. It is a dynamic structure that maintains cell shape, protects the cell, enables cellular motion (using structures such as [[flagella]], [[cilia]] and [[lamellipodia]]), and plays important roles in both intracellular transport (the movement of [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s and [[organelle]]s, for example) and cellular division.

===Fluid skeletons===

==== Hydrostatic skeleton (hydroskeleton) ====
{{Main article|Hydrostatic skeleton}}
A hydrostatic skeleton is a semi-rigid, soft tissue structure filled with liquid under pressure, surrounded by muscles. Longitudinal and circular muscles around their body sectors allow movement by alternate lengthening and contractions along their lengths. A common example of this is the [[earthworm]].

==Organisms with skeletons==

===Invertebrates===
The endoskeletons of echinoderms and some other soft-bodied [[invertebrate]]s such as [[jellyfish]] and [[earthworms]] are also termed [[hydrostatic skeleton|hydrostatic]]; a body cavity the [[coelom]] is filled with [[coelom#fluid|coelomic fluid]] and the pressure from this fluid acts together with the surrounding muscles to change the organism's shape and produce movement.

====Sponges====
The skeleton of [[sponge]]s consists of microscopic [[calcareous]] or [[silicious]] [[Sponge spicule|spicule]]s. The [[demosponge]]s include 90% of all species of [[sponge]]s. Their "skeletons" are made of [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s consisting of fibers of the protein [[spongin]], the mineral [[silica]], or both. Where spicules of silica are present, they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar [[Hexactinellida|glass sponges]].&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 105–106|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Echinoderms====
The skeleton of the [[echinoderm]]s, which include, among other things, the [[starfish]], is composed of [[calcite]] and a small amount of [[magnesium oxide]]. It lies below the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] in the [[mesoderm]] and is within cell clusters of frame-forming cells. This structure formed is porous and therefore firm and at the same time light. It coalesces into small [[calcareous]] ossicles (bony plates), which can grow in all directions and thus can replace the loss of a body part. Connected by joints, the individual skeletal parts can be moved by the muscles.

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|300px| '''Pithecometra''':  From [[Thomas Huxley]]'s 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', the compared skeletons of apes to humans.]]
In most vertebrates, the main skeletal component is referred to as [[bone]]. These bones compose a unique skeletal system for each type of animal. Another important component is cartilage which in mammals is found mainly in the joint areas. In other animals, such as the cartilaginous fishes, which include the [[shark]]s, the skeleton is composed entirely of cartilage. The [[segmentation (biology)|segmental]] pattern of the skeleton is present in all vertebrates (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians) with basic units being repeated. This segmental pattern is particularly evident in the vertebral column and the ribcage.

Bones in addition to supporting the body also serve, at the cellular level, as calcium and phosphate storage.

====Fish====
{{Main article|Fish anatomy}}

The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage as in the ([[Chondrichthyes]]), or bones as in the ([[Osteichthyes]]). The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles. They are supported only by the muscles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fish fin|fins]], are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the caudal fin (tail fin), have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.

====Birds====
{{Main article|Bird anatomy}}

The bird skeleton is highly adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight, yet still strong enough to withstand the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single [[ossification]]s, such as the [[pygostyle]]. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true [[jaw]], instead having evolved a [[beak]], which is far more lightweight. The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an [[egg tooth]], which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg.

====Marine mammals====
[[File:Zalophus californianus 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Californian sea lion]]]]
To facilitate the movement of [[marine mammal]]s in water, the hind legs were either lost altogether, as in the whales and [[manatee]]s, or united in a single [[fish fin|tail fin]] as in the [[pinnipeds]] (seals). In the whale, the [[cervical vertebrae]] are typically fused, an adaptation trading flexibility for stability during swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |title=Beluga Whale |publisher=Yellowmagpie.com |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521114304/http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |title=About Whales |publisher=Whalesalive.org.au |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812000655/http://whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humans====
{{Main article|Human skeleton}}
[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]

The human skeleton consists of both fused and individual bones supported and supplemented by [[ligament]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[muscle]]s and [[cartilage]]. It serves as a scaffold which supports organs, anchors muscles, and protects organs such as the brain, [[human lung|lung]]s, [[human heart|heart]] and [[spinal cord]]. Although the teeth do not consist of tissue commonly found in bones, the teeth are usually considered as members of the skeletal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/22537-skeletal-system.html|title=Skeletal System: Facts, Function &amp; Diseases|work=Live Science|access-date=7 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123921/http://www.livescience.com/22537-skeletal-system.html|archivedate=7 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The biggest bone in the body is the [[femur]] in the upper leg, and the smallest is the [[stapes]] bone in the [[middle ear]]. In an adult, the skeleton comprises around 14% of the total body weight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Allometric Relationship of Skeleton Weight to Body Weight in Teleost Fishes: A Preliminary Comparison with Birds and Mammals|author1=William W. Reynolds  |author2=William J. Karlotski |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Copeia|year=1977|pages=160–163|doi=10.2307/1443520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and half of this weight is water.

Fused bones include those of the [[Human pelvis|pelvis]] and the [[Human skull|cranium]]. Not all bones are interconnected directly: There are three bones in each [[middle ear]] called the [[ossicles]] that articulate only with each other. The [[hyoid bone]], which is located in the neck and serves as the point of attachment for the [[tongue]], does not articulate with any other bones in the body, being supported by muscles and ligaments.

There are 206 bones in the adult human skeleton, although this number depends on whether the pelvic bones (the [[hip bone]]s on each side) are counted as one or three bones on each side (ilium, ischium, and pubis), whether the coccyx or tail bone is counted as one or four separate bones, and does not count the variable [[wormian bone]]s between skull sutures. Similarly, the sacrum is usually counted as a single bone, rather than five fused vertebrae. There is also a variable number of small sesamoid bones, commonly found in tendons. The patella or kneecap on each side is an example of a larger sesamoid bone. The patellae are counted in the total, as they are constant. The number of bones varies between individuals and with age – newborn babies have over 270 bones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human skeleton takes 20 years before it is fully developed. In many animals, the skeleton bones contain [[Bone marrow|marrow]], which produces blood cells.

There exist several general differences between the male and female skeletons. The male skeleton, for example, is generally larger and heavier than the female skeleton. In the female skeleton, the bones of the skull are generally less angular. The female skeleton also has wider and shorter breastbone and slimmer wrists. There exist significant differences between the male and female pelvis which are related to the female's pregnancy and childbirth capabilities. The female pelvis is wider and shallower than the male pelvis. Female pelvises also have an enlarged pelvic outlet and a wider and more circular pelvic inlet. The angle between the pubic bones is known to be sharper in males, which results in a more circular, narrower, and near heart-shaped pelvis.&lt;ref name="Balaban-61"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Handy Anatomy Answer Book | first = Naomi| last = Balaban| pages = 61 | year = 2008 | publisher = Visible Ink Press| isbn = 978-1-57859-190-9

==Bones and cartilage==

===Bone===
{{Main article|Bone}}

Bones are rigid [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] that form part of the [[endoskeleton]] of [[vertebrate]]s. They function to move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, produce [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cell]]s and store minerals. Bone tissue is a type of dense [[connective tissue]]. Bones have a variety of shapes with a complex internal and external structure they are also lightweight, yet strong and hard. One of the types of tissue that makes up bone tissue is [[mineralized tissue]] and this 
gives it rigidity and a [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb-like]] three-dimensional internal structure. Other types of tissue found in bones include [[bone marrow|marrow]], [[endosteum]] and [[periosteum]], [[nerve]]s, [[blood vessel]]s and [[cartilage]]. There are 206 bones in the adult human body&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Anatomy and Biology of the Human Skeleton |author1=Steele, D. Gentry |author2=Claud A.

Appleton-Century | page = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartilage===
{{Main article|Cartilage}}

During [[embryogenesis]] the precursor to bone development is cartilage. Much of this substance is then replaced by bone during the second and third trimester, after the flesh such as muscle has formed around it; forming the skeleton. Cartilage is a stiff and inflexible [[connective tissue]] found in many areas in the bodies of humans and other animals, including the joints between bones, the [[rib cage]], the ear, the nose, the elbow, the knee, the ankle, the [[bronchial tubes]] and the [[intervertebral disc]]s. It is not as hard and rigid as bone but is stiffer and less flexible than [[muscle]].

Cartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a large amount of [[extracellular matrix]] composed of Type II [[collagen]] (except Fibrocartilage which also contains type I collagen) fibers, abundant [[ground substance]] rich in [[proteoglycan]], and [[elastin]] fibers. Cartilage is classified in three types, [[elastic cartilage]], [[hyaline cartilage]] and [[fibrocartilage]], which differ in the relative amounts of these three main components.

Unlike other connective tissues, cartilage does not contain blood vessels. The chondrocytes are supplied by diffusion, helped by the pumping action generated by compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage. Thus, compared to other connective tissues, cartilage grows and repairs more slowly.

== In popular culture ==
In [[Western culture]], the skeleton is oftentimes seen as a fearful [[symbols of death|symbol of death]] and the [[paranormal]].  It is a popular motif in the holiday [[Halloween]], as well as [[Day of the Dead]].

'''Skin''' is the soft outer tissue covering of [[vertebrate]]s.

Other [[cuticle|animal coverings]], such as the [[arthropod exoskeleton]], have different [[cellular differentiation|developmental origin]], structure and [[chemical composition]]. The adjective '''cutaneous''' means "of the skin" (from Latin ''cutis'', skin). In [[mammal]]s, the skin is an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] of the [[integumentary system]] made up of multiple layers of [[ectodermal]] [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], and guards the underlying [[muscle]]s, [[bone]]s, [[ligament]]s and [[organ (anatomy)|internal organ]]s. Skin of a different nature exists in [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[bird]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alibardi L | year = 2003 | title = Adaptation to the land: The skin of reptiles in comparison to that of amphibians and endotherm amniotes | url = | journal = J Exp Zoolog B Mol Dev Evol. | volume = 298 | issue = 1| pages = 12–41 | doi = 10.1002/jez.b.24 | pmid = 12949767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All mammals have some hair on their skin, even [[marine mammal]]s like [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s which appear to be hairless.
The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the [[human body|body]] against [[pathogen]]s&lt;ref name="Proksch"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Proksch E, Brandner JM, Jensen JM | year = 2008 | title = The skin: an indispensable barrier | journal = Exp Dermatol | volume = 17 | issue = 12| pages = 1063–72 | pmid = 19043850 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0625.2008.00786.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and excessive water loss.&lt;ref name="Madison"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Madison KC | year = 2003 | title = Barrier function of the skin: "la raison d'être" of the epidermis | url = http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v121/n2/pdf/5601872a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J Invest Dermatol | volume = 121 | issue = 2| pages = 231–41 | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12359.x | pmid = 12880413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its other functions are [[thermal insulation|insulation]], [[temperature]] regulation, sensation, and the production of [[vitamin D]] folates.  Severely damaged skin may heal by forming [[scar|scar tissue]]. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around  the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as "crows feet" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4&amp;nbsp;mm thick and is the thickest skin on the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of [[estrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/andchien/PDFs/HuBio/estrogen.pdf|journal=Experimental Dermatology|title=The biological actions of estrogen in skin|author=Thornton MJ|year=2002|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0625.2002.110601.x|pmid=12473056|volume=11|issue=6|pages=487–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The American Journal of Pathology|title=Topical Estrogen Accelerates Cutaneous Wound Healing in Aged Humans Associated with an Altered Inflammatory Response|author1=Gillian S.

On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create [[leather]]. [[Reptile]]s and [[fish]] have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and [[bird]]s have hard feathers, all made of tough β-[[keratin]]s. [[Amphibian]] skin is not a strong barrier, especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to [[osmosis]] and diffusive forces. For example, a [[frog]] sitting in an [[anesthetic]] solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin.  Amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=BT|title=The natural history of amphibian skin secretions, their normal functioning and potential medical applications.|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=651&amp;fileId=S0006323197005045|journal=Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|year=1997|volume=72|issue=3|pages=365–379|pmid=9336100|doi=10.1017/s0006323197005045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammalian skin is composed of two primary layers:
*the ''[[epidermis]]'', which provides waterproofing and serves as a barrier to infection; and
*the ''[[dermis]]'', which serves as a location for the [[appendages]] of skin;

===Epidermis===
{{main|Epidermis}}

The epidermis is composed of the outermost layers of the skin. It forms a protective barrier over the body's surface, responsible for keeping water in the body and preventing [[pathogens]] from entering, and is a stratified squamous [[epithelium]],&lt;ref name="Rooks"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of [[cell division|proliferating]] basal and [[cell differentiation|differentiated]] suprabasal [[keratinocyte]]s.

[[Keratinocyte]]s are the major [[cell (biology)|cells]], constituting 95% of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]],&lt;ref name="Rooks" /&gt; while [[Merkel cell]]s,  [[melanocyte]]s and [[Langerhans cell]]s are also present. The [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] can be further subdivided into the following ''strata'' or layers (beginning with the outermost layer):&lt;ref name="ageingskin"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-1-structure-of-skin-and-introduction/ The Ageing Skin – Structure]. pharmaxchange.info.

*[[Stratum corneum]]
*[[Stratum lucidum]] (only in [[Hand#Human anatomy|palms]] and [[sole (foot)|soles]])
*[[Stratum granulosum]]
*[[Stratum spinosum]]
*[[Stratum germinativum]] (also called the [[stratum basale]])
[[Keratinocyte]]s in the [[stratum basale]] proliferate through [[mitosis]] and the daughter [[cell (biology)|cells]] move up the strata changing shape and composition as they undergo multiple stages of [[cell differentiation]] to eventually become anucleated. During that process, [[keratinocyte]]s will become highly organized, forming [[cell junction|cellular junctions]] ([[desmosomes]]) between each other and secreting [[keratin]] [[proteins]] and [[lipids]] which contribute to the formation of an [[extracellular matrix]] and provide mechanical [[strength of materials|strength]] to the skin.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=19333614 | year=2009 | last1=Breitkreutz | first1=D | last2=Mirancea | first2=N | last3=Nischt | first3=R | title=Basement membranes in skin: Unique matrix structures with diverse functions? | volume=132 | issue=1 | pages=1–10 | doi=10.1007/s00418-009-0586-0 | journal=Histochemistry and Cell Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keratinocyte]]s from the [[stratum corneum]] are eventually shed from the surface ([[desquamation]]).

The [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] contains no [[blood vessel]]s, and [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the deepest layers are nourished by diffusion from [[blood]] [[capillaries]] extending to the upper layers of the [[dermis]].

===Basement membrane===
{{main|Basement membrane}}

The [[epidermis]] and [[dermis]] are separated by a thin sheet of [[fibers]] called the [[basement membrane]], which is made through the action of both [[tissue (biology)|tissues]].
The basement membrane controls the traffic of the [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[molecules]] between the dermis and epidermis but also serves, through the binding of a variety of [[cytokine]]s and [[growth factors]], as a reservoir for their controlled release during [[physiological]] remodeling or [[repair]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=16064139 | year=2005 | last1=Iozzo | first1=RV | title=Basement membrane proteoglycans: From cellar to ceiling | volume=6 | issue=8 | pages=646–56 | doi=10.1038/nrm1702 | journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dermis===
{{main|Dermis}}

The '''dermis''' is the layer of skin beneath the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] that consists of [[connective tissue]] and cushions the body from [[stress (biology)|stress]] and strain.
The [[dermis]] provides tensile [[strength of materials|strength]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] to the skin through an [[extracellular matrix]] composed of [[collagen fibrils]], [[microfibrils]], and [[elastic fibers]], embedded in [[hyaluronan]] and [[proteoglycan]]s.&lt;ref name="Pmid" /&gt; Skin proteoglycans  are varied and have very specific locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith MM, Melrose J | title = Proteoglycans in normal and healing skin | journal = Adv. Wound Care | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 152–73 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25785238 | doi = 10.1089/wound.2013.0464 | pmc=4352701}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[hyaluronan]], [[versican]] and [[decorin]] are present throughout the [[dermis]] and [[epidermis]] [[extracellular matrix]], whereas [[biglycan]] and [[perlecan]] are only found in the [[epidermis]].

It harbors many [[mechanoreceptor]]s (nerve endings) that provide the sense of [[touch]] and [[heat]] through [[nociceptor]]s and [[thermoreceptor]]s. It also contains the [[hair follicle]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[apocrine glands]], [[lymphatic vessel]]s and [[blood vessel]]s. The [[blood vessel]]s in the [[dermis]] provide nourishment and waste removal from its own [[cell (biology)|cells]] as well as for the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].

The [[dermis]] is tightly connected to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] through a [[basement membrane]] and is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], called the ''papillary region'', and a deep thicker area known as the ''reticular region''.

====Papillary region====
The papillary region is composed of loose [[areolar connective tissue]].This is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'' that extend toward the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. The papillae provide the [[dermis]] with a "bumpy" surface that interdigitates with the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.

====Reticular region====
The reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular [[connective tissue]], and receives its name from the dense concentration of [[collagen]]ous, [[Elastic fibers|elastic]], and [[Reticular fiber|reticular]] fibers that weave throughout it. These [[protein]] fibers give the [[dermis]] its properties of [[strength of materials|strength]], [[extensibility]], and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].
Also located within the reticular region are the [[roots of the hair]], [[sweat gland]]s, [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous glands]], [[Cutaneous receptor|receptors]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], and [[blood vessel]]s.

===Subcutaneous tissue===
{{main|Subcutaneous tissue}}

The [[subcutaneous tissue]] (also hypodermis)  is not part of the skin, and lies below the [[dermis]]. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying [[bone]] and [[muscle]] as well as supplying it with [[blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s. It consists of loose [[connective tissue]] and [[elastin]]. The main [[cell (biology)|cell]] types are [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[adipocyte]]s (the subcutaneous tissue contains 50% of [[body fat]]). [[Fat]] serves as padding and insulation for the body.

[[Microorganisms]] like ''[[Staphylococcus]] epidermidis'' colonize the skin surface. The density of [[skin flora]] depends on region of the skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from [[bacteria]] residing in the deeper areas of the [[hair follicle]], [[gastrointestinal tract|gut]] and [[urogenital]] openings.

==Structure in Fish, Amphibians, Birds, and Reptiles==

===Fish===
{{see also|Fish scales}}

The epidermis of [[fish]] and of most [[amphibian]]s consists entirely of live [[cell (biology)|cells]], with only minimal quantities of [[keratin]] in the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of the superficial layer. It is generally permeable, and in the case of many [[amphibians]], may actually be a major respiratory organ. The [[dermis]] of [[bony fish]] typically contains relatively little of the [[connective tissue]] found in [[tetrapod]]s. Instead, in most species, it is largely replaced by solid, protective bony [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s. Apart from some particularly large dermal bones that form parts of the [[skull]], these [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s are lost in [[tetrapods]], although many [[reptile]]s do have [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s of a different kind, as do [[pangolin]]s. [[Cartilaginous fish]] have numerous tooth-like [[Dermal denticle|denticle]]s embedded in their skin, in place of true [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s.

[[Sweat gland]]s and [[sebaceous gland]]s are both unique to [[mammals]], but other types of skin gland are found in other [[vertebrates]]. [[Fish]] typically have a numerous individual [[mucus]]-secreting skin [[cell (biology)|cells]] that aid in insulation and protection, but may also have [[poison]] [[glands]], [[photophore]]s, or [[cell (biology)|cells]] that produce a more watery, [[serous]] fluid. In [[amphibians]], the [[mucus]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] are gathered together to form sac-like [[glands]]. Most living [[amphibians]] also possess ''granular [[glands]]'' in the skin, that secrete irritating or toxic compounds.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

Although [[melanin]] is found in the skin of many species, in the [[reptile]]s, the [[amphibians]], and [[fish]], the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is often relatively colourless. Instead, the colour of the skin is largely due to [[chromatophore]]s in the [[dermis]], which, in addition to [[melanin]], may contain [[guanine]] or [[carotenoid]] [[pigments]]. Many species, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[flounder]]s may be able to change the colour of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their [[chromatophores]].&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

=== Amphibians ===
''See also: [[amphibian]]s''

==== Overview ====
Amphibians possess two types of [[gland]]s, [[Mucous gland|mucous]] and granular (serous). Both of these glands are part of the [[integument]] and thus considered [[cutaneous]]. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via [[keratinocyte]]s and passes through to the surface of the [[Epidermis|epidermal]] or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030096299598515I|title=Cutaneous granular glands and amphibian venoms - ScienceDirect|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(95)98515-I|volume=111|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|pages=1–29 | last1 = Toledo | first1 = R.C.|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Granular Glands ====
Granular glands can be identified as [[venom]]ous and often differ in the type of toxin as well as the concentrations of secretions across various orders and species within the amphibians. They are located in clusters differing in concentration depending on [[amphibian]] taxa. The toxins can be fatal to most vertebrates or have no effect against others. These glands are alveolar meaning they structurally have little sacs in which venom is produced and held before it is secreted upon defensive behaviors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Structurally, the ducts of the granular gland initially maintain a cylindrical shape. However, when the ducts become mature and full of toxic fluid, the base of the ducts become swollen due to the pressure from the inside. This causes the epidermal layer to form a pit like opening on the surface of the duct in which the inner fluid will be secreted in an upwards fashion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UklQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA635&amp;lpg=PA635&amp;dq=necturus+integument+google+book#v=onepage&amp;q=necturus%20integument%20google%20book&amp;f=false|title=Journal of Morphology|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology .|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intercalary region of granular glands are more developed and mature in comparison with mucous glands. This region resides as a ring of cells surrounding the basal portion of the duct which are argued to have an [[ectoderm]]al muscular nature due to their influence over the lumen (space inside the tube) of the duct with dilation and constriction functions during secretions. The cells are found radially around the duct and provide a distinct attachment site for muscle fibers around the gland's body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The gland alveolus is a sac that is divided into three specific regions/layers. The outer layer or tunica fibrosa is composed of densely packed connective-tissue which connects with fibers from the spongy intermediate layer where elastic fibers as well as nerves reside. The nerves send signals to the muscles as well as the epithelial layers. Lastly, the epithelium or tunica propria encloses the gland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Mucous Glands ====
Mucous glands are non-venomous and offer a different functionality for amphibians than granular. Mucous glands cover the entire surface area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ducts of the mucous gland appear as cylindrical vertical tubes which break through the epidermal layer to the surface of the skin. The cells lining the inside of the ducts are oriented with their longitudinal axis forming 90 degree angles surrounding the duct in a helical fashion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Intercalary cells react identically to those of granular glands but on a smaller scale. Among the amphibians, there are taxa which contain a modified intercalary region (depending on the function of the glands), yet the majority share the same structure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The alveolor of mucous glands are much more simple and only consist of an epithelium layer as well as connective tissue which forms a cover over the gland. This gland lacks a tunica propria and appears to have delicate and intricate fibers which pass over the gland's muscle and epithelial layers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Birds and reptiles===
{{Main|Reptile scales}}
The [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s is closer to that of [[mammals]], with a layer of dead keratin-filled [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the surface, to help reduce [[water]] loss. A similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial [[amphibians]] such as [[toad]]s. However, in all of these [[animals]] there is no clear [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] into distinct layers, as occurs in [[human]]s, with the change in [[cell (biology)|cell]] type being relatively gradual. The [[mammal]]ian [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] always possesses at least a [[stratum germinativum]] and [[stratum corneum]], but the other intermediate layers found in [[human]]s are not always distinguishable.
[[Hair]] is a distinctive feature of [[mammal]]ian skin, while [[feather]]s are (at least among living species) similarly unique to [[bird]]s.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 129–145|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bird]]s and [[reptile]]s have relatively few skin [[gland]]s, although there may be a few structures for specific purposes, such as [[pheromone]]-secreting [[cell (biology)|cells]] in some [[reptile]]s, or the [[uropygial gland]] of most [[bird]]s.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

==Development==
{{Cn span|Cutaneous structures arise from the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and include a variety of features such as hair, feathers, claws and nails. During embryogenesis, the epidermis splits into two layers: the periderm (which is lost) and the [[Stratum germinativum|basal layer]].  The basal layer is a [[stem cell]] layer and through asymmetrical divisions, becomes the source of skin cells throughout life. It is maintained as a stem cell layer through an [[autocrine]] signal, [[Transforming growth factor|TGF-a]], and through [[paracrine]] signal FGF7 aka [[keratinocyte growth factor]] (KGF) produced by the dermis below the basal cells. In mice, over-expression of these factors leads to an overproduction of granule cells and thick skin.|date=December 2017}}

{{Cn span|Hair and feathers are formed in a regular pattern and it is believed to be the result of a reaction-diffusion system. This [[reaction-diffusion system]] combines an activator, [[Sonic hedgehog]], with an inhibitor, BMP4 or BMP2, to form clusters of cells in a regular pattern. Sonic hedgehog-expressing epidermal cells induce the condensation of cells in the mesoderm. The clusters of mesodermal cells signal back to the epidermis to form the appropriate structure for that position. BMP signals from the epidermis inhibit the formation of placodes in nearby ectoderm.|date=December 2017}}

{{Cn span|It is believed that the mesoderm defines the pattern. The epidermis instructs the mesodermal cells to condense and then the mesoderm instructs the epidermis of what structure to make through a series of reciprocal inductions. Transplantation experiments involving frog and newt epidermis indicated that the mesodermal signals are conserved between species but the epidermal response is species-specific meaning that the mesoderm instructs the epidermis of its position and the epidermis uses this information to make a specific structure.|date=December 2017}}

==Functions==
Skin performs the following functions:

#Protection: an anatomical barrier from [[pathogens]] and damage between the internal and external  [[natural environment|environment]] in bodily defense. (See [[Skin absorption]].) [[Langerhans cell]]s in the skin are part of the [[adaptive immune system]].&lt;ref name="Proksch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madison"/&gt;
#[[Wikt:sensation|Sensation]]: contains a variety of [[nerve endings]] that jump to [[thermoreceptor|heat and cold]], [[touch]], [[pressure]], [[vibration]], and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[injury]] (see [[somatosensory system]] and [[haptic perception]]).
#Thermoregulation: [[eccrine]] ([[sweat]]) glands and dilated blood vessels (increased superficial [[perfusion]]) aid heat loss, while constricted [[blood vessel|vessels]] greatly reduce cutaneous [[blood flow]] and conserve [[heat]]. [[Erector pili muscle]]s in [[mammals]] adjust the angle of [[hair]] shafts to change the degree of insulation provided by hair or [[fur]].
#Control of [[evaporation]]: the skin provides a relatively dry and semi-impermeable barrier to reduce fluid loss.&lt;ref name="Madison"/&gt;
#Storage and [[biosynthesis|synthesis]]: acts as a storage center for [[lipid]]s and [[water]]
#[[Skin absorption|Absorption through the skin]]: [[Oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] can diffuse into the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] in small amounts; some [[animal]]s use their skin as their sole [[respiration organ]] (in [[human]]s, the [[cell (biology)|cells]] comprising the outermost 0.25–0.40&amp;nbsp;mm of the skin are "almost exclusively supplied by external [[oxygen]]", although the "contribution to total [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] is negligible")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stücker M, Struk A, Altmeyer P, Herde M, Baumgärtl H, Lübbers DW | title = The cutaneous uptake of atmospheric oxygen contributes significantly to the oxygen supply of human dermis and epidermis | journal = J. Physiol. | volume = 538 | issue = 3 | pages = 985–994 | year = 2002 | pmid =     11826181 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013067 | pmc=2290093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Topical medication|medications are absorbed through the skin]].
#[[Water]] resistance: The skin acts as a [[water]] resistant barrier so essential [[nutrients]] aren't washed out of the body. The nutrients and oils that help hydrate the skin are covered by the most outer skin layer, the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. This is helped in part by the sebaceous glands that release [[sebum]], an oily liquid. Water itself will not cause the elimination of oils on the skin, because the oils residing in our dermis flow and would be affected by water without the epidermis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCracken|first=Thomas|title=New Atlas of Human Anatomy|year=2000|publisher=Metro Books|location=China|isbn=978-1-58663-097-3|pages=1–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Camouflage]], whether the skin is naked or covered in fur, scales, or feathers, skin structures provide protective coloration and patterns that help to conceal animals from predators or prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Camouflage |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/camouflage/ |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=27 February 2017|date=2011-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanics===
{{main|Soft tissue}}
Skin is a soft tissue and exhibits key mechanical behaviors of these tissues.  The most pronounced feature is the J-curve stress strain response, in which a region of large strain and minimal stress exists, and corresponds to the microstructural straightening and reorientation of collagen fibrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sherman |first=Vincent R. |title=The materials science of collagen |journal=Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials |volume=52 |pages=22–50 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.05.023 |pmid=26144973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the intact skin is prestreched, like wetsuits around the diver's body, and in other cases the intact skin is under compression. Small circular holes punched on the skin may widen or close into ellipses, or shrink and remain circular, depending on preexisting stresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bush |first=James A. |title=Skin tension or skin compression? Small circular wounds are likely to shrink, not gape |journal=Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive &amp; Aesthetic Surgery |pmid=17652049 |doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2007.06.004 |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=529–34|year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aging===

Tissue [[homeostasis]] generally declines with age, in part because [[stem cell|stem]]/progenitor cells fail to self-renew or [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]].  In the skin of mice, [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[oxidative stress]] can promote [[cellular senescence]] and [[ageing|aging]] phenotypes.&lt;ref name="pmid22278880"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velarde MC, Flynn JM, Day NU, Melov S, Campisi J |title=Mitochondrial oxidative stress caused by Sod2 deficiency promotes cellular senescence and aging phenotypes in the skin |journal=Aging (Albany NY) |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=3–12 |date=January 2012 |pmid=22278880 |pmc=3292901 |doi=10.18632/aging.100423 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ordinarily mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ([[SOD2]]) protects against oxidative stress.   Using a mouse model of genetic SOD2 deficiency, it was shown that failure to express this important antioxidant enzyme in epidermal cells caused cellular senescence, nuclear [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]], and irreversible arrest of proliferation of a fraction of [[keratinocyte]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid22278880" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26240345"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velarde MC, Demaria M, Melov S, Campisi J |title=Pleiotropic age-dependent effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on epidermal stem cells |journal=Proc.

==Society and culture==
The term "skin" may also refer to the covering of a small [[animal]], such as a [[sheep]], [[goat]] ([[goatskin (material)|goatskin]]), [[pig]], snake ([[snakeskin]]) etc. or the young of a large [[animal]].

The term [[Hide (skin)|hides]] or [[Rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] refers to the covering of a large adult [[animal]] such as a [[cow]], [[American bison|buffalo]], [[horse]] etc.

Skins and [[Hide (skin)|hides]] from the different [[animal]]s are used for [[clothing]], bags and other [[consumer products]], usually in the form of [[leather]], but also as [[fur]]s.

Skin from [[sheep]], [[goat]] and [[cattle]] was used to make [[parchment]] for [[manuscript]]s.

Skin can also be cooked to make [[pork rind]] or [[pork rind|crackling]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">The '''Test of Understanding in College Economics''' or '''TUCE''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use at the undergraduate level, primarily targeting introductory or principles-level coursework in economics.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e. [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Knowledge]] (TEK) and [[Test of Economic Literacy]] (TEL)) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TUCE is in its fourth edition (2007) and is available, along with an examiner’s manual, for instructors, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The latest revision process, a joint effort between the NCEE and the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]], included a national norming consisting of 70 institutions across the United States spanning the four largest categories of the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].  The TUCE has two forms, one covering [[microeconomics]] and one covering [[macroeconomics]], each with thirty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items.  Each form includes three items covering [[international economics]].

'''''The World Trade Center Tapestry''''' was a large [[tapestry]] by [[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Royo]].  It was displayed in the lobby of [[2 World Trade Center]] (the South Tower) in [[New York City]] from 1974 until it was destroyed in 2001 by the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]].

Saul Wenegrat, former director of the art program for the [[Port Authority of New York]], had suggested to Miró that he could make a tapestry for the World Trade Center, but the artist declined as he would only make the work with his own hands but had no experience of making a tapestry.  However, after his daughter recovered from an accident in Spain, Miró agreed to make a tapestry for the hospital that had treated her as a token of his gratitude.  Having learned the technique from tapestry maker Josep Royo, Miró made several other tapestries with Royo, including one for the World Trade Center, ''Woman'' for the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]], and one for the [[Fundació Joan Miró]].

The work was an abstract design, with bright blocks of colour, red, green, blue and yellow, with black elements and a light brown background.  Made of wool and hemp, it measured {{convert|20|xx|35|ft|m}} and weighed 4&amp;nbsp;tonnes.  It was completed in 1973, and displayed at a retrospective at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris before being installed in New York in 1974.

'''Women as theological figures''' have played a significant role in the development of various [[religions]] and religious [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. The study of '''[[women and religion]]''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. It is worth noting from  a gender scientific approach, women occupy the second room in all of the following religions in the examples below. 

George H. Gallup Jr. wrote in an analysis for the Gallup Organization in 2002 that, a mountain of evidence shows that women have more religiosity than men. Gallup goes on to say that women hold on to their faith more heartily, work harder for the church, and in general practice with more consistency than men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roy Britt, ''Women More Religious Than Men, http://www.livescience.com/7689-women-religious-men.html, February 28, 2009'' October 27, 2014 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==
{{details|Bahá'í Faith and gender equality#Historical women figures in Bahá'í history}}

In Bahá'i writings, the [[Holy Spirit]] is often described as the "[[Maid of Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="Abdo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdo_female_holy-spirit |title=Female Representations of the Holy Spirit in Bahá'í and Christian writings and their implications for gender roles |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three women figure prominently in the history of the Bahá'í Faith: [[Táhirih]], a disciple of the [[Báb]]; [[Ásíyih Khánum]], the wife of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]; and [[Bahíyyih Khánum]] the daughter of Bahá'u'lláh. Táhirih and Bahíyyih, in particular, held strong leadership positions and are seen vital to the development of the religion.

Several women played leading roles in the early days of the Bahá'í Faith in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbahai.org/cgi-bin/articles.pl?article=93 |title=Women in the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Planetbahai.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=2 |title=Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/finch_unclipping_wings |title=Unclipping the Wings |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are: [[May Maxwell]], [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Corinne True], and [[Martha Root]].  [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] and a mix of male and female [[Hands of the Cause]] formed an interim leadership of the religion for six years prior to the formation of the [[Universal House of Justice]]. Later prominent women include [http://www.bahai.us/node/80 Patricia Locke], [http://www.creativefilms.com/Pos.html Jaqueline Left Hand Bull Delahunt], [[Layli Miller-Muro]], and [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Dr. Susan Maneck], who herself wrote books documenting the role of women in the Bahá'í Faith.

Recognition of the feminine aspect of [[God]] during the last century by [[Tantra|Tantric]] and [[Shakti]] religious leaders, has led to the legitimization of the female teachers and female [[guru]]s in Hinduism.

There are more Svetambara sadhvis than sadhus and women have always been influential in the Jain religion.&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-jain-faith/ |title=The Role of Women - Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
