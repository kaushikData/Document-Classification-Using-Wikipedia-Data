[[File:American Ninja Challenge - Batman.jpg|thumb|300px|''American Ninja Challenge'' competitor in Batman costume.]]

'''''American Ninja Challenge''''' was a nationwide competition sponsored by [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]] to send a number of American citizens to Japan to compete in the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] hit TV show ''[[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]'' (known as ''Ninja Warrior'' in US). American Ninja Challenge has been held since ''Sasuke'' 19 (the 19th competition) and currently merged into the TV series ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' that premiered on December 12, 2009 and succeeded American Ninja Challenge.

==Episodes==

===Ninja Fest (2006)===

G4's [[Attack of the Show]] hosts [[Kevin Pereira]] and [[Olivia Munn]] broadcast a competition to ninja aspirees everywhere to create a [[video]] displaying their 'ninja moves'. Hundreds of people sent in submissions, and six finalists were selected. Through various competitions in America, the two winners were chosen; Collin Bell from [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and Brett Sims from [[South Carolina]] went to Japan. They then participated in the Ninja Warrior [[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]] tournament.

===Ninja Fest 2 (2007)===

Once the videos were sent in, six finalists were chosen. The six finalists were: Russelis Perry aka "Blackie Chan") from [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]; martial artist Joe Simonsen from [[West Islip, New York]]; Freerunner Brian Orosco from [[San Francisco, California]]; Rick Seedman from [[New York City, New York]]; freerunner Levi Meeuwenburg from [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]; and Mark Witmer from [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].

These six finalists then went to a [[US Navy]] training camp, where they competed on a [[marine (military)|marine]] training obstacle course. In '1v1' challenges, three of the six competitors were eliminated. Once there were three challengers left, they competed on an improvised course consisting of several of the new Ninja Warrior's most difficult obstacles.

The winner, Levi Meeuwenberg, cleared it in 45 seconds, followed by Brian Orosco at 1:12 and Russelis Perry in third place at 1:16. In Japan the two top finalists Levi and Brian were joined by former finalist Brett Sims to take on the course at Midoriyama.

====Trip to Japan====

Levi and Brian, prior to leaving for Japan, met with U.S. Olympic athlete and Ninja Warrior competitor [[Paul Terek]], who has reached the third stage in past Ninja Warrior competitions. Paul trained them in strategies and tactics to quickly and successfully defeat some of the trickier obstacles of Ninja Warrior. Afterward, they headed to Japan, where they enjoyed Japanese culture and met for a dinner with Ninja Warrior's all-stars, including [[Makoto Nagano]], the winner of the 17th Ninja Warrior tournament. Some other all-stars they met were: Shingo Yamamoto, gas station manager, and firefighter Toshihiro Takeda, who has reached the third stage more than any other competitor.

===Ninja Fest 3 (2008)===
The third American Ninja Challenge contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008, and aired as part of November 12, 2008. Viewers got to vote for their favorite competitors and the top three would be picked and flown directly to Japan to compete in Sasuke 21. The three winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and freerunner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg (the first woman to qualify) of [[Valley Village, California]]. These winners joined American Ninja Challenge 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]] to compete. In Japan, they have the ultimate experience, along with training at Muscle Park, a scaled-down version of the Sasuke course located in a section of shopping mall called "''Muscule Park''".

===Ninja Fest 4 (2009)===
The fourth and final Ninja Challenge contest winner was David Campbell. He joined up with former Ninja Challenge winners Luci Romberg and Levi Meeuwenberg to compete in Sasuke 22. Also joining them was the returning host [[Olivia Munn]] for the run to the top of mount Midoriyama. This season concluded the American Ninja Challenge, which subsequently evolved into its own national format - American Ninja Warrior.  Beginning with the 4th season of American Ninja Warrior, the qualifiers would compete on a replicated Sasuke Midoriyama course in the Las Vegas, USA (and no longer participate in the Japanese version of the show). Beginning with ANW5, additional "Special" competitions would also be arranged between the finalists of the Japanese and USA editions of the show.

==American Ninja Warrior==
{{main|American Ninja Warrior}}
The popularity of the American Ninja Challenge led [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] to create a licensed version of ''Sasuke'' titled '''''American Ninja Warrior''''', with contestants from the United States and all play-by-play commentary in English.

[[File:Portrait of Archibald Armstrong Archee the kinges lester by Thomas Cecil.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Archibald Armstrong, engraving by [[Thomas Cecil (engraver)|Thomas Cecil]]]]
'''Archibald Armstrong''' (died March 1672), [[court jester]], called "Archy," was a native of [[Scotland]] or of [[Cumberland]], and according to tradition first distinguished himself as a sheep-stealer; afterwards he entered the service of [[James I of England|James VI]], with whom he became a [[favourite]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==At court==
When the king succeeded to the English throne, Archy was appointed court jester. In 1611 he was granted a pension of two [[shilling]]s a day, and in 1617 he accompanied James on his visit to Scotland. His influence was considerable and he was greatly courted and flattered, but his success appears to have turned his head. He became presumptuous, insolent, and mischievous and was much disliked by the members of the court.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
James seems to have favoured him; indeed in August 1618, Archie got the monopoly on tobacco pipes.

At the Newmarket races in 1612, he even tried to excite jealousy between James and [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], by pointing out how more courtiers stayed with Henry once they were parted. Thereafter Henry's friends would always toss Archie in a blanket when they saw him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1623 he accompanied Prince Charles and [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] in their royal marriage negotiations in [[Spain]], where he was much caressed and favoured by the Spanish court and, according to his own account, was granted a pension. His conduct here became more intolerable than ever. He rallied the [[Henrietta Maria of France|infanta]] on the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada|Armada]] and censured the conduct of the expedition to Buckingham's face. Buckingham declared he would have him hanged, to which the jester replied that "dukes had often been hanged for insolence but never fools for talking." On his return he gained some complimentary allusions from [[Ben Jonson]] by his attacks upon the Spanish marriage.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He retained his post on the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and accumulated a considerable fortune, including the grant by the king of 1000 acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²) in Ireland. After the death of Buckingham in 1628, whom he declared "the greatest enemy of three kings," the principal object of his dislike and rude jests was [[William Laud]], whom he openly vilified and ridiculed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He pronounced the following grace at Whitehall in Laud's presence: "Great praise be given to God and little laud to the devil" (Laud stood only five feet tall, and bitterly resented remarks on the subject), and after the news of the rebellion in Scotland in 1637 he greeted Laud on his way to the council chamber at Whitehall with: "Who's fool now? Does not your Grace hear the news from Stirling about the liturgy?" On Laud's complaint to the council, Archy was sentenced the same day "to have his coat pulled over his head and be discharged the king's service and banished the king's court."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Later years==
He settled in [[London]] as a money-lender, and many complaints were made to the privy council and [[House of Lords]] of his sharp practices. In 1641 on the occasion of Laud's arrest, he enjoyed a mean revenge by publishing ''Archy's Dream; sometimes Jester to his Majestie, but exiled the Court by Canterburie's malice''. Subsequently, he resided at [[Arthuret]] in Cumberland, according to some accounts his birthplace, where he possessed an estate, and where he died in 1672, his burial taking place on 1 April.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was twice married, his second wife being Sybilla Bell. There is no record of any legal offspring, but the baptism of a "[[Bastardy|base son]]" of Archibald Armstrong is entered in the parish register of 17 December 1643. ''A Banquet of Jests: A change of Cheare'', published about 1630, a collection chiefly of dull, stale jokes, is attributed to him, and with still less reason probably ''A choice Banquet of Witty Jests ... Being an addition to Archee's Jests, taken out of his Closet but never published in his Lifetime'' (1660).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''Baseball Talk''' was a set of 164 "talking" baseball cards that were released by [[Topps]] Baseball Card Company and the [[LJN]] Corporation during the spring of 1989. Each card featured a plastic disk affixed to the back of an oversized baseball card. When placed in the SportsTalk player the cards would play two to three minutes of recorded audio. The player retailed for [[United States dollar|$]]24.99 and was labeled for ages six and up. It required four AA alkaline batteries to operate.&lt;ref&gt;[Beckett Mar. 89]&lt;/ref&gt; The cards featured most of the better known players in baseball in [[1988 Major League Baseball season|1988]] and were sold in toy stores throughout the United States and Canada during [[1989 Major League Baseball season]]. LJN and Topps planned to debut talking [[National Football League|NFL]] and [[National Football League|NBA]] cards (it stated in print advertising "Coming Soon - NFL Football and NBA Basketball Talking Cards), but those plans, along with follow-up MLB editions, were canceled as the card players often broke or played with poor audio quality.&lt;ref&gt;[Beckett Nov. 89]&lt;/ref&gt; Stores were flooded with returned boxes of Baseball Talk and by the fall of 1989 many of the cards and players could be found in discount bins at places like [[Toys R Us]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]]. At one point, packs of cards that had been priced at $4 a piece were selling for as low as 50 cents by stores that were eager to move a failed product.

==Cards==
The SportsTalk player was sold with four cards (a checklist card that served as an introduction to the series, a [[Hank Aaron]] card, and the cards of 1988 stars [[Don Mattingly]] and [[Orel Hershiser]]). Additional cards were sold with four to a pack and were labeled in a manner that let the buyer know what cards were inside. [[Mel Allen]] narrated eight cards that featured highlights from historic games as well as 33 cards of former stars such as [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Duke Snider]]. Hall of Fame legends like [[Ted Williams]], [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Warren Spahn]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Joe DiMaggio]] and [[Bob Feller]] were omitted from the set as they did not agree to take part.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett Mar 89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Drysdale]] interviewed the players of the National League for their cards and [[Joe Torre]] did the same for the American League players. Many of the cards featured amusing or humorous anecdotes, such as [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] recounting how his Japanese baseball glove manufacturer ([[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]]) spelled his name "Mike Franagan" and that the company's executives told him, "Mr. Franagan, we're very grad you use our grub."

===Rare collectibles===
Because the cards and players were on the market for a short period of time and that many of the players didn't work well, a complete set and a working player today are very rare and sell for a Beckett book value of $250–$300 (Beckett 2008 Almanac).

==Checklist==
The following is the numerical checklist for the only set of cards ever released for Baseball Talk.

'''By Team'''

Each team was represented by at least three players except for the [[1988 Baltimore Orioles season|1988 Baltimore Orioles]], who had two ([[Cal Ripken, Jr.|Cal Ripken]] and [[Eddie Murray]].)

'''Bilofix''' is the name of a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[construction toy]] product primarily consisting of [[wood|wooden]] [[beams]] and [[plastic]] [[screw]]s and [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]]. It was produced and marketed primarily in the 1960s first by the [[Lego company]] and then by a separate Bilofix company. The name Bilofix is usually written stylized as "BILOfix".

==History==
The "Bilo" part of the name is a combination of the first three letters of [[Billund, Denmark|Billund]], [[Denmark]], birthplace of Lego and Bilofix, and the first initial of [[Ole Kirk Christiansen]], founder and inventor of Lego and Bilofix.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stadsarkiv.kolding.dk/administrator/components/com_koldingbogen/media/29b7a66f5102b6f53dcf88d713ebcbd0-2006-Legetoejsfabrikken-Bilofix.pdf Article about the history of Bilofix from the Kolding city archive] (danish)&lt;/ref&gt; When LEGO decided in 1960 to stop producing wooden toys, two sons of Lego founder Ole Kirk Christiansen, Karl Georg and Gerhardt (brothers of [[Godtfred Kirk Christiansen]]), decided to leave the Lego company and to start Bilofix as their own independent business in a new factory in [[Kolding]], Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stadsarkiv.kolding.dk/administrator/components/com_koldingbogen/media/29b7a66f5102b6f53dcf88d713ebcbd0-2006-Legetoejsfabrikken-Bilofix.pdf Article about the history of Bilofix from the Kolding city archive] (danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|string=Celebrity Big Brother}}
[[File:ShilpaShetty.jpg|thumb|Celebrity Big Brother 2007 Winner [[Shilpa Shetty]]]]
The '''''Celebrity Big Brother 5'' racism controversy''' was a series of events related to incidents of allegedly [[Racism|racist]] behaviour by contestants on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|fifth series]] of the British [[reality television]] show ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'', broadcast on British television station [[Channel 4]] in January 2007. The controversy centred on comments made by [[British people|British]] contestants [[Jade Goody]], [[Danielle Lloyd]], and [[Jo O'Meara]], concerning [[Indian people|Indian]] contestant [[Shilpa Shetty]]. The screening of these comments on UK television resulted in national and international media coverage, responses from the UK and Indian governments, and the show's suspension during the 2008 season.

Many agencies and corporations cancelled their contracts with the housemates accused of racism, citing the allegations as the reason for the terminations. Also, many sponsors of the ''Big Brother'' series cancelled their sponsorship of the show. After the show, Goody stated that she understood her comments appeared as racist and apologised for any offence caused. Shetty later told the media that she forgave Goody. After conducting an investigation, [[Ofcom]] ruled that Channel 4 had breached the [[Broadcasting Code]], and statutory sanctions were placed on [[Channel Four Television Corporation|the network]].

== Summary of events in ''Celebrity Big Brother 5'' ==
The fifth UK series of ''Celebrity Big Brother'' began on Wednesday 3 January 2007.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication"/&gt;{{rp|1.2}}  On the first day, eleven celebrity housemates entered the Big Brother House, including model Danielle Lloyd, singer Jo O'Meara and [[Bollywood]] actress Shilpa Shetty. Then, on Friday 5, former ''[[Big Brother 3 (UK)|Big Brother]]'' housemate Jade Goody entered the house, accompanied by her boyfriend [[Jack Tweed]] and her mother [[Jackiey Budden]].&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.19}} Each day, Channel 4 broadcast a daily "highlights" show, featuring selected events of the previous 24 hours in the House,&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|2.6}} which itself was repeated the following morning, although offensive language and other potentially objectionable content was removed for [[Watershed (broadcasting)|pre-watershed]] broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.54}}

During Budden's stay in the house, she and Shetty clashed on numerous occasions. Budden claimed that she was unable to pronounce "Shilpa",&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.20}} and referred to Shetty as "Princess"&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.20}} and "the [[Indian people|Indian]]".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|7.1}} During her eviction interview on Wednesday 10 January, after Budden used the term "the Indian", presenter [[Davina McCall]] did not question her use of the term – but focussed instead on Budden's failure to pronounce "Shilpa" properly.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.24}} After Budden's eviction, Goody's boyfriend [[Jack Tweed]] called Shetty a "[[cunt]]",&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|6.28}} which was [[Bleep censor|bleeped]] for broadcast,&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|6.23}} and a [[wanker]].&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.28}} The night that [[Carole Malone]] was evicted, Lloyd referred to Shetty as a "dog".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.31}}
 
The following day, Shetty cooked a chicken meal for the housemates. According to Lloyd and O’Meara, Shetty had undercooked the chicken. When they suggested that chicken may be cooked differently in India, O'Meara retorted: "That's why they're all thin, because they're sick all the time, because they're ill."&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.36}} Lloyd also mentioned that she didn't like Shetty touching her food because she didn't "know where her hands have been".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.36}}
 
The tensions in the house came to a peak on Tuesday 16 January, when an explosive argument between Shetty and Goody erupted, seemingly over [[Bouillon cube|stock cubes]].&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.40}} During this argument, Goody told Shetty that she was "no fucking princess here",&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|6.58}} "normal"&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|6.58}} and needed "a day in the slums",&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|6.59}} while Shetty told Goody that she needed "[[etiquette]] classes"&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.40}} and that her "claim to fame was [''Big Brother'']".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.40}} Lloyd and O'Meara laughed throughout the exchange and, when the argument had abated, Lloyd said: "I think she should fuck off home. [...] Does that mean that I need [[elocution]] lessons, because she can't understand what I fucking say? She can't even speak English properly anyway."&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.45}}
 
After the argument, Shetty asked fellow housemates if they thought they were "reacting to [her] like this because [she was] Indian".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.50}} In a conversation with [[Cleo Rocos]], who contested the idea that the others' motivation was racism, Shetty replied: "It is, I'm telling you."&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.51}} However, in a later Diary Room conversation with Big Brother, she retracted this statement.&lt;ref name="Shilpa Jade not racist"/&gt;
 
The next morning, in a conversation with Lloyd, Goody referred to Shetty as, amongst other things, "Shilpa [[Poppadom]]".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|4.52}} Following this exchange, Goody was called to the Diary Room to explain her comment, where she clarified that she had not meant it with racist intent.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|8.35}} The following day, Big Brother called Goody back to the Diary Room, where she was informed that: "Big Brother will not tolerate any racist behaviour or anything that could be seen as racist behaviour."&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|8.36}} Goody then discussed the "poppadom" comment directly with Shetty, amongst other grievances the two had with each other. Finally, Goody apologised to Shetty, and Shetty apologised to Goody.&lt;ref name="both"/&gt;
 
On Friday 19 January, Goody was eliminated from the competition by public vote (receiving 82%&lt;ref name="Jade evicted as poll reveals public anger"/&gt; of the votes to evict), and left the House. Following O’Meara, Lloyd and Tweed’s eventual evictions from the House, Shetty was announced as the winner of the show on Sunday 28 January, with 63% of the public vote.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|2.8}}

== Response ==
=== Viewer complaints ===
On 15 January, it was reported that media regulator [[Ofcom]] was investigating "approximately 200 complaints of racism"&lt;ref name="Viewers jump"/&gt; received by them. Following the broadcast of Lloyd and O'Meara's conversation about cooking in India, this number increased to 3,500 complaints, with a further 1,000 complaining to Channel 4 directly.&lt;ref name="Complaints soar"/&gt; By 5pm on Tuesday 16, the complaint figures stood at 10,000 to Ofcom, and 2,000 to Channel 4.&lt;ref name="Record complaints"/&gt;
 
On 18 January – the day after the episode that included the "Oxo cube" argument, Lloyd's subsequent "fuck off home" remark and Shetty voicing her concern about potential racism – the chief executive of Ofcom, Ed Richards, stated that 25,000 complaints had been received, calling it a "UK record".&lt;ref name="Ofcom: 'no kangaroo court'"/&gt; Later that day, Channel 4's chief executive, [[Andy Duncan (executive)|Andy Duncan]], spoke about the events of the series. He said that Channel 4 was "very concerned by the number of complaints and some of the surrounding discussion and complaint", and opined that "the level of complaint and comment shows the programme has touched a real nerve."&lt;ref name="Duncan defends"/&gt; In addition, directory inquiry service [[118 118 (UK)|118 118]] received "1,058 angry callers" during Wednesday's broadcast, which was after Shetty’s statement was shown.&lt;ref name="C4 dodges"/&gt;
 
By 20 January, the day after Goody's eviction, the number of complaints stood at 40,000.&lt;ref name="Jade evicted as poll reveals public anger"/&gt; The final figure was clarified by Ofcom as "just over" 44,500 complaints.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication"/&gt;{{rp|1.4}} As of 2018, ''Celebrity Big Brother 5'' is the British television broadcast with the second highest number of complaints, after ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]''.&lt;ref name="most complained"/&gt;

=== Media reaction ===
{{wikinews2|Big Brother star meets Tony Blair|UK Celebrity Big Brother loses sponsorship over racism allegations}}
The controversy generated over 300 newspaper articles in Britain, 1,200 in English newspapers around the globe, 3,900 foreign language news articles, and 22,000 [[blog]] postings on the [[internet]].&lt;ref name="Racial subplot"/&gt;
 
British [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers were vitriolic towards Goody, Lloyd and O'Meara during their stay in the house – particularly towards Goody. ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' ran a front-page editorial entitled "Beauty V Bigot",&lt;ref name="Beauty v Bigot"/&gt; referring to her as a "racist bully". They later referred to Goody as a "vile racist", and to Lloyd as Goody's "partner-in-crime".&lt;ref name="Danielle two faced"/&gt; In the same print, they misquoted Goody as saying "Go back to the slums"&lt;ref name="Good 4 nothings"/&gt; – she actually said "You need a day in the slums".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication"/&gt;{{rp|6.59}} On Friday 19 January, as Goody and Shetty faced the public vote for eviction that night, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'}}s front page carried the headline: "Evict Face Of Hate", accompanied by six photos of Goody and the official telephone number required to vote to evict her from ''Big Brother''.&lt;ref name="Evict face"/&gt;
 
The BBC became the subject of complaints after making the controversy its lead story, on the same day that [[Ruth Turner (political advisor)|Ruth Turner]] was arrested for her involvement in the [[Cash for Honours]] scandal.&lt;ref name="BBC criticised"/&gt;

=== Political reaction in UK and India ===
Leicester East MP [[Keith Vaz]] tabled an [[Early Day Motion]] in Parliament addressing this issue.&lt;ref name="Commons"/&gt; The controversy coincided with a visit by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] to India. When questioned by journalists, he said: "I want Britain to be seen as a country of fairness and tolerance. Anything detracting from this I condemn."&lt;ref name="Racism, ratings and reality TV"/&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] refused to comment on the issue as he had not seen the programme, although he did "condemn racism in all its forms."&lt;ref name="Surreal"/&gt; London mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] stated, "The racism towards Shilpa Shetty on ''Celebrity Big Brother'' is completely unacceptable". He went on to accuse the producers of the programme of selectively editing the show "to broadcast participants' racist comments".&lt;ref name="Racism reality check"/&gt;
 
[[Anand Sharma]], India's junior [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|minister for external affairs]], told journalists that the Indian government would take "appropriate measures" once more information became available,&lt;ref name="Big Brother eviction Shilpa v Jade"/&gt; while [[Kamal Nath]], India's [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|trade minister]], reportedly said that ''Celebrity Big Brother'' could lead to a "diplomatic crisis".&lt;ref name="Surreal"/&gt;
 
[[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] chairman [[Trevor Phillips]] stated that Channel 4 must "make clear that they got it wrong, they intervened too little too late".&lt;ref name="Goody coach"/&gt; A small protest involving "dozens" of Shetty's fans took place in [[Patna]], eastern India, during which straw [[Effigy|effigies]] of ''Big Brother'' producers were burned.&lt;ref name="Racism, ratings and reality TV"/&gt; [[Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi]], India's information and broadcasting minister, opined that Shetty should appear before the Indian high commission in London when she left the house, stating: "If there has been some racism shown against her in the show, it is not only an attack on women but also on the skin and the country."&lt;ref name="Racism, ratings and reality TV" /&gt; The India Tourism Office placed an "open letter" to Goody as advertisements in several national newspapers, inviting her to "experience the healing nature of India".&lt;ref name="Come to india"/&gt;

=== Sponsor and corporate backlash ===
On 18 January, [[The Carphone Warehouse]] suspended its sponsorship of ''Celebrity Big Brother'' with immediate effect over the alleged racism, before permanently ending its contract with Channel 4 altogether.&lt;ref name="Carphone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carphone2"/&gt; Speaking about the suspension, the company's chief executive, [[Charles Dunstone]], stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our concern has rapidly mounted about the broadcast behaviour of individuals within the ''Big Brother'' house. We are totally against all forms of racism and bullying and indeed this behaviour is entirely at odds with the brand values of the Carphone Warehouse. As a result we feel that as long as this continues we are unable to associate our brand with the programme. We had already made it clear to Channel 4 that were this to continue, we would have to consider our position. Nothing we saw last night gave us any comfort. Accordingly we have instructed Channel 4 to remove our sponsorship name and branding with immediate effect.&lt;ref name="Carphone" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Other sponsors of the show, including Beauty-boxes.com, Zamya, [[United Biscuits]], [[Cobra (beer)|Cobra Beer]], [[Cow &amp; Gate]] and [[Money Supermarket|Moneysupermarket.com]] withdrew sponsorship from the programme.&lt;ref name="No crowd no shock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Axe Big Brother"/&gt; Vanni Treves, Channel 4's former chairman, urged Channel 4 to cancel the show,&lt;ref name="Axe Big Brother" /&gt; while [[Hertsmere|Hertsmere Borough Council]], the owners of ''Big Brother'''s studios in [[Borehamwood]], threatened to refuse permission to film.&lt;ref name="Dumped"/&gt;
 
Fragrance chain [[The Perfume Shop]], [[pharmacy]] chain [[Boots Group|Boots]], and [[Debenhams]] department stores withdrew [[Jade Goody]]'s brand of [[perfume]], ''Shh...'', from their stores.&lt;ref name="Gloat C4"/&gt; [[HarperCollins]] cancelled plans to publish the paperback version of Jade Goody's autobiography. The book, titled ''Jade: My Autobiography'' was published in hardback in May 2006, and was scheduled to be released in paperback on 5 February 2007. A spokesman for the firm stated:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In light of recent events, HarperCollins has decided it wouldn't be appropriate to proceed with the paperback publication of Jade: My Autobiography as planned on 5 February. The author and agent support this decision.&lt;ref name="Disgraced"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
[[Act Against Bullying]], a charity supported by Goody, dropped all mention of her from their website citing the racism allegations as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6260000/newsid_6267600/6267675.stm|title=Bullying charity drops Jade Goody|date=2007-01-16|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=CBBC Newsround}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Motorcycle]] [[insurance]] company [[Bennetts]] also terminated its six-figure agreement with Danielle to be the official model for their company, citing the racism allegations for this termination.&lt;ref name="Dumped"/&gt;

=== Response by Channel 4 ===
On 16 January, after thousands of complaints had been received, Channel 4 issued the following statement:&lt;blockquote&gt;Matters of bullying or racial abuse in any form are taken extremely seriously by Channel 4 and [[Endemol Shine UK|Endemol]]. The nature of the show often includes incidents where conflicts arise and housemates are encouraged to resolve issues among themselves. Housemates are closely monitored at all times to ensure they have the appropriate support inside the house which includes being able to talk in confidence to producers. Shilpa herself has not voiced any concerns of racial slurs or bullying against her. Appropriate measures to reprimand individual behaviour would take place where necessary.&lt;ref name="C4 press statement 1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In spite of this, complaints figures continued to rise, leading the network to issue another statement the following day. They denied that any "overt racial abuse or racist behaviour" had occurred, but acknowledged that a "cultural and [[social class|class]] clash between [Shetty] and three of the British females"&lt;ref name="C4 press statement 2"/&gt; had.
 
It is typical on ''Big Brother'' that live evictions are attended by a large crowd gathered outside the House and, following their interview with [[Davina McCall]], evicted housemates then attend a press conference. Channel 4 announced on the afternoon of the eviction that both events had been cancelled, and that all profits from the vote to evict that week would be donated to charity.&lt;ref name="Phone vote charity"/&gt;
 
On 22 January, Channel 4's board of directors held a meeting to discuss the issue. Following the meeting, its chairman issued the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Clearly many people were worried and offended by what they saw. I want to reassure them that we take the views of our audience very seriously and profoundly regret any offence that may have been caused. On behalf of the board the Chief Executive and I have commissioned a review of the editorial and compliance processes that support Big Brother. The board will receive a full report and seek to identify any lessons that can be learned for the future. The programme remains on air for a further week and the channel is focused on its completion. We are expecting to hear from Ofcom in the near future detailing the nature and number of complaints they have received and requesting a formal response to their questions. Our own review will also help support this process. All board members of Channel 4 abhor racism. We are also committed to ensuring that the channel continues to fulfil its remit to explore important social issues.&lt;ref name="Board chairman"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Viewership ===
The launch show of ''Celebrity Big Brother'' (aired on 3 January 2007) averaged 7.1 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline=bb-ratings-continue-slide&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18424299&amp;siteid=66633-name_page.html|title=BB RATINGS CONTINUE SLIDE|last=Watson|first=Donna|date=2007-01-09|publisher=The Daily Record|accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ratings fell to 3.9 million by 7 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/events/2007/celebrity-big-brother-5/news/01/jade-blamed-for-tumbling-celeb-bb-ratings.html|title=Jade blamed for tumbling Celeb BB ratings|date=2007-01-08|publisher=Tiscali|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321152353/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/events/2007/celebrity-big-brother-5/news/01/jade-blamed-for-tumbling-celeb-bb-ratings.html|archivedate=21 March 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2007-01-09|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings quickly rose as media coverage reported alleged racism towards Shilpa from fellow female contestants; the episode which aired on 2007/01/16 saw a ratings boost with the show sharing 18% of the available audience and ratings of 4.5 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1992388,00.html|title=Race row boosts Big Brother ratings|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2007-01-22|publisher=Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode the following night also rose in ratings, with 5.2 million viewers.

== Investigation ==
=== Police ===
After Shetty confided in Cleo Rocos that she though the conflicts within the House could be racially motivated, her words compelled police to investigate whether or not to classify her treatment as '[[Inciting ethnic hatred|racial hatred]]' under Part III of the [[Public Order Act 1986]].
 
On Thursday 18 January, [[Hertfordshire Constabulary|Hertfordshire Police]] released the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hertfordshire Constabulary is investigating allegations of racist behaviour in the Big Brother house and will be conducting enquiries, including a review of the tapes. We will continue to liaise with Ofcom and with [[Endemol Shine UK|Endemol]], whom we have strongly encouraged to ensure that any form of behaviour that could raise similar concerns, does not occur. We will continue to closely monitor the situation over the next few days. Hertfordshire Constabulary will not tolerate racism in any form and is taking these allegations seriously. The constabulary has experience of investigating and resolving incidents in the Big Brother house in past seasons.&lt;ref name="Racial incident"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Police also confirmed they had spoken to Goody and her mother Budden, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An investigation into allegations of racist behaviour inside the Celebrity Big Brother house is continuing. Hertfordshire Constabulary can confirm police will be making approaches to speak to housemates if and when appropriate once they have left the house. We are also making contact with two of the housemates who have already been evicted but at this stage no interviews have taken place.&lt;ref name="Police contact Jade"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 1 February, three days after the series concluded, an anonymous handwritten note was handed to the police, written on the back of a production schedule for an episode of ''[[List of Big Brother (UK) shows#Big Brother's Little Brother|Big Brother's Little Brother]]'', alleging that footage existed of some housemates singing a "racist song" featuring the word “[[Paki (slur)|"paki"]].&lt;ref name="Paki song"/&gt; Channel 4 confirmed that police would require a "[[court order]]" to see unbroadcast footage of the show.&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt; Ultimately, it transpired that untransmitted footage did exist, featuring some housemates creating a [[limerick]] about Shetty. The word "paki" was never actually used, but referred to.&lt;ref name="untransmitted"/&gt;
 
On 9 March 2007, police stated that no formal charges would be brought against any of the participants of ''Celebrity Big Brother'', stating:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Channel 4] declined to co-operate and stated they would contest any application to court [...] Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, it was felt that it would not be in the public interest to effect arrests or to pursue footage through the courts. The CPS has concluded that whilst what occurred was clearly offensive, it was not criminal.&lt;ref name="Police charges ruled out"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
The police also confirmed that, without specifying names, they had interviewed four housemates in relation to the controversy, while two others “would not speak to them”.&lt;ref name="Police charges ruled out"/&gt;

=== Ofcom ===
Regulatory authority [[Ofcom]] announced its intention to conduct the investigation into the viewer complaints about the series,&lt;ref name="Ofcom: 'no kangaroo court'" /&gt; and continued after the conclusion of the criminal investigation.&lt;ref name="Probe continues"/&gt; Channel 4 made its submission to Ofcom in April.&lt;ref name="Brace for ruling"/&gt; Channel 4 was criticised for the announcement and promotion of its [[Big Brother 8 (UK)|eighth]] series of ''Big Brother'' before the investigation had concluded, with Ofcom stating that it was "aware of the benefits" of announcing its findings before the new series began.&lt;ref name="BB8 promotion"/&gt;
 
Ofcom’s Adjudication of Findings was published on 24 May 2007.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt; After examining a large number of events throughout the series, it decided that the broadcast of three events in particular had breached Ofcom's [[Broadcasting Code]]:&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|1.11}}
 
* [[Jo O'Meara]] and [[Danielle Lloyd]]'s remarks about cooking in India
* Danielle Lloyd's "Fuck off home" comment
* [[Jade Goody]]'s "Shilpa Poppadom" comment
 
It also decided that, while [[Jackiey Budden]]'s use of the expression "The Indian" was "deeply offensive",&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|7.10}} the circumstances and Channel 4's response led Ofcom to consider this matter resolved.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|7.12}}
 
Channel Four also confidentially supplied Ofcom with uncensored and untransmitted material from the programme. Firstly, this clarified [[Jack Tweed]]'s use of the word "cunt", and not the word "Paki" which had been reported.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|6.28}} However, this also revealed conversations that took place between Goody, Lloyd, O'Meara and Tweed on Tuesday 16 January 2007, a few hours after the "Oxo cube" row between Goody and Shetty.&lt;ref name="untransmitted"/&gt; In the first conversation, they discussed whether "[[Paki (slur)|the P word]]" had been used by any housemate (which Jack clarified by saying "It rhymes with tacky").&lt;ref name="untransmitted"/&gt;{{rp|4}} In subsequent conversations, they created limericks which featured the rhyming words "tacky", "happy", "nappy", "crappy", "yappy" and "strappy".&lt;ref name="untransmitted"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} These conversations, which were never broadcast, led to Big Brother issuing formal warnings to O'Meara and Tweed in the Diary Room, threatening immediate ejection from the House if their behaviour recurred.&lt;ref name="untransmitted"/&gt;{{rp|11–26}}
 
Channel Four clarified that [[Brighter Pictures]], the production company that supplies ''Big Brother'' to the channel, had suppressed the footage and logged the material under the heading "racist".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|1.17}} However, Ofcom responded that although Channel Four were unaware of the material, it highlighted a significant breakdown in communication between it and the producers, meaning that they were "not in possession of all the relevant facts and as a result, failed to maintain proper control over their programme".&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|8.43}}
 
As a result of broadcasting the three offending scenes, repeating one of them in early morning syndication and for their failing to be aware of what was happening in the House at a critical time, Ofcom decided to impose an official sanction on the network, directing them to broadcast a statement of their findings three times during the broadcast of ''[[Big Brother 8 (UK)|Big Brother 8]]''.&lt;ref name="Ofcom adjudication" /&gt;{{rp|9.11}}
 
On the same day as Ofcom published their findings, Channel 4 issued a press statement accepting the verdict, with Chief Executive [[Andy Duncan (executive)|Andy Duncan]] stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;We accept Ofcom's judgement that on the occasions in question we did not ensure that ''Big Brother'' intervened with the necessary promptness or strength. We would like to say sorry once again for the offence caused to viewers as a result. Ofcom did not rule this material should not have been broadcast, but that we should have done more to contextualise it by challenging and reprimanding the offending housemates. We believe the initiatives we have announced will help prevent a repeat of the public offence caused by the programme.&lt;ref name="C4 accepts"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Channel 4 and ''Big Brother''===
In addition to Ofcom’s investigation of the series, Channel 4 also commissioned its own internal review of the events of the series. It concluded that: "[...] great offence was caused by the broadcast of several comments made by housemates, irrespective of their motivation.  Channel 4 appeared to be somehow condoning the behaviour of some of the housemates because interventions were felt to be too late or insufficiently forceful." Subsequently, the network agreed to change and improve their compliance systems, introduce an "additional editorial perspective", "acknowledge and contribute to public debate provoked by its programmes" and update the ''Big Brother'' rules. However, the review also commented on what it described as the "hostile" media coverage of the programme, and denied that Channel 4 had "deliberately engineered" tension in the House between Shetty and her housemates.&lt;ref name="C4 review"/&gt;
 
Nine days into the [[Big Brother 8 (UK)|eighth series]] of ''Big Brother'', and exactly two weeks after Ofcom and Channel 4's separate findings were published, contestant [[Emily Parr]] was removed from the ''Big Brother'' House following her use of the term "[[nigger]]" during a conversation with another housemate.&lt;ref name="Emily removed"/&gt; Subsequently, Channel 4 was praised&lt;ref name="C4 praise"/&gt; by several sources.
 
''Celebrity Big Brother'' did not air in 2008, after Channel 4 decided to "rest" the format. It was replaced by ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]'', before ''Celebrity Big Brother'' returned in [[Celebrity Big Brother 6 (UK)|January 2009]]. The contestants were spoken to "in detail" about the controversy, and how to avoid a repeat incident.&lt;ref name="coaching CBB6"/&gt; On 26 August 2009, just before the conclusion of the [[Big Brother 10 (UK)|tenth series]] of ''Big Brother'', Channel 4 announced that it would not be renewing its contract with [[Endemol Shine UK|Endemol]] to screen ''Big Brother'' after its end in 2010.&lt;ref name="Time on Big Brother"/&gt; The rights were bought by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], who broadcast the program for seven years before deciding not to renew their contract with Endemol in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/05/big-brother-to-return-this-year|title=Big Brother to return this year after Channel 5 seals deal|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|date=2011-04-05|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/14/big-brother-channel-5-drops-reality-tv-show|title=Big Brother, where art thou?

Since the controversy, and following the removal of Parr in the eighth series, ''Big Brother'' has continued to have a zero-tolerance policy on the use of any potentially offensive or discriminatory language – either on the programme or in public before it – resulting in the removal of several Housemates. These have included [[Ken Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/12/ken-morley-thrown-off-celebrity-big-brother|title=Ken Morley thrown off Celebrity Big Brother after using word 'negro'|last=Deans|first=Jason|date=2015-01-12|website=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Biggins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/24/big-brother-biggins-bisexual-people-ofcom-x-factor|title=Big Brother: Biggins' comments about bisexual people 'did not breach rules'|last=Press Association|first=|date=2016-10-24|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodrigo Alves]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/25/celebrity-big-brother-rodrigo-alves-ejected-after-racist-language-warning|title=Celebrity Big Brother: Rodrigo Alves ejected after racist language warning|last=Press Association|first=|date=2018-08-25|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tila Tequila]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/22/online-conspiracy-theories-feed-holocaust-denial|title=New online generation takes up Holocaust denial|last=Doward|first=Jamie|date=2017-01-22|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Tate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/big-brother/264046-big-brother-2016-andrew-tate-removed-house.html|title=Andrew Tate REMOVED from the Big Brother house|date=2016-06-13|work=TellyMix|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[List of Big Brother 19 housemates (UK)#Ellis|Ellis Hillon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guardian-series.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/16881515.big-brother-contestant-ellis-hillon-removed-from-house-over-offensive-tweets|title=Big Brother contestant Ellis Hillon removed from house over offensive tweets|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contestants===
After she was evicted from the House, [[Jade Goody]] made several appearances in the media, such as an interview with [[News of the World]], and appearances on ''[[Big Brother's Little Brother]]'' and ''[[The Wright Stuff]]'',&lt;ref name="Wright stuff"/&gt; during which she apologised profusely for her behaviour on the programme, and confirmed that her fee for appearing on ''Celebrity Big Brother'' was being donated to charity.&lt;ref name="Jade donating TV fee to charity"/&gt; She maintained that she was not racist, but understood how her comments could have been interpreted as such. On 29 January, she was admitted to [[Priory Hospital]] for issues relating to [[mental health]].&lt;ref name="Priory"/&gt; She made few public appearances over the course of 2007. In 2008, she was offered a place on the [[Bigg Boss 2|second series]] of [[India]]'s version of ''Big Brother'', entitled ''[[Bigg Boss]]'', which she accepted. The series was presented by her former housemate, and subject of the racism controversy, [[Shilpa Shetty]], and the two were reunited on the launch night of the show. Two days into the series, Goody was forced to leave the Bigg Boss House, after receiving a call from her doctor indicating that she had been diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name="Return to UK"/&gt; She released her second and final autobiography in September 2008, entitled ''Catch A Falling Star''. Her condition continued to worsen over the next few months and, in February 2009, she was informed that her cancer was terminal. She died on 22 March 2009.&lt;ref name="Guardian obit"/&gt;

[[Jo O'Meara]], like Goody, was treated for mental health issues after she left the House. She gave an interview in which she described [[Suicide ideation|suicidal thoughts]].&lt;ref name="Jo after"/&gt; In a statement on 1 February, she apologised for her behaviour, and also discussed her introduction into the house, her eviction, her interview with [[Davina McCall]] and the [[death threats]] she had received.&lt;ref name="Jo statement"/&gt; A year later, she gave birth to a son. In 2015, she took part in an [[S Club 7]] reunion, and continues to work in [[animal rights]] [[activism]].&lt;ref name="Jo now"/&gt;

[[Danielle Lloyd]] faced less hostility upon her eviction from the House, and continued to be a prominent figure in the media over the course of 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="Glamour to mum"/&gt; In May 2007, she threatened to sue [[Endemol Shine UK|Endemol]] for unfair editing, and to make her own complaint to Ofcom.&lt;ref name="Danielle sues"/&gt; In 2017, Lloyd addressed the controversy in an episode of ''[[In Therapy]]''.&lt;ref name="In Therapy"/&gt;

[[Shilpa Shetty]], during her interview with McCall after being announced as the winner of the show, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Things happen, people make mistakes and we all learn from them. But I can say one thing for sure. Jade didn't mean to be racist. She isn't a racist. I really don't want to leave England putting anyone in trouble. This country has given me so much. I just want to thank all of Great Britain for giving me this fantastic opportunity to make my country proud."&lt;ref name="10 years on"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2007, her next film, entitled ''[[Life In A... Metro]]'' became the first Bollywood film to premiere in [[Leicester Square]].&lt;ref name="10 years on"/&gt; A year later, following Goody's brief appearance on ''Bigg Boss'', Shetty announced that she had forgiven her.&lt;ref name="I'll be there for Jade"/&gt;

'''Dame Edna Everage''' is a character created and performed by Australian comedian [[Barry Humphries]], known for her lilac-coloured or "[[wisteria]] hue" hair and [[cat eye glasses]] or "face furniture", her favourite flower, the [[gladiolus]] ("gladdies") and her boisterous greeting: "Hello, Possums!" As Dame Edna, Humphries has written several books including an autobiography, ''My Gorgeous Life'', appeared in several films and hosted several television shows (on which Humphries has also appeared as himself and other alter-egos).

Humphries has regularly updated Edna, originally a drab [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] housewife satirising Australian suburbia. Then he caused the Edna character to adopt an increasingly outlandish wardrobe after performances in London in the 1960s through which his Edna character grew in stature and popularity. Following film appearances and an elevation to [[Dame (title)|damehood]] in the 1970s, the character evolved to "Housewife and Superstar", then "Megastar" and finally "Gigastar". Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Dame Edna became increasingly known in North America after multiple stage and television appearances.

Edna describes her chat-shows as "an intimate conversation between two friends, one of whom is a lot more interesting than the other". The character has been used to satirise the [[cult of celebrity]], class [[snob]]bery, and [[prudishness]] and is often used by Humphries to poke fun at the political leaders and fashions of the times. Her exuberant persona and scathing commentary on society and celebrity, as well as her habit of treating celebrities like ordinary people (on her TV shows) and ordinary people like celebrities (in her stage shows) have become signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lahr|1992|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Humphries freely states that Edna is a character he plays, Edna refers to Humphries as her "entrepreneur" or manager. Humphries and his staff of assistants and writers only refer to Edna as "she" and "her", never mixing the character with Humphries himself. It is this precision and richness of identity which gives Dame Edna her unique force as a character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lahr|1992|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Humphries announced that the character would be retired at the end of the current stage tour;&lt;ref name="ABC18Mar2012"/&gt;, but as of 2013 he has decided to bring her back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneysymphony.com/production-pages/2013/concert-season/barry-humphries,-dame-edna-other-marsupials.aspx |title=Dame Edna with the Sydney Symphony |publisher=Sydney Symphony Orchestra |date= |accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character story==
While Dame Edna is a fictitious character (whose life story has been entirely created by Barry Humphries), so complete is her identity as an individual that Macmillan published ''My Gorgeous Life'', Edna's "autobiography" (written by Humphries but credited to Edna herself), on its non-fiction list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lahr|1992|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphries has also written an "Unauthorised Biography" of his life as Edna's manager: ''Handling Edna'', published in 2010.

According to ''My Gorgeous Life'', and statements Edna has made over the years, she was born Edna May Beazley in [[Wagga Wagga]], [[New South Wales]], with a sibling who would give birth to [[Barry McKenzie]]. Everage started her stage career in a sketch entitled "Olympic Hostess" in the revue ''Return Fare'' on 19 December 1955 as Mrs. Norm Everage, an "average Australian housewife" from [[Moonee Ponds]], a suburb in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. She spends her time visiting world leaders and jet-setting between her homes in Los Angeles, London, Sydney, Switzerland and [[Martha's Vineyard]]. She is a friend and confidante of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] and has advised prime ministers and presidents. Edna once took an on-air phone call from President [[Ronald Reagan]] to assure him that he was, indeed, still the president; and at stageshows she has claimed to be giving former Australian Prime Minister, [[Julia Gillard]], [[elocution]] lessons.

The character has three adult children, Bruce, Kenny, and Valmai. Her first daughter, Lois, when still an infant, went missing and was believed to have been abducted by a "rogue koala" during a family camp-out in the outback, à la [[Azaria Chamberlain]]. In ''Handling Edna, the Unauthorised Biography'', Humphries absolves the koala of any role in the affair and reveals the true fate of Lois, who in fact survived abduction to become a Catholic nun. Edna's surviving daughter, Valmai, has assisted Dame Edna on her most recent programmes for [[ITV1]], including ''[[The Dame Edna Treatment]]'' and has assisted on her live tour shows. Edna takes great pride in her two sons: Bruce, who works as an engineer in South Melbourne and is married to Joylene from [[Ivanhoe, Victoria|Ivanhoe]], and her youngest, Kenneth (or Kenny), who is a fashion designer in London and designs all of her frocks. Dame Edna refers often to him and his partner, Clifford Smale, both of whom Edna believes are searching for "Miss Right", although she admits they are looking "in some very strange places". Kenny appeared in [[Sir Les Patterson]]'s documentary ''Les Patterson and the Great Chinese Takeaway'' as a boutique owner in Hong Kong. Dame Edna's mother is incarcerated in a "maximum-security twilight home for the permanently bewildered". Valmai and Kenny are the only family members (so far) who have appeared on stage or screen with their mother. Her husband, Sir Norman Everage, died in 1988 after many years in hospital suffering from prostate problems and a "testicular murmur"; Edna founded the non-profit "Friends of the Prostate" in his honour. Dame Edna was not with Norm when he died. And due to his insistence that all his organs be donated; by the time she reached his bedside, Norm had been "globally recycled" and all that remained was "a dent in the pillow". As a result, Dame Edna almost believed that Norm's cremation was a "waste of money".

In recent years, Edna has demonstrated her social conscience and sensitivity, telling audiences of her intention to adopt an African child from "the country where Madonna shops for loved ones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aco.com.au/?url=/humphries-reviews |title=ACO Home |publisher=Aco.com.au |date= |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dame Edna spent many years accompanied by her bridesmaid and constant companion [[Madge Allsop]] (played by [[Emily Perry (English actress)|Emily Perry]]), a New Zealander from [[Palmerston North]] who assisted Dame Edna with her appearances and television shows. (Perry died at the age of 100 in 2008 and now Dame Edna's daughter Valmai has replaced her on stage). Madge never spoke a public word (although she sang on [[Comic Relief]]), and while she was often the butt of Dame Edna's jokes, the two were devoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Everage|1989 (For all of this section)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Handling Edna, the Unauthorised Biography'', Humphries gives Madge a voice and explains the sad loss of her own husband in New Zealand's boiling mud, whilst the couple were on their honeymoon.

On some of her shows (''The Dame Edna Experience'') Dame Edna was joined on stage by 'Chuck' ([[Charlton Heston]]) where he would be mildly humiliated and mistreated.

Dame Edna is praised for her insights into her homeland. When asked why Australians are so good at sport she commented: "Good food and diet; open air life; juicy steaks; sunshine — and the total absence of any kind of intellectual distraction".

Dame Edna launched a campaign to be appointed as a [[BBC]] [[news presenter|newsreader]] in 2009 after the corporation announced it wished to seek a female newsreader over 50 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='I would be stimulating to sit with'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8276000/8276111.stm|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=26 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours===
[[File:Dame Edna Place-night.JPG|thumb|180px|Dame Edna Place at night, marked by lit signs on each wall.]]
On 7 March 2007, Melbourne renamed a city street in her honour: Dame Edna Place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melbourne alley named after Dame Edna|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-03-07/melbourne-alley-named-after-dame-edna/2210862|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=7 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly Brown Alley off Little Collins Street, was officially opened by the [[Lord Mayor]] of Melbourne, [[John So]]. Dame Edna Place is opposite Royal Arcade and The Causeway, between the major roads, Elizabeth Street and Swanston Street; it was, until its renaming, a service alley for adjoining buildings. Dame Edna was not at the renaming ceremony but was represented by ten look-alike Dames. Everage Street in suburban [[Moonee Ponds]] has also been named in her honour.

In 1982, Dame Edna's alter-ego Barry Humphries was made an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] for "services to the theatre"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=869869&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|title=It's an Honour – Honours – Search Australian Honours|work=itsanhonour.gov.au|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 16 June 2007 he was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21915846-2,00.html?from=public_rss News.com.au Dame Edna wins Queen's award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102142523/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C21915846-2%2C00.html?from=public_rss |date=2 November 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[MAC Cosmetics]] 2008 Winter Line-Up, a Dame Edna collection of cosmetics were released including eye shadow, lipstick, powder, and nail polish.

A bronze statue was unveiled at [[Docklands, Victoria|Melbourne Docklands]] in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dame Edna Everage statue unveiled in Australia|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2158116.ece|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=22 January 2009}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located by the Yarra river near Harbour Town which also includes statues of singer John Farnham, Dame Nellie Melba, and Graham Kennedy.

==Invention of the character==
Barry Humphries was invited to join the fledgling [[Union Theatre Repertory Company]] early in 1955 and toured [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] country towns performing ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', directed by [[Ray Lawler]]. On tour, Humphries invented Edna gradually as part of the entertainment for the actors during commutes between country towns. Humphries gradually developed a [[falsetto]] impersonation of a Melbourne housewife, imitating the [[Country Women's Association]] representatives who welcomed the troupe in each town. At Lawler's suggestion, Mrs Everage (later named Edna after Humphries' nanny) made her first appearance in a [[Melbourne University]]'s UTRC revue at the end of 1955, as the city prepared for the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympic Games]]. The sketch involved a houseproud "average housewife" offering her [[Moonee Ponds]] home as an Olympic billet, [[wikt:spruik|spruiking]] her home as possessing "burgundy wall-to-wall carpets, [[lamington]] cakes and reindeers frosted on glass dining-room doors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/the-clown-prince-of-suburbia/story-e6frg8n6-1111118780314 |first=Graeme|last=Blundell|title=Barry Humphries, the clown prince of suburbia|date=7 February 2009|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the character was billed as "Mrs Norm Everage" (Humphries describing this name as "Everage as in 'average', husband Norm as in 'normal'")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=St. Pierre|first=Paul Matthew|title=A portrait of the artist as Australian: l'oeuvre bizarre de Barry Humphries|year=2004|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=0-7735-2644-7|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had none of the characteristic flamboyant wardrobe of later years.

His mother (whom the interviewer William Cook said "sounds like a frightful snob") was a major inspiration for Edna, although he denied it when she was alive to protect her feelings. Her first monologue in 1955 was about her "lovely home", reflecting young Barry’s own site visits accompanying his builder father. Originally she was a "mousy" character and too quiet to please the raucous crowd at [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]] club in London.&lt;ref name="William Cook pp15-18"&gt;"The consummate amateur" by William Cook, ''The Oldie'' [London], September 2016 pp. 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one author, Edna came into her own during the 1980s when the policies of [[Thatcherism]]—and what he described as the "vindictive style of the times"—allowed Dame Edna to sharpen her observations accordingly.&lt;ref name="Lahr 1992 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lahr|1992|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lahr wrote that Edna took Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher's]] "seemingly hypocritical motto" of "caring and compassion" for others and turned it on its head, Edna became the voice of Humphries' outrage.
&lt;ref name="Lahr 1992 1"/&gt;{{dubious|date=May 2012}}{{vague|date=May 2012}}

==Stage and screen performances==

=== 1950s–1999 ===
Humphries played the character at comedy clubs, satirising the atmosphere of 1950s Melbourne suburbia. An interview with "Mrs Everage" was one of the programmes screened on [[HSV-7]]'s first day of programming in 1956. Another revue called Rock'n'Reel followed in 1958 at the New Theatre in Melbourne. She appeared in a televised revue shown on New Year's Eve, 1958, ''[[Wild Life and Christmas Belles]]''.

The character's overseas debut, now as Edna Everage, was in the early 1960s at comedian [[Peter Cook]]'s nightclub, [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]], in London's West End, where she received a poor review from [[Bamber Gascoigne]], then the drama critic for ''[[The Spectator]]''. Barry Humphries cites Cook as being instrumental in launching Edna's UK career. While her first appearances at the Establishment Club was a flop, the mousy Edna being too quiet to please that raucous crowd, a 2016 interviewer William Cook saw the early failure as a blessing, so that Humphries spent the sixties as a jobbing actor rather than as a pampered star.&lt;ref name="William Cook pp15-18"/&gt;

In 1972, the character appeared as [[Barry McKenzie]]'s "Aunt Edna" in the film, ''[[The Adventures of Barry McKenzie]]''. In the sequel ''[[Barry McKenzie Holds His Own]]'', the Australian Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] cameos at the close of the film to confer upon Edna the title of [[Dame (title)|Dame]], henceforth to be known as "Dame Edna".

Following the lukewarm reception to Edna's early appearances in Humphries' 1969 stageshow ''Just a Show'' and the BBC television series ''The Barry Humphries Scandals'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/barryhumphries/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410090505/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/barryhumphries/ |archivedate=10 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a growing awareness and appreciation among British audiences for Edna emerged and Humphries devised a stage show titled ''Edna Everage Housewife Superstar'' which was successfully presented in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in the mid-1970s. The show featured monologues, songs and what was becoming an Edna trademark – interaction with the theatre audience.

In April 1976, Edna made an appearance in ''A Poke in the Eye (with a Sharp Stick)'' – the first of what became [[Amnesty International]]'s [[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Secret Policeman's Ball]] series of benefit shows. Edna performed a song for the show and was featured in the film of the show.  She also appeared in the 1981 Amnesty show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''. Edna made a cameo appearance in the 1978 film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.  In 1979 she was the subject of a [[BBC]] ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' [[mockumentary]]: ''La Dame aux Gladiolas''.

Humphries debuted the character off-Broadway in [[New York City]] in the late 1970s, but the show received such a poor review from ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Humphries later joked that he thought, "Well, I'll go back to Broadway but I'll wait till the critic's dead – and I had to wait 25 years. I had to wait a quarter of a century for that critic to die".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s864967.htm |title=ENOUGH ROPE with Andrew Denton – episode 11: Barry Humphries (26/05/2003) |publisher=ABC |date=26 May 2003 |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dame Edna's success grew in the UK throughout the 1980s and early 1990s with semi-regular stage and television shows. Her first TV specials were in 1978/79 on BBC, but she became popular with broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] after her initial performance on ''An Audience With...Dame Edna Everage'' in 1980, in front of an audience of invited celebrities. She went on to perform two more ''[[An Audience With...]]'' specials (in 1984 and 1988), the only performer ever to make three shows in the series.

In 1987, Edna starred alongside Humphries's vulgar alter-ego [[Les Patterson]] in the comedy feature ''[[Les Patterson Saves the World]]''. In the same year ''[[The Dame Edna Experience]]'', ostensibly a talk show which she described as "really a monologue interrupted by total strangers" aired, featuring high-profile "celebrity guests" such as [[Sean Connery]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Joan Rivers]], and [[Germaine Greer]] (an old friend of Humphries'), as well as Madge, her silent, sour-faced "bridesmaid and travelling companion". In 1989, the show was back for a second season, this time taking place in her "luxury penthouse suite" where her guests stayed and, in the case of [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr]], did her grocery shopping. Subsequently, these shows were aired in the U.S. on PBS, broadening her audience and enlarging her fame. ''[[Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch]]'' a reality/game show hybrid, aired in 1992, and saw her and Madge having a look at her "by invitation only, ladies audience" member's houses, and evaluating their housekeeping skills. U.S. television specials followed, as did an unsuccessful series which aired only one episode. She appeared as a guest of [[Phil Donahue]] on his talk show on 17 February 1993.

In 1997, she appeared in another television talk show ''Dr Dame Edna Kisses It Better''. Edna continued her Australian stage and television appearances including a record five appearances as guest presenter at the [[TV Week Logie Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logies2008.blogspot.com|title=TV Week Logie Awards 2008|author=Aussie TV Fan|work=logies2008.blogspot.com|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a role as a co-narrator (along with Humphries and Les Patterson) of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Australian social history series ''Barry Humphries Flashbacks'' in 1999.

=== 2000–2009 ===

In 2000 and 2004, Dame Edna appeared on Broadway, and toured America with both shows. These were ostensibly not "performances", but rather "appearances", with Dame Edna giving monologues and interacting with audience members. Her 2000 show, ''The Royal Tour,'' won the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show]], and a [[Tony Award]].

During 2001 and 2002, Dame Edna appeared in the fifth season of the television show ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' playing the guest role of Claire Otoms, a client of the show's law firm who later became a secretary at the same firm. The character shared Dame Edna's voice and style and was explicitly listed in the opening credits as being played by Dame Edna Everage (although Barry Humphries received a credit in the closing credits). Claire Otoms is an [[anagram]] of "A Sitcom Role".

In the 2002 motion picture ''[[Nicholas Nickleby (2002 film)|Nicholas Nickleby]]'' Dame Edna plays the role of Mrs. Crummles, an actress and wife of the manager of a provincial theatre company. Barry Humphries also appears in the film as Mr. Leadville.

Dame Edna appeared at the [[Party at the Palace]] in London in 2002 where she referred to the Queen as the "jubilee girl".

The nostalgic "Barry Humphries: Back to my Roots" tour featured Humphries, Edna, Sir Les and [[Sandy Stone (Barry Humphries character)|Sandy Stone]] around Australia in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/06/1057430074172.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Back to my roots and other suckers, Barry Humphries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, she had an interview punctuated with NPR Weekend Edition's host Scott Simon's table-pounding laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=935921 | series=Weekend Edition |title=A Bit of a Chat with Dame Edna| network=NPR | date=25 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character celebrated her 50th "birthday" in 2005. To mark the occasion, in 2006, [[Australia Post]] featured Edna on a postage stamp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/hello-possums-as-dame-edna-comes-in-for-a-good-licking/2006/01/20/1137734154379.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Hello Possums, as Dame Edna comes in for a good licking | date=21 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lord Mayor of Melbourne]] presented Edna with the key to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1722232.htm |title=The World Today – Melbourne fetes Dame Edna |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She toured Australia with the stageshow "Barry Humphries Back With a Vengeance" and appeared on camera "together" with Humphries for the first time in an interview by [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]] for Australia's [[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/stories/raymartin/259443/great-dame |title=Great Dame |publisher=Sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au |date=3 September 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927013512/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/stories/raymartin/259443/great-dame |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared on screen at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony|Closing Ceremony]] of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in Melbourne while 1000 "Commonwealth Dames" danced around the arena wearing purple wigs, garish costumes and gladioli, singing along to her song, "We've Made The Most Of Melbourne" : "It's not as small as Adelaide, Compared to Canberra, it's bliss, And if you've been to Melbourne, You can give Sydney a miss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/commonwealth-games/melbourne-we-did-it/2006/03/26/1143330923113.html?page=fullpage | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Melbourne, we did it! | date=26 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2006 she appeared on ITV's coverage of [[The Prince's Trust]] 30th Birthday Concert. During the telethon-style segments of the event, she took part in a game of ''[[Blind Date (UK TV series)|Blind Date]]'' picking former ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]'' contestant [[Chico Slimani]] over actors [[Roger Moore]] and [[Richard E Grant]].

In the summer of 2006, Dame Edna appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' alongside [[Billy Crystal]]. On 23 September 2006, during an interview on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', she revealed that she would be returning to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 2007 with a new chat show called ''[[The Dame Edna Treatment]]''. The show began on Saturday 17 March 2007, with the set-up being that Edna runs a health spa where various famous guests come for treatment.

On 17 December 2006 Dame Edna appeared as a guest panellist on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] TV Show ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'' where she sang with presenter [[Adam Hills (comedian)|Adam Hills]]. On 16 December 2007 she appeared as the last guest on the final episode of the ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' UK talk show. On 29 May 2008 she appeared on ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'' alongside [[Ray Mears]] and [[Alanis Morissette]]. On 8 August 2008 she appeared on ''[[Loose Women]]'' on the final show of that year's series. On 12 September and 15 December 2008, and also on 27 May 2009, she made guest appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.

Accompanied by her daughter Valmai in America and Sir Les Patterson in the UK, Dame Edna again toured with what was declared ''My First Last Tour''. On television in early 2009, she appeared in adverts to publicise the insurance company [[Norwich Union]]'s change of name to [[Aviva]], quoting her change of name from Mrs Everage. On 9 June 2009, she appeared as a guest on ''The Late Late Show'' with Craig Ferguson. On 17 July 2009, she appeared as a guest on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]''. On an episode of ''[[The One Show]]'' in September 2009 a piece of graffiti on [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]'s [[Penshaw Monument]] read "Edna Woz Ere 09" and a pair of Everage's signature glasses were drawn next to it. Dame Edna performed the "Last Night of the Poms" at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] accompanying the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] on 15 September 2009 and on 21 September, she appeared as a guest on Channel 4's "The Paul O'Grady Show", where she complained of a burst appendix in Australia, but said of course she was happy to be back in the UK.

=== 2010–present ===
[[File:Edna statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of Dame Edna at [[Docklands, Victoria|Waterfront City, Docklands]], Melbourne]]
In early 2010 Dame Edna collaborated with [[cabaret]] pianist and singer [[Michael Feinstein]] for a two-person revue in the US entitled "All About Me", based on the premise that the pair were rivals who were forced to work together for the show's sake. The show opened as the second production for the newly refurbished [[Henry Miller's Theatre]] and was planned to run from 18 March through 18 July 2010 (with previews beginning on 22 February), but lukewarm reviews and low ticket sales led to the limited engagement being cut short and closing on 4 April 2010, after 27 previews and 20 regular performances.&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138257-Brief-Duet-Broadways-All-About-Me-with-Feinstein-and-Everage-to-Close-April-4 "Brief Duet: Broadway's All About Me, with Feinstein and Everage, to Close 4 April"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331191613/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138257-Brief-Duet-Broadways-All-About-Me-with-Feinstein-and-Everage-to-Close-April-4 |date=31 March 2010 }} playbill.com, 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2010, she appeared on the television talk show ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' as a guest host to promote the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzukBruUuzo |title= Dame Edna on 'The View' | series = The View | date = 25 March 2010 | network = ABC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2012 Humphries announced he would "retire" the Dame Edna character because he was "beginning to feel a bit senior".&lt;ref name="ABC18Mar2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-03-18/dame-edna-calls-it-a-day/3897072|title=Curtains for Humphries' Dame Edna Everage|publisher=ABC News/AFP|date=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2003 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine invited Dame Edna to write a satirical advice column. She created a storm of controversy with a piece published in the February 2003 issue. Replying to a reader who asked if she should learn Spanish, she wrote:
:"Forget Spanish. There's nothing in that language worth reading except ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and a quick listen to the CD of ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' will take care of that ... Who speaks it that you are really desperate to talk to? The help? Your leaf blower?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/09/thirteen-things-we-got-wrong_slideshow_item8_9 |title=Sorry, Wrong Cover |work=Vanity Fair |date=4 September 2013|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7892682.stm |title=Dame Edna: Why the fuss? |work=BBC News |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Hispanic community read this reply as a racist remark and complaints flooded in to the magazine. Actress [[Salma Hayek]] responded angrily, penning a furious letter in which she denounced Dame Edna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/14/spain.duncancampbell |title=Dame Edna treads on Spanish toe |work=The Guardian |date=14 February 2003|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Vanity Fair'' received death threats, the magazine published a full-page apology to the Hispanic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/16/opinion/op-rrodriguez16 |title=Dear Edna: Why Can't We Laugh Anymore? |work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 February 2003|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphries commented later: "If you have to explain satire to someone, you might as well give up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feneley|first1=Rick|title=Poetry professor Barry Spurr: master of parody or bigotry?|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/poetry-professor-barry-spurr-master-of-parody-or-bigotry-20141024-11azyf.html|accessdate=30 July 2015|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dame Edna was questioned about the controversy on the eve of her 2003 Australian tour, she retorted that Hayek's denunciation was due to "professional jealousy", and that Hayek was envious because the role of painter [[Frida Kahlo]] (for which Hayek received an Oscar nomination) had originally been offered to Edna:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was offered the part of Frida I turned it down, and she was the second choice. I said 'I'm not playing the role of a woman with a moustache and a monobrow, and I'm not having same-sex relations on the screen' ... I'm not racist. I love all races, particularly white people. You know, I even like Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/30/1051381998838.html |title=Still playing the dame |work=The Age |date=1 May 2003|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/a-brush-with-edna-26437301.html |title=A brush with Edna |work=Independent.ie |date=26 November 2012|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{nihongo|"'''Dennō Senshi Porygon'''"|でんのうせんしポリゴン|Dennō Senshi Porigon|translated as "Cyber Soldier Porygon", although more commonly "Electric Soldier Porygon"|lead=yes}} is the thirty-eighth episode of the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]]'s [[List of Pokémon episodes (season 1)|first season]]. Its only broadcast was in [[Japan]] on December 16, 1997. In the episode, [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]] and his friends find at the local [[Pokémon Center]] that there is something wrong with the [[Poké Ball]] transmitting device. To find out what is wrong, they must go inside the machine.

The episode is infamous for certain repetitive visual effects that induced [[photosensitive epilepsy|photosensitive epileptic]] [[seizure]]s in a substantial number of Japanese viewers, an incident referred to as the {{nihongo|"Pokémon Shock"|ポケモンショック|Pokémon Shokku|}} by the Japanese press. As a result of the seizures 685 viewers were taken to hospitals; 2 people remained hospitalized for more than two weeks. Due to this, the episode has not been [[Pokémon episodes removed from rotation|rebroadcast]] worldwide. After the incident, the ''Pokémon'' anime went into a four-month [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]], and it returned on [[TV Tokyo]] on April 16, 1998, thus making the episode perhaps the most controversial episode of the entire ''Pokémon'' series. Since then, the episode has been parodied and referenced in cultural media, including ''[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo|The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Chinpokomon|South Park]]''.

==Plot==
[[Ash Ketchum|Ash]], [[Misty (Pokémon)|Misty]], [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]] and [[Pikachu]] discover that the system used to transfer Pokémon from one Pokémon Center to the other is malfunctioning. On [[List of Pokémon anime characters#Nurse Joy|Nurse Joy]]'s request, they go to Professor Akihabara, the one who created the Poké Ball transfer system. He tells them that [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]] stole his prototype [[Porygon]], a digital Pokémon that can exist in [[cyberspace]], and is using it to steal trainers' Pokémon from inside the computer system.

Akihabara sends Ash, Misty, Brock, Pikachu and his second Porygon into the system to stop Team Rocket, whom they learn have set up a blockade that stops Pokéballs from traveling the network. Porygon is able to defeat Team Rocket's Porygon, but Nurse Joy, monitoring the situation and unaware that Ash and the others are inside, has sent an anti-virus program into the system to combat the [[computer virus]] Team Rocket set up. Pikachu uses a Thunderbolt attack on the program, which manifests as "vaccine missiles", which causes an explosion. The group and Team Rocket successfully escape the computer, and with Team Rocket's blockade removed, the system returns to normal.

Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by the ''Pokémon'' episode was unprecedented.&lt;ref name="banned" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washington" /&gt;

An article in ''[[USA Today]]'' reassured parents that American children were unlikely to suffer seizures provoked by cartoons as US networks did not air anime, with its "fast-paced style of animation",&lt;ref name="cityrain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://angkor.com/cityrain/pokemon.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107010228/http://angkor.com/cityrain/pokemon.shtml|archivedate=November 7, 2005 |title=Forbidden Pokémon |publisher=Angkor.com |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though anime has become more prevalent on American television since. The incident was included in the 2004 edition and the 2008 [[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Gamer's Edition]] of the [[Guinness World Records]] book, holding the record for "Most Photosensitive Epileptic Seizures Caused by a Television Show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Records: The biggest load of ...|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/682831161.html?dids=682831161:682831161&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+25%2C+2004&amp;author=Vinay+Menon&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Records+The+biggest+load+of+...|last=Menon|first=Vinay|date=August 25, 2004 |publisher=Toronto Star|page=F04|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Record Book Focused on the Gamers|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/journalnow/access/1464448681.html?dids=1464448681:1464448681&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+17%2C+2008&amp;author=Tim+Clodfelter%3B+Journal+reporter&amp;pub=Winston-Salem+Journal&amp;desc=RECORD+BOOK+FOCUSED+ON+THE+GAMERS|first=Tim|last=Clodfelter|date=April 17, 2008 |publisher=Winston-Salem Journal|page=1|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
News of the incident spread quickly through Japan. The following day the television station that had originated the lone broadcast of that episode, TV Tokyo, issued an apology to the Japanese public, suspended the program, and said it would investigate the cause of the seizures.&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt; Officers from [[Atago, Minato, Tokyo|Atago]] Police stations were ordered by Japan's [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] to question the anime's producers about the show's contents and production process.&lt;ref name="Wudunn"/&gt; An emergency meeting was held by the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]], in which the case was discussed with experts and information collected from hospitals. Video retailers all over Japan removed the ''Pokémon'' anime from their rental shelves.&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt;

Reaction was swift on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], and [[Nintendo]]'s shares fell by 400 [[yen]] (almost 5%) the following morning to 12,200 yen.&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asahi"/&gt; Nintendo produces the game upon which the ''Pokémon'' anime series is based. Then-president of Nintendo, [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]], said at a press conference the day after the episode had aired that the video game company was not responsible since the [[Pokémon Red and Blue|original ''Pokémon'' game]] for its [[Game Boy]] product was presented in black and white.&lt;ref name="Asahi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Popular TV cartoon blamed for mass seizures|date=December 17, 2008|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualpet.com/vp/farm/pmonster/seizures/pmnews1.htm |title=Pocket Monsters Seizures News Coverage|publisher=Virtualpet.com |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the airing of "Dennō Senshi Porygon", the ''Pokémon'' anime went into a four-month [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] until it returned in April 16, 1998 with airing of "Pikachu's Goodbye" and "The Battling Eevee Brothers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-03-27/10th-anniversary-of-pokemon-in-japan|title= 10th Anniversary of Pokémon in Japan|date=March 27, 2007|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2002/60/hamilton.html|title=Empire of Kitsch: Japan as Represented in Western Pop Media|last=Hamilton |first=Robert|date=April 2002|publisher=Bad Subjects|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the hiatus, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday.&lt;ref name="aki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home-aki.cool.ne.jp/soudou.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113092133/http://home-aki.cool.ne.jp/soudou.htm|archivedate=January 13, 2008|script-title=ja:ポケモン騒動を検証する|publisher=TVアニメ資料館|language=Japanese|accessdate=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pokémon theme songs|opening theme]] was also redone, and black screens showing various Pokémon in spotlights were broken up into four images per screen. Before the seizure incident, the opening was originally one Pokémon image per screen.&lt;ref name="aki"/&gt; Before the resumption of broadcast, {{nihongo|"Problem Inspection Report on Pocket Monster Animated  Series"|アニメ ポケットモンスター問題検証報告|Anime Poketto Monsutā Mondai Kenshō Hōkoku}} was shown. Broadcast in Japan on April 16, 1998, host Miyuki Yadama went over the circumstances of the program format and the on-screen advisories at the beginning of animated programs, as well as showing letters and fan drawings sent in by viewers, most of whom were concerned that the incident would lead to the anime being cancelled.&lt;ref name="aki"/&gt; Many Japanese television broadcasters and medical officials came together to find ways to make sure the incident was not repeated. They established a series of guidelines for future animated programs,&lt;ref name="washington"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/kouhou/guideenglish.htm|title=Animated Program Image Effect Production Guidelines|publisher=TV Tokyo|accessdate=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* Flashing images, especially those with red, should not flicker faster than three times per second. If the image does not have red, it still should not flicker faster than five times per second.
* Flashing images should not be displayed for a total duration of more than two seconds.
* Stripes, whirls and concentric circles should not take up a large part of the television screen.

This episode kept the episodes "Rougela's Christmas" ("Holiday Hi-Jynx") and "Iwark as a Bivouac" ("Snow Way Out!") off their original broadcast date in Japan following the incident. Those two episodes were about to air after "Dennō Senshi Porygon" on December 23, 1997 and January 6, 1998 respectively. They were eventually only aired on October 5, 1998 as an hour-long special. Airing out of order caused confusion to viewers because Ash still had a [[Charmander]] instead of [[Charizard]], and Misty did not have [[Togepi]] yet, but [[Starmie]] and [[List of Pokémon (102–151)#Horsea|Horsea]]. Also, a New Year special was about to air between these episodes on December 30, 1997, but it was cancelled after [[TV Tokyo]] pulled any mention of Pokémon from their channel following the incident.

To prevent any similar incidents from occurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, and it has not aired since in any country.&lt;ref name="banned"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/58544/11-controversies-caused-cartoons|title=11 Controversies Caused by Cartoons|author=Conradt, Stacy|publisher=Mental Floss, Inc.|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Pokémon incident, TV broadcasters voluntarily added on-screen warnings to shows targeted at young children encouraging viewers to watch anime in a well-lit room and to sit far away from the television set.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Sevakis. {{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2017-06-21/.117773 |title=Answerman - What Happened To The 'Watch This Program In A Well-Lit Room' Warnings? |accessdate=August 14, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621214110/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2017-06-21/.117773 |archivedate=June 21, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}, June 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to put the event out of public concern and prevent victims from reliving the traumatizing event, the anime has not featured Porygon in any subsequent episodes.&lt;ref name="absoluteanime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteanime.com/pokemon/porygon.htm|title=Character Profile: Porygon|last=Innes|first=Kenneth|publisher=Absolute Anime|accessdate=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
The "Pokémon Shock" incident has been parodied many times in [[popular culture]], including an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]],'' "[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]". In the episode, the [[Simpson family]] travels to Japan. When they arrive at their hotel in Tokyo, Bart is seen watching an anime entitled Battling Seizure Robots featuring robots with flashing eye lasers, and asks: "Isn't this that cartoon that causes seizures?", and the flashing eyes cause him to have a seizure. Marge and Lisa are also affected and Homer walks in seeing them all convulsing on the floor and joins in. The same scene is seen again in the episode's end credits, this time covering the entire screen.&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

An episode of ''South Park'' that first aired in November 1999, "[[Chinpokomon]]", revolves around a ''Pokémon''-like phenomenon, called ''Chinpokomon'', with which the children of South Park become obsessed. ''Chinpokomon'' toys and video games are sold to American children in South Park by a Japanese company. The company's president, Mr. Hirohito, uses the toys to brainwash the American children, making them into his own army to topple the "evil" American "empire". These toys included a video game in which the player attempts to [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bomb Pearl Harbor]]. While playing this game, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] has an epileptic seizure and [[They killed Kenny|later dies]], in reference to the ''Pokémon'' seizure incident.&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

In the pilot episode of ''[[Drawn Together]]'', [[List of Drawn Together characters#Ling-Ling|Ling-Ling]], who is a parody of Pikachu, states that his goal in the Drawn Together house is to "destroy all, and give children seizures". There follows a scene with flashing lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=`Together' dances to edge of offensiveness|last=Maureen|first=Ryan|date=October 27, 2004 |publisher=Chicago Tribune|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[So Yesterday (novel)|So Yesterday]]'', a novel by [[Scott Westerfeld]], this episode is mentioned and shown to one of the characters. The flashing red light that caused the seizure is also used in the story telling elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Westerfeld|first=Scott|title=So Yesterday|publisher=Razorbill |date=September 8, 2005|isbn=1595140328|url=https://www.amazon.com/So-Yesterday-Scott-Westerfeld/dp/1595140328|accessdate=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre often deals with issues concerned with [[economics]],  typically about [[business]], [[investing]], and [[finance|money]]. Economic films often touch upon themes that occur in the everyday world of business or in the economy in a general sense. Economics films have often been utilized to focus on economic, financial, political, social and philosophical issues.

Common subject matter involving economic films are diverse.

==Plot==
Five years after [[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|the first film]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, [[Dominic Toretto]] ([[Vin Diesel]]) and his new crew, consisting of his girlfriend Letty ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), Tego Leo ([[Tego Calderon]]), Rico Santos ([[Don Omar]]), Cara ([[Mirtha Michelle]]) and [[Han Lue]] ([[Sung Kang]]), are hijacking fuel tankers in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Dominic suspects that the police are on their trail, forcing the crew to disband and go their separate ways, with Han deciding to go to Tokyo. Realizing that he must leave, Dominic runs, leaving Letty behind to protect her from harm.

Three months later, Dominic is now residing in [[Panama City]]. He gets a call from his sister, Mia Toretto ([[Jordana Brewster]]), who tells him that Letty has been murdered. Dominic heads back to Los Angeles to attend her funeral and examine the crash and finds traces of [[nitromethane]] on the ground. He visits the only car mechanic that sells nitromethane in LA and forces him into giving him the name David Park, the man who ordered the fuel, and informs him that the only car that uses nitromethane in the area is a green 1972 [[Ford Gran Torino]] Sport.

Meanwhile, [[FBI]] agent [[Brian O'Conner]] ([[Paul Walker]]) is trying to track down a Mexican drug lord, Arturo Braga ([[John Ortiz]]). His search leads him to David Park, and he tracks him down using an illegal modification record on his car. Dominic arrives at Park's apartment first and hangs him out of the window by his ankles before Brian arrives. Brian saves Park and Park becomes the FBI's new informant. Park gets Brian into a [[Street racing|street race]]. Brian selects a [[Modified car|modified]] 2002 [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] R34&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_239575-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-R34-2002.html/ 2002 Nissan Skyline GT-R &amp;#91;R34&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; from the impound lot. Dominic races in his modified 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] SS 454. [[Gisele Yashar]] ([[Gal Gadot]]), the liaison for Braga, reveals that the winner will become the last driver on a team that traffics [[heroin]] between the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Dominic wins by bumping Brian's car while it is in nitro, making him lose control. Brian uses his power as an FBI agent to arrest another driver, Dwight Mueller, and takes his place on the team.

The team meets up with Braga's personal henchman, Fenix, and Dominic notices that Fenix drives the same Torino the mechanic described. They drive across the border using underground tunnels to avoid detection. Brian has prior knowledge that after the heroin was delivered, Braga ordered the drivers to be killed. Upon discovering this, Dominic confronts Fenix and learns that he himself killed Letty when she tried to escape him. A stand-off ensues, though not before Dominic creates a diversion by loosening his car with nitrous &amp;ndash; sparking a vehicle explosion that destroys his car and several others, including Brian's. In the ensuing chaos, Dominic and Brian hijack a 1999 [[Hummer H1]] with $60 million worth of heroin in it. Dominic and Brian drive back to LA and hide the heroin in a police impound lot, where Brian picks up a modified [[Subaru Impreza]] WRX STI Hatchback; they subsequently drive back to Dominic's house, where they reunite with Mia.

Dominic finds out Brian was the last person to contact Letty, which results in Dominic attacking Brian until Brian explains that Letty was working undercover - she was tracking down Braga in exchange for clearing Dominic's record. Brian tells his superiors that in exchange for Dominic's pardon, he will lure Braga into a trap, forcing him to show up to exchange money for the heroin. At the drop site, the man who claims to be "Braga" is revealed as a decoy, and "Campos" &amp;ndash; the real Braga &amp;ndash; escapes with Fenix and the pair flee to [[Mexico]]. In the ensuing chaos, Fenix nearly runs over Gisele, before Dom saves her.

Brian and Dominic travel to Mexico to catch Braga, with the help of Gisele, who gives them directions as a favored return for Dom saving her life. Brian and Dom find him at a church and apprehend him. As Braga's henchmen try to rescue him, Brian and Dominic drive through the underground tunnels back to the United States. Brian crashes his car after taking fire from Braga's men. He is then injured after being [[side collision|T-boned]] by Fenix. Before Fenix can kill Brian, Dominic drives into and kills Fenix. As police and helicopters approach the crash site on the American side of the border, Brian tells Dominic to leave, but Dominic refuses &amp;ndash; saying he is not running anymore. Despite Brian's request for clemency, the judge sentences Dominic to 25 years to life. Brian resigns from the FBI and Dominic boards a prison bus that will transport him to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc|Lompoc penitentiary]]. As the bus drives down the road, Brian, Mia, Leo, and Santos arrive in their cars to intercept it.

==Production==
The film was announced in July 2007. [[Vin Diesel]], [[Paul Walker]], and the rest of the cast of the original film all reprised their roles. Filming began in 2008. The movie cars were built in Southern California's San Fernando Valley. Around 240 cars were built for the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedaltothefloor.com/fast-and-furious-2009-the-two-big-car-stars/ More Cars and More Action in Fast &amp; Furious] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122627/http://www.pedaltothefloor.com/fast-and-furious-2009-the-two-big-car-stars/ |date=April 2, 2015 }} pedal to the floor March 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, the replica vehicles do not match the specifications they were supposed to represent. For example, the replica version of ''F-Bomb'', a 1973 [[Chevrolet Camaro]] built by Tom Nelson of NRE and David Freiburger of ''[[Hot Rod (magazine)|Hot Rod]]'' magazine, included a 300&amp;nbsp;hp crate V8 engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission, whereas the actual car included a [[twin-turbo]] 1,500&amp;nbsp;hp engine and a 5-speed transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/features/fast-furious-cars-1973-f-bomb-camaro.html The F-Bomb Drops on Fast &amp; Furious] Edmunds Insideline March 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Dodge Charger 426 Hemi R/T that was used in the original movie was a 1970, but the car in this movie was a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi with a slightly modified front grill and rear tail lights to appear as a 1970 car; the original 1970 Dodge Charger was in pieces, being totally disassembled for restoration.

The original red 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 seen in the end credits of the first Fast &amp; Furious movie, also makes an appearance but is later highly modified for a street race.

The most radical vehicles built for the film were the Chevy trucks constructed for the fuel heist. Powered by 502ci GM big block motors, the '67 had a giant ladder-bar suspension with airbags using a massive 10-ton semi rear axle with the biggest and widest truck tires they could find. The '88 Chevy Crew Cab was built with twin full-floating GM 1-ton axles equipped with Detroit Lockers and a transfer case directing power to both axles and capable of four-wheel burnouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0905_fast_furious_movie_cars/musclecars_destruction.html Fast &amp; Furious Movie Cars – Faster And More Furious] Hod Rod Magazine, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another vehicle built for the film was the blue Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 owned by an uncredited owner which brought a 241-mile per hour top speed at the Bayshore Route Highway in Japan. It was a hard car to build by the production so they made clones by acquiring Nissan Skyline 25GT's and made them look like the original car. The Skyline 
that was also used at the desert was actually a dune buggy using a Skyline R34's shell.

==Music==

Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gives the film a B+, saying, "Fast &amp; Furious is still no ''[[Point Break]]''. But it's perfectly aware of its limited dramatic mission...and...it offers an attractive getaway route from self-importance, snark, and chatty comedies about male bonding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' thought this movie was the first real sequel to the first and also gave it a positive review, writing, "''Fast &amp; Furious'' is the first true sequel of the bunch. By reuniting the two male stars from the original and...continuing the story from the first film, this new film should re-ignite the franchise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave it a positive review, providing viewers were car fans, writing, "If you're a lover of stomach-clenching speed that turns the world into a neon blur...then ''Fast &amp; Furious'', the fourth edition of that metal-twisting series, should leave you exhausted and satiated for a very long time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Roger Ebert]], who gave positive reviews to the previous films, gave an unfavorable review of the film, writing, "I admire the craft involved, but the movie leaves me profoundly indifferent. After three earlier movies in the series, which have been transmuted into video games, why do we need a fourth one? Oh. I just answered my own question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090401/REVIEWS/904029995 |title= Fast &amp; Furious | work= Chicago Sun-Times |date = April 1, 2009 |accessdate = April 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
On its first day of release the movie grossed $30.6 million, and peaked at the top spot of the weekend box office with $70,950,500, more than ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift|Tokyo Drift]]'' earned in its entire domestic run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/?sortdate=2009-04-03&amp;p=.htm |title= Daily Box Office for Friday, 3 April 2009 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | work = Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had the sixth-biggest opening weekend of 2009 and was double what most industry observers expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joshua |last=Rich |title=''Fast &amp; Furious'' shatters box office records |url= http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/04/05/boxoffice.ew/index.html?section=cnn_latest |publisher= [[Time Inc.]] &lt;!-- republished at CNN.com --&gt; | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Graphic Artists Guild''' is a [[guild]] of [[graphic designer]]s, [[illustrators]], and [[photographers]] and is organized into seven chapters around the [[United States]]. It is a member of the international organization [[Icograda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://graphicartistsguild.org/Membership_Benefits/information-services |title=Information Services |author=Graphic Artists Guild |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the mid-1960s most automobile advertising contained illustrations, not photographs. Many of the illustrators who worked for the advertising agencies servicing the automobile industry were unhappy with their pay and working conditions. Many were members of the [[Society of Illustrators]], but they were told that the Society did not do advocacy work. So those artists banded together to form the Guild as a union of artists. On November 2, 1967, the Graphic Artists Guild charter, based on the [[Screen Actors Guild]] constitution, was signed in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], by 113 artists. After the Detroit chapter, and the first national office (eventually located in [[New York City]]), were founded, artists organized chapters in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]; and [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="Shaftel"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.graphicartistsguild.org/typeroom/assets/uploads/guild_news/guild_news_2007/2007.03.04.pdf|title=Proud To Be A Union Artist, Part One: Yes, the Graphic Artists Guild Is Really a Labor Union|first=Lisa |last=Shaftel|date=2007-03-04|publisher=Graphic Artists Guild News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illustratorsireland.com/index.php/features/fullstory/graphic_artists_guild/|date=2002-04-10|title=IGI Feature: Graphic Artists Guild|publisher=Illustrators Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benner"&gt;{{cite book|title=Work in the New Economy: Flexible Labor Markets in Silicon Valley|author=Chris Benner|pages=163–167|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|ISBN=0-631-23250-8|location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the Detroit chapter called a strike against [[Campbell-Ewald]], the advertising agency that serviced [[Chevrolet]]. Guild members struck for better wages and the right of Campbell-Ewald's freelance graphic artists to accept work from other clients. The strike failed when Campbell-Ewald hired [[Strikebreaker|scabs]] to break the strike. With the failure of the strike the Detroit chapter declined and the Guild's headquarters was moved to New York.&lt;ref name="Shaftel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benner" /&gt;

Over the years, the Guild has merged with several other artists groups, including the [[Illustrators Guild]] in 1976, the [[Graphic Artists for Self-Preservation]] and the [[Creative Designers Guild]] in 1978, the [[Textile Designers Guild]] in 1979, the [[Cartoonist Guild]] in 1984, the [[Coalition of Designers]] in 1987, and the Society of Professional Graphic Artists in Seattle became the Guild’s Seattle chapter in 1993.&lt;ref name="Shaftel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleguild.org/guild/page/history/about/ |title=SPGA/Seattle Chapter |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204030453/http://www.seattleguild.org/guild/page/history/about/ |archivedate=February 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the Guild sued the Illustrators Partnership of America and five individuals for [[libel]] regarding what the Guild considered [[defamation|defamatory]] public comments in connection with the IPA's effort to form a separate illustrators rights-collecting society with 13 organizations, the [[American Society of Illustrators Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ami.org/2008/graphic-artists-guild-sues-artists-for-forming-asip.html "Graphic Artists Guild Sues Artists for Forming ASIP"], Graphic Artists Guild [[press release]], via the [[Association of Medical Illustrators]], December 1, 2008. [https://www.webcitation.org/5ytpWTdeE WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Judge Debra James of the Supreme Court, Civil Branch, [[New York County]], dismissed this [[US$]]1 million-dollar [[tortious interference]] and defamation lawsuit. The Guild filed a motion to appeal.

==UAW Affiliation==
For most of its history, the Graphic Artists Guild has been an independent union, negotiating its first collective bargaining contract for artists at the [[Sesame Workshop|Children’s Television Workshop]] in 1986. In 1993 the Guild became the collective bargaining agent for the graphic artists employed at [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) primary member station, [[WNET]]. After years of negotiations with the [[American Federation of Teachers]], [[Communications Workers of America]], and the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW), the Guild in 1999 voted to affiliate with the UAW, becoming Local 3030. Affecting the Guild's decision were the experiences of the [[National Writers Union]], which had seen 50% membership growth under UAW auspices.&lt;ref name="Shaftel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.graphicartistsguild.org/typeroom/assets/uploads/guild_news/guild_news_1999/99_01_02.pdf|title=The Time Has Come for Affiliation|author=Brett Harvey|date=1999-01-02|publisher=Graphic Artists Guild News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Guild membership declined from 2,083 in 1999 to 1,832 in 2003, the Guild's affiliation with UAW became economically unfeasible. In 2004, a majority of the Guild members voted to disaffiliate at the end of the five-year agreement.&lt;ref name="Dangle" /&gt;

==Advocacy==
In the 1970s, Guild lobbying helped sway the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Royalty Tribunal]] to raise fees and improve reporting procedures regarding use of previously published art for [[PBS]] and its affiliate stations.&lt;ref name="Shaftel" /&gt;

In 1979, the Guild began a long-term campaign to stop [[work-for-hire]] contracts, where the art buyer assumes control over a freelance artist's work. A 1989 Supreme Court decision, [[Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid]], followed the Guild's position to rule that a company obtaining the services of a freelancer cannot compel a work-for-hire situation, or assume one is in place, unless both parties sign a written contract agreeing to such an arrangement.&lt;ref name="Shaftel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf|title=Works Made for Hire Under the 1976 Copyright Act|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=2004-11-01|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Guild represented a group of textile designers, terminated by Print-a-Pattern for trying to form a union, in an unfair labor practices action before the [[National Labor Relations Board]].&lt;ref name="Shaftel" /&gt;

In the early 1980s, artists' fair-practices law based on the Guild's model law were passed in California, New York, and Oregon. In response to Guild opposition, the IRS withdrew a proposed rule that would have disallowed a home studio deduction where the artist had a primary source of income at another location and from another type of work.&lt;ref name="Shaftel" /&gt;

In 1985, the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] chapter succeeded in passing the Arts Preservation Act in [[Massachusetts]], which states, "No person, except an artist who owns or possesses a work of fine art which the artist has created, shall intentionally commit, or authorize the intentional commission of any physical defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction of a work of fine art."&lt;ref name="Shaftel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/231-85s.htm|title=The General Laws of Massachusetts; PART III.

Under the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], writers and artists were barred from deducting expenses except in the year in which they booked the income for those expenses. The Graphic Artists Guild and 44 other artists groups successfully lobbied to have that provision repealed in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/us/tax-bill-is-lifting-curbs-on-julia-child-s-oregano.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Graphic%20Artists%20Guild&amp;st=cse|title=Tax Bill Is Lifting Curbs On Julia Child's Oregano|author=Irving Molotsky|date=1988-11-06|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Northern California Chapter lobbied the state's Board of Equalization on behalf of illustrator Heather Preston. This effort resulted in a ruling that virtually exempts sales tax on all on the artwork of graphic artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norcal.gag.org/news/2002/02_08_02_SalesTax_Victory.html|title=Sales Tax: A Long Battle Won|author=Mike Friedrich|date=2002-02-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030826041636/http://norcal.gag.org/news/2002/02_08_02_SalesTax_Victory.html |archivedate=2003-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graphicartistsguild.org/theguild/what-the-guild-is/|title=What the Guild is|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Graphic Artists Guild filed suit against [[Google]] to halt further development of the [[Google Books Library Project]]. The issue in the lawsuit is Google’s digitization of millions of books for the benefit of Google Books. The books in dispute include protected visual works, such as photographs, illustrations, and charts. Google had previous negotiated a settlement with text authors and other rights holders whose work was unlawfully digitized, but that agreement did not address the rights of visual artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/technology/07google.html?scp=168&amp;sq=Graphic+Artists+Guild&amp;st=nyt|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2010-04-06|title=Visual Artists to Sue Google Over Vast Library Project|author=Miguel Helft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/04/prweb3846334.htm|date=2010-04-09|title=Graphic Artists Guild Sues Google|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|author=Patricia McKiernan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/23/authors-opt-out-google-book-settlement|title=Thousands of authors opt out of Google book settlement|date=2010-02-23|author=Alison Flood|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ia32c20e0500d8fa5196c4f564a11198a|author=Glenn Peoples|title=Business Matters: SoundExchange, Google, Live Nation and more|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Handgame''', also known as '''stickgame''', is a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[guessing game]].

==Rules==
[[Image:Handgamepieces.png|thumb|Handgame bones.]]
Any number of people can play the Hand Game, but each team (the "hiding" team and the "guessing" team) must have one leader each. The Hand Game is played with two pairs of 'bones', each pair consisting of one plain and one striped bone. Typically ten sticks are used as counters with some variations using additional count sticks such as extra stick or "kick Stick" won by the starting team. The "raw" or "uncooked" counting sticks will be divided evenly between both opposing teams. 
Different rules such as which bone will be guessed, the plain or striped bone, is determined by the traditional format of the tribe or region  - the plain bone or the striped bone. California, Oklahoma, and Dakota Indians generally call for the striped bone, where as most other tribes prefer to guess for the plain bone. 
The two teams, one "hiding" and one "guessing," sit opposite one another; two members of the "hiding" team take a pair of bones and hide them, one in each hand, while the team sings, and uses traditional instruments(drums, sticks, rattles, clappers), and attempts to distract the "guessing" team. The leader or 'Captain' of the "guessing" team, or a team member selected by the Captain, then must guess the pattern of the hidden bones. Since each hider holds one plain and one striped bone in each hand, there are initially four possibilities: both to the left, both to the right, both inside, or both outside. A gesture with a stick or hand generally accompanies each call.  For each hider mis-guessed, the calling team must turn over one stick to the hiders . If a hider is guessed he must surrender the guessed bones to the calling side. The side continues hiding and singing until both pairs of bones have been guessed and surrendered. Then the teams reverse roles, and the game continues in this manner until one team holds all the sticks.

==History==
[[File:Stick game set Travellers Rest Montana 2012.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Stick game set]]
[[File:Bag with 65 Inlaid Gambling Sticks, Tsimshian (Native American), 19th century, 05.588.7348.jpg|thumb|Bag with 65 Inlaid Gambling Sticks, [[Tsimshian]], 19th century]]
Handgame predates recorded history. The oral tradition tells us that people originally learned Handgame from the animals. Historical documentation states that games were once played for land use and female companionship, and later on for horses and cattle. Today, handgame is played during traditional gatherings, [[powwow]]s, tribal celebrations, and more recently in tournaments hosted by individual tribes or Indian organizations. More recent versions of handgame played by tribes in the Northwest added an extra stick, or "kickstick"; this variation was promulgated by the Paiute [[medicine man]] [[Wovoka]] when he traveled to the Northwest to teach the [[Ghost Dance]]. Handgame bones and counting sticks have been identified in ancient anthropological digs. 

Handgame continues to spread amongst Native American tribes; the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] classified it as [[Class I gaming]], leaving its regulation to individual tribes.

In 2010, [[Tulalip]]'s Battle of Nations Stick Game Tournament, the largest handgame tournament to date in the US, attracted 177 teams competing for a $US 30,000 first prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

== Plot==
{{original research section|date=April 2018}}
The player's uncle is unable to take care of his farm any more, so he hands over the responsibility of caring for the farm to the player. The game starts with a [[scarecrow]] teaching the player about harvesting [[wheat]]. By selling crops/products, the player earns coins which can be used to buy production buildings, pets and decoration items. By doing so, they also earn [[experience point]]s (XP), with which they level up. As the game progress, the player is introduced to Angus, a friend of the player's uncle who teaches about fishing. 

Players form into "neighborhoods", wherein the members can assist each other when in need and also chat with each other.

== Gameplay ==
{{original research section|date=April 2018|reason=Info only in game}}
Various crops are unlocked at different stages of the game; field crops such as wheat and bananas, and [[fruit tree]]s and bushes. The player can also buy farm animals; capture aquatic life like fish, lobsters, and ducks; and buy pet animals which are fed for XP. The player can expand their farm later in the game. The game requires a continuous Internet connection to enable play.

==Reception==
[[Gamezebo]] gave it 4/5, noting its similarity to ''[[Farmville]]'' and praising the graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lufkin|first=Bryan|title=Hay Day|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2012/07/03/hay-day-review/|work=Gamezebo|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' gave it a bronze award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hay Day|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Multiformat/Hay+Day/review.asp?c=42764|work=Pocket Gamer|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JD Natasha''' (born '''Natasha Jeannette Dueñas''' on February 27, 1988 in [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]], [[Florida]]) is an [[Americans|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[musician]]. She began her musical career as a solo [[singer-songwriter]], singing and accompanying her music on the guitar. Later, she began to co-found other ensembles.&lt;ref name="Rating in 2004 debut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latin-artists.com/news.php?id=351&amp;is=1|title=JD Natasha tops Best of 2004 (Estefan, People en Español)|date=2004-11-03|publisher=Latin Artists.com|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
JD Natasha was born to an [[Argentina|Argentine]] father and a [[Cuban American]] mother. She is the second of four children, sister of Jonathan Duenas (Jae Coop), and grew up in [[Miami, Florida]]. She graduated from [[Coral Reef Senior High School]]. She started singing in her Church Choir at five and wrote her first song at 11.&lt;ref name="Young Star News"&gt;Young Star News - {{cite web | url=http://www.youngstarnews.com/news/040806-001-natasha.htm | title=Young Star News | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031064211/http://www.youngstarnews.com/news/040806-001-natasha.htm | archivedate=2005-10-31 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Natasha credits a musical aunt of hers who introduced her to her primary influences in [[classic rock]].&lt;ref name="JD Natasha Official Web Site"&gt;JD Natasha Official Web Site - {{cite web | url=http://www.natashaville.com/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?15,1,6,O,E,0,15 | title=JD Natasha Official Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
JD Natasha released her debut album ''[[Imperfecta-Imperfect]]'' on July 13, 2004, on the [[EMI International]] record label. The album with tracks in both [[English Language|English]] and [[Spanish Language|Spanish]] exposed her to a new market of other Latin artists who have crossed over in to the English Speaking American Market. Although she performed and recorded her songs bilingually, it was not a Latin American fan base that propelled her to public note, but her own skill, as her debut album was released in both Spanish and English approximately the same time period. She received acclaim as the best new Hispanic bilingual artist from [[Emilio Estefan]] as the "Top Pick in Emilio Estefan/People en Espanol’s 'Best of 2004'". In addition, she received praise from ''[[Newsday]]'', ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the ''[[Associated Press]]''.&lt;ref name="Rating in 2004 debut"/&gt;

In May 2008, Natasha formed the indie-rock act [[Fancy Me Yet]] with bandmates Alex Darren and Chris Bernard.&lt;ref name="Rating in 2004 debut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fancy Me Yet Official Site"&gt;Fancy Me Yet Official Site - {{cite web| url=http://fancymeyet.com/meet-band| title=Fancy Me Yet Official Site| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124173815/http://fancymeyet.com/meet-band| archivedate=2013-01-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite vocalist Natasha's Jeanne's notable success early on in her musical career (including nominations for three Latin Grammy's, "Best New Artist", "Best Rock Solo Album", and "Best Rock Song", while signed to EMI) you are hard pressed to find her new Los Angeles based rock outfit "The Second Howl" simply reminiscing on accolades of the past. Instead you discover a band eager to let the new music speak for itself, as it quickly rises above the noise. 
 
Natasha and guitarist Alex Darren met in their native city of Miami and began collaborating in 2008 after recognizing similar musical tastes. The duo formed "Fancy Me Yet," but in 2012 decided it was time for a fresh start and moved to Los Angeles. Upon arrival, they locked themselves in their Valley apartment and began writing furiously. 
 
The Second Howl has since finished a batch of "no apologies rock and roll" recordings with producer Eric Lilavois at Crown City Studios and are gearing up for upcoming live performances.

'''Kona Lanes''' was a [[bowling]] center in [[Costa Mesa, California]], that opened in 1958 and closed in 2003 after 45 years in business. Known for its futuristic design, it featured 40 wood-floor bowling lanes, a [[amusement arcade|game room]], a lounge, and a coffee shop that eventually became a [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican diner]].&lt;!-- see ref "ocweekly" and adverts critiki.com/images/locations/37/2941_jumbo.JPG and 6763_jumbo.JPG re services/amenities; see roadside sign image re Mexican diner --&gt; Built during the advent of [[Googie architecture]], its [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] [[Tiki culture|Tiki]]-themed styling extended from the large [[neon sign|roadside sign]] to the building's neon lights and exaggerated rooflines.

When Kona Lanes was demolished in 2003, it was one of the last remaining examples of the Googie style in the region; its sister center, Java Lanes in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], was razed in 2004.&lt;!-- see refs "java1" and "java2" --&gt; Much of Kona's equipment was sold prior to the demolition; the distinctive sign was saved and sent to [[Cincinnati]], where a portion is on permanent display in the [[American Sign Museum]].

Costa Mesa's planning commission approved a proposal to build a department store on the site; following public outcry, those plans were scrapped. In 2010, the still-vacant land was [[zoning|rezoned]] for [[Old age#Senior citizen|senior citizens']] apartments and commercial development. Construction on the apartments began ten years after Kona Lanes was demolished.

===Decline and demolition===
Kona Lanes continued to lose business to newer centers,&lt;ref name=dailypilot/&gt; despite efforts to appeal to a more diverse customer base by hosting local music acts, supporting a Polynesian-themed restaurant called Kona Korral,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; and promoting gimmicks like "nude bowling".&lt;ref name=nude&gt;{{cite news|last=Vanderknyff|first=Rick|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-25/news/ol-789_1_bowling-center|title=Strike Up the Music: If You Haven't Bowled Lately, It's Time to Get Back in the Groove|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 25, 1993|accessdate=July 22, 2017|quote=For a time, Kona Lanes in Costa Mesa even advertised 'nude bowling' on its marquee, but it turns out that was just the gag name for a new league.

Plans to build a [[Kohl's]] department store on the site occupied by Kona Lanes and the already-closed [[Regal Entertainment Group#Edwards Theatres|Edwards Cinema Center]] and [[Ice Capades#Chalet skating rinks|Ice Capades Chalet]] were approved by the city's planning commissioners, but they were met with resistance by neighbors who did not believe the store was a [[neighbourhood character|good fit]] for the area.&lt;ref name=dailypilot/&gt;&lt;!-- cites closures in 2001; see ref "appeal" re "good fit" --&gt; Then-mayor Karen Robinson complained that Costa Mesa's policy-makers were discarding recreation as part of the quality of residents' lives, and appealed the commissioners' decision in February 2003.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|first=Dierdre|last=Newman|title=Mayor Plans Appeal of Kona Lanes Vote|work=Daily Pilot|location=Costa Mesa, California|url=http://articles.dailypilot.com/2003-02-28/news/export26731_1_mesa-verde-homeowners-assn-robin-leffler-costa-mesa|date=February 28, 2003|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous sentence and fragment except closures --&gt; The city council later rejected the proposal.&lt;ref name=nokohls&gt;{{cite news|first=Dierdre|last=Newman|title=Costa Mesa Rakes Over the Kohl's|work=Daily Pilot|location=Costa Mesa, California|url=http://articles.dailypilot.com/2003-04-09/news/export25088_1_segerstrom-sons-costa-mesa-kohl|date=April 9, 2003|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing efforts to [[architectural conservation|save Kona Lanes]] failed;&lt;ref name=dailypilot/&gt; it closed for good in May 2003 and was demolished soon after.&lt;ref name=demolition&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Dierdre|url=http://articles.dailypilot.com/2003-05-31/news/export23343_1_bowling-alley-segerstroms-kona-lanes|title=Demolition nears for Kona Lanes bowling|work=Daily Pilot|location=Costa Mesa, California|date=May 31, 2003|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Sister center Java Lanes was leveled the following year.&lt;ref name=java2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservela.com/archives/000150.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085023/http://www.preservela.com/archives/000150.html|title=Alert: Java Lanes|website=PreserveLA.com|date=April 13, 2004|archivedate=March 4, 2016|accessdate=December 10, 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;!-- cites Googie --&gt;{{indent|3}}{{cite web|last=Cohn|first=Matt|url=https://www.lbpost.com/life/arts-culture/2000003626-java-lanes-remembered-as-long-beach-s-tiki-space-age-fun-place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427141417/http://lbpost.com/life/arts-culture/2000003626-java-lanes-remembered-as-long-beach-s-tiki-space-age-fun-place|title=Java Lanes Remembered As Long Beach's Tiki, Space-Age Fun Place|work=Long Beach Post|date=April 28, 2014|archivedate=April 27, 2016|accessdate=December 10, 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powers, Daly, &amp; DeRosa's other Googie-styled center, Anaheim Bowl, was demolished previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/24/local/me-25759|title=History and the Style of the Future: Googie Architecture Is Obsolete, But&amp;nbsp;... |work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 24, 1999|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Activity at Kona Lanes increased in its final days, due to the nostalgic value of potential keepsakes. Manager Juanita Johnson said people were asking to buy furniture, office equipment, and more.

'''Kubi Chaza Indi''' is a [[Zimbabwe]]an development activist and businesswoman. Under her maiden name, Kubi Chaza, she was an actress in the [[United Kingdom]], appearing in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' in 1973 as a sales clerk serving [[James Bond]]. After returning to Zimbabwe, she and actor husband [[John Indi]] started a company making beauty products.

==Background==
Indi is very active in the development community, particularly with respect to issues affecting women, and is secretary-general of the Indigenous Business Women's Organisation in Zimbabwe.

The Indis have continued to work in film-making, John as an actor, but Kubi on both sides of the camera. In 1989, she produced ''I Am the Future'', a film about a young woman (played by [[Stella Chiweshe]]) who travels to the big city to escape Zimbabwe's independence war in the rural areas. In 1993, she played the eponymous heroine's modern neighbour in ''Neria'', [[Tsitsi Dangarembga]]'s script about widowhood in Zimbabwe. Both films were directed by [[Godwin Mawuru]], and ''Neria'' featured a soundtrack by [[Oliver Mtukudzi]].

Indi is a member of the Women Filmmakers of Zimbabwe.

'''Latin ballad''' ({{lang-es|balada romántica}}) refers to a music genre derivative of [[Bolero]] that originated in the early-1960s in Latin America and Spain.

Some of the best known artists of the Latin ballad are [[Julio Iglesias]], [[José Luis Rodríguez (singer)|José Luis Rodriguez]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Camilo Sesto]], [[Emmanuel (singer)|Emmanuel]], [[Nino Bravo]], [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Ricardo Montaner]], [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]] and [[José José]] among others. Because of its difficulty, the Latin balladeers are often recognized as skilled singers such as the case of Nino Bravo, José José, Luis Miguel or Raphael.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWSAEGMPXT8][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyxdmMMdMao]&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent decades it has become the dominant musical genre of Latin pop.

== Origin and evolution ==
The Latin or romantic ballad has its origin in the Latin American bolero in the 1950s ([[Lucho Gatica]], [[Leo Marini]]), but also in the romantic song in Italian ([[Nicola Di Bari]]) and French ([[Charles Aznavour]]) in the 1960s and 1970s.

In Mexico, the first ballad recorded as such is "Sonata de Amor" (Sonata of Love) of Mario Álvarez in 1961. In 1965 the famous bolero singer-songwriter [[Armando Manzanero]], sang his first ballad, "Pobres besos míos" (My Poor Kisses).

The heyday of the ballad was reached in the mid-1970s, where artists such as [[José José]], [[Camilo Sesto]], [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]], [[Roberto Carlos]], [[Rocío Dúrcal]] and others released a big number of hits. The main hits of José José were "El triste" (The Sad One), "La nave del olvido" (The Ship of Forgetfullness), "Te extraño" (I Miss You, also written by Manzanero), "Amar y querer" (To love and To want), or "Gavilán o paloma" (Hawk or Dove), "El pasado" (The Past), "Volcán" (Volcano) or "Lo que no fue no será" (What Never Was Will Never Be). By Roberto Carlos the songs "Amigos" (Friends) or "Detalles" (Details). By Camilo Sesto the hits "Fresa Salvaje" (Wild Strawberry), "Perdóname" (Forgive Me) or "Vivir Así es Morir de Amor" (To Live Like This is to Die of Love). Rocío Dúrcal enjoyed worldwide success and was known as "La Dama de la canción" (The Lady of Song). Her successful ballads include "Costumbres" (Customs), "Amor Eterno" (Eternal Love), "Diferentes" (Different), among many others that were released in Latin America.[2] These songs are widely known today in Latin America.

In the course of their existence the genre merged with diverse rhythms to form several variants, such as romantic [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[cumbia]] aside others.

From the 1990s, globalization and media internationalization processes that integrated contributed to the ballad's spread international spread and further homogenize around a common Latin identity. As part of the Latin Americanization of the United States and the dominant presence in the genre of multinational record labels, [[Miami]] has become the main producer of ballads&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090611214939/http://www.saintmarys.edu/~dparty/pdf/Balada%20y%20Transnacionalismo.pdf ''Transnacionalización y la balada latinoamericana'' (In spanish:Transnationalization and the ballad Latin - American), por Daniel Party, University of Pennsylvania, 2003, pag. 6]&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn has fed back trends of migration of Latino and Hispanic performers, producers and musicians to that city. By the turn of the 2010s however, Latin ballads have begun to lose popularity as uptempo Latin genres such as [[bachata (music)|bachata]], [[reggaeton]], and Spanish-language [[electropop]] music have gained popularity with the Hispanic audience in the radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cobo|first1=Leila|authorlink1=Leila Cobo|title=Latin Noise: We Want Our Ballads|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin-notas/6244251/latin-music-we-want-our-ballads|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=8 September 2015|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The ethnomusicologist Daniel Party  defines the romantic ballad as "a love song of slow tempo, played by a solo singer accompanied by an orchestra usually" .&lt;ref name="saintmarys.edu"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090611214939/http://www.saintmarys.edu/~dparty/pdf/Balada%20y%20Transnacionalismo.pdf ''Transnacionalización y la balada latinoamericana'' (In spanish:Transnationalization and the ballad Latin - American), by  Daniel Party, University of Pennsylvania, 2003, pag. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballad and bolero are often confused and songs can fall in one or the other category without too much presicion. The distinction between them is referring primarily to a more sophisticated and more metaphorical language and subtle bolero, compared with a more direct expression of the ballad.

Party stressed that the romantic ballad derive from  "Latin common sensibility"&lt;ref name="saintmarys.edu"/&gt; He draws on the research of Jesus Martin-Barbero to highlight that the romantic ballad is an expression of a broader cultural process, called by Martin-Barbero as "emotional integration in Latin America", a phenomenon that would explain a generalization of the ways of feeling and express the emotions of the Latinos, through gestures, sounds, rhythms and cadences common literary devices, linked in turn to the [[telenovela]].&lt;ref&gt;Martín-Barbero, Jesús.

'''Le Lido''' is a [[cabaret]] and [[burlesque]] show located on the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It opened in 1946 at 78 Avenue des Champs -Élysée and moved to its current location in 1977. It is known for its exotic shows including dancers, singers, and other performers. Famous names have performed there including: [[Edith Piaf]], [[Siegfried and Roy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siegfried and Roy at Lido de Paris|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbDMvLj9csw|website=Youtube|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvie Vartan]], [[Johnny Hallyday]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Josephine Baker]], [[Kessler Twins]], [[Elton John]], [[Laurel &amp; Hardy]], [[Dalida]], [[Shirley MacLaine]],&lt;ref name=Maclaine&gt;{{cite web|title=Shirley Maclaine at the Lido|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330885/|website=IMDB|publisher=Amazon.com inc.|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitzi Gaynor]], [[Juliet Prowse]] and [[Noël Coward]].

== History ==
Founded by Joseph and Louis Clérico, Le Lido opened on June 20, 1946. Le Lido was preceded by an artificial beach in a townhouse basement in the 1920s, running as a nightclub/casino in the late night hours.

In 1955, after a visit by the entertainment director of the [[Stardust Resort and Casino]], Las Vegas, the Clérico brothers along with Donn Arden brought the Lido to the [[Stardust Resort and Casino|Stardust]] Las Vegas. This started a series of imports of Parisian cabaret shows to Las Vegas: [[Follies Bergeres]] to the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana]], Nouvelle Eve to [[El Rancho Vegas|Hotel El Rancho Vegas]] and [[Casino de Paris]] to the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]].&lt;ref name="Showgirls Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lido at the Stardust|url=http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/showgirls/lido-stardust|website=Digital Collections at UNLV|publisher=UNLV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stardust edition of Le Lido closed in 1992.

Le Lido moved in 1977 to the Normandie on the Champs-Élysées.

In 2006, [[Sodexo]], the international food service company, purchased Le Lido and has invested 24 million euro into developing its current show.&lt;ref name=sodexo&gt;{{cite web|title=SODEXO INVESTIT 25 MILLIONS DANS LA REFONTE DU LIDO|url=http://www.hospitality-on.com/actualites/2014/12/01/sodexo-investit-25-millions-dans-la-refonte-du-lido/|website=Hospitality on think tank|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230044205/http://www.hospitality-on.com/actualites/2014/12/01/sodexo-investit-25-millions-dans-la-refonte-du-lido/|archivedate=2014-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Show ==
The Lido was closed from December 2, 2014, to April 2, 2015, while a new version of the show was prepared. &lt;ref name="lido mainpage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lido|url=http://www.lido.fr|website=Le Lido|publisher=Le Lido|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version was developed by [[Franco Dragone]]. Each version of Le Lido is made up of 10–20 scenes and runs for about an hour and a half. Two shows are run every day of the week. A pre-show dinner is offered with the first evening show of each day at an additional cost.

Each Le Lido show features singers and dancers, which always include the famous Bluebell Girls.&lt;ref name="Guardian_obit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gentlemen|first1=Amelia|title=Founder of Bluebell Girls dies at 94|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/15/france.arts|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few featured dancers, showgirls and lead singers may be added. The Lido is known for its spectacular costumes featuring thousands of dollars in feathers and rhinestones, rich fabrics, and top quality furs.

The opening or "theme" scene welcomes the audience and sets the tone for the evening. It may also set the colour scheme for the show and will feature special effects and lighting. Music may be original or a medley of current popular songs mixed with music from Broadway or Hollywood films; often the opening number is a potpourri of styles and performers may change costumes several times. Between the production numbers, specialty "vaudeville/cabaret" acts are featured, such as jugglers, acrobats or magicians. At least one scene will feature water effects – another thing the Lido is known for. The stage itself can be raised and lowered, may change back and forth into an ice rink or swimming pool, and can feature elaborate set pieces which come up from below. The closing number often features a number called "Merci Beaucoup" (featured in the television show Shirley Maclaine at The Lido de Paris) and usually has some particularly spectacular costumes.

Among the last of its kind, the Lido has a special place in the history of nightclubs and floorshows and continues a tradition of the "naughty but nice" opulent production shows originally started by The [[Follies Bergeres]].

==Bluebell Girls==
[[File:MargaretKellyGirls.jpg|thumbnail|right|Margaret with the Bluebell Girls in 1948]]
Founded by [[Margaret Kelly (dancer)|Margaret Kelly]], also known as Miss Bluebell, the dancers of the Lido are known as the Bluebell Girls. Until her retirement in 1986, each dancer was hand-selected by Kelly. Then the dancers were under the direction of Pierre Rambert until his retirement in Dec 2014.&lt;ref name="Guardian_obit" /&gt; According to the [[Forbes]], they are "some of the world’s most beautiful and talented burlesque dancers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rooksanahossenally/2016/09/26/5-reasons-the-champs-elysees-avenue-in-paris-is-still-worth-visiting/#3bd9ab5fa602|title=5 Things to do When Visiting the Champs Elysées in Paris|last=Hossenally|first=Rooksana|date=2016-09-26|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cast comes from all over the world, and are noted for their statuesque height, averaging a height of 5' 11". It is interesting that while many of the performers in the shows are French a large number come from the UK and many of the tall statuesque "showgirls" who may top 6 feet without heels may come from South Africa and the USA.

With the fall of the Soviet Union, showgirls and classically trained dancers now come from Ukraine and many other former Soviet states.

==Production history==
Every few years, Le Lido develops a new version of its show. The show used to change more frequently, now each iteration may run for several years until the management feels it has run its course and a new production is called for. Each show can take millions of dollars to develop. The following are the titles of each show produced by the Le Lido:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Shows|url=http://www.lido.fr/en/myth.html#b3|website=Le Lido|publisher=Le Lido|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[wrestling mask|masked wrestlers]]'''. The earliest known masked wrestler in the United States was The Masked Marvel who famously "crashed" the international tournament, which featured many of the top stars of the [[History of professional wrestling in the United States#"Farmer" Burns-Frank Gotch era|"Farmer" Burns-Frank Gotch era]], held at the [[Manhattan Center|Manhattan Opera House]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwi-online.com/pages/wrestlingframe.html |title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated: Wrestling History|author=Pro Wrestling Illustrated|authorlink=Pro Wrestling Illustrated|year=2007|publisher=PWI-Online.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, many [[professional wrestlers]] have traditionally worn masks after they had been used in an area, or "territory", that their popularity and drawing ability diminished, it would be an easy way for a wrestler to begin working in a new area as a "fresh face". Sometimes workers wore masks in one territory and unmasked in another territory in order to keep their two identities separate. Several wrestlers used one or two personas for their entire career such as [[Dick Beyer|The Destroyer]] (1962–1984), [[Tim Woods|Mr. Wrestling]] (1965–1983) and [[Bill Eadie|Masked Superstar]] (1976–1986).&lt;ref name="WrestlingMuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/masks2.html |title=Masked Wreslers |author= |work=From Parts Unknown |publisher=WrestlingMuseum.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrestling masks also have a significant cultural importance in [[lucha libre]], and [[puroresu]] to a lesser extent; famed ''[[luchadore]]s'' such as [[Blue Demon]], [[Mil Máscaras]] and [[El Santo]] have achieved an almost iconic status in Mexico. In Japan, masked wrestlers are also very popular. Many are heavily influenced by [[anime]] and [[manga]] characters such as [[Tiger Mask]] and [[Black Tiger (professional wrestling)|Black Tiger]] during the 1980s, and [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] in the 90s. Many of these stars would appear in [[World Championship Wrestling]] during the "[[Monday Night Wars]]" period.&lt;ref name="WrestlingMuseum"/&gt;

In recent years, [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] has re-used masked characters for comedic purposes. [[Edge and Christian]] donned the masks worn by the [[WWE|WWF]]'s original [[Los Conquistadores]] in their feud with [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champions]] [[The Hardy Boyz]] in 2000. Under the guise of [[El Gran Luchadore]], [[Paul London]], [[Shannon Moore]], [[Eddie Guerrero]] and [[Kurt Angle]] each challenged [[John Layfield|JBL]] for the [[WWE Championship]] in 2004. Likewise, [[El Generico]] and [[Shark Boy]] play a similar role on the [[independent circuit]].

Desmond refuted this in an ABC interview in April 2008, saying that she dated Thomas for 10 years, but they would never have married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/talkingheads/txt/s2209837.htm Lorrae Desmond, ''Talking Heads, with Peter Thompson'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, she made history by being the first woman to win the Gold [[Logie Award|Logie]] (which was in fact Silver, as women at the time received the Silver Statuette, and men received the Gold Statuette) for her work on her variety show ''The Lorrae Desmond Show''.&lt;ref name="TVW"&gt;[http://tvweek.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=272558 "1962: Lorrae Desmond", ''TV Week''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901221618/http://tvweek.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=272558 |date=1 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gold Logie]] award that year was a dual honour, with [[Tommy Hanlon Jr.]] also winning the coveted trophy.

Desmond married Sydney surgeon Dr Alex Gorshenin in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47510218 |title=LORRAE DESMOND'S WEDDING. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=29 May 1963 |accessdate=5 April 2011 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; They travelled to the United States together, where he continued to study. They moved back to Sydney but the marriage did not last long.

The [[Australian Government]] invited her to tour Vietnam from 1967 to 1971, to entertain the troops. She was widely courted as being the [[Forces Sweetheart|Australian Forces Sweetheart]], amongst others including [[Little Pattie]].&lt;ref name="awm"&gt;[http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/REL33301.002 Sequin and chiffon entertainer's scarf : Lorrae Desmond], Australian War Memorial.&lt;/ref&gt; Desmond was appointed a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in 1970 for services to entertainment and the welfare of the Australian Forces in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="mbe1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lorrae GORSHENIN MBE|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1085521&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|publisher=Australian Honours Database|accessdate=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mbe2"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45118 |date=13 June 1970 |page=6401|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Desmond was a supporter of the [[2000 Paralympic Games|Paralympic Games]].

==Television roles==
Desmond's television appearances include ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'', ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'' (1973) and ''[[Arcade (TV series)|Arcade]]'' (1980). She also had a guest appearance on ''[[Home and Away]]'' as Isobel Dupre.&lt;ref name = "TVW"/&gt;

==''A Country Practice'': Shirley Gilroy==
Desmond appeared as Shirley Gilroy in ''[[A Country Practice]]'', an original character, from 1981 to 1992, opposite [[Brian Wenzel]] who played her husband Frank Gilroy. In 1984 she won the Logie for Best Supporting Actress for this role. In one of the series' iconic episodes in 1992, the long-running character Shirley was killed off in an off-screen plane crash, with actress Desmond stating she did not want a prolonged death storyline arc like Molly Jones ([[Anne Tenney]]).

==Writing==
Desmond co-wrote the lyrics to the musical ''[[Man of Sorrows (musical)|Man of Sorrows]]'' (originally titled ''Jesus Christ Revolution'') which premiered in Melbourne in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Out-of-town success for new musical|last=|first=|date=4 June 1972|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the industry, she said: &lt;blockquote&gt;What I really wanted to do was write lyrics for songs. I did do a few weeks in ''Home And Away'' after ''ACP'', but I’m a bit sick of performing—after you've been doing it for 50 years you're just going around in circles! The thing I liked most about being a performer was putting the act together, which is why I've come back to writing. It's still pleasant to be recognised as Shirley because people are always nice to me. And with those ''ACP'' repeats on [[Hallmark]], it goes from generation to generation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001, she obtained the rights to write the lyrics for a musical play based on [[Bryce Courtenay]]'s novel ''[[Smoky Joe's Cafe]]'', about the effects of the Vietnam War on a veteran. The play, entitled ''Honey'', premiered in 2007 at the [[Riverside Theatre Parramatta]].&lt;ref name="stagewhispers"&gt;[http://www.stagewhispers.com.au/node/1997 Lorrae Desmond – blonde goddess in the golden dress], ''Stage Whispers'', July/August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also a magazine columnist for ''[[That's Life! (Australian magazine)|That's Life]]''; she wrote an article called "Ask Lorrae", where readers would write in, asking for advice and information.

Desmond took part in an ''A Country Practice'' reunion special in 2006, as part of the "Television Turns 50" celebrations, and the series' 30th-anniversary reunion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, David: [http://citysearch.com.au/tvguide/1137861630641/TV+reunions+are+hot+property TV reunions are hot property], Citysearch, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, Lorrae who was the first female to win a [[Gold Logie]], appeared at the [[Logie Awards of 2017|Logie awards]], to present an award opposite her cousin's son, Chinese Australian actor and presenter [[Sam Pang]].

'''Market Street Cinema''' is a historical theatre located on [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in the [[Mid-Market, San Francisco|Mid-Market district]], [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. It was founded in 1912 by David and [[Sid Grauman]] as the Imperial Theater''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Let's Break Down the History of the Market Street Cinema|url = http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2013/06/13/lets_break_down_the_history_of_the_market_street_cinema.php|website = Curbed SF|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was converted into a movie theatre as the Premiere Theatre (1929) and the [[United Artists]] Theatre (1931).

'''''Phantasm: Ravager''''' (sometimes styalized as '''''Phantasm: RaVager''''' and also known as '''''Phantasm V''''') is a 2016 American [[horror film]], and the fifth and final installment in the [[Phantasm (film series)|''Phantasm'' series]]. It marks the only film in the series not directed by [[Don Coscarelli]], although he acts as producer and co-writer. It is directed by David Hartman and stars [[A. Michael Baldwin]], [[Reggie Bannister]], and [[Angus Scrimm]] in his final appearance as the [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|Tall Man]].

==Plot==
The film begins with Reggie, running about in the desert, still on the trail of his nemesis - the [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|Tall Man]]. He then pays a man to offer him a ride, but realizes it's actually his car they're in, and the man stole it when he recalls putting a gun in the middle compartment. He chucks the man out, but two spheres suddenly fly by, and one sphere kills the man on the road while the other chases after Reggie. He manages to defeat them however, but then wakes up in a hospital sitting with Mike talking to him as he sits in a wheelchair, who apparently looks after him due to him having an early stage of [[dementia]]. He then tells Mike his story. In an apparent dream setting, Reggie meets a woman who mistakes him for a friend. Her car isn't working, so Reggie offers her a lift. They go to a cabin on a farm, and Reggie learns that a Bulgarian man named Demeter helps out. Reggie explains to her about his dealings with The Tall Man over the years, and she is amazed by his tale. He tries his usual lady wooing, but is turned down. As he plays a song, he cannot remember her name, and goes to sleep. Later, The Tall Man shows up with more of his deadly spheres. A flashback scene then shows Reggie in the hospital, but it is the hospital from the 1860s.  The Tall Man (or his original identity, Jebediah) is lying in the bed next to him. They then talk. Jebediah explains he's nearly finished, and has lost many friends. He says they are both there basically to die. 

Reggie wakes up the next morning, remembering the lady's name is Dawn. He gets no answer when he asks her a question, and finds that she's been killed by spheres, that then give chase. Reggie equips himself with a shotgun. The spheres force him into a nearby barn. A man armed with an axe confronts him, and it's revealed he is Demeter. A sphere kills a horse. Another sphere then manages to get inside the barn, killing Demeter, before Reggie fights it off. Reggie speaks to Mike again in the hospital. Mike tells him about a new threat looming. Back in his dream, Reggie goes through the woods. Along a path, he encounters a gigantic sphere hovering in the sky, and Reggie is back at the hospital again. Reggie alternates between the other world in both his dream, and the present time. The Tall Man appears, and says their paths cross again. It's 1979; a younger self will attend a funeral in Morningside, and that all his efforts got him nowhere. The Tall Man proclaims he can resurrect Reggie's dead family in exchange for him ceasing his meddling. 

Reggie is next seen in a mortuary, contending with the dwarf "Lurker" followers of The Tall Man, and the Lady in Lavender appears. She is shot by Reggie and seemingly killed. Continuing on, Reggie goes into a large cave, shooting a dwarf and the place shakes. The Tall Man asks him if he's considered his offer, but when Reggie retaliates, The Tall Man again reminds him his chances are depleting. Reggie wants his friends Jodie and Mike back, but The Tall Man recognizes his "loyalty" for his friends as foolishness. In yet another dream sequence which he alternates with the nightmare world, Reggie is strapped to a gurney as armed masked people appear. One is called Chunk and the other is revealed to be the person Reggie knew as Dawn despite her death, but she says her name is actually Jane and she thinks Reggie is delusional. She radios in some people. Reggie fails to convince her they know each other, but she gets him medical attention instead. More evil dwarf things show up to attack Reggie, but Chunk saves him and gives him a weapon. Dawn &amp; Chunk take Reggie to other members of their group who are fighting the Tall Man. Mike reunites with Reggie, and then escape the nightmare hospital. Mike tells Reggie he's been out of action for a decade in a coma, and the Earth has changed.  He says it's no longer their home, it's The Tall Man's now.

In the dream world, Reggie wanders around the hospital hallways, but a nurse orders him back to his room. In the nightmare world, an enemy has grabbed him. A spiked sphere then kills one of the people helping Reggie. Mike visits Reggie at the hospital, and says his dream orientates him. Mike reveals he had a dream too where he was in the desert, looking for Reggie. It turns out Mike still has his connection to The Tall Man. Mike reveals The Tall Man unleashed an alien virus that caused an apocalypse on society worldwide. Jane is caught by The Tall Man, so Chunk, Mike and Reggie go after The Tall Man. In his own red planet world, they face and battle The Tall Man, Jane is killed. Chunk, who posed as a dwarf next to the Tall Man, then turns the tables. Chunk blows himself up to try to kill The Tall Man. Back at the hospital, Reggie fights some Gravers alongside Mike. Jodie shows up in a car spewing bullets to save them. After driving awhile, they decide to drive north as The Tall Man hates the cold. In a flashback to the hospital, however, Reggie seemingly passes away in bed while Mike &amp; Jody are holding his hands, and the film ends. 

During the end-credits, Chunk appears through a portal along a desert road, missing a hand, and meets up with Rocky. Chunk flirts with her, asking Rocky if he has a chance. Rocky teases back saying that there are no other guys around, but Rocky then sees Reggie and the others pulling up in the Barricuda heading north, and they get in. Lots of giant spheres are then shown in the sky in the distance, indicating the war with The Tall Man is far from over.

==Production==
In 2004, six years after the release of ''[[Phantasm IV: Oblivion]]'', series director Don Coscarelli told ''[[Fangoria]]'', "I’d also still like to do another ''Phantasm'' film. Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm are still in great shape and raring to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2323|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603043907/http://fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2323 |title=Don Coscarelli talks BUBBA sequel possibilities |work=fangoria.com |date=2004-05-11 |archivedate=2004-06-03 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, it was announced that Coscarelli was in the final stages of talks with [[New Line Cinema]] to produce a new entry. According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', the new film was "being developed as a relaunch and as a possible trilogy about Mike's coming of age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000835831|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109120415/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000835831 |title='Phantasm' in New Line's airspace  |work=hollywoodreporter.com |date=2005-03-10 |archivedate=2006-01-09 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version never came to fruition.

Rumors about a sequel were reignited in June 2007 by footage contained in Don Coscarelli's ''Farewell to the Alamo Drafthouse'', featuring Angus Scrimm and A. Michael Baldwin in their roles. However an interview with Reggie Bannister surfaced on YouTube, and, when asked about the possibility of a fifth film, he stated there was no activity or development but that anything was possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phantasm.com/secrets/?p=33 |title=Blog » Blog Archive » Don Coscarelli's Farewell To The Alamo Drafthouse |work=Phantasm.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, rumors again surfaced that Coscarelli would begin a new ''Phantasm'' sequel.  According to a report on [[Dread Central]], a reliable source told them the script was completed and filming would begin later in the year.&lt;ref name="phantasm5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3146849/is-don-coscarelli-finally-gearing-up-for-phantasm-5/|title=UPDATED: Is Don Coscarelli Finally Gearing Up For 'Phantasm 5'? Nope! |work=bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate=2014-03-28|date=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coscarelli disputed this claim, publicly stating, "I have no solid news to report on a new project now."&lt;ref name="phantasm5" /&gt; The director, however, was being coy with film news sites.  According to what Coscarelli and new co-writer-director David Hartman told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the film was shot secretly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/video-phantasm-5-ravager-trailer/ |title=Hot Teaser Trailer: 'Phantasm V: Ravager' |work=deadline.com |date=2014-03-26 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in and around southern California during 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/03/27/phantasm-5-ravager-trailer-exclusive/ |title='Phantasm: Ravager' cast details and teaser trailer -- EXCLUSIVE VIDEO |work=ew.com |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26, 2014, news of ''Ravager''{{'}}s completion was released via various film news sites.  The next day, a teaser trailer debuted on the film's official site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phantasm.com/ |title=Phantasm V: Ravager |work=Phantasm.com |date=2014-03-26 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2014 "sneak peek" video preview on the official Phantasm website, director Hartman mentioned in quick passing, "This thing is going to be in the can 2015... for sure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phantasm.com/secrets/ |title=Phantasm V: Ravager |work=Phantasm.com |date=2014-03-26 |accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2015 at Scarefest in Lexington, Kentucky, it was announced that the film has been delayed until 2016. The next month, Reggie Bannister announced that ''Ravager'' is completed and is awaiting a distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phantasmarchives.blogspot.com/2015/09/phantasm-ravager-delayed-to-2106.html |title=Phantasm Ravager Delayed to 2016 |work=phantasmarchives.blogspot.com |date=2015-09-13 |accessdate=2015-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phantasmarchives.blogspot.com/2015/10/news-phantasm-ravager-is-finished.html |title=News: Phantasm Ravager is Finished |work=phantasmarchives.blogspot.com |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 54% of 13 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.1/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/phantasm_ravager/|title=Phantasm: Ravager|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Metacritic]], another review aggregator, rated it 51/100 based on seven reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/phantasm-ravager|title=Phantasm: Ravager|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joe Leydon]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and Marten Carlson of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' both criticized the film's narrative cohesiveness.&lt;ref name=cos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/09/film-review-phantasm-ravager/|title=Film Review: ''Phantasm: Ravager''|last=Carlson|first=Marten|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=2016-09-26|accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/phantasm-ravager-review-1201873751/|title=Film Review: ''Phantasm: Ravager''|last=Leydon|first=Joe|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2016-09-29|accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leydon speculated that the film's troubled production may have cause this,&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; and Carlson more directly blamed the film's origin as a series of shorts.&lt;ref name=cos/&gt;  Both said this will probably cause outsiders to be confused by the film.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;&lt;ref name=cos/&gt;  In comparing it to the previous films, Carlson said it "captures the heart, if not the quality", though fans will likely forgive its faults, as they did the first film.&lt;ref name=cos/&gt;  Leydon, though describing it as "a patchwork quilt of outtakes from its four predecessors", also cited the appeal to fans to revisit their favorite characters.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;  Though recognizing the film's narrative weakness, Michele Galgana of ''[[Screen Anarchy]]'' wrote, "Still, it's impossible to overlook the fun that you see all these guys having, and their hearts are all in the right place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenanarchy.com/2016/09/fantastic-fest-2016-review-phantasm-ravager.html|title=Fantastic Fest 2016 Review: ''Phantasm Ravager''|last=Galgana|first=Michele|work=[[Screen Anarchy]]|date=2016-09-30|accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Abrams of ''[[Roger Ebert|Roger Ebert.com]]'' gave the film two and a half stars saying the "CGI-intensive action scenes are distractingly ugly-looking. The camerawork is also amateurish, and the film's drab, undistinguished dialogue is only interesting when it's explicitly calling back to the original ''Phantasm.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrams|first=Simon|title=Phantasm: Ravager|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/phantasm-ravager-2016|publisher=[[Roger Ebert|Roger Ebert.com]]|date=October 7, 2016|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marten Carlson of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' criticized the look of the film saying "at its best, though, the film’s cheap production is impossible to ignore. The cinematography is flat and appears to have been shot on a consumer HD camera. The special effects are achieved primarily with low-grade CGI that’s laughable at times."&lt;ref name="consequence"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Marten|title=Film Review: Phantasm: Ravager|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/09/film-review-phantasm-ravager/|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=September 26, 2016|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson ultimately said "All formal complaints aside, Ravager is successful in its attempt to capture the spirit of the series. Phantasm has always been about family, the love between brothers and friends, and seeing Reggie and Mike together again, we can only feel the sincerity of their relationship."&lt;ref name="consequence"/&gt; Reviewers at ''Bloody Disgusting'' were split with Trace Thurman placing it on his "5 Worst Horror Movies of 2016"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thurman|first=Trace|title=5 Worst Horror Movies of 2016|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3417512/traces-worst-horror-movies-2016/2/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=December 29, 2016|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet John Squires loved it.&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Squires|first=John|title=Why I Love ‘Phantasm: Ravager’: 2016’s Most Charming Horror Film|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3419577/love-phantasm-ravager-2016s-charming-horror-film/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=December 29, 2016|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both agreed the film looked like a "cheaply-made student film."&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt;

'''"Poor Mary"''' or '''"Poor Jenny"''' is a popular [[English language]] [[nursery rhyme]] and [[singing game]]. It has a [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number of 1377.

==Lyrics==
Lyrics vary considerably for this song.  Over a hundred known variations have been collected in Britain since the 1880s, not least in the use of the names, including Jenny, Mary and Sally. Common modern versions include:
:Poor Jenny is a-weeping,
:A-weeping, a-weeping,
:Poor Jenny is a-weeping
:On a bright summer’s day.

:Why are you weeping,
:Weeping, weeping,
:Why are you weeping,
:On a bright summer's day?

:I'm weeping for a loved one,
:A loved one, a loved one,
:I'm weeping for a loved one,
:On a bright summer's day.

:Stand up and choose your loved one,
:Your loved one, your loved one,
:Stand up and choose your loved one,
:One a bright summer's day.

:Shake hands before you leave 'er,
:You leave 'er, you leave 'er,
:Shake hands before you leave 'er,
:On a bright summer's day.&lt;ref name=Opie1985&gt;[[I. Opie and P. Opie]], ''The Singing Game'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), pp. 325–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The game==
One child of the group is chosen to be "Jenny" or "Mary" etc., and has to kneel in the middle of a circle, usually with head in hands. The other children join their hands and walk around the other child singing the first verse. The child in the centre then carries out the actions of the following verses, most importantly choosing a partner.

==The tune==
The tune is widely known in Europe, and forms the first section of the folk dance tune "La Bourrée des Galvachers" from Burgundy, France.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQSOKd03zY&lt;/ref&gt; The melody was also used by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|first Piano Concerto, op.35.]]&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Shostakovich, ''Piano Concerto'' (London: Boosey &amp; Hawkes, n.d. HPS644). Compare the trumpet solo in the nine bars starting one bar after rehearsal mark 63 with the melody as given by Opie; they are identical.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poverty leads many women to be tempted into prostitution and [[cocaine addiction]].&lt;ref name="pulitzer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Guinea Bissau: Crack and prostitution, cocaine's other face  |work=[[Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|Pulitzer]]|date=30 June 2009|author=Marco Vernaschi|url= http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/guinea-bissau-crack-and-prostitution-cocaine%E2%80%99s-other-face|accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the prostitutes in [[Bissau]] and other towns in Guinea-Bissau are Manjako women from [[Caio (Guinea-Bissau)|Caio]] in the [[Cacheu Region]].&lt;ref name="buckner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckner|first1=Margaret|title=Village women as town prostitutes: cultural factors relevant to prostitution and HIV epidemiology in Guinea-Bissau|url=https://www.codesria.org/IMG/pdf/22LBUCKNER_.pdf|website=Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa|accessdate=7 January 2018|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ency"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ditmore|first1=Melissa Hope (edited by)|title=Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0313329685}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be over 30 and wait in designated rooms in their houses for clients. Occasionally they will go to a local bar in search of clients.&lt;ref name="buckner" /&gt; Prostitutes from Caio also travel to [[Ziguinchor]] in [[Senegal]] and [[Banjul]] in [[The Gambia]] to work.&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;

Younger prostitutes in the cities often work in bars.&lt;ref name="pulitzer" /&gt;

There have been reports of [[child sex tourism]] on the [[Bissagos Islands]].&lt;ref name="state16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2016 - Country Narratives - Guinea-Bissau|url=https://www.ecoi.net/local_link/326250/452829_en.html|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=7 January 2018|language=en|date=30 June 2016}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV==
Like other countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[HIV]] is a problem in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New cases of HIV / AIDS worry country's health authorities|url=https://uniogbis.unmissions.org/en/new-cases-hiv-aids-worry-countrys-health-authorities|website=UNIOGBIS|accessdate=7 January 2018|language=en|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult prevalence is 3.1%&lt;ref name="unaids"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinea-Bissau 2016 Country factsheet|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/guinea-bissau|website=[[UNAIDS]]|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Condom]] use amongst sex workers is irregular,&lt;ref name="pulitzer" /&gt; which has led to an HIV prevalence amongst sex workers of 39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child prostitution==
[[Child prostitution]] is a problem in the country. Many children engage in prostitution for survival. The activity mainly takes place in clubs, bars and hotels. The government takes little action, relying on [[NGO]]s to try and address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Prostitution - Guinea-Bissau|url=http://gvnet.com/childprostitution/Guinea-Bissau.htm|website=GVNET|accessdate=7 January 2018}} maily culled from 10-15 year old sources, not verified.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2000-2004 there have been reports of [[child sex tourism]] on the [[Bissagos Islands]].&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Guinea-Bissau}}
Guinea-Bissau is a source country for children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. The extent to which adults are subjected to forced prostitution is unclear. Bissau-Guinean girls are subjected to child sex trafficking in [[Guinea]] and [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Guinea-Bissau as a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]] country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Guinea-Bissau 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282665.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revenge tragedy''' (sometimes referred to as '''revenge drama''', [[revenge play]], or '''tragedy of blood''') is a theoretical genre in which the principal theme is revenge and revenge's fatal consequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Formally established by American educator [[Ashley_Horace_Thorndike|Ashley H. Thorndike]] in his 1902 article "The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays," a revenge tragedy documents the progress of the protagonist's revenge plot and often leads to the demise of both the murderers and the avenger himself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Thorndike, A. H. "The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays." ''Modern Language Association''. 17.2 (1902): 125-220. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre first appeared in [[Early modern Britain]] with the publication of [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' during the latter half of the 16th century''.'' Earlier works, such as [[Jasper Heywood]]'s translations of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (1560's) and [[Thomas Norton]] and [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]]'s play ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorbuduc]]'' (1561), are also considered revenge tragedies. Other well-known revenge tragedies include [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (c.1599-1602), ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (c.1588-1593), and [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''[[The Revenger's Tragedy]]'' (c.1606).

==Revenge Tragedy as a Genre==
The genre of revenge tragedy is a modern invention, developed as a means of explaining early modern tragedies that maintain a theme or motif of revenge in varying degrees. Classification of the revenge tragedy is at times contentious, as with other early modern theatrical genres.[[File:First Folio.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s First Folio]] Lawrence Danson suggested that Shakespeare and his contemporaries had a "healthy ability to live comfortably with the unruliness of a theatre where the genre was not static but moving and mixing, always producing new possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Danson, Lawrence. ''Shakespeare's Dramatic Genres''. Oxford University Press, Oxford: 2000. Print. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Shakespeare's 1623 [[First Folio]]'s famously depicts the printer-imposed ([[William Jaggard]] and [[Edward Blount]]) three genres of comedy, history, and tragedy, leading readers to falsely believe that plays are easily categorized and contained.&lt;ref&gt;The First Folio, printed after his death, was also prepared by Shakespeare's colleagues [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]].&lt;/ref&gt; While these three genres have remained staples in discussions of genre, other genres are often either invoked or created to accommodate the generic slipperiness of early modern drama. These include not only revenge tragedy, but also [[city comedy]], romance, [[pastoral]], and [[problem play]], among others.

It is common to consider any tragedy containing an element of revenge a revenge tragedy. Lily Campbell argues that revenge is the great thematic uniter of all early modern tragedy, and "all Elizabethan tragedy must appear as fundamentally a tragedy of revenge if the extent of the idea of revenge be but grasped."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lily. "Theories of Revenge in Renaissance England." ''Modern Philology''. 28.3 (1931) 281-296. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredson Bowers]]'s work (1959) on the genre not only widened and complicated what revenge tragedy is, but also increased its function as a productive lens in the work of dramatic interpretation. For example, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' was originally marketed in the First Folio as ''The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus.'' ''[[Hamlet]]'' was similarly titled in the First Folio as ''The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'' and ''The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'' in the [[Second Quarto]] edition (1604). It's not unusual to find present-day editors classifying these plays as tragedies;&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Lars. Introduction to ''The Duchess of Malfi''. ''The Duchess of Malfi''. By John Webster. ''English Renaissance Drama''. Eds. David Bevington, et al. Norton, New York: 2002. 1749-1754. Print. p. 1749.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weis, Rene. Introduction. ''John Webster'': The Duchess of Malfi ''and Other Plays''. By John Webster. Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1996. ix-xxviii. Print. p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is becoming increasingly common to also read and interpret early modern drama with other genres in mind, such as revenge tragedy.

==Generic Conventions==
While these conventions don't apply to all plays that can be considered revenge tragedies, the events listed are common within the genre:
* The avenger is killed
* Spectacle for the sake of spectacle
* Villains and accomplices that assist the avenger are killed
* The supernatural (often in the form of a ghost who urges the protagonist to seek vengeance)
* A play within a play, or [[Dumbshow|dumb show]]
* Madness or feigned madness
* Disguise
* Violent murders, including [[decapitation]] and [[dismemberment]]
* [[Soliloquy|Soliloquies]]
* A [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] figure
* [[Cannibalism]] ([[Thyestes|Thyestean]] banquets)
* A fifth and final act where many characters are killed (multiple corpses on the stage)
* Degeneration of a once-noble protagonist
* In later [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] and [[Caroline_era|Caroline]] revenge tragedies, the protagonist is more often a villain than a hero (though this is subjective)
* In later revenge tragedies, there is often more than one character who seeks revenge

== Significant revenge tragedy playwrights ==

===Lucius Seneca===

[[Seneca the Younger|Lucius Seneca]] was a prominent playwright of the first century, famous for helping shape the genre of revenge tragedy with his ten plays: ''[[Hercules (Seneca)|Hercules Furens]], [[Troades (Seneca)|Troades]], [[Phoenissae (Seneca)|Phoenissae]], [[Medea (Seneca)|Medea]], [[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]], [[Oedipus (Seneca)|Oedipus]], [[Agamemnon (Seneca)|Agamemnon]], [[Thyestes (Seneca)|Thyestes]], [[Hercules Oetaeus]], and [[Octavia (play)|Octavia]].''&lt;ref&gt;Alkhaleefah, Tarek A. "The Senecan Tragedy and its Adaptation for the Elizabethan Stage: A Study of Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy." ''International Journal of English and Literature''6.9 (Sept. 2015): 163-167. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of his plays lies in the difficulty of the period. While the Elizabethan tragedy was considered more acceptable, revenge tragedy sought to unleash the carnal side of human nature on stage in a much more grotesque way. It was a transitional time in the literary world that would eventually lead to grueling pieces like these. Infamous scenes like the [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] feast in ''Thyestes'' introduce the audience to another dimension of the human experience, challenging them to reflect on extreme emotions and dig deeper into the conventions of the genre.

Seneca’s ''Thyestes'', a tale of revenge and horror with prominent cannibalism, can be identified as one of the first "revenge pieces." In the power struggle between two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, there is a clear theme of revenge. The underlying plot is Thyestes's affair with Atreus' wife. He stole his treasured golden fleece, and sneakily took the throne of Mycenae from him. After a long period of exile, Thyestes is allowed to return to Mycenae. However, the conflict escalates when Atreus executes his revenge by tricking Thyestes into eating his children. Although overtly grotesque, this piece of literature follows the conventions of the revenge tragedy genre. Ultimately, everyone ends up dead and revenge has been taken to a level that was not anticipated in the beginning.

===William Shakespeare===
[[William Shakespeare]] was an English poet and playwright from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alchin|first1=Linda K.|title=William Shakespeare|url=http://www.william-shakespeare.info/|website=William Shakespeare|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through plays like ''Hamlet'' and ''Titus Andronicus'', Shakespeare portrayed the basic characteristics of a revenge tragedy. He presented elements that are quite similar to those from Seneca's tragedies, establishing tragedy as a more well-known genre.

''Titus Andronicus'' depicts the madness of Titus, who wanted to take revenge on Tamora and her sons for what they did to Lavinia and Bassianus. This leads him to kill everybody that he faced in his search to satisfy himself and avenge them. The main plot focuses on Titus's revenge against Tamora and her sons, but also there are other people to whom he seeks vengeance. This is an element that can define a revenge tragedy. The appearance of cannibalism in the last scene at the banquet and grotesque elements during the play relate ''Titus Andronicus'' to Seneca's earlier revenge tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/titus/full.html|title=Titus Andronicus|last=|first=|date=|website=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/index.html|script-title=Titus Andronicus|access-date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51860">'''Saturday-morning cartoon''' is a colloquial term for the original [[animated series|animated television]] programming that was typically scheduled on Saturday mornings in the [[United States]] on the [[Big Three television networks|major]] [[television network]]s. The genre's popularity had a broad peak from the late 1960s through the early 1990s; after this point, it declined in the face of changing cultural norms, increased competition from formats available at all times, and heavier regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kids' TV Grows Up: The Path from Howdy Doody to SpongeBob|last=Holz|first=Jo|publisher=McFarland|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4766-6874-1|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=73–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last two decades of the genre's existence, Saturday-morning cartoons were primarily created and aired to meet [[E/I|educational television mandates]], or E/I. Minor television networks, in addition to the non-commercial [[PBS]] in some markets, continue to air animated programming on Saturday while partially meeting those mandates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Pied Piper Of Cable Beguiles Rivals' Children|work=The New York Times|date=October 29, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/29/arts/pied-piper-of-cable-beguiles-rivals-children.html?scp=49&amp;sq=Felix%20the%20Cat&amp;st=cse|accessdate=August 21, 2010|last=Mifflin|first=Lawrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1990/0430/elevin.html|title=Mutant Ninja Turtles, Profits, and Children|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the generally accepted times for these and other children's programs to air on Saturday mornings were from 8:00 a.m. to noon [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Until the late 1970s, American networks also had a schedule of children's programming on Sunday mornings, though most programs at this time were repeats of Saturday morning shows that were already out of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020914&amp;slug=kidshows14|title=Saturday-morning TV gets ready to rumble|last=McFarland|first=Melanie|work=The Seattle Times|date=September 14, 2002|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Saturday Morning, Dude, Time for TV|work= New York Times|date=January 5, 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/tv/it-s-saturday-morning-dude-time-for-tv.html?scp=6&amp;sq=Beetlejuice%20cartoon&amp;st=cse|accessdate=August 12, 2010|first=Neil|last=Strauss}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some markets, some shows were pre-empted in favor of [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] or other types of [[local programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Television: trouble in toontown|work=Time|date=November 25, 1996|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985595,00.html|accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] Saturday morning cartoons were largely defunct by 2002. At least one U.S. broadcast television network still aired non-E/I animated programs on Saturday mornings as late as 2014; among the "Big Three" traditional major networks, the last non-educational cartoon (''[[Kim Possible]]'') last aired in 2006. [[Cable television]] networks have since then revived the practice of debuting their most popular animated programming on Saturday mornings on a sporadic basis.

==Technique==
An animated [[feature film]] may use 24 different [[frame rate|drawings ''per second'']] of finished film. Due to lower budgets, Saturday morning cartoons are often produced with a minimum amount of animation drawings, sometimes no more than three or four per second. In addition, the movements of the characters are often repeated, very limited, or even confined to mouths and eyes only. An exception to the 24-frames-per-second rule is when animation is "shot in twos" in which 12 drawings per second are used and the switch to 24 frames per second is for quick events such as explosions or "wild takes".

==History==
===Early cartoons===
Although the Saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of [[children's television|children's programming]] beginning in the early 1950s, the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on Saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s, when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids' viewing on that one morning to appeal to [[advertising|advertisers]]. Furthermore, [[limited animation]], such as that produced by such studios as [[Filmation|Filmation Associates]], [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]], [[Total Television]], [[Jay Ward Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]], was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot, as compared to live-action programming. While production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming, the cost of talent was far less (voice actors [[Daws Butler]], [[Don Messick]], [[June Foray]], [[Mel Blanc]], [[Paul Frees]], [[Jean Vander Pyl]], [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]], [[Howard Morris]], [[Allen Melvin]], [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]], [[Dayton Allen]], [[Janet Waldo]], [[Paul Winchell]], [[Hans Conried]], [[Casey Kasem]] and, in later years, [[Jim Cummings]], [[Frank Welker]], [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Jess Harnell]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Corey Burton]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Cree Summer]], [[Maurice LaMarche]] and [[Tom Kenny]] became known for their ability to hold several characters at once, sometimes even on the same show) and networks could rerun children's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series, negating the financial disadvantages. The experiment proved successful, and the time slot was filled with profitable programming.

Until the late 1960s, a number of Saturday-morning cartoons were [[reruns]] of animated series originally made for [[prime time]] during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier.  These included [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Top Cat]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'' and ''[[Jonny Quest]]'', [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.]]'s ''[[The Alvin Show]]'', and [[Bob Clampett]]'s ''[[Beany and Cecil]]''.

Some Saturday morning programs consisted of telecasts of older cartoons originally made for [[movie theater]]s, such as the ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'' and ''[[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]]'' cartoons produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]], the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and directed by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] for that studio prior to establishing their own company; the ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' and ''[[Heckle and Jeckle]]'' cartoons produced by [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]]'s ''[[Terrytoons]]'', and [[Walter Lantz]]'s ''[[Woody Woodpecker]]'' cartoons. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind ([[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] was particularly associated with this business model), so that by selling the shorts to theaters, the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone, which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Show Business: What's Up, Doc? Animation!|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 6, 1990|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970846,00.html|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these legacy characters later appeared in "new" versions by other producers (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' by Hanna and Barbera for their own company, and later by [[Filmation]]; ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' by [[Filmation]] and later by [[Ralph Bakshi]], ''[[The Pink Panther Show|The Pink Panther]]'' by [[Hanna-Barbera]] with [[Friz Freleng]] as a consultant).

The remainder of the networks' Saturday-morning schedules were filled by reruns of black-and-white live-action series made in the 1950s, usually with a western background (''[[The Lone Ranger]]'', ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]'', ''[[Sky King]]'', ''[[Fury (TV series)|Fury]]'', ''[[Rin-Tin-Tin]]'', ''[[My Friend Flicka]]'', etc.) and occasional first-run live-action series such as ''[[The Magic Land of Allakazam]]'', the later color episodes of ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', ''[[The Shari Lewis Show]]'', ''[[Shenanigans (game show)|Shenanigans]]'', and ''[[Watch Mr. Wizard]]''.

[[Independent station]]s (TV stations not affiliated with networks) often did not show cartoons on Saturday mornings, instead running feature films (usually [[B-Westerns]] or low-budget series movies such as ''[[The Bowery Boys]]'' or ''[[Bomba the Jungle Boy]]''), chapters of "[[cliffhanger]]" [[serial film]]s, comedy [[short subjects]] originally made for movie theatres (''[[Laurel and Hardy]]'', ''[[The Three Stooges]]'', and ''[[Our Gang]]''/''[[The Little Rascals]]''), older live-action syndicated series like ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', ''[[The Cisco Kid]]'', ''[[Ramar of the Jungle]]'', ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]]'', ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' and ''[[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]]''; and regional sports shows, often wrestling or bowling programs.

===1960s–1980s===
====1960s====
The mid-1960s brought a boom in [[superhero]] cartoon series, some adapted from [[comic books]], (''[[Superman]]'', ''[[Aquaman]]'', ''[[Spider-Man]]'', ''[[The Fantastic Four]]''), and others original (''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'', ''[[The Herculoids]]'', ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', etc.)  Also included were [[parodies]] of the superhero genre (''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'', ''[[The Super 6|The Super Six]]'', and ''[[George of the Jungle]]'', among others.)  Another development was the [[popular music]]-based cartoon, featuring both real-life groups (''[[The Beatles (TV series)|The Beatles]]'', ''[[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson 5ive]]'', and ''[[The Osmonds (TV series)|The Osmonds]]'') as well as anonymous studio musicians (''[[The Archies]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats]]'').  Live-action series continued to some extent with [[Sid and Marty Krofft]]'s ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'' and ''[[Sigmund and the Sea Monsters]]'', Hanna-Barbera's ''[[The Banana Splits]]'', Stan Burns and Mike Marmer's ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]'', ABC's ''[[Curiosity Shop]]'' (produced by [[Chuck Jones]]), [[Don Kirshner]]'s widely popular ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', and the British-made slapstick comedy ''[[Here Come the Double Deckers]]''.

====1970s====
With the 1970s came a wave of animated versions of popular live-action [[prime time]] series, mainly with the voices of the original casts, including ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' (''[[The Brady Kids]]''), ''[[Star Trek]]'' (''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]''),"Emergency!"(Emergency+4) ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (''[[The New Adventures of Gilligan]]'' and later ''[[Gilligan's Planet]]''), ''[[Happy Days]]'' (''[[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]''), ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'' (''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley in the Army]]''), ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' (''[[Mork &amp; Mindy/Laverne &amp; Shirley/Fonz Hour]]''), ''[[The Partridge Family]]'' (''[[Partridge Family 2200 A.D.]]''; the cast was also semi-regulars on ''[[Goober and the Ghost Chasers]]''), and ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (''[[The Dukes (TV series)|The Dukes]]''). Less literally adapted was ''[[The Oddball Couple]]'', which turned [[Neil Simon]]'s mismatched roommates into a scruffy dog and a fastidious cat. Many of these animated spinoffs featured storylines and settings that would not be feasible in most live-action series (such as trips around the world and/or into space). The ties between the animated spin-offs and their live-action origins varied widely, depending on how much input the original cast and crew were willing to contribute (and how much the animation companies were willing to pay for that talent); in retrospective, animated versions of TV series are generally not treated as [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

Other adaptations of familiar characters and properties included ''[[Tarzan]]'' (''[[Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle]]''), ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' (''[[Return to the Planet of the Apes]]''), ''[[Lassie]]'' (''[[Lassie's Rescue Rangers]]'') and ''[[Godzilla]]''. At this same time, the great success of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' spawned numerous imitations, combining ''[[The Archie Show|Archies]]''-style teen characters and [[funny animal]]s with light-weight mystery stories (''[[Speed Buggy]]'', ''[[Jabberjaw]]'', etc.)  Comedian [[Bill Cosby]] successfully blended educational elements with both comedy and music in the popular, long-running ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]''.

[[Filmation]], primarily a cartoon producer, also turned out several live-action Saturday morning series in the 1970s; including ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]'' and ''[[The Secrets of Isis|Isis]]'' (with animated sequences), ''[[Jason of Star Command]]'', ''[[The Ghost Busters]]'' (not related to the [[Ghostbusters|later movie series]], but a vehicle for former ''[[F Troop]]'' stars [[Larry Storch]] and [[Forrest Tucker]]) and ''[[Uncle Croc's Block]]''.

====1980s====
A Hanna-Barbera adaptation of the Belgian [[comic strip]] ''[[The Smurfs]]'' became a huge success in the 1980s, bringing with it other series with [[fairytale]]-like settings (''[[My Little Pony]]'', ''[[Monchichis]]'', ''[[Trollkins]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', etc.)  Most of the genres made popular in previous generations (funny animals, superheroes, teen mysteries, science fiction and live-action adaptations) continued to appear as well, with the exception of the musical band cartoons (only one of note, the syndicated ''[[Jem and the Holograms]]'', emerged in the 1980s); by this time, the bands were engaged in making [[music video]]s of their own, and listeners looking for their favorite bands ended up migrating to [[MTV]]. [[CBS]] and the producing team of [[Lee Mendelson]] and [[Bill Melendez]], acclaimed for their [[Emmy]]-winning prime time specials adapted from [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]'', brought Schulz's characters to Saturday mornings in ''[[The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show]]''; later in the 1980s, the successful ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip and TV specials were adapted into the long-running ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', also on CBS.

Other adaptations of familiar characters and properties included ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' (''[[Star Wars: Droids]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Ewoks]]'') and ''[[Zorro]]'' ([[The New Adventures of Zorro (1981 TV series)|''The New Adventures of Zorro'']]).

During the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, a glut of younger and junior versions of cartoon characters began appearing on Saturday morning cartoons.

===Watchgroup backlash===
Parents' lobby groups such as [[Action for Children's Television]] appeared in the late 1960s. They voiced concerns about the presentation of [[commercialism]], violence, anti-social attitudes and [[stereotype]]s in Saturday morning cartoons. By the 1970s, these groups exercised enough influence that the television networks felt compelled to lay down more stringent content rules for the animation houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419101063/pg_3/?tag=content;col1|title=Saturday-Morning Cartoons|accessdate=October 12, 2009|work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|first=Paul|last=Pogue|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toy-based TV: effects on children debated|work=The New York Times|date=February 3, 1986|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/arts/toy-based-tv-effects-on-children-debated.html |accessdate=August 10, 2010|first=Peter|last=Boyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONTROVERSY ABOUT TOYS, TV VIOLENCE|work=The New York Times|date=December 12, 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/12/garden/controversy-about-toys-tv-violence.html|accessdate=August 10, 2010|first=Glenn|last=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] was openly considering a ban on all advertising during television programming targeting preschoolers, and severe restrictions on other children's program advertising, which would have effectively killed off the format; the commission ultimately dropped the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Les (March 19, 1978). "[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1978/03/09/issue.html TV cartoons face dim future]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The networks were encouraged to create educational spots that endeavored to use animation and/or live-action for enriching content. The ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] became a television classic; ABC also had several other short-form animated featurettes, including ''[[Time for Timer]]'' and ''[[The Bod Squad]]'', that had long runs. Just as notable were [[CBS]]'s news segments for children, ''[[In the News]]'' and [[NBC]]'s ''Ask [[NBC News]]'' and ''[[One to Grow On]]'', which featured skits of everyday problems with advice from the stars of NBC [[Prime time|primetime]] programs.

===Decline===
The decline of the timeslot somewhat began in the early 1990s for a variety of reasons, including:
* The rise of [[broadcast syndication|first-run syndicated]] animated programs, which usually had a greater artistic freedom and looser standards than those that were mandated by a network. These programs included ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[Voltron]]'', ''[[ThunderCats]]'', ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'', ''[[Ducktales]]'', the first two seasons of ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', and the first three seasons of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/19/business/the-media-business-nbc-considers-scrapping-saturday-cartoons.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; NBC Considers Scrapping Saturday Cartoons|last=Boyer|first=Peter|work=The New York Times|date=September 19, 1988|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increasing regulation of children's programming content, including the [[Federal Communication Commission]]'s introduction of the [[E/I]] mandate in 1990 and later made more explicit in 1996. This required all broadcast networks to air "educational and informational" children's programs for at least three hours a week. Concurrent with this, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] outlawed the advertising of both [[premium-rate telephone number]]s and [[tie-in]] merchandise during children's hours. Both of these factors limited creative options and cut off large revenue sources for children's programs on network television, and would overrun Saturday morning cartoons.&lt;ref name=wp93014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/30/saturday-morning-cartoons-are-no-more/|title=Saturday morning cartoons are no more|last=Sullivan|first=Gail|work=The Washington Post|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;            
* The rise of [[cable television]] networks such as the [[Disney Channel]], [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Cartoon Network]], which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours, making Saturday morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers. Cable channels have the additional advantage of being beyond FCC content regulations and do not have to abide by educational and advertising regulations; within a year of the E/I mandate being imposed, Nickelodeon shot ahead of all of the broadcast networks in Saturday morning viewership ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-75761403.html|title=Nick Retains Saturday Crown|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=June 18, 2001|accessdate=October 30, 2013}} {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are at least ten channels specializing in children's programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/media/25kidstv.html?_r=1|title= Fox Ends Saturday-Morning Cartoons|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 25, 2008|accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable television was also better positioned to [[rerun]] children's programming as another source of revenue in an increasingly fractured marketplace.&lt;ref name=variety2002&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2002/tv/news/kid-skeds-tread-on-joint-strategy-1117873477/|title=Kid skeds tread on joint strategy|last=Bernstein|first=Paula|date=September 29, 2002|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The increased availability of [[home video]] services (both hard-copy and later through the Internet), which, just like cable, allowed children to watch their favorite cartoons at any given time.&lt;ref name=wp93014/&gt;
* An increase in children's participation in Saturday activities outside the home.&lt;ref name=awn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/disappearance-saturday-morning|title=The Disappearance of Saturday Morning|accessdate=October 2, 2009|work=[[Animation World Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The gradual legalization of [[no-fault divorce|no-fault]] [[divorce in the United States]] over the course of the 1970s and 1980s, which prompted a spike in divorces, and a desire for parents to make more productive use of time with their children. In addition, visitation periods for the secondary custodial parent often occurred Saturday mornings and afternoons, changing the routines of these children from a steady schedule every weekend.&lt;ref name=wp93014/&gt;

Animation companies survived by shifting their resources: [[adult animation|adult-oriented cartoons]], many in [[prime time]], experienced a revival in the 1990s as the Saturday morning cartoons were in decline, as did animated feature films (see, for example, the [[Disney Renaissance]]).&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; Fueled by the continued requirement for educational programming, networks continued to carry some cartoons well into the 2000s; by this point, these consisted either of repurposed [[rerun]]s from cable or outsourced blocks of cartoons imported from outside the United States. As the popularity of these blocks continued to decline and no hit shows emerged from them, by the early 2010s cartoons began an outright phaseout, with the major networks opting to fill their educational mandates by commissioning live-action, mostly documentary/human interest series that were far less labor-intensive and expensive to produce (and, more importantly for the networks, less restrictive in regard to commercials).&lt;ref name="Robb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/kids-tv-shows-saturday-mornings-fcc-loophole-advertising-1201774658/|title=Preteen Saturday Morning Kids Shows Abandoned By Broadcast Networks|last=Robb|first=David|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 20, 2016|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the space formerly filled by Saturday morning cartoons would be occupied by [[infomercial|paid programming]]&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/VR1117996360.html|title=Longform ads replace kid fare on Fox|last=Schneider|first=Michael|work=Variety|date=November 23, 2008|accessdate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded coverage of [[college football on television|college football]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma]]''&lt;/ref&gt; both of which greatly expanded as the result of separate government rulings in 1984.

==State of Saturday morning cartoons since the 1990s==
A 1996 [[Federal Communications Commission]] mandate, issued in the wake of the [[Children's Television Act]], requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children's [[E/I|educational/informational]] ("E/I") programming per week.

To help their [[network affiliate|affiliates]] comply with the regulations, broadcast networks began to reorganize their efforts to adhere to the mandates, so their affiliates would not bear the burden of scheduling the shows themselves on their own time thus eliminating the risk of having network product preempted by the mandates. This almost always meant that the educational programming was placed during the Saturday morning cartoon block.

[[NBC]] abandoned its original Saturday morning cartoon lineup in 1992, replacing it with a Saturday morning edition of ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' and adding an all live-action teen-oriented block, ''[[TNBC]]'', which featured ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'', ''[[California Dreams]]'' and other teen comedies. Even though the educational content was minimal to non-existent, NBC labeled all the live-action shows with an E/I rating and provided the [[legal fiction]] of a blanket educational summary [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] provided to stations to place in their quarterly educational effort reports for the FCC. Cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002, after cable network Discovery Kids (now [[Discovery Family]]) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction, beating out other children's television companies (notably [[Nickelodeon]], which already programmed CBS's Saturday morning block as [[Nick Jr. on CBS]]).

[[CBS]] followed NBC's example in 1997 by producing ''CBS News Saturday Morning'' for the first two hours of its lineup and an all live-action block of children's programming. The experiment lasted a few months, and CBS brought back its animated ''[[CBS Storybreak]]'' series.

In 2004, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was the last of the broadcast networks to add a Saturday morning edition of its morning news program (in their case, ''[[Good Morning America Weekend]]'') in the first hour of its lineup, mainly due to internal affiliate criticism of the lack of network coverage for the February 2003 [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] which occurred on a Saturday morning, forcing them to take coverage from other video [[wire service]]s. Prior to that, and particularly in the early 1990s, it was not uncommon for affiliates to preempt part or all of ABC's cartoon lineup with local programming.

Fox carried little or no E/I programming, leaving the responsibility of scheduling the E/I shows to the affiliates themselves (although the network did eventually add daily reruns of ''[[The Magic School Bus (TV series)|The Magic School Bus]]'' to meet the E/I mandates from 1998 to 2001). Following the closure of its [[4Kids TV]] block in 2008, Fox would not carry any children's programming at all for five years until the launch of [[Xploration Station]]. [[The WB]] was far more accommodating; for several years, the network aired the history-themed ''[[Histeria!]]'' five days a week, leaving only a half-hour of E/I programs up to the local affiliates to program.

Several channels, while not offering original animated series, do air reruns of older Saturday morning cartoons. [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], a spin-off channel of Cartoon Network, specialized primarily in [[rerun]]s of Saturday morning cartoons from the 1960s and 1970s (the majority of which come from Hanna-Barbera, which, like Boomerang, is owned by [[Time Warner]]). In the 2010s, the channel's focus shifted toward airing reruns of canceled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s (many of which were never intended for the Saturday morning programming block), and as of 2014, all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots. Hub Network owned the broadcast rights to rerun several of [[Fox Kids]]' most popular programs (this was a byproduct of former Fox Kids head [[Margaret Loesch]] working as head of the Hub Network at the time); the majority of that programming was dropped or relegated to early morning timeslots when Loesch left the network and the channel was relaunched as [[Discovery Family]] in 2014. A handful of [[digital subchannel]]s also make use of Saturday morning cartoon reruns, including [[Luken Communications]]'s [[PBJ (TV channel)|PBJ]] and [[Ion Media Networks]]' [[Qubo]].

In 2011, the major networks began to phase out weekend-morning educational programming aimed towards preteen audiences, in favor of live-action [[Reality television|reality]] and [[Television documentary|docuseries]] outsourced to other producers. [[Litton Entertainment]] took over programming the Saturday morning children's blocks from ABC, CBS, The CW and NBC in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2016 respectively. These programs are ostensibly aimed at teenagers and families, and networks have legally declared these new programs to be oriented towards viewers between the ages of 13 and 16. This distinction is important from a legal basis, as it removes the requirement for the programs to comply with the advertising limits imposed by the Children's Television Act.&lt;ref name="Robb"/&gt;

===Units of larger entertainment companies===
====ABC====
{{see also|Children's programming on the American Broadcasting Company}}
By the mid-1990s, broadcast networks were now becoming units of larger entertainment companies. ABC was bought by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996, which began airing all Disney-produced programming by 1997 and canceled programs produced by companies other than Disney (with the notable exceptions of two shows   ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs and Tweety Show]]'', which continued to air until Warner Bros. discontinued the show in 2000) and [[Science Court]] which was produced by Burns &amp; Burns also ran until 2000. After being purchased by Disney, ABC's Saturday morning cartoons became part of a block called [[ABC Kids (United States)|Disney's One Saturday Morning]] before switching to a block of live-action and animated programs under the banner [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] in 2002. Many of the block's shows were produced by Disney and also aired on [[Disney Channel]] and/ or [[Toon Disney]]. At one point, ABC Kids had only two animated shows on its schedule, while the remainder of the lineup consisted of live-action entertainment shows. By late 2008, all shows that were part of the ABC Kids block were reruns of older episodes that originally aired a few years earlier, this remained the case for the next three years, with no episodes added into rotation (thus, for instance, the first season of ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' was still running on ABC Kids in constant repeats even though several further seasons had aired on Disney Channel by the time the block ended).

[[Disney Channel]] (which, like ABC, is owned by The Walt Disney Company) launched a Saturday morning block of its popular animated programming, initially named [[Disney Channel Saturday Mornings|Toonin' Saturdays]], in June 2011. On August 27, 2011, ABC ended the ABC Kids block. ABC was the first network to outsource its E/I liabilities and Saturday morning program block to Litton; Litton's ABC block is known as the ''[[Litton's Weekend Adventure|Weekend Adventure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/468736-ABC_to_Premiere_ABC_Weekend_Adventure_on_Sept_3.php|title=ABC to Premiere ABC Weekend Adventure on Sept. 3|last=Albiniak|first=Paige|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928113011/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/468736-ABC_to_Premiere_ABC_Weekend_Adventure_on_Sept_3.php|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110524007282/en/Litton-Announces-ABC-Weekend-Adventure|title=Litton Announces "ABC Weekend Adventure"|work=Business Wire|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073435/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110524007282/en/Litton-Announces-ABC-Weekend-Adventure|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/05/24/51447/abc-orders-saturday-kids-block-from-litton|title=Litton To Supply Kids Block For ABC Stations|work=TV News Check|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204120253/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/51447/abc-orders-saturday-kids-block-from-litton|archivedate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney Channel quietly ended its Saturday morning cartoon block in 2014, then brought it back in 2017 as "Get Animated!"

====CBS====
{{see also|Children's programming on CBS}}
In 1999, CBS was purchased by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]], bringing it under the same ownership as popular children's network [[Nickelodeon]]. CBS in turn ran programming from Nickelodeon and [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] from 2000 until 2006, nearly a year after Viacom split into two separate companies (Nickelodeon went to a newly created company under the [[Viacom]] name and CBS became the flagship property of [[CBS Corporation]]). The two parties ended the Nickelodeon/Nick Jr.-branded block, which was replaced by the [[DIC Entertainment]] (now [[Cookie Jar Group]]) produced [[KOL Secret Slumber Party]] in September 2006. The block was rebranded as [[KEWLopolis]], featuring an increased amount of animated series, in September 2007. On September 19, 2009, KEWLopolis was rebranded as [[Cookie Jar TV]], with its target audience shifted toward preschoolers.&lt;ref name="CookieJarTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/22324|title=CBS Sets Lineup for Cookie Jar Block|date=September 4, 2009|work=WorldScreen|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kidscreen.com/2009/05/08/upfront-20090508/|title=Zeroing in|work=Kidscreen|date=May 8, 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814211724/http://kidscreen.com/2009/05/08/upfront-20090508/|archivedate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cookie Jar TV ended its run on September 21, 2013, at which point Litton also took over programming CBS' E/I liabilities and Saturday morning programming. Litton's CBS block is known as the ''[[CBS Dream Team]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-cbs-litton-entertainment-saturday-teen-block-20130724,0,7010894.story|title=CBS partners with Litton Entertainment for Saturday teen block|last=James|first=Meg|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 24, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second time CBS has dropped animated children's programming from its lineup; the network had previously gone with an all-live-action programming lineup for the 1997-98 season when the E/I rules took effect, but reverted to animated programming the following season. The ''Dream Team'' block is also unusual among the other Litton blocks as it includes scripted programming (as of 2016, only one scripted program, the government-funded [[police procedural]] ''[[The Inspectors (TV series)|The Inspectors]]'', airs on the block).

====Fox====
From 1990 to 2002, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] ran the [[Fox Kids]] block, which featured both animated and live-action series in the afterschool hours on weekday afternoons from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. (outcompeting with syndicated afternoon children's programs on independent stations and affiliates of smaller networks). Among its notable series included animated series such as ''[[Taz-Mania]]''; ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''; ''[[X-Men (1992 TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]''; ''[[Eek! The Cat]]''; ''[[Bobby's World]]''; ''[[Spider-Man (1994 animated series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Animaniacs]]'', live action shows like ''[[Power Rangers]]'' (American adaptation of ''[[Super Sentai]]''); ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'' and ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]''; and Japanese anime series such as ''[[Digimon]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''. Fox sold its children's division as part of its 2001 sale of [[Television networks preceding ABC Family#Fox Family|Fox Family Channel]] (now [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]) to The Walt Disney Company; the network then leased its remaining Saturday morning block to [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] in 2002.

The 4Kids-produced block, which by that point became [[4Kids TV]], ended its run on December 27, 2008, Fox opted to drop children's programming altogether rather than lease the block to another company,&lt;ref name="seekingalpha.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/105157-4kids-entertainment-inc-q3-2008-earnings-call-transcript|title=4Kids Entertainment, Inc.

Fox's [[owned-and-operated station]]s and affiliates instead hold the responsibility of carrying children's programming (generally through programs purchased off the syndication market).

On September 13, 2014, Fox's owned-and-operated stations (among some of their other affiliates, such as those owned by [[Tribune Company]]) picked up a new block entitled ''[[Xploration Station]]'' from [[Steve Rotfeld Productions]]. The three-hour block features [[E/I]] programs focused on science and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/fox-stations-add-srps-two-hour-stem-block/128024|title=Fox Stations Add SRP's Two-Hour STEM Block|last=Albiniak|first=Paige|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=December 17, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The CW====
{{Main|The CW}}

'''Origins'''

''[[Kids' WB]]'' debuted on [[The WB]] on September 9, 1995, as a block on weekday mornings, weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings. During the run of the weekday morning blocks, the network aired the animated series ''[[Histeria!]]'' to meet [[E/I]] content quotas for the network's affiliates. The ''Kids' WB'' weekday morning block ended in 2001, while the weekday afternoon block was discontinued on December 30, 2005 with The WB retaining the two afternoon hours to run a lineup of off-network syndicated reruns.

'''The CW begins airing children's programming'''

''[[Kids' WB]]'', now reduced to just the Saturday morning block that was expanded to five hours from four with the removal of the weekday afternoon lineup, moved to [[The CW]] (which is part-owned by The WB's former parent [[Time Warner]]) on September 23, 2006 (CW owned-and-operated station [[WUPA]] in Atlanta debuted the block the following day as it opted to carry the block on Sundays). The ''Kids' WB'' block ended its run on May 17, 2008, and was replaced on May 24, 2008 by the 4Kids Entertainment-produced ''[[Toonzai|The CW4Kids]]'' (4Kids already produced Fox's ''[[4Kids TV]]'' block at that time, which would not end for another seven months due to a dispute with the network over distribution on Fox stations and compensation for the time lease). ''The CW4Kids'' was renamed ''[[Toonzai]]'' on August 14, 2010 (with the former brand being retained as a sub-brand to fulfill branding requirements imposed by 4Kids), ''Toonzai'' was replaced by ''[[Vortexx]]'', produced under a time lease agreement with [[Saban Capital Group#Saban Brands|Saban Brands]] (which had acquired some of 4Kids' assets, including certain programs, in an auction earlier in the year) on August 25, 2012.

''Vortexx'' ended its run on September 27, 2014, at which point the CW turned over its E/I liability and Saturday morning programming to Litton as well. Litton's CW block is known as ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' and, at five hours in length, it is two hours longer than the blocks Litton programs for ABC and CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2014/05/exclusive-traditional-saturday-morning-programming-ends-fall-saban-brands-pulls-plug-vortexx/|title=Exclusive: Traditional Saturday Morning Programming Ends This Fall as Saban Brands Pulls the Plug on the Vortexx|work=Toon Zone|date=May 31, 2014|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/31/the-cw-replacing-vortexx-saturday-morning-programming-with-live-action-one-magnificent-morning/269192/|title=The CW Replacing 'Vortexx' Saturday Morning Programming With Live Action 'One Magnificent Morning'|last=Bibel|first=Sara|work=TV by the Numbers|date=May 31, 2014|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NBC====
{{see also|Children's programming on NBC}}
NBC entered into a partnership with digital cable and satellite network [[Discovery Family#As Discovery Kids|Discovery Kids]] to provide original programming from the channel on NBC's Saturday morning lineup in 2002; Discovery Kids on NBC ran on the network from September 14, 2002 to September 2, 2006. NBC replaced that block with [[Qubo]], a three-hour "[[edutainment]]" block that debuted on September 9, 2006 (with accompanying blocks on co-owned Spanish network [[Telemundo]] on weekend mornings and on [[Ion Television]] once weekly), as part of a programming partnership between parent company [[NBCUniversal]], [[Ion Media Networks]], [[Scholastic Press]], [[Nelvana]] and [[Classic Media]], that resulted in the creation of a companion digital multicast network on Ion Television's stations; the Qubo blocks on NBC and Telemundo ended on June 30, 2012, leaving only the Ion block and standalone Qubo Channel.

On July 7, 2012, NBC launched a new Saturday morning block aimed at preschool-aged children, [[NBC Kids]], under a time lease agreement with co-owned cable network [[Sprout (TV network)|Sprout]] (which NBC, through corporate parent [[Comcast]], also owned a minority interest before purchasing it outright in 2012). NBC Kids, which was the only and final Saturday morning programming block to air animated programming, ended its run on September 25, 2016.

On February 24, 2016, NBC announced a new E/I block produced by [[Litton Entertainment]], [[The More You Know (block)|The More You Know]]—a brand extension of NBC's [[public service announcement]] brand [[The More You Know|of the same name]], and it launched on October 8, 2016, resulting in NBC removing all cartoons from its Saturday morning lineups for the first time since September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/thewire/nbc-and-litton-entertainment-expand-iconic-more-you-know-platform-new-three-hour-saturday-morning-programming-block/154073|title=NBC and Litton Entertainment Expand Iconic 'The More You Know' Platform Into New Three-Hour Saturday Morning Programming Block|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=February 24, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/nbc-litton-partner-more-you-know-block/154074|title=NBC, Litton Partner on 'The More You Know' Block|last=Malone|first=Michael|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=February 24, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ThisTV====
On November 1, 2008, [[ThisTV]] launched airing a daily children's program block called [[Cookie Jar (company)|Cookie Jar Toons]], which was programmed by [[Cookie Jar Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjar.com/cj_about_ent.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128232653/http://www.cjar.com/cj_about_ent.php |archivedate=January 28, 2013 |title=About Cookie Jar Entertainment|work=Cookie Jar Group|accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mgm.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=559|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123517/http://mgm.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=559|archivedate=August 28, 2008|title=MGM Launches This TV Network|date=July 28, 2008|work=MGM|accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block featured mainly scripted animated and live action series; Cookie Jar-produced programs that did not count towards [[E/I]] quotas aired under the sub-block This is for Kids. Cookie Jar Toons/This is for Kids was discontinued on October 31, 2013, effectively removing Saturday children's programming from the network; after [[Tribune Broadcasting]] assumed part-ownership of ThisTV from [[Weigel Broadcasting]] the following day, Tribune replaced the block with a three-hour Sunday morning lineup of exclusively E/I-compliant programs from various syndication distributors.

On May 2, 2017, [[Sinclair Broadcasting Group]] announced that it would introduce a new children's programming block named ''[[KidsClick]]'', which airs on mainly CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, and nationally on [[This TV]], beginning on July 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sinclair-to-launch-kidsclick-multiplatform-programming-block-for-children-300449572.html|title=Sinclair To Launch 'KidsClick' Multiplatform Programming Block For Children|work=PR Newswire|date=May 2, 2017|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block was transferred from This TV to [[TBD (TV network)|TBD]] nationally starting on July 1, 2018.&lt;ref name=kctbd&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=KidsClickTV|number=1014882581073063937|date=July 5, 2018|title=We were sad too, but the good news is we are still on TV on TBD.

====DiC Kids Network/Cookie Jar Kids Network====
The [[Cookie Jar Kids Network]] (formerly DiC Kids Network) was a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] children's programming block that aired select animated (and some live action) series from the Cookie Jar Group program library on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[The CW|CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliated stations, and [[Independent station (North America)|Independent stations]] to allow these stations to meet required E/I programming quotas. This block ended on September 18, 2011.

====PBS Kids====
PBS has run daytime children's programming targeted at children between the ages of 4 and 12 since the network debuted on October 5, 1970. Its afternoon and Saturday morning children's programming was folded into a daily block called [[PTV (PBS)|PTV]] (which aired weekdays from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to Noon local time). On September 6, 1999, the block was rebranded as PBS Kids and spun off a 24-hour cable channel using the same name, which was turned into a joint venture with [[Comcast]], [[HIT Entertainment]] and [[Sesame Workshop]] in 2005, becoming [[PBS Kids Sprout]]. The PBS Kids cable channel was funded by [[DirecTV]].

Then, PBS Kids was divided into two sub-blocks and they were: [[PBS Kids Go!]] and the [[PBS Kids Preschool Block]]. An additional three-hour weekend morning block for preschool-aged children that was produced in conjunction with the Canadian production company [[Nelvana]] called the [[PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch]] debuted on September 30, 2000 and lasted until 2004. PBS Kids Go! debuted in 2004 and ended in 2013. The network continues to offer Saturday morning programming as of 2015, though as with most PBS programming, local member stations retain the right to refuse it outright for other programming such as instructional/DIY/cooking programming, carrying it on Sundays instead, or placing it on a subchannel. Also, other PBS member stations maintain full-time or half-time subchannels with self-programmed and slotted PBS Kids content which may share channel space with other networks such as [[Create (TV network)|Create]] or a local state political proceedings coverage network.

====Retro TV====
{{main|Retro Television Network}}
[[Retro Television Network]]'s Saturday morning lineup consisted of classic cartoons from the 1960s through 1990s, most of which were produced by [[Filmation]] licensed via [[DreamWorks Classics]]. Due to corporate consolidation which led to the DreamWorks library being owned by NBCUniversal (which had been unpaid in the past by the network for older primetime dramas) in 2016, this lineup was eventually pulled for low-cost barter E/I content and other newer cartoons unable to find distribution otherwise.

====Bounce TV====
{{main|Bounce TV}}
Only one cartoon series that aired on Saturdays was [[Bill Cosby]]'s ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'' during the early morning hours since moving from weeknights in 2012, having made it one of the only 3 subchannel networks that still aired cartoons without any advertisements aimed towards children and the only network that aired an African American cartoon since ''The Proud Family'' aired on ABC Kids from 2002 to 2005. [[Bounce TV]] still airs 3-hour E/I mandates on Saturdays. ''Fat Albert'' was discontinued on the network in July 2015 due to [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|Cosby's assault allegations]] currently going through the court system, in concert with the network also removing his [[Cosby|late 1990s CBS sitcom]] from their schedule.

====TeleXitos====
{{main|TeleXitos}}
TeleXitos airs both cartoons and 3-hour children's programming; however, only two non-[[E/I]] programming airs in the early morning and afternoon hours such as ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' and ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]''. Like [[Retro Television Network]] and [[MundoMax]], it doesn't air commercials aimed at children. It's the only Spanish-language subchannel to air cartoons on Saturdays.

'''''Shadowmatic''''' is a [[puzzle game]] developed and published by [[indie developer|indie studio]] Triada Studio Games from [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/187204/ | title = New photorealistic 3D puzzle Shadowmatic available on App Store}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shadowmatic is an imagination stirring puzzle where the player rotates abstract objects in a spotlight to find recognizable silhouettes in projected shadows, relevant to the surrounding environment. The project is focused on delivering photorealistic graphics across [[iOS]] devices, combined with a challenging and relaxing gameplay. ''Shadowmatic'' was released on January 15, 2015 for [[iOS]]. The game won a 2015 [[Apple Design Award]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Design Awards 2015|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/|website=Apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the attention to detail, high-fidelity rendering, excellent execution, and perfect representation of Multi-touch game play.

== Gameplay ==

Shadowmatic is a single player [[shadow puppet]] game. In the game, the player is presented with a very obscure, abstract object that, generally, doesn’t resemble anything. There’s an off-screen light source casting a shadow on the wall and the player's task is to rotate the object until the shadow forms a recognizable silhouette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Spanner|title=Shadowmatic Review: Illuminating|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2015/01/16/shadowmatic-review-illuminating/|website=Gamezebo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some levels feature two or three floating objects, adding more dimensions to the solution as the player attempts to not only rotate them correctly, but also position them relative to each other within 3D space, and thereby reveal the silhouette. In the levels with two or three objects, a button is supplied to switch control between them. 
Holding down this button and sliding a finger on the screen orbits the two objects around each other, which is a necessary aspect of the shadow's formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadowmatic|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Shadowmatic/review.asp?c=63379|website=PocketGamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other puzzle games, Shadowmatic is based on levels. Each level is themed, and the theme is reflected in the room’s surroundings—the animal levels, for example, take place in what looks like a jungle, while baby-themed levels take place in a nursery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You Should Play: Twist objects into shadow puppets with puzzler Shadowmatic|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/2878092/you-should-play-twist-objects-into-shadow-puppets-with-puzzler-shadowmatic.html|website=MacWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player will have to solve each stage before being able to move on to the next. In total, Shadowmatic has 70 levels that are spread out across the nine rooms. A progress meter at the bottom indicates how close the player is to finding it — the more dots are lit up, the closer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use your imagination to the fullest in Shadowmatic, a relaxing puzzle game|url=http://appadvice.com/review/shadowmatic|website=AppAdvice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the player is stuck, there is a hints system, where they can pay with the in-game currency to reveal a clue about the silhouette they are trying to find. Even though it’s there, the developers don’t recommend using it to enjoy the game to the fullest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use your imagination to the fullest in Shadowmatic, a relaxing puzzle game|url=http://appadvice.com/review/shadowmatic|website=AppAdvice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In-app purchases exist to purchase more hints. The player can also earn hints by completing levels.
The players earn hint-points depending on how fast they can solve it, and there are also secondary objectives and secrets that they'll discover as they go. The game has full Game Center integration for three leaderboards (score, completed levels, and secrets found), as well as 24 achievements to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use your imagination to the fullest in Shadowmatic, a relaxing puzzle game|url=http://appadvice.com/review/shadowmatic|website=AppAdvice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accolades ==
Shadowmatic has received several awards including: "Best Game Art" Indie Prize at the Casual Connect Amsterdam 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indie Prize Award Winners 2016|url=http://indieprize.org/asia/index.html/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227130336/http://indieprize.org/asia/index.html|archivedate=2016-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Excellence in Visual Art" and the "Media Choice Award" at the DevGAMM Moscow 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DevGAMM Moscow 2015 Winners|url=http://devgamm.com/moscow2015/en/games/awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 the game received the prestigious [[Apple Design Award]] at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] 2015.
Shadowmatic was featured in the [[CNN International]]'s "Silk Road: Past, Present, Future" show's segment on digital technology and innovation in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yerevan: Between history and technology|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/11/23/spc-the-silk-road-armenia-a.cnn|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">'''Social poetry''' is [[poetry]] which performs a [[social function]] or contains a level of [[social commentary]]. The term seems to have first appeared as a translation from the original Spanish [[:es:Poesía social|Poesia Socíal]],  used to describe the post-[[Spanish Civil War|Spanish-civil-war]] poetry movement of the 1950s and 60s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daydí-Tolson|first=Santiago|title=The Post-Civil War Spanish Social Poets|year=1983|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=0805765336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (including poets such as [[:es:Blas de Otero|Blas de Otero]] ). Later, José Eduardo Limón, for example, has used it to describe Mexican-American [[Chicano]] poetry in [[Texas]] during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Limón|first=José Eduardo|title=Mexican Ballads, Chicano Poems: History and Influence in Mexican-American Social Poetry|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520076338}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere, others have used the term to describe English-language poets such as [[W.H. Auden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Manteiga |first=Robert C. |title=Politics and Poetics: England's Thirties Poets and the Spanish Civil War |journal= Modern Language Studies |date= Summer 1989 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages= 3–14 |jstor= 3195099? |doi= 10.2307/3195099}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[George Bernard Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Bernard Shaw - Social Poet|url=http://vegsoc.org.au/religion_poetry_shaw.asp|publisher=Vegetarian  / Vegan Society of Queensland|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boston University]] has recently offered courses in “the social poetry of Central America.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romance Studies; Spanish|url=http://www.bu.edu/rs/about/spanish/|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

More recently, John Stubley has made use of the term as part of the Centre for Social Poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stubley|first=John|title=Home Page|url=http://socialpoetry.net/home-4/|publisher=Centre for Social Poetry|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stubley expands the idea to include what [[Owen Barfield]] describes as poetic “effect”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barfield|first=Owen|title=Poetic Diction: A study in Meaning|year=1952|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|location=London|isbn=081956026X|pages=52.|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – which distinguishes between the poetic ''form'' of words on a piece of paper, and the poetic ''effect'' of a “felt change of consciousness”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barfield|first=Owen|title=Poetic Diction: A Study in Meaning|year=1952|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|location=London|isbn=081956026X|pages=47–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stubley explores this poetic effect or experience as it occurs between human beings (socio-poetic experience), together with all that they can turn their minds and hands to in relation to the organisation (i.e., "poeticisation"&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stubley|first=John|title=About|url=http://socialpoetry.net/about/|publisher=Centre for Social Poetry|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[social relation|social life]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;  He attempts to create spaces that give expression to [[Imagination|imaginations]] of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] realities at work within the human and [[social organism]]s, thereby opening up the way to [[individual]] and [[social transformation]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

'''Taichi "Tai" Kamiya''', known as {{nihongo|'''Taichi Yagami'''|八神 太一|Yagami Taichi|}} in Japan, is a fictional character in the multimedia franchise [[Digimon]]. He first appeared in the ''[[Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01]]'' manga, where he is sent to the Digital World to meet his Digimon companion Zeromaru, in order to save it from multiple enemies. An alternate version of Tai appears in [[Toei Company]]'s 1999 series as the main protagonist of ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'', a supporting character in the sequel and once again as the protagonist of the films ''[[Digimon Adventure tri.]]''. In this timeline, Tai the leader of the first season [[List of Digimon Adventure characters#DigiDestined|DigiDestined]]. He is adventurous and a born leader, and is usually the first to spring into action. He is partnered with the [[dinosaur]]-like Agumon in the ''Digimon Adventure'' anime series.

Tai was created by manga author Tenya Yabuno from ''V-Tamer 01''. Multiple voice actors have voiced him across the franchise. Critical reception to Tai has been positive by writers from manga and anime websites. While his role and personality in the first Digimon series has been positive, writers expressed mixed thoughts about Tai's characterization in ''Tri'' due to lacking his hotblooded personality.

==Development==
Tai's original character was designed by Tenya Yabuno, one of the authors of manga ''V-Tamer 01''. He was based on Kentarou Kamon, the protagonist of the ''Digimon'' manga pilot, ''C'mon Digimon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digimon V-Tamer 01|year=1999|author=Yabuno, Tenya}}&lt;/ref&gt; While creating the ''Digimon Adventure'' short, director [[Mamoru Hosoda]] wanted to focus on Tai and Kari's relationship with Koromon, the Digimon that appeared in their house, but did not want to portray it as friendship, instead portraying Digimon as dangerous creatures.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite book|title=Digimon Movie Book|language=Japanese|publisher=Shueisha|year=2001|isbn=978-4087790955|pages=111–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer Satoru Nishizono revealed that as the staff decided on Tai's name using [[kanji]] that related to "luck". While Tai was conceptualized as the main character, Toei wanted to focus on all the Digidestined children at the same time resulting in an ensemble cast. Nishizono stated that with the exception of Tai and Agumon, Toei was told to make in-depth young characters to fit's the series' viewers. The staff considered Tai to remain as a protagonist for the next sequel but instead ended as a supporting character.&lt;ref&gt;"Memories of Our Digimon Adventure, Part 6" July 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="staff1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalscratch.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/interview-memories-of-da-pt-6 | title=Memories of Our Digimon Adventure, Part 6 | accessdate=2010-12-26| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011154626/http://digitalscratch.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/interview-memories-of-da-pt-6/| archivedate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bcn|date=July 2017|reason=This is a fan translation. Please reference the original text.}} For ''[[Digimon Adventure#Films|Digimon Adventure: Children's War Game!]]'', Hosoda wanted to focus on Tai's naivete through his nervousness on interacting with Sora despite needing her help. While finding Tai's actions out of character, Hosoda wanted Tai to try his best to apologize with Sora.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

For ''tri.'', Keitaro Motonaga stated the staff at Toei devised multiple scenarios to compare how he aged with his previous appearances. The staff also focused on his rivalry with Matt Ishida, due to how differently the two matured. Motonaga also commented that Tai was in a stage where he thought he would not be a teenager, which changed his characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Digimon Adventure Tri Interview|magazine=Otomedia|publisher=Gakken Plus|issue=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Digimon Adventure tri.]]'' series, Tai's teenage appearance was designed by Atsuya Uki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-12-13/new-digimon-anime-staff-key-visual-title-unveiled/.82117|title=New Digimon Anime's Staff, Key Visual, Title Unveiled|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, Tai's appearances were voiced by [[Toshiko Fujita]]. During auditions, the staff immediately chose her as they were fans of her works. Fujita liked Tai's character, due to how he cares for his sister and for his clumsy personality. She did not find difficulties in voicing Tai for the first series. She also liked the relationship between Tai and Agumon, believing it to be one of the best from the anime based on their similarities.&lt;ref&gt;"Memories of Our Digimon Adventure, Part 1" July 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; For ''tri'', Fujita was replaced by [[Natsuki Hanae]], who had been a fan of the series since he was a child and enjoyed Tai's character based on his bravery and sense of justice. He rewatched the first anime and the film before auditioning. at the same time pressured. When reading the script, Hanae noted Tai was different due to how he aged and felt this change was natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Digimon Adventure Tri Interview|magazine=Otomedia|publisher=Gakken Plus|issue=August 2016|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English dub, the character's name was shortened to "Tai" from "Taichi." [[Joshua Seth]] provides his voice. He did not find any impressions, during his audition for the character with comments on how he was close to the people in the cast. He felt Tai was similar to him so he "pitched up [his voice] little bit younger". Additionally, he stated he enjoyed voicing the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/culture/digimons-joshua-seth-on-blowing-minds-and-reuniting-with-digital-monsters-1698814/|title=Digimon’s Joshua Seth on Blowing Minds and Reuniting With Digital Monsters|work=Geek|accessdate=August 18, 2017|author=Minor, Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time the film ''Revenge of Diaboromon'' was dubbed in English, he had retired from the voice acting industry in 2005, causing casting director Jeff Nimoy to cast [[Jason Spisak]] as his replacement, remarking how similar he sounded to Seth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digipedia.db-destiny.net/cast_crew/nimoy2.htm |title=Retrospective with Jeff Nimoy |publisher=Digipedia.db-destiny.net |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seth commented that his regular is very similar to the one from Tai in ''Tri'' was not difficult as he initially thought he had to "warm" up to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/digimon/258402/joshua-seth-interview-digimons-tai-returns|title=Joshua Seth Interview: Digimon's Tai Returns|work=Den of Geek|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Devil''''' ({{lang-hu|Az ördög}}) ([[1918 in film|1918]]) is a [[cinema of Hungary|Hungarian film]] directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. The  film was remade for American audiences by [[James Young (director)|James Young]] in 1921, starring [[George Arliss]] in his film debut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/D/Devil1921.html Silent Era entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production background==
From the original ad campaign, "Here is a story mounted in settings and scenes of splendor and luxury. A story that is as old as yesterday; as true as today; and as new as tomorrow. A production of real mark and unexcelled distinction. As the central figure George Arliss is an unforgettable picture of fiendish, subtle, domineering and diabolic ingenuity; of cunning, sardonic and unrelenting resourcefulness. Yet he is the suave, charming, polished and artistic Devil."

This satiric drama was based on the 1908 play by [[Ferenc Molnar]] that launched Arliss on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and was used to entice him into his very first (of many) films. Earlier versions were made by no less than [[Thomas Edison]] and [[D.W. Griffith]]. The original play title was "The Devil; A Comedy in Three Acts." In an interview from Motion Picture World, January 1921, Mr. Arliss told reporters he decided to go into films, after being impressed by the work of [[Charlie Chaplin]]. The director then made a screen test to show Arliss how intimate the camera was, and how it exaggerated gestures. Arliss said films would probably lead to better acting on the stage, when actors could study their technique on the big screen.

==Plot==
Dr. Muller (Arliss), a friend to all, finds pleasure in turning the goodness in people to evil ends. He meets Marie Matin ([[Lucy Cotton]]) and her fiancé, Georges Roben (Roland Bottomley), while viewing a new painting, "The Martyr-Truth Crucified by Evil." Marie declares that the picture was wrong: Evil could never triumph over Truth, and though Muller says he agrees with her, he plots to prove otherwise. To this end, he entangles Marie with artist Paul de Veaux (Edmund Lowe), Georges's best friend, causing the latter's model, Mimi (Sylvia Breamer), to become jealous. Georges, believing that he is standing between Paul and Marie, releases Marie from her engagement. Marie finds Paul and Mimi alone together, late one evening, and turns back to Georges, whom she marries. This does not discourage Muller, who but for Marie's purity almost succeeds in his evil designs. As a last resort, Muller lures Marie to his apartment to trick her. There in a moment of dramatic conflict—she prays for help; a vision of a shining cross appears; and Muller is consumed in flames. Note: This was also the first film for Fredric March and Mrs. George Arliss.

==Preservation status==
This once lost film has recently been rediscovered and is now being restored by the [[Library of Congress]] Motion Picture Conservation Center in [[Dayton, Ohio]].

On a 2010 episode of [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] series ''[[American Pickers]]'' the show's hosts are invited to search under the stage of a turn of the century theater and film hall. Under the stage, they find a dusty stack of old movie posters, the main and most vivid being a forgotten poster for the 1921 version of ''The Devil''.

'''''Uncle Scrooge''''' (stylized as '''''Uncle $crooge''''') is a [[comic book]] starring [[Scrooge McDuck]] ("the richest duck in the world"), his nephew [[Donald Duck]], and grandnephews [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], and revolving around their adventures in [[Duckburg]] and around the world. It was first published in Four Color Comics #386 March 1952, as a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the popular "Donald Duck" series and is still presently ongoing. It has been produced under the aegis of several different publishers, including [[Western Publishing]] (initially in association with [[Dell Comics]] and later under its own subsidiary, [[Gold Key Comics]] and its Whitman imprint), [[Gladstone Publishing]], [[Disney Comics]], [[Gemstone Publishing]], [[Boom! Studios]], and [[IDW Publishing]], and has undergone several hiatuses of varying length. Despite this, it has maintained the same numbering scheme throughout its six decade history, with only IDW adding a secondary numbering that started at #1.&lt;ref name="IDW-0115"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=58660|title=IDW KICKS OFF NEW MONTHLY DISNEY LINE IN APRIL WITH "UNCLE SCROOGE" #1|author=Stephen Gerding|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Scrooge and his family, recurring characters include [[Gyro Gearloose]], [[Gladstone Gander]], [[Emily Quackfaster]], and [[Brigitta MacBridge]]. Among the adversaries who make repeat appearances are [[the Beagle Boys]], [[Magica De Spell]], [[John D. Rockerduck]] and [[Flintheart Glomgold]]. ''Uncle Scrooge'' is one of the core titles of the "[[Duck universe]]".

Its early issues by famed writer/artist (and creator of Scrooge McDuck) [[Carl Barks]] formed the inspiration for the syndicated television cartoon ''[[DuckTales]]'' in the late 1980s. Several stories written by Barks and published in ''Uncle Scrooge'' were adapted as episodes of ''DuckTales''.

==Writers and artists==
The first 70 issues mostly consisted of stories written and drawn by Carl Barks. The 71st issue had a story written by Barks and drawn by [[Tony Strobl]]. Subsequent Gold Key Comics issues combined reprints of earlier Barks tales with new material by creators such as Strobl, [[Vic Lockman]], [[Phil DeLara]], Jack Manning, and [[Pete Alvarado]].

When Gladstone Publishing relaunched the title in 1986, a new generation of American creators began contributing to the title, including [[Don Rosa]], [[William Van Horn]], [[John Lustig]], Pat McGreal, Dave Rawson, and [[Michael T. Gilbert]]. As before, their work was intermingled with Carl Barks reprints, as well as with translations of European Disney comics by such creators as [[Daan Jippes]], Fred Milton and [[Romano Scarpa]] originally published by Oberon, [[Egmont (media group)|Egmont]] (originally Gutenberghus) and [[Disney comics#Italy|Disney Italy]]/[[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Mondadori]].

==U.S. publication history==
{{main|List of Uncle Scrooge comics}}

* [[Dell Comics]]: 1952–1962 (''[[Four Color Comics]]'' issues 386, 456 and 495; issues 4–39)
* [[Gold Key Comics]]: 1962–1984 (issues 40–173 as Gold Key, 174–209 as Whitman)
* [[Gladstone Publishing]]: 1986–1990 (issues 210–242)
* [[Disney Comics]]: 1990–1993 (issues 243–280)

* [[IDW Publishing]]: 2015– (issue 405 onwards, with additional IDW-specific issue numbers starting from 1)&lt;ref name="IDW-0115"/&gt;

Scrooge made his first appearance in the Donald Duck story "[[Christmas on Bear Mountain]]" as a curmudgeonly man who decides to test Donald and his nephews to see if they are worthy of inheriting his wealth. Barks found the character and his wealth a useful springboard for stories and re-used him in a number of subsequent Donald Duck one-shot adventures and ten pagers appearing in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]''. By 1952 the popularity of the character convinced Dell to give Scrooge a try-out as a lead character in the seminal "[[Only a Poor Old Man]]" in Dell's ''[[Four Color]]'' anthology series, a story Barks expert [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] has termed a masterpiece. After two further ''Four Color'' appearances Scrooge was granted his own title starting with issue number 4 (counting the try-out issues as one through three).

The series continued uninterrupted (though not always on a monthly schedule) until 1984, when [[Western Publishing]] (the parent company of Gold Key/Whitman, who were publishing the title at the time) withdrew from the comic book business. Western had held the Disney comic book license since the late 1930s, and their withdrawal left the license, and ''Uncle Scrooge'', in limbo for two years, when [[Another Rainbow]], who had been publishing hardbound compilations of Carl Barks's work for several years, acquired it and launched Gladstone Publishing, resuming the title where Whitman had left off.

Gladstone continued publishing ''Uncle Scrooge'' until their license expired in 1990. At that point, the series shifted over to [[Disney Comics]] with little change in editorial direction. It was one of only three monthly titles to survive the "Disney implosion" of 1991 (the others being ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' and ''Donald Duck Adventures''), and continued to be published by Disney Comics until 1993, when Disney Comics folded and the license was reacquired by Gladstone Publishing. Gladstone went through their own implosion in 1998, and ''Uncle Scrooge'' was briefly converted into a double-sized (64 page), "prestige" format series, before Gladstone ended publication entirely later that year.

No further issues were published until 2003, when Gemstone Publishing (whose editorial staff included several former employees of Gladstone) acquired the license and resumed publication of ''Uncle Scrooge''. Gemstone maintained the prestige format previously adopted by Gladstone, and continued to publish the series until November 2008. Financial difficulties at Gemstone ended its run then, and the license was acquired by [[Boom! Studios]], who reverted to the standard 32 page format when they began publication in late 2009. Boom's run ended in 2011, when the Walt Disney Company's acquisition of [[Marvel Entertainment]] lead to the consolidation of all Disney comics licenses under [[Marvel Comics]].

In January 2015, [[IDW Publishing]] announced that they would be publishing the title, starting in April 2015.&lt;ref name="IDW-0115"/&gt;

===Other titles and spinoffs===
Over the years, Scrooge McDuck has proven popular enough to appear as the main character in a number of other comic book series. Many of these series include republications of stories originally written for the "main" ''Uncle Scrooge'' title in the United States or various European countries.

Scrooge often appeared in ''[[The Beagle Boys]]'' alongside his frequent adversaries, published irregularly by Gold Key from 1963 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beagle Boys|url=http://www.wolfstad.com/dcw/united-states/the-beagle-boys/|work=DCW: Disney Comics Worldwide|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When that title ended, it was relaunched as ''The Beagle Boys Versus Uncle Scrooge'' in March 1979 and lasted for twelve issues, until February 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA: The Beagle Boys Versus Uncle Scrooge|url=http://coa.inducks.org/publication.php?c=us/BBVS|work=I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Gladstone Publishing began publication of ''[[Uncle Scrooge Adventures]]'', which they would continue to publish until 1998, excluding the period from 1990 through 1993, when Disney Comics held the license to publish Disney comics.

Scrooge was also a major character in three different comic book titles tied in with the ''[[DuckTales]]'' television series. The first of these consisted of 13 issues and was published by Gladstone Publishing from 1987 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA: Ducktales|url=http://coa.inducks.org/publication.php?c=us/DT|work=I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second consisted of 18 issues published by Disney Comics from 1990 through 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA: Ducktales (Disney Comics)|url=http://coa.inducks.org/publication.php?c=us/DTD|work=I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final (to date) was published over six issues by Boom Kids! in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA: DuckTales (Boom)|url=http://coa.inducks.org/publication.php?c=us/DTK|work=I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several ''DuckTales'' comics starring Scrooge would also appear in the pages of ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA: Disney Adventures|url=http://coa.inducks.org/publication.php?c=us/DA|work=I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, ''The Adventurous Uncle Scrooge McDuck'', published by Gladstone, ran for two issues in 1998. A third issue was planned but cancelled along with the rest of Gladstone's output other than ''Uncle Scrooge'' and ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' following a collapse in comics sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Adventurous Uncle Scrooge McDuck|url=http://www.wolfstad.com/dcw/united-states/the-adventurous-uncle-scrooge-mcduck/|work=DCW: Disney Comics Worldwide|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |Title=Everyone Is A Suspect: Presented by Up and Vanished and Murder on the Orient Express
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|27}}
 |Aux1={{Duration|m=29|s=38}}
 |ShortSummary=Up and Vanished and Murder on the Orient Express present a podcast exclusive, "Everyone Is a Suspect." True crime often inspires the most successful fictional crime stories. When told by a visionary novelist like Dame Agatha Christie, dubbed "The Queen of Crime," these fictional stories can become larger than life and even more compelling than truth. "Everyone Is a Suspect" dives deeper into both fact and fiction, taking a closer look at the “Crime of the Century," the 1932 Lindbergh Baby kidnapping, which, along with Christie’s own experiences as a passenger on the Orient express, inspired her to write the 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express. In true Up and Vanished fashion, host Payne Lindsey will reexamine the Lindbergh kidnapping case, and even retrace Christie’s steps by embarking on his own trip aboard the Orient Express. In preparation for the November 10th premiere of Murder on the Orient Express, the podcast will also include interview episodes titled, "The Suspects.” Each episode will focus on the upcoming film, featuring a collection of cast interviews, discussing the MOTOE novel and film, the parallels between true crime and fiction, podcasting, and more.

==Consumer availability==

===Distribution===

===Sales===
In 2011, the Belgian consumer bought 6.54 million games. More than 84% of those games were console games.

'''Walking''' is one of the most popular outdoor recreational activities in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramblers.org.uk/what-we-do/making-the-case-for-walking/participation-in-walking.aspx Ramblers Association website: Walking Facts and Figures]&lt;/ref&gt; and within England and Wales there is a comprehensive network of [[Rights of Way in England and Wales|rights of way]] that permits access to the countryside. Furthermore, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land has opened up since the enactment of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]]. In Scotland the ancient tradition of [[freedom to roam|universal access to land]] was formally codified under the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]].&lt;ref name=knowthecode&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outdooraccess-scotland.scot/sites/soac/files/docs/know_the_code_leaflet.pdf|title=Enjoy Scotland’s Outdoors|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are few rights of way, or other access to land in [[Northern Ireland]]. 

[[Walking]] is used in the United Kingdom to describe a range of activity, from a walk in the park to trekking in the [[Alps]]. The word "[[hiking]]" is used in the UK, but less often than walking; the word '''rambling''' is also used, and the main organisation that supports walking is called [[The Ramblers]]. Walking in mountainous areas in the UK is called [[hillwalking]], or in [[Northern England]], including the [[Lake District]] and [[Yorkshire Dales]], fellwalking, from the dialect word [[fell]], for high, uncultivated land. Mountain walking can sometimes involve [[scrambling]].

==History==
The idea of undertaking a walk through the countryside for pleasure developed in the 18th-century, and arose because of changing attitudes to the landscape and nature, associated with the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', ed. M. H. Abrams, vol. 2 (7th edition) (2000), p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times walking generally indicated poverty and was also associated with vagrancy.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Solnit, ''Wanderlust: A History of Walking''. New York: Penguin Books, 2000, p.83, and note p.297.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]], an English priest, popularised the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the [[Lake District]] of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed

&lt;blockquote&gt;to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.&lt;ref name=West2&gt;{{cite book |last=West |title=A Guide to the Lakes |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this end he included various "stations" or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name=development&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011064752/http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |title=Development of tourism in the Lake District National Park|accessdate=27 November 2008|publisher=Lake District UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1778 the book was a major success.&lt;ref name=NPA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |title=Understanding the National Park – Viewing Stations|accessdate=27 November 2008|publisher=Lake District National Park Authority }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous early exponent of walking for pleasure was the English poet [[William Wordsworth]]. In 1790 he embarked on an extended tour of France, Switzerland, and Germany, a journey subsequently recorded in his long autobiographical poem ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1850). His famous poem ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' was inspired by a visit to the [[Wye Valley]] made during a walking tour of [[Wales]] in 1798 with his sister [[Dorothy Wordsworth]]. Wordsworth's friend [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] was another keen walker and in the autumn of 1799, he and Wordsworth undertook a three weeks tour of the [[Lake District]]. [[John Keats]], who belonged to the next generation of [[Romantic poets]] began, in June 1818, a [[walking tour]] of Scotland, Ireland, and the [[Lake District]] with his friend Charles Armitage Brown.

More and more people undertook walking tours through the 19th-century, of which the most famous is probably [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s journey through the [[Cévennes]] in France with a donkey, recorded in his ''[[Travels with a Donkey]]'' (1879). Stevenson also published in 1876 his famous essay "Walking Tours". The subgenre of [[travel writing]] produced many classics in the subsequent 20th-century. An early American example of a book that describes an extended walking tour is naturalist [[John Muir]]'s ''A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf'' (1916), a posthumous published account of a long botanising walk, undertaken in 1867.

Due to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialisation]] in England, people began to migrate to the cities where living standards were often cramped and unsanitary. They would escape the confines of the city by rambling about in the countryside. However, the land in England, particularly around the urban areas of [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]], was privately owned and [[trespass]] was illegal. Rambling clubs soon sprang up in the [[North of England|north]] and began politically campaigning for the legal '[[right to roam]]'. One of the first such clubs, was 'Sunday Tramps' founded by [[Leslie White]] in 1879. The first national grouping, the Federation of Rambling Clubs, was formed in London in 1905 and was heavily patronised by the [[peerage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBkNAQAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Forbidden Land: The Struggle for Access to Mountain and Moorland|author=Stephenson, Tom|year=1989|publisher= Manchester University Press|page=78|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to Mountains [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s, that would have legislated the public's 'right to roam' across some private land, were periodically presented to Parliament from 1884 to 1932 without success. Finally, in 1932, the Rambler's Right Movement organised a [[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|mass trespass]] on [[Kinder Scout]] in Derbyshire. Despite attempts on the part of the police to prevent the trespass from going ahead it was successfully achieved due to massive publicity. However, the Mountain Access Bill that was passed in 1939 was opposed by many walkers, including the organisation [[The Ramblers]], who felt that it did not sufficiently protect their rights, and it was eventually repealed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramblers.org.uk/wales/what-we-do/protecting-and-expanding-where-we-walk/right-to-roam-crow.aspx The Ramblers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort to improve access led after World War II to the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], and in 1951 to the creation of the first [[national park]] in the UK, the [[Peak District National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/79227/factsheet4-quarrying.pdf |title=Quarrying and mineral extraction in the Peak District National Park |publisher=Peak District National Park Authority |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of this and similar national parks helped to improve access for all outdoors enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nowthenmagazine.com/issue-52/kinder-trespass/|title=Kinder Trespass. A history of rambling |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] considerably extended the [[right to roam]] in England and Wales.

===Walking tour===
A walking tour is an extended walk in the countryside, undertaken by an individual, or group for several days. Walking tours have their origin in the [[Romantic movement]] of the late 18th, early 19th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Solnit, ''Wanderlust: A History of Walking''. New York: Penguin Books, 2000, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; It has some similarities with [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], [[trekking]], and also [[tramping]] in New Zealand, though it need not take place in remote places. In the late 20th-century, with proliferation of official and unofficial long distance walking routes, walkers now are more likely to follow a long distance way, than to plan their own walking tour. Such tours are also organised by commercial companies, and can have a professional guide, or are self-guided; in these commercially organised tours, luggage is often transported between accommodation stops.

====Rights of way ====
{{Main|Right of way (public throughway)|Rights of way in England and Wales}}
[[File:Dry stone wall 20.JPG|thumb|right|Limestone hills and [[dry-stone wall]]s in the west of the Yorkshire Dales. This part of the national park is popular with walkers due to the presence of the [[Yorkshire three peaks]].]]
In England and [[Wales]] the public has a legally protected right to "pass and repass" (i.e. walk) on [[footpath]]s, [[bridleway]]s and other routes which have the status of a [[public right of way]].  Footpaths typically pass over private land, but if they are public rights of way they are public highways with the same protection in law as other highways, such as [[trunk road]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramblers.org.uk/info/britain/footpathlaw.html Ramblers Association: Basics of Footpath Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Public rights of way originated in [[common law]], but are now regulated by the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]].  These rights have occasionally resulted in conflicts between walkers and landowners.  The rights and obligations of farmers who cultivate crops in fields crossed by public footpaths are now specified in the law. Walkers can also use '''permissive paths''', where the public does not have a legal right to walk, but where the landowner has granted permission for them to walk.

====Rights of way in London====
[[Definitive map]]s of public [[rights of way]] have been compiled for all of [[England and Wales]] as a result of [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]], except the 12 [[Inner London]] boroughs&lt;ref&gt;[http://naturenet.net/row/definitivemaps.html Definitive maps]&lt;/ref&gt; which, along with the [[City of London]], were not covered by the Act.

To protect the existing rights of way in London the Ramblers launched their "Putting London on the Map" in 2010 with the aim of getting "the same legal protection for paths in the capital as already exists for footpaths elsewhere in England and Wales. Currently, legislation allows the Inner London boroughs to choose to produce definitive maps if they wish, but none do so".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innerlondonramblers.org.uk/current-campaigns/putting-london-on-the-map.html Inner London Ramblers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Right to roam ====
Walkers long campaigned for the [[right to roam]], that is access to privately owned uncultivated land. In 1932 the [[mass trespass of Kinder Scout]] had a far-reaching impact.  The [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949|1949 Countryside Act]] created the concept of designated [[open Country]], where access agreements were negotiated with landowners. The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] gave walkers a conditional right to access most areas of uncultivated land.

=== Scotland ===

==== Right to roam ====
{{main|Scottish Outdoor Access Code}}
In [[Scotland]] there is a traditional presumption of universal access to land. This was formally codified into [[Scots law]] under the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], which grants  everyone the right to be on most land and inland water for recreation, education and going from place to place providing they act responsibly.&lt;ref name=knowthecode&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outdooraccess-scotland.scot/sites/soac/files/docs/know_the_code_leaflet.pdf|title=Enjoy Scotland’s Outdoors|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of access rights in Scotland is one of shared responsibilities, in that those exercising such rights have to act responsibly, whilst landowners and managers have a reciprocal responsibility to respect the interests of those who exercise their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Scottish Outdoor Access Code|url=https://www.outdooraccess-scotland.scot/|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|accessdate=12 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides detailed guidance on these responsibilities.

Responsible access can be enjoyed over the majority of land in Scotland, including all uncultivated land such as hills, mountains, moorland, woods and forests. Access rights also apply to fields in which crops have not been sown or in which there are farm animals grazing; where crops are growing or have been sown access rights are restricted to the margins of those fields. Access rights do not apply to land on which there is a building, plant or machinery. Where that building is a house or other dwelling (e.g. a [[static caravan]]) the land surrounding it is also excluded in order to provide reasonable measures of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Outdoor Access Code|url=http://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/rr-content/uploads/2016/07/Scottish-Outdoor-Access-Code.pdf|publisher=[[Scottish Natural Heritage]]|date=2005|accessdate=2018-07-18|pages=7-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of how much land surrounding a building is required to provide "reasonable measures of privacy" has been the main issue on which the courts have been asked to intervene. In ''Gloag v. [[Perth and Kinross Council]]'' the sheriff allowed about {{convert|14|acres|ha|order=flip}} surrounding [[Kinfauns Castle]], a property belonging to [[Ann Gloag]], to be excluded from access rights. In ''Snowie v Stirling Council and the Ramblers’ Association'' the courts allowed about {{convert|13|acres|ha|order=flip}} to be excluded, but refused permission for a wider area to be excluded and required the landowner to keep the driveway unlocked to allow access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairngorms.co.uk/resource/docs/boardpapers/11112008/CNPA.Paper.2680.Local%20Outdoor%20Access%20Forum%20Working%20Group.Paper.6.Summary.pdf|title=Summary of Scottish access and liability court cases|publisher=Cairngorms Local Outdoor Access Forum|accessdate=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Severin |last=Carrell |title=Multimillionaire uses financial muscle to bar ramblers from woods |url=https://www.theguardian.com/country/article/0,,2102624,00.html |work=The Guardian |date= 14 June 2007 |accessdate=12 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rights of way====
{{Main|Rights of way in Scotland}}
In addition to the general right of access the public also have the right to use any defined route over which the public has been able to pass unhindered for at least 20 years.  However, local authorities are not required to maintain and signpost public rights of way as they are in England and Wales.

===Northern Ireland===
[[File:Mourne_mountains.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Mourne Wall]], looking towards Hare's Gap in the [[Mourne Mountains]], [[Northern Ireland]]]]
[[Northern Ireland]] has very few public rights of way and access to land in Northern Ireland is more restricted than other parts of the UK, so that in many areas walkers can only enjoy the countryside because of the goodwill and tolerance of landowners. Permission has been obtained from all landowners across whose land the Waymarked Ways and [[Ulster Way]] traverse. Much of Northern Ireland's public land is accessible, e.g. Water Service and [[Forest Service Northern Ireland|Forest Service]] land, as is land owned and managed by organisations such as the [[National Trust]] and the [[Woodland Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkni.com/useful-info/ Walk Northern Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern Ireland shares the same legal system as England, including concepts about the ownership of land and public rights of way, but it has its own court structure, system of precedents and specific access legislation.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Public Rights of Way and Access to the Countryside: [http://www.doeni.gov.uk/index/information/foi/.../publications-details.htm?].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-distance footpaths===
{{Main|Long distance footpaths in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Black Hill (Peak District).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The paved surface of the Pennine Way on [[Black Hill (Peak District)|Black Hill]], Cheshire, England]]

Long-distance paths are created by linking public footpaths, other rights of way, and sometimes permissive paths, to form a continuous walking route. They are usually waymarked and guidebooks are available for most long-distance paths. Paths are generally well signposted, although a map is also needed, and a compass may sometimes be needed on high [[moorland]]. There are usually places to camp on an extended trip, but accommodation of various kinds is available on many routes. However, occasionally paths are distant from settlements, so that camping is necessary. Water is not available on high [[downland]] paths, like [[The Ridgeway]], though taps have been provided at some spots.

Fifteen paths in England and Wales have the status of [[National Trails]], which attract government financial support. Twenty-nine paths in Scotland have the similar status of [[Scotland's Great Trails]]. The first long-distance path was the [[Pennine Way]], which was proposed by [[Tom Stephenson (activist)|Tom Stephenson]] in 1935, and finally opened in 1965. Other paths include [[South Downs Way]] and [[Offa's Dyke Path]]. Major guides to these [[long-distance footpath]]s in Britain are provided by [[HMSO]] for the [[Countryside Commission]], one of the first being that for the [[Pennine Way]] by Tom Stephenson in the 1960s.

==Hillwalking==
{{See also|Mountains and hills of England|Mountains and hills of Scotland|Scrambling}}
Walks or hikes undertaken in upland country, [[moorland]], and mountains, especially when they include climbing a [[summit (topography)|summit]] are sometimes described as hillwalking or fellwalking in the United Kingdom. Though hillwalking can entail [[scrambling]] to reach a mountain summit, it is not [[mountaineering]].&lt;ref name="urlBMC - Safety &amp; Skills"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebmc.co.uk/Feature.aspx?id=1568 |title=BMC – Safety &amp; Skills |author=Alex Messenger |date=4 April 1999 |publisher=[[British Mountaineering Council]] |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MCI"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mountaineering.ie/aboutthemci/tier1viewdetials.asp?ID=8&amp;Tier1ID=8 |title=Mountaineering Ireland (Previously MCI) |year=2009 |work=Mountain Leader Training Northern Ireland |publisher=[[Mountaineering Ireland]] |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellwalking is a word used specifically to refer to hill or mountain [[walking]] in [[Northern England]], including the [[Lake District]], Lancashire, especially the [[Forest of Bowland]], and the [[Yorkshire Dales]], where [[fell]] is a [[dialect]] word for high, uncultivated land.

[[File:Black Mountain Top.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The summit of the [[Black Mountain, Wales|Black Mountain]], crossed by the [[Offa's Dyke Path]] on the English/Welsh border]]

Popular locations for hillwalking include the [[Lake District]], the [[Peak District]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]], [[Snowdonia]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] and [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]], Wales, [[Dartmoor]] and the [[Scottish Highlands]], including the [[Cairngorms]], the largest [[National Park]] in the UK. The mountains in Britain are modest in height, with [[Ben Nevis]] at {{convert|4409|ft}} the highest, but the unpredictably wide range of weather conditions, and often difficult terrain, can make walking in many areas challenging. [[Peak bagging]] provides a focus for the activities of many hillwalkers. The first of the many [[hill lists in the British Isles|hill lists]] compiled for this purpose was the [[Munro]]s – mountains in Scotland over {{convert|3000|ft}} – which remains one of the most popular.

The United Kingdom offers a wide variety of ascents, from gentle rolling lowland hills to some very exposed routes in the moorlands and mountains. The term ''climbing'' is used for the activity of tackling the more technically difficult ways of getting up hills involving [[rock climbing]] while hillwalking refers to relatively easier routes.
[[File:Liathach from Beinn Eighe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Liathach]] seen from [[Beinn Eighe]]. With the [[Munro]] "Top" of Stuc a' Choire Dhuibh Bhig (915 metres) in the foreground and the two Munro summits in the background.]] However, many hillwalkers become proficient in [[scrambling]], an activity involving use of the hands for extra support on the crags. It is an ambiguous term that lies somewhere between walking and [[rock climbing]], and many easy climbs are sometimes referred to as difficult scrambles. A distinction can be made by defining any ascent as a climb, when hands are used to hold body weight, rather than just for balance. While much of the enjoyment of scrambling depends on the freedom from technical apparatus, unroped scrambling in exposed situations is potentially one of the most dangerous of [[mountaineering]] activities, and most guidebooks advise carrying a rope, especially on harder scrambles, which may be used for security on exposed sections, to assist less confident members of the party, or to facilitate retreat in case of difficulty. Scramblers need to know their limits and to turn back before getting into difficulties. Many easy scrambles in good weather become serious climbs if the weather deteriorates. [[Black ice]] or [[Glaze ice|verglas]] is a particular problem in cold weather, and [[mist]] or [[fog]] can disorientate scramblers very quickly.
[[File:Striding Edge.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Striding Edge from [[Helvellyn]], English [[Lake District]]]]

Many of the world's mountaintops may be reached by walking or scrambling up their least steep side. In Great Britain ridge routes which involve some scrambling are especially popular, including [[Crib Goch]] on [[Snowdon]], the north ridge of [[Tryfan]], [[Striding Edge]] on [[Helvellyn]] and Sharp Edge on [[Blencathra]] in the [[Lake District]], as well as numerous routes in [[Scotland]] such as the [[Aonach Eagach]] ridge in [[Glen Coe|Glencoe]]. Many such routes include a "bad step" where the scrambling suddenly becomes much more serious.

In Britain, the term "mountaineering" tends to be reserved for technical climbing on mountains, or for serious domestic hillwalking, especially in winter, with additional equipment such as ice axe and crampons, or for routes requiring rock-climbing skills and a rope, such as the traverse of the [[Cuillin]] ridge, on the Scottish island of [[Skye]]. The [[British Mountaineering Council]] provides more information on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebmc.co.uk BMC website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Navigation]] and map-reading are essential hillwalking skills on high ground and mountains, due to the variability of [[Climate of the United Kingdom|British]] and Irish weather and the risk of rain, low cloud, fog or the onset of darkness. In some areas it is common for there to be no waymarked path to follow. In most areas [[Hiking boots|walking boots]] are essential along with weatherproof clothing, spare warm clothes, and in mountainous areas a [[Bivouac sack|bivvy bag]] or [[bothy bag]] in case an accident forces a prolonged, and possibly overnight halt. Other important items carried by hillwalkers are: food and water, an emergency [[whistle]], [[flashlight|torch/flashlight]] (and spare batteries), and [[first aid]] kit. And, where reception permits, a fully charged mobile phone is recommended. Hillwalkers are also advised to let someone know their route and estimated time of return or arrival.

===Guidebooks===
{{see also|List of UK hill-walking guide writers}}
[[File:Catbells_Northern_Ascent,_Lake_District_-_June_2009.jpg|thumb|left|Hillwalkers on Catbells, [[Lake District]], England]]
[[W A Poucher]] (1891–1988) wrote several hillwalking guide books, in the 1960s, which describe, in detail, the various routes up specific mountains, along with the precautions needed and other practical information useful to walkers. The guides cover [[Wales]], [[Peak District]], [[Scotland]], [[Isle of Skye]] and the [[Lake District]]. Even more detailed guides were written by [[Alfred Wainwright]] (1907–1991) but these are mainly restricted to the [[Lake District]] and environs. His main series of seven books was first published between 1955 and 1966. Both authors describe the major paths, their starting points and the peaks where they end, with important landmarks along each route. Neither are entirely comprehensive. More recently Mark Richards has written numerous walking guides, especially for the Lake District, for the publisher [[Cicerone (publisher)|Cicerone]], who are now the leading publisher of walking guides in the UK. The [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] are, through the experience and knowledge of their members, the largest publishers of guidebooks to climbing and walking in Scotland.

==Walking in London==
{{main|Walking in London}}
[[File:Canal_Regent_Londres.jpg|thumb|left|The Regent's Canal near St Mark's Regents' Park.]]
Walking is a popular recreational activity in London, despite traffic congestion. There are many areas that provide space for interesting walks, including commons, parks, canals, and disused railway tracks. This includes [[Wimbledon Common]], [[Hampstead Heath]], the eight [[Royal Parks]], [[Hampton Court Park]], and [[Epping Forest]]. In recent years access to canals and rivers, including the [[Regents Canal]], and the [[River Thames]] has been greatly improved, and as well a number of long distance walking routes have been created that link green spaces.

The following are some of long distance routes in London:
*[[Capital Ring]] a {{convert|75|mi}} circular route with 15 sections and a radius of approximately 4–8 miles (6–13&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Charing Cross]], mostly through the inner [[Outer London]] suburbs but also partly in [[Inner London]]. The route forms a complete circuit, crossing the [[River Thames]] twice and with a suggested starting point at [[Woolwich]];
*[[London Outer Orbital Path]] ("Loop") a 150-mile (240&amp;nbsp;km) circular route with 24 sections mostly through [[Outer London]] suburbs. The "[[M25 motorway|M25]]" for walkers, the path is broken because the Thames cannot be crossed between [[Purfleet]] and [[Erith]];
*[[Jubilee Walkway]] a route through central London, originally called the '''Silver Jubilee Walkway''', laid down in 1977 as part of the celebrations of the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II]]. The route takes in many of London's major attractions;
*[[Lea Valley Walk]] which starts outside Greater London but has around 12.5 miles (20&amp;nbsp;km) within its boundary. The route follows the [[River Lea]] and the [[Lee Navigation]];
*The River [[Thames Path]] a [[National Trail]], opened in 1996, following the length of the [[River Thames]], starting outside London at its source near [[Kemble, Gloucestershire|Kemble]] in Gloucestershire and ending at the [[Thames Barrier]] at [[Charlton, London|Charlton]]. It is about {{convert|184|mi|km}} long. More than {{convert|20|mi|km}} are within London.

== Challenge walks ==
Challenge walks are strenuous walks by a defined route to be completed in a specified time.  Many are organised as annual events, with hundreds of participants. In May and June, with longer daylight hours, challenge walks may be 40 or more miles.  A few are overnight events, covering distances up to 100 miles. Well-known challenge walks include the [[Lyke Wake Walk]] and the [[Yorkshire three peaks|Three Peaks Challenge]] in Yorkshire, and the [[Three Towers Hike]] in Berkshire. See also [[Long Distance Walkers Association]].
[[File:Ingleborough whole.JPG|thumb|[[Ingleborough]], Yorkshire, which is on the [[Yorkshire Three Peaks]]]]There are also some challenge walks aimed at children, young adults and youth groups such as the [[Chase Walk]].

== Walking for health ==
{{main|Walking}}
In the UK the health benefits of walking are widely recognised.  In 1995 Dr [[William Bird (doctor)|William Bird]], a general practitioner, started the concept of "health walks" for his patients—regular, brisk walks undertaken to improve an individual's health.  This led to the formation of the Walking for Health Initiative (WfH, formerly known as 'Walking the way to Health' or WHI) by [[Natural England]] and the [[British Heart Foundation]].  WfH trains volunteers to lead free health walks from community venues such as libraries and GP surgeries.  The scheme has trained more than 35,000 volunteers and there are more than 500 Walking for Health schemes across the UK, with thousands of people walking every week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whi.org.uk Walking the Way to Health Initiative website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the [[Ramblers]] launched its flagship Get Walking Keep Walking project, funded by the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Big Lottery]] and Ramblers Holidays Charitable Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getwalking.org Get Walking Keep Walking website]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike regular health walks, the Get Walking Keep Walking model uses targeted outreach programmes based around a 12-week walking plan to encourage regular independent walking.  In the same year, a new organisation, Walk England was formed, with aid from the National Lottery and the [[Department for Transport]], to provide support to health, transport and environmental professionals who are working to encourage walking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkengland.org.uk Walk England website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisations ==
The government agency responsible for promoting access to the countryside in England is [[Natural England]].  In Wales the comparable body is the [[Countryside Council for Wales]], and in Scotland [[Scottish Natural Heritage]]. The [[Ramblers]] (Britain's Walking Charity) promotes the interests of walkers in Great Britain and provides information for its members and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramblers.org.uk Ramblers website]&lt;/ref&gt; Local Ramblers volunteers organise hundreds of group-led walks every week, all across Britain. These are primarily for members; non-members are welcomed as guests for two or three walks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramblers.org.uk/areas_groups/groupswalksfinder Group Walks Finder]&lt;/ref&gt; The Get Walking Keep Walking project provides free led walks for residents in certain areas, information and resources to those new to walking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getwalking.org Get Walking Keep Walking website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the organisations that promote the interest of walkers are: the [[Ramblers Association]], the [[British Mountaineering Council]], the [[Mountaineering Council of Scotland]], The Online Fellwalking Club, and the [[Long Distance Walkers Association]], which assists users of [[long-distance trail]]s and challenge walkers. Organisations which provide overnight accommodation for walkers include the [[Youth Hostels Association (England &amp; Wales)|Youth Hostels Association]] in England and Wales, the [[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]], and the [[Mountain Bothies Association]].

'''William Alfred Merchant''' (31 July 1919&amp;nbsp;– 26 May 2001), was an English midget clown who performed under the name of '''"Little Billy" Merchant'''. Born in a [[workhouse]] in [[Barton Hill, Bristol]], Merchant was abandoned by his parents as a young child and brought up in an orphanage in Bristol. As an adult, he was only {{convert|42|in|m}} tall.

Merchant was fascinated by his local variety theatre, the Bristol Empire, where a chance encounter in 1937 resulted in his recruitment into John Lester's troupe of midgets. He subsequently joined Joe Boganny's band of acrobatic dwarves, with whom he appeared in many of the leading variety venues of the time. During the Second World War Merchant worked as an aircraft fitter for the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]], but he managed to spend the 1944 summer season at Chessington Zoo Circus, partnering the clown Fiery Jack (real name Fred Zetina).{{r|TelegraphObituary}} His partnership with [[Robert George John Francis Fossett|Jacko the Clown]] lasted for 30 years, during which time the pair travelled extensively on the European circus circuit. They were regular performers at the [[Belle Vue Zoological Gardens#Circus|Belle Vue Christmas Circus]] until Merchant's retirement in 1979.{{sfnp|Stackhouse|Hyams|2005|p=65|ps=none}} They also spent six summer seasons at the Great Yarmouth Hippodrome.{{r|TelegraphObituary}}

Merchant moved to a retirement home in [[Skegness]] in 1979. He  received a lifetime achievement award from the Circus Friends' Association of Great Britain in 2000.{{r|TelegraphObituary}}

'''''Yoni Ki Baat''''' (roughly translated from [[Hindi]] as "Talks of the Vagina," and sometimes abbreviated '''''YKB&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;''''') is a project featuring the live performance of monologues by women of [[South Asian diaspora|South Asian origin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southasiansisters.org/|title=South Asian Sisters|author=|date=|work=southasiansisters.org|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; loosely inspired by [[Eve Ensler|Eve Ensler's]] ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sapnamagazine.com/2005/our-vaginas-have-monolugues-too-breaking-the-silence-one-yoni-at-a-time/|title=Our Vaginas Have Monolugues, Too: Breaking the Silence, One Yoni at a Time|author=|first=|date=|work=Sapna Magazine: South Asian American Women|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503033334/http://sapnamagazine.com/2005/our-vaginas-have-monolugues-too-breaking-the-silence-one-yoni-at-a-time/|archive-date=2016-05-03|dead-url=|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Yoni_Ki_Baat:_South_Asian_Queer_and_Feminist_Organizing|title=Yoni Ki Baat: South Asian Queer and Feminist Organizing|last=Bharat|first=Omsri|date=2015|website=FoundSF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces can be performed by the writer, or by another performer, sometimes anonymously.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makker|first=Vandana|date=May 29, 2004|title=If My Vagina Could Speak...|url=http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/articles/157|journal=SAMAR|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its launch, ''YKB'' has been continuously performed across the United States.

''Yoni Ki Baat'' was developed in 2003 by South Asian Sisters, a non-profit collective of South Asian women based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=7417|title=South Asian Women in America Talk Sex, Break Myths  by Vandana Makker|author=|first=|date=|work=Boloji|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723213231/http://cms.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=7417|archive-date=2017-07-23|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founders Maulie Dass, Sapna Shahani, and Vandana Makker sent out a call in February 2003, and described receiving an outpouring of submissions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theaerogram.com/yoni-ki-baat-vagina-monologues-inspired-celebration-south-asian-women/|title=‘Yoni Ki Baat’: A ‘Vagina Monologues’-Inspired Celebration of South Asian Women|last=Luhar|first=Monica|date=2014-03-17|work=The Aerogram|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/displayArticleS.php?id=120306062833|title=‘Yoni Ki Baat’ Spotlights Desi Diaspora Women's Sexuality|last=Assisi|first=Francis C.|date=2007-01-02|website=IndoLink|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102142008/http://www.indolink.com/displayArticleS.php?id=120306062833|archive-date=2007-01-02|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public performances in July 2003 at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] included monologues dealing with abuse, menstruation, masturbation, orgasms, marriage, religious faith, and political protest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to co-founder Vandana Makker:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Yoni Ki Baat'' allows individuals who identify as women of South Asian ancestry the space to share their stories around issues that are often 'taboo' (and therefore not discussed) in our communities. Stories around sex, body image, abuse, violence. Stories around sex, body image, abuse, violence, pleasure, hair, relationships, bodily functions, strong emotions—pleasure, hair, relationships, bodily functions, strong emotions—those things we often can’t even admit to ourselves. These are the stories that we seek out and then perform on stage. Sometimes the writers perform their own pieces and sometimes we have other women perform them. In the spirit of ''The Vagina Monologues'', a portion of the proceeds from each show are donated to organizations that support survivors of domestic violence."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Yoni Ki Baat'' performances and spinoffs have been performed in various parts of the United States by campus organizations and local South Asian organizations, sometimes borrowing scripts from South Asian Sisters, holding calls for submissions, or a combination of the two. The majority of proceeds are donated to organizations supporting survivors of domestic violence in the South Asian community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to South Asian Sisters' regular performances in the San Francisco Bay Area, ''YKB'' has been staged in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yonikiraat.wixsite.com/yonikiraat|title=Yoni Ki Raat|work=Yoni Ki Raat|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2017/03/16/yoni-ki-baat-vagina-monologues-seattle-2017/63560|title=Yoni Ki Baat: Where skeptics learn to trust|date=2017-03-16|work=The Seattle Globalist|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://events.sulekha.com/yoni-ki-baat-2018_event-in_naperville-il_330589|title=Yoni Ki Baat - 2018  at North Central College Meiley Swallow Hal, Naperville, IL|last=|first=|date=|website=events.sulekha.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://union.wisc.edu/events-and-activities/event-calendar/event/yoni-ki-baat-intersectional-stories-from-womyn-of-color/197/|title=Yoni Ki Baat|last=|first=|date=|website=union.wisc.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2018/04/south-asian-sisters-bring-yoni-ki-baat-to-harvard/|title=South Asian Sisters Bring Yoni Ki Baat to Harvard|last=|first=|date=2018-04-12|work=The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/yonikibaat|title=Yoni Ki Baat|last=|first=|date=|website=maizepages.umich.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thescarlet.org/15716/larts/yoni-ki-baat-south-asian-vagina-monologues/|title=Yoni Ki Baat: South Asian Vagina Monologues|last=Bilimoria|first=Drashhti|work=The Scarlet|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grinnell, Iowa|Grinnell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesandb.com/article/yoni-ki-baat-vulnerable-and-empowering.html|title=Yoni Ki Baat: Vulnerable and Empowering|last=Bohlke|first=Lily|date=October 27, 2017|work=The Scarlet and Black|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://shc.stanford.edu/events/yoni-ki-baat-performance-rangmanch|title="Yoni ki Baat"- A Performance by Rangmanch|last=|first=|date=2014-03-03|work=Stanford Humanities|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zuffa, LLC''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|uː|f|ə}}) is an American sports promotion company specializing in [[mixed martial arts]]. It was founded in January 2001 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], by [[Station Casinos]] executives [[Frank Fertitta III]] and [[Lorenzo Fertitta]] to be the parent entity of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) after they purchased it from the Semaphore Entertainment Group. The word "Zuffa" is an [[Italian language|Italian]] word ({{IPA-it|ˈtsuffa|pron}}), meaning "fight". On July 11, 2016, Zuffa announced that it would be purchased by [[WME-IMG]] for the price of $4.025 billion.&lt;ref name="espn.go.com"&gt;http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/16970360/ufc-sold-unprecedented-4-billion-dana-white-confirms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with MMA organizations==

===International Fight League===
Throughout the existence of the [[International Fight League]] (IFL) between 2006 and 2008, both Zuffa and the IFL had competed in a hostile relationship. Zuffa accused the IFL of and sued them for illegally using proprietary information obtained by hiring executives from the UFC organization. The IFL responded with their own suit claiming that Zuffa was threatening potential partners not to work with the IFL, including [[Fox Sports Net]] (a deal with Fox Sports was later signed before resolution of the suit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/IFL-Inks-Broadcast-Deal-with-Fox-Sports-Net-4205 |title=IFL Inks Broadcast Deal with Fox Sports Net |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The tension between the IFL and the UFC worsened with accusations that the IFL had attempted to buy out several top UFC fighters.

In July 2008, there were reports of the IFL's possible purchase by the UFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Corey Lorinsky|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/2008/7/ufc-might-buy-clobbered-international-fight-league-ifli- |title=Hope For KO-ed International Fight League (IFLI): UFC Might Buy It* |publisher=Business Insider |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Joe Favorito, former IFL senior vice president, cited financial troubles for the closing of the company on July 31, 2008. Anonymous sources stated that Zuffa had bought the IFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zuffa purchases IFL|url=http://www.thefightnetwork.com/news/805:zuffa-purchases-ifl/|work=Fight Network|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other reports cited the UFC's airing of IFL footage on its programming, and the signing of previous IFL fighters, as an indirect confirmation of the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5thround.com/07252008/news/1293/ifl-going-goinggone/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201045527/http://www.5thround.com/07252008/news/1293/ifl-going-goinggone/ |date=December 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WFA===
On December 11, 2006, Zuffa acquired the assets of the [[World Fighting Alliance]], and formed WFA Enterprises, LLC. as a subsidiary to handle these assets, including select fighter contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&amp;gid=3959 |title=Subsidiary of Zuffa, LLC Acquires Assets from World Fighting Alliance, Inc |publisher=Ufc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410002850/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&amp;gid=3959 |archivedate=2010-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, it was reported that Zuffa was formalizing plans to buy [[World Extreme Cagefighting]], to be run as a separate promotion from the UFC.

===WEC===
Following the purchase of the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], Zuffa made several changes to the promotion. This included modifying the WEC's cage, transferring to a focus on lighter weight classes, giving it the ability to host events in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], and having the championships of fighters who were contracted UFC fighters vacated. From 2007 to the end of 2010, the WEC was run as a separate promotion under the Zuffa banner, airing events [[WEC 28|28]] to [[WEC 53|53]] on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] in the US and on [[The Score Television Network|The Score]] in Canada. On October 28, 2010, [[Dana White]] announced that the WEC would be absorbed into the UFC in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCIWWLnJSN4&amp;feature=sub |title=Exclusive: Dana White Announces UFC-WEC Merger |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pride Fighting Championships===
{{main|Pride Fighting Championships#Pride Worldwide era}}

On March 27, 2007, it was announced that [[Frank Fertitta III]] and [[Lorenzo Fertitta]] were acquiring the assets of [[Pride Fighting Championships]], the UFC's largest rival, from [[Dream Stage Entertainment]]. To handle the take over, the Fertitta brothers created a new corporate entity to handle the assets, Pride FC Worldwide Holdings LLC. With common ownership in place, Zuffa and Pride Worldwide would be working closely together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=3053&amp;zoneid=13 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111019/http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=3053&amp;zoneid=13 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although goals of reviving Pride were not realized, many of Pride's assets, including contracts with fighters and intellectual property, are now regularly utilized by the UFC.

===Strikeforce===

====Early relationship (2008–2010)====

Starting around 2008, UFC president Dana White began a long media battle with their main competitor, [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], and their main media partner, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. White had expressed that he had "no beef with Strikeforce", instead indicating a greater dislike for Showtime, and Ken Hershman in particular. However, White did express in an interview that he had a mutual relationship with Strikeforce founder and CEO [[Scott Coker]], explaining that Coker was caught up in his battle with Showtime.

====2011 acquisition and beyond (2011–2013)====

On March 1, 2011, Scott Coker was noted for dismissing rumors of a pending sale to Zuffa as "crazy." Coker went on to explain that Strikeforce was searching for "strategic partners" and that there were at least two (some reports say three) potential investors, but that "the UFC is not one of them."&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prophet |first=Zombie |url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2011/3/13/2047456/ufc-strikeforce-acquisition-more-details-emerge |title=More Details Emerge on UFC Acquisition of Strikeforce |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date=2011-03-13 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiappetta |first=Mike |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/03/30/the-anatomy-of-the-zuffa-strikeforce-deal/ |title=The Anatomy of the Zuffa-Strikeforce Deal |publisher=MMA Fighting |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the potential investors has been documented to have been [[ProElite]].&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sports.espn.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh GrossMMAArchive |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/news/story?id=6209923 |title=UFC parent company Zuffa buys rival MMA promoter Strikeforce - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-03-13 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on March 12, 2011, it was announced in an interview of Dana White by journalist [[Ariel Helwani]] that Zuffa had purchased Strikeforce.&lt;ref name="sports.espn.go.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Helwani |first=Ariel |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/03/12/zuffa-purchases-strikeforce/ |title=Zuffa Purchases Strikeforce |publisher=MMA Fighting |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitman |first=Mike |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Zuffa-Purchases-Strikeforce-30800 |title=Zuffa Purchases Strikeforce |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2011-03-12 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/22807/ufc-purchases-strikeforce.mma |title=UFC purchases Strikeforce; UFC boss says organizations to operate independently |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=2011-03-12 |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731021112/http://mmajunkie.com/news/22807/ufc-purchases-strikeforce.mma |archivedate=2012-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/22822/ufc-officially-announces-strikeforce-purchase-fertitta-says-coker-to-run-promotion.mma |title=UFC officially announces Strikeforce purchase, Fertitta says Coker to run promotion |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023144456/http://mmajunkie.com/news/22822/ufc-officially-announces-strikeforce-purchase-fertitta-says-coker-to-run-promotion.mma |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was made between Zuffa and partial Strikeforce owner [[Silicon Valley Sports and Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="sports.espn.go.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/309950/Coker-tried-failed-to-get-control-of-Strikeforce/ |title=Coker tried, failed to get control of Strikeforce - Mixed Martial Arts News |publisher=Mixedmartialarts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of money involved has not been officially disclosed, however, it has been reported that the deal was worth $40 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/309911/Zuffa-reportedly-paid-40-million-for-Strikeforce/ |title=Zuffa reportedly paid $40 million for Strikeforce - Mixed Martial Arts News |publisher=Mixedmartialarts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources have confirmed that Scott Coker attempted to not sell Strikeforce to Zuffa. However, Coker ultimately failed and agreed to sell Strikeforce's licensing rights, fighter contracts, and video library to Zuffa on March 10 or 11.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sports.espn.go.com"/&gt; On March 14, 2011, Zuffa held a conference call to officially announce the acquisition of Strikeforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiappetta |first=Mike |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/03/14/ufc-purchases-strikeforce-conference-call-twitter-updates/ |title=Zuffa Purchases Strikeforce Conference Call Twitter Updates |publisher=MMA Fighting |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prophet |first=Zombie |url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2011/3/14/2049812/ufc-purchases-strikeforce-conference-call-live-updates-dana-white |title=UFC Purchases Strikeforce Conference Call Live Updates |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 2011, Scott Coker stated that he felt that the acquisition would be good for the sport of mixed martial arts. This was in contradiction of his original resistance of selling Strikeforce to Zuffa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sherdog.com |url=http://sherdogblog.craveonline.com/blog/2011-03-28 |title=Sherdog.com MMA Blog: Monday, March 28, 2011 |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008170933/http://sherdogblog.craveonline.com/blog/2011-03-28 |archivedate=October 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Strikeforce was operated as a separate company, similar to that of the WEC, until January 12, 2013, when the final Strikeforce show was held in [[Oklahoma City]]. After which, the promotion was dissolved, and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC.

===United Glory===
When [[United Glory]] was originally formed in 2006, it was known as Ultimate Glory before a lawsuit with Zuffa forced a name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leidecker |first=Tim |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/European-Throwdown-Overeem-Goodridge-in-Works-14278 |title=European Throwdown: Overeem-Goodridge in Works |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invicta Fighting Championships===
In June 2014 the UFC announced that they had signed a multi-year, multi-event broadcast deal to show and archive all [[Invicta FC]] events on [[UFC Fight Pass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-fight-pass-incivta-deal|title=UFC FIGHT PASS signs historic content deal with Invicta FC|work=UFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2014/6/5/5784496/ufc-inks-distribution-deal-of-all-invicta-events-for-fight-pass|title=UFC inks distribution deal of all Invicta events for Fight Pass|author=Dave Meltzer|date=6 June 2014|work=MMA Fighting}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed the UFC to further expand its women's divisions by adding a [[Minimumweight|strawweight]] division in July 2014, and signing Invicta fighters such as [[Carla Esparza]] and [[Felice Herrig]].

===Shooto===
In June 2014 the UFC announced that they had signed a development deal with the recently revived, [[Vale Tudo Japan]]. A brand that was brought back in 2012 by the long running, [[Shooto]] promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-signs-development-deal-with-shooto-in-japan|title=UFC and Japan's VTJ Sign Historic Deal|work=UFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/ufc-signs-developmental-deal-with-shooto-in-japan-062614|title=UFC signs developmental deal with SHOOTO in Japan|author=Fox Sports|work=FOX Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UFC plans on promoting and operating a new tournament series that will focus on [[Bantamweight (MMA)|135]] and [[Featherweight (MMA)|145]] pound divisions. There were plans of a ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]''-like TV show to help promote these tournaments but it is unclear on what the status remains on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fansided.com/2014/06/26/ufc-partners-former-shooto-promotion/|title=UFC partners with former Shooto promotion|work=FanSided}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2014/6/26/5844564/ufc-partners-with-vale-tudo-japan-for-tv-show-and-tournament|title=UFC partners with Vale Tudo Japan for TV show and tournament|author=Dave Meltzer|date=26 June 2014|work=MMA Fighting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship With non-MMA organizations==

===Flash Entertainment===
On January 12, 2010, Zuffa sold a minority interest in the company to Flash Entertainment.  The company announced the completion of a deal in which a 10-percent interest in the company to the [[Abu Dhabi]] government-owned Flash Entertainment.  With the sale, company ownership would be 40.5 percent held by Lorenzo Fertitta, the company’s CEO and chairman, 40.5 percent held by his older brother, Frank Fertitta III, 10 percent by Flash Entertainment and nine percent by Dana White.&lt;ref name="Abu-Dhabi"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!

===Ubisoft===
In December 2010, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against [[video game publisher]] [[Ubisoft]], for what they claimed was a violation of trademark on the game, ''Fighters Uncaged'', packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sieroty|first=Chris|title=UFC sues video game maker, alleging harm to trademark|url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/ufc-sues-video-game-maker-alleging-harm-to-trademark-111715579.html?ref=579|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal|date=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the packaging of the game the trademarked term, "Ultimate Fighting" is shown in all capital letters. Zuffa claimed that the use of the term is identical or confusingly similar to the use of the UFC's trademarks. While Ubisoft failed to provide any comments on the lawsuit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=December 14, 2010 1:03PM PST |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/fightersuncaged/news.html?sid=6285399&amp;om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=newsfeatures&amp;tag=newsfeatures;title;1 |title=UFC parent sues Ubisoft |publisher=GameSpot.com |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; by August 2011, the two companies announced the dissolution of the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitman |first=Mike |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Zuffa-Ubisoft-Settle-Infringement-Suit-35058 |title=Zuffa, Ubisoft Settle Infringement Suit |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lone Survivor Foundation===
In May 2011, it was announced that Zuffa would be holding a charity auction featuring more than 100 items to benefit the [[Lone Survivor Foundation]] during the last week of May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/23684/ufc-offers-more-than-100-items-for-charity-auction-to-benefit-lone-survivor-foundation.mma |title=UFC offers more than 100 items for charity auction to benefit Lone Survivor Foundation |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=2011-05-21 |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023191546/http://mmajunkie.com/news/23684/ufc-offers-more-than-100-items-for-charity-auction-to-benefit-lone-survivor-foundation.mma |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All products were autographed by UFC fighters and included [[baseball cap]]s, [[T-shirt]]s, [[MMA gloves]], and [[DVD]]s. Products generally ranged in price from $50 to a few thousand dollars.

===Cleveland Clinic brain trauma study===
In February 2014, Zuffa was one of a number of major combat sport promotions to support a major brain trauma study that was being conducted by the [[Cleveland Clinic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cagepages.com/2014/02/07/ufc-help-cleveland-clinics-study-brain-study/|title=UFC to help Cleveland Clinic's Study on Brain Trauma|work=Cage Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/317079-do-not-run-until-tuesday-brain-health-supported-by-richard-schaefer-todd-duboef-bernard-hopkins|title=Study unites Golden Boy, Top Rank, MMA, U.S. Senators|author=Lem Satterfield|date=4 February 2014|work=Ring TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2014/1/27/5351822/mma-and-boxing-luminaries-combine-efforts-help-cleveland-clinic-brain|title=MMA and boxing luminaries combine efforts to help Cleveland Clinic brain health study|author=Luke Thomas|date=27 January 2014|work=MMA Fighting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/ufc/story/ufc-teams-up-with-senators-mccain-reid-to-support-brain-health-study-at-the-cleveland-clinic-020114|title=MMA and boxing execs, Senators McCain and Reid team up to support brain health study|author=Fox Sports|work=FOX Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/feb/05/study-head-injuries-boxing/|title=Boxing and MMA officials join Reid and McCain to tout study of fighters' brain health|author=Karoun Demirjian|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/ufc/story/mma-boxing-rivals-unify-to-support-head-trauma-research-we-owe-it-to-these-athletes-020414|title=MMA, boxing rivals unify to support head trauma research: 'We owe it to these athletes'|author=Fox Sports|work=FOX Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/02/boxers_and_politicians_stop_fi.html|title=Boxers and politicians stop fighting to support Cleveland Clinic brain injury study (video)|work=cleveland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/10402924/boxing-mma-representatives-meet-head-research|title=Boxing, MMA representatives meet about head research|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/boxing-mma-organizations-promise-funding-brain-study-las-vegas|title=Boxing, MMA organizations promise funding for brain study in Las Vegas|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/4/boxing-mma-groups-back-brain-trauma-study/|title=Boxing, MMA groups back brain trauma study|work=The Washingtion Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was further followed up in February 2016, when Zuffa donated a million dollars to the [[Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health|Ruvo Center]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/ufc-donates-1m-ruvo-center-brain-trauma-study-video&lt;/ref&gt;

==MMA regulations==
The current rules used in the UFC were first established by the [[New Jersey Athletic Control Board]] in 2000, in consultation with the UFC and other MMA promotions in the United States.&lt;ref name="state.nj.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |title=NJ State Athletic Control Board - Proposed Rules - Rules Governing Boxing, Extreme Wrestling and Sparring Exhibitions and Performance Bond Procedure |publisher=State.nj.us |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |archivedate=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first UFC event under the new rules was [[UFC 28]], held before Zuffa's takeover. New Jersey's ''Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts'' has since been established throughout the country by other state athletic commissions, including Nevada and California.&lt;ref name="state.nj.us"/&gt; The UFC has, however, kept close ties with state commissions, especially the [[Nevada Athletic Commission|Nevada State Athletic Commission]], of which Lorenzo Fertitta is a former board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=LearnUFC.FactSheet |title=The Official Website of the Ultimate Fighting Championship® |publisher=UFC |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627235500/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=learnufc.factsheet |archivedate=2010-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug policy efforts==
During the early years of [[mixed martial arts]], when [[Pride Fighting Championships]] along with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] were early premierships of the sport, it has been documented that there was a noteworthy lack of rules and regulations regarding drug testing for [[Performance-enhancing drugs|PED's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/7/20/5920195/enson-inoue-pride-contract-shows-no-steroid-testing-mma-news|title=Enson Inoue’s PRIDE FC contract highlights lack of steroid testing|author=Kyle McLachlan|date=20 July 2014|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjpenn.com/pride-contract-stated-fighters-could-use-steroids/|title=PRIDE Contract Stated Fighters Could Use Steroids|work=- BJPenn.com UFC Fight News &amp; Videos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifighting.com/2013/09/02/10716/steroids-in-pride-a-retrospective/|title=Steroids In Pride: A Retrospective|author=Adam Brennan|date=2 September 2013|work=SciFighting}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a widespread debate and discussion regarding how prevalent the use of steroids were in the sport, as well as a long list of competitors in the UFC and other major organizations facing failed drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagepotato.com/mma-steroid-busts-definitive-timeline/|title=MMA Steroid Busts: The Definitive Timeline [UPDATED With Testosterone Busts]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was further highlighted by continued problems with UFC champions, including [[Jon Jones]] and [[Anderson Silva]], failing drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/12197656/jon-jones-ufc-no-room-cocaine-addict|title=Jon Jones of UFC -- 'No room to be cocaine addict'|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/12338927/anderson-silva-fails-second-drug-test|title=Anderson Silva fails second drug test|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; So in February 2015, Zuffa announced a more aggressive year round, random-testing approach for its competitors to begin in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-officials-unveil-plans-for-more-robust-drug-testing-of-athletes|title=UFC Officials Unveil Plans For More Robust Drug Testing Of Athletes|work=UFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/12343412/ufc-drug-test-fighters-year-round-part-new-anti-doping-plan|title=UFC to drug test fighters year-round as part of new anti-doping plan|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/2/17/8045981/ufcs-decisions-regarding-peds-will-change-direction-of-the-sport|title=UFC's decisions regarding PEDs will change direction of the sport|author=Dave Meltzer|date=18 February 2015|work=MMA Fighting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-piracy efforts==
Zuffa has been one of the largest and most aggressive spenders among anti-piracy political [[Lobbying|lobbyists]] in the United States since the end of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/mma/post/2012-05-18/ufc-among-sports-big-spenders-with-dc-lobbyists/697054/1 | work=USA Today | title=Updated monthly | date=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thing in particular that sets them apart from other sports leagues is that, in addition to supporting efforts of stricter piracy laws, they have also on numerous occasions gone after selected individuals in addition to pirate hosting websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://combatsportslaw.com/2014/03/10/zuffa-v-piracy-expensive-lessons-in-summarydefault-judgements/|title=Zuffa v.

Zuffa has always maintained the stance that the large amounts of illegal streams of their events causes massive financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjpenn.com/ufc-confirms-theyre-losing-millions-from-piracy/|title=UFC Confirms They're Losing Millions From Piracy - BJPenn.com UFC Fight News &amp; Videos|work=- BJPenn.com UFC Fight News &amp; Videos|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225044638/http://www.bjpenn.com/ufc-confirms-theyre-losing-millions-from-piracy/|archivedate=2014-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to having such a stringent stance it has been extremely controversial and has caused a number of debates within the mixed martial arts community on its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120320/10225718173/ufc-makes-awful-decision-to-sue-some-its-biggest-fans.shtml|title=UFC Makes The Awful Decision To Sue Some Of Its Biggest Fans|work=Techdirt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the UFC began experimenting on an online subscription model known as UFC Fight Pass in 2014. It is unclear how beneficial the service has been since its emphasis has been largely minimal next to UFC's partnership with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and noticeable decline in average PPV buyrates, highlighted by the [[Standard &amp; Poor's|S&amp;P]] downgrading Zuffa's credit rating in late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/10/12/6965831/standard-poors-downgrades-zuffa-credit-rating-after-rough-2014|title=Standard &amp; Poors downgrades Zuffa credit rating after rough 2014|author=Zane Simon|date=12 October 2014|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2011 it was announced that Zuffa would be providing year-round customized insurance coverage for any injury suffered by a [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] or Strikeforce athlete.&lt;ref name="mmafighting.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiappetta |first=Mike |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/05/09/ufc-executives-detail-new-insurance-plan-fighters-managers-rea/ |title=UFC Execs, Fighters and Managers Discuss New Insurance Plan |publisher=MMA Fighting |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Non|first=Sergio|title=UFC broadens health coverage for fighters|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/mma/post/2011/05/ufc-broadens-health-coverage-for-fighters/1|accessdate=30 September 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/details-about-zuffas-new-fighter-insurance-and-coverage-for |title=Details About Zuffa’s New Fighter Insurance and Coverage for UFC and Strikeforce |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |date=2011-05-09 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mmamania.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Con |first=Genghis |url=http://www.mmamania.com/2011/5/9/2162589/hurts-so-good-new-details-emerge-about-the-ufc-health-insurance-plan |title=Hurts so good: New details emerge about the UFC health insurance plan |publisher=MMAmania.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="themmatruth.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cordero |first=Angel R. |url=http://themmatruth.com/articles/ufc-announces-unprecedented-accident-insurance-coverage-for-its-athletes |title=UFC Announces Unprecedented Accident Insurance Coverage for Its Athletes |publisher=Themmatruth.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808233814/http://themmatruth.com/articles/ufc-announces-unprecedented-accident-insurance-coverage-for-its-athletes |archivedate=2012-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Helwani|first=Ariel|title=Zuffa to offer accident insurance to all 350 contracted fighters|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/42964079/ns/sports-mma/|accessdate=30 September 2011|newspaper=NBC Sports|date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sherdog.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Zuffa-Expands-Fighter-Insurance-to-Cover-Training-Injuries-32204 |title=Zuffa Expands Fighter Insurance to Cover Training Injuries |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2011-05-09 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy covers any injuries that occur during competition, training, and non-training related accidents. The policy was underwritten by Houston-based specialty insurance group [[HCC Insurance Holdings]] and went into effect on June 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="sherdog.com" /&gt;

The details of the policy include:
* Coverage for all athletes signed by the UFC or Strikeforce.
* Coverage for athletes residing both within and outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="mmafighting.com"/&gt;
* Zuffa paying for all premiums for the policy, with athletes not required to pay anything.
* Allowing athletes to use up to $50,000 in annual coverage for any injuries that occur while under contract to Zuffa. This includes services such as, doctor services, laboratory tests, emergency medical evacuation, and physical therapy.
* Coverage for athletes regardless of if they are scheduled to compete.
* Life and dental insurance at no cost to the athletes.&lt;ref name="mmafighting.com"/&gt;
* No coverage for minor illnesses, but training-related illnesses like [[staph infections]] are covered.&lt;ref name="mmamania.com"/&gt;

An insurance policy is not a first for mixed martial arts or [[combat sports]] as a whole. Former promotions such as the [[International Fight League]], offered insurance to its athletes. However Zuffa's policy is the first to cover a large group of combat sport athletes.&lt;ref name="themmatruth.com"/&gt; According to UFC president [[Dana White]], the policy was a goal of the company since Zuffa first purchased the UFC in 2001. In addition UFC chairman and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Lorenzo Fertitta]] stated that the policy took three years to establish while trying to find possible insurers.&lt;ref name="mmafighting.com" /&gt; Prior to the introduction of this policy, Zuffa provided up to $100,000 for an athlete on each event to cover injuries sustained during competition. However, if an athlete was injured outside of competition they would have to pay for their own medical expenses.&lt;ref name="sherdog.com" /&gt;

Notable incidents where UFC athletes were injured outside of competition include,
* [[Frank Mir]], who was struck by a car while riding his motorcycle in 2004, and forced out of competition for over 20 months.
* [[Brock Lesnar]], who was forced out of action for several months while struggling with [[diverticulitis]].

==Monopoly accusations==
The Ultimate Fighting Championship has been accused of monopolistic business practices both in casual criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdreactor.com/2011/03/12/its-official-ufc-is-a-monopoly/|title=It’s Official, UFC Is a Monopoly|work=Nerd Reactor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1122107-ufc-opinion-how-having-a-monopoly-can-hurt-mma|title=UFC|author=Montique David|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themmacorner.com/2014/01/24/industry-dominance-the-ufc-and-its-monopoly-in-the-mma-market/|title=Industry Dominance: UFC And Its ‘Monopoly’ In The MMA Market|author=Greg Byron|work=The MMA Corner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/6/30/5846330/ufc-monopoly-panel-discussion-paul-gift-david-dudley|title=Panel discussion: Is the UFC a Monopoly?|author=John S. Nash|date=30 June 2014|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in formal lawsuits for a number of years. There are numerous fighters who have accused the company of various wrongdoing's regarding issues including unequal pay, predatory actions toward rival promotions, lack of a [[pension]] or [[Trade union|union]] safety net, and other perceived unethical business practices. These perceptions have been most highlighted by a [[Federal Trade Commission]] investigation that took place between 2011 and 2012. As well as in a series of class action lawsuits filed against the company in late 2014 and early 2015.

===Federal Trade Commission investigation===
In the months following the March 2011 acquisition of rival promotion Strikeforce, rumours began to circulate that a possible investigation by the FTC would take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxinginsider.com/columns/mma-rumors-surge-regarding-an-ftc-investigation-of-zuffaufc/|title=MMA: Rumors Surge Regarding an FTC Investigation of Zuffa/UFC - BoxingInsider.com|work=BoxingInsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumours later came to be true when it was officially announced around the end of January 2012 that the FTC had in fact conducted an investigation, and found no wrongdoings regarding the UFC being a monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/FTC-Closes-Investigation-of-UFC-Parent-Company-Zuffa-39817|title=FTC Closes Investigation of UFC Parent Company Zuffa|work=Sherdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/7525483/ftc-closes-probe-ufc-strikeforce-purchase-take-further-action|title=FTC closes probe of UFC's Strikeforce purchase, won't take further action|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/381842/FTC-closes-monopoly-investigation-of-UFC|title=FTC closes monopoly investigation of UFC|date=1 February 2012|work=The Underground}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class action lawsuits===
'''2014'''

On December 16, 2014 a class action lawsuit was filed against Zuffa by fighters [[Cung Le]], [[Jon Fitch]] and [[Nate Quarry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/ClassAction-Lawsuit-Filed-Against-UFC-by-Cung-Le-Jon-Fitch-Nate-Quarry-78853|title=Class-Action Lawsuit Filed Against UFC by Cung Le, Jon Fitch, Nate Quarry|work=Sherdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/12/18/ufc-fighters-file-class-action-lawsuit-accusing-mixed-martial-arts-promotion-of-violating-anti-trust-laws/ | work=The Washington Post | first=Marissa | last=Payne | title=UFC fighters file class-action lawsuit accusing mixed martial arts promotion of violating anti-trust laws | date=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few days, [[Javier Vazquez (fighter)|Javier Vazquez]] and [[Dennis Hallman]] filed a second class action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/dennis-hallman-javier-vasquez-join-class-action-lawsuit-against-ufc|title=Dennis Hallman, Javier Vasquez join class-action lawsuit against UFC|work=MMAjunkie}}&lt;/ref&gt; And on December 24, [[Brandon Vera]] and [[Pablo Garza (fighter)|Pablo Garza]] filed a third lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/12/24/7448055/brandon-vera-and-pablo-garza-file-third-class-action-suit-on|title=Brandon Vera and Pablo Garza File Third Class Action Suit on Christmas Eve|author=John S. Nash|date=24 December 2014|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the initial news spreading, Zuffa quickly responded following the first class action with the statement that, "The UFC will vigorously defend itself and its business practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-promises-to-vigorously-defend-itself-against-class-action-suit|title=UFC promises to ‘vigorously’ defend itself against class-action suit - MMAjunkie|work=MMAjunkie}}&lt;/ref&gt; This soon led other promoters such as [[Scott Coker]], President of [[Bellator MMA]], expressing an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit, while rejecting his organization as being labeled a "minor league" as was done several times in the initial filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/12/26/7450619/ufc-bellator-scott-coker-interested-outcome-ufc-lawsuit-bellator-not-minor-league-mma-news|title=Scott Coker interested in outcome of UFC class-action lawsuit, says Bellator is not a ‘minor league’|author=Karim Zidan|date=26 December 2014|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of December 2014, the UFC made a formal statement stating, "We are proud of the company we have built, confident in our legal position, and intend to prevail in this lawsuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-statement-2|title=UFC Statement|work=UFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015'''

On February 7, 2015, a fourth lawsuit was filed against the UFC, this one by [[Mac Danzig]] and [[Gabe Ruediger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightofthenight.com/news/mac-danzig-and-gabe-ruediger-file-lawsuit-against-zuffa|title=Mac Danzig And Gabe Ruediger File Lawsuit Against Zuffa|author=Jason Henderson|date=7 February 2015|work=Fight of the Night}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymmanews.com/lawsuits-piling-zuffa-additional-former-ufc-fighters/|title=Lawsuits piling up on ZUFFA, additional fighters sue|work=My MMA News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this time that Zuffa motioned to move the hearing date from May 7 to March 26, as well as to move the venue from Northern California to Las Vegas, where they are headquartered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/2/3/7968899/ufc-lawsuit-details-full-documents-on-zuffas-motion-to-transfer/in/7162628|title=UFC Lawsuit: Details and full documents on Zuffa's Motion to transfer venue, and advance hearing date|author=Anton Tabuena|date=3 February 2015|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Zuffa motioned to have the lawsuits dismissed, in four separate documents they claim, "The Complaints' vague and conclusory allegations fall far short of the Supreme Court's requirements in [[Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly]], for pleading specific facts showing a plausible antitrust claim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/2/28/8125455/mma-ufc-zuffa-motion-to-dismiss-antitrust-lawsuit-fighters|title=UFC files motion to dismiss fighter antitrust lawsuit|author=Paul Gift|date=28 February 2015|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, a fifth lawsuit was added by [[Kyle Kingsbury]] and [[Darren Uyenoyama]] on March 20, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/3/21/8268695/ufc-lawsuit-two-more-fighters-file-antitrust-complaint-against-zuffa|title=UFC Lawsuit: Two more fighters file antitrust complaint against Zuffa|author=John S.

Nash|date=12 April 2015|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the May 7 hearing regarding the motion to change venue, a Californian federal judge granted Zuffa the motion to change venue to Las Vegas after citing contract agreements from the former employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/6/3/8717945/ufc-class-action-antitrust-lawsuit-motion-transfer-venue-nevada-mma-news|title=Judge grants UFC's motion to transfer antitrust case to Nevada|author=Paul Gift|date=3 June 2015|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the change of venue to Nevada, Zuffa was denied its motion to remain a [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] for 15 years of its financial records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/5/14/8604095/ufc-fighter-monopoloy-lawsuit-zuffa-files-motion-to-stay-discovery-of-15-years/in/7162628|title=Zuffa files motion to stay discovery of '15 years of Zuffa's financial statements'|author=John S.

Nash|date=29 July 2015|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, following this denial, debate a began on who, what, and how UFC sensitive information should be viewed, especially by MMAFA founder, [http://mmafa.tv/ Rob Maysey].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/8/28/9221583/ufc-antitrust-lawsuit-discovery-confidential-information-zuffa-vs-maysey-mmafa-mma-legal-news/in/7162628&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sides have argued for different criteria, so as not to put them at an disadvantage. However, Zuffa has requested a two-tiered system of confidentiality: confidential and highly confidential. They have stated they feel that Maysey's access to highly confidential information could have an influential impact on him and his role in the MMAFA. Meanwhile, Maysey has openly stated his goal is to represent the fighters and ultimately try to get a reform similar to the [[Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act|Ali Act]] of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3CiNZN7rd4&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving forward to September 25, 2015, due to the gradual nature and complications regarding the lawsuit; Zuffa requested another dismissal of the case and asked that it be thrown out of Las Vegas federal court. In a surprise bench ruling, this was ultimately denied, which promoted the UFC to release a formal response.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/9/25/9363209/ufc-loses-motion-to-dismiss-antitrust-lawsuit-mma-news/in/7162628&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/13741330/court-denies-ufc-motion-dismiss-antitrust-lawsuit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ufc.com/news/UFC-Statement-on-Antitrust-Hearing-in-Las-Vegas&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, magistrate judge Peggy Leen ruled that the UFC could not prevent plaintiffs attorney Rob Maysey from viewing its most highly confidential and sensitive business and financial information. This has officially caused an expert discovery that is estimated to last from 12–16 months (September 2016 to January 2017).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/10/1/9430995/ufc-loses-two-motions-discovery-antitrust-lawsuit-mma-news/in/7162628&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, both parties will have to hand over various highly confidential and sensitive documents.

The goal of the expert discovery is to determine three key factors for antitrust liability to all hold true: (1) Does the UFC have monopoly power? (2) Did the UFC acquire or maintain such power through exclusionary conduct? (3) Did the UFC cause antitrust injury since having a monopoly is not always illegal in the United States? This is expected to involve a wide range of important figures (past and present) in both mixed martial arts and boxing, including most top ranked [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] staff, [[Scott Coker]], [[Bjorn Rebney]], [[Ray Sefo]], [[Frank Shamrock]], [[Fedor Emelianenko]], [[Randy Couture]], [[Ben Askren]], [[Mark Cuban]], [[Oscar De La Hoya]], [[Bob Arum]], [[Lou DiBella]], [[Ken Hershman]], [[Bob Meyrowitz]], and even various [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE FC]] executives. Following this ruling through the end of 2015, both sides have provided well over 100,000 documents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/11/17/9748132/ufc-lawsuit-update-plaintiffs-argue-discovery-108000-documents-produced-mma-news/in/7162628&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2016'''

Starting in January, the UFC defense team filed its official answer, denying the fighters’ antitrust claims. In an amended complaint, which contained nearly identical legal and economic substance to the original version from December 2014. The only major difference being the number of plaintiff fighters has declined from eleven to six.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2016/1/20/10796946/antitrust-lawsuit-ufc-files-answer-denying-fighter-claims-mma-news/in/7162628&lt;/ref&gt; Pablo Garza, Gabe Ruediger, Darren Uyenoyama, Dennis Hallman, and Mac Danzig all dropped out of the lawsuit while the original three plaintiffs, Cung Le, Nate Quarry, and Jon Fitch, remain along with Brandon Vera, Javier Vazquez, and Kyle Kingsbury. In addition, Zuffa has stood by its point of protecting its brand. And in the latest update, the UFC has inadvertently produced PRIDE FC acquisition materials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2016/4/3/11354336/ufc-inadvertently-produced-pride-email-antitrust-lawsuit-mma-news/in/7162628&lt;/ref&gt; This has triggered a new debate on whether the material is of value in the lawsuit or can be used as a privileged document.

==Sale to WME-IMG==
Around May 11, 2016, [[ESPN|ESPN's]] Darren Rovell reported that [[Goldman Sachs]] was helping Zuffa set up a sale of its majority ownership to one of four bidders at a speculated price range between $3.5 billion to $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/15503004/ufc-owners-advanced-talks-sell-promotion&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after Rovell reported this, UFC President [[Dana White]] went on ''[[The Dan Patrick Show]]'' and denied that the UFC was up for sale, claiming that Zuffa was more focused on "working on deals and our expansion globally" than selling the promotion. However, White would further add that Zuffa would be listening to offers if they met the reported $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmafighting.com/2016/5/11/11657066/dana-white-denies-ufc-for-sale-says-were-working-on-growing-the&lt;/ref&gt; Despite White's denial of a potential sale, Dave Meltzer of [[SB Nation|SB Nation's]] mmafighting.com reported a month later that the sale of the UFC was imminent, as Zuffa received two bids within the range of $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion from both [[WME-IMG]] and [[China Media Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmafighting.com/2016/6/16/11957074/ufc-sale-reportedly-imminent-with-two-bids-in-4-1-billion-range&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, on July 11, after months of speculation, the UFC released a statement confirming that Zuffa had sold its majority stake to an ownership group headed by [[WME-IMG]] for $4.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ufc.com/news/WME-IMG-TO-ACQUIRE-UFC&lt;/ref&gt;  ESPN's Darren Rovell and Brett Okamoto would go on further to report that, despite the sale to WME-IMG, Dana White would be staying on with the UFC as President and would "be given a stake in the new business."  They would also add that the Abu Dhabi-based Flash Entertainment would still maintain its 10 percent stake in the company.&lt;ref name="espn.go.com"/&gt;

==Potential Expansion Into Boxing==

Following the sale of their majority stake in the UFC to [[William Morris Endeavor|WME-IMG]], in addition to the success of [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor|Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s bout against Conor McGregor]] in 2016 and 2017. UFC President Dana White has teased the idea of Zuffa potentially becoming involved in the sport of [[boxing]]. It's still unclear what the future of this business endeavor is exactly. Though rumors have speculated that Dana White, [[Ari Emanuel]], and others from the UFC have tried to form business partnerships with boxers such as [[Mikey Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mmamania.com/2018/5/5/17321052/report-zuffa-boxing-close-to-signing-undefeated-wbc-lightweight-champion-mikey-garcia-ufc&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anthony Joshua]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbrennan/2018/03/30/zuffa-boxings-attempts-to-lure-joshua-threatens-al-haymons-supremacy/#73ef85a94260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sportsnet.ca/mma/ufc-willing-offer-boxing-champ-anthony-joshua-500-million-deal/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mmaweekly.com/dana-white-interested-in-mikey-garcia-for-zuffa-boxing-addresses-anthony-joshua-rumors&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to formulating plans around the long running rumors of [[Anderson Silva]] who has long expressed an interest in fighting [[Roy Jones Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NviFGnQRzo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/1/24/16927184/ufc-mma-boxing-news-interview-roy-jones-jr-anderson-silva-dana-white-boxing&lt;/ref&gt;. Though this fight in particular is questionable given that both athletes are in the later stages of there careers. Though the UFC did help air Roy Jones Jr.'s "retirement" bout on their [[UFC Fight Pass]] streaming service in early 2018. Another sign that Zuffa has interested in expanding into the sport of boxing to some degree.

It has also been thought that UFC is interested in co-promoting boxing matches into their events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/ufc-president-dana-white-on-his-move-into-boxing/&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally in mid-2018 Dana White, still claiming efforts are being made to expand promotional efforts into boxing. Has stated that he and others aren't interesting in working with any of major boxing sanctioning bodies causing even more speculation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fightsports.tv/white-claims-zuffa-boxing-wont-work-with-sanctioning-bodies/&lt;/ref&gt; This is all in contrast to Dana White's long time disgust with the business of boxing and many of the major promotional figures. Making some to question if this is related to underwhelming business expectations for the UFC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/instead-of-killing-boxing-the-ufc-plans-to-use-it-as-a-lifeline&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rumors that have floated around since the change of ownership of the UFC, consist of [[Bob Arum]] claiming members of the UFC expressing an interest in purchasing either [[Top Rank|Top Rank Promotions]] or at least its video library for $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boxinginsider.com/columns/will-dana-white-ufc-next-big-players-zuffa-boxing/&lt;/ref&gt;
