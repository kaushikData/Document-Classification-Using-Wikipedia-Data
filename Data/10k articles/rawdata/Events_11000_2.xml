The '''2008 submarine cable disruptions''' were three separate incidents of major damage to submarine optical communication cables around the world. The first incident caused damage involving up to five high-speed [[Internet]] [[submarine communications cable]]s in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Middle East]] from 23 January to 4 February 2008, causing internet disruptions and slowdowns for users in the Middle East and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Khaleej_Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cable damage hits one million Internet Users |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&amp;xfile=data/theuae/2008/february/theuae_february121.xml |work=Khaleej News |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209140523/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&amp;xfile=data%2Ftheuae%2F2008%2Ffebruary%2Ftheuae_february121.xml |archivedate=9 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident called into doubt the safety of the undersea portion of the Internet cable system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/04/technology/cables.php |title=Ruptures call safety of Internet cables into question |work=International Herald Tribune |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=5 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206083645/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/04/technology/cables.php |archivedate=6 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February there was another outage, this time affecting a fiber optic connection between [[Singapore]] and [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thejakartapost.com/news/2008/02/29/internet-capacity-down-10.html |title=Internet capacity down to 10% |work=The Jakarta Post |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=1 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303185053/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/02/29/internet-capacity-down-10.html |archivedate=3 March 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cables damaged==

===23 January===
Although it was not reported at the time, there was a cut off of [[FALCON (cable system)|FALCON]] on 23 January.&lt;ref name="Khaleej_Times"/&gt; The FALCON cable system connects several countries in the [[Persian Gulf]] and India.

===30 January===
On 30 January 2008, news agencies reported Internet services were widely disrupted in the Middle East and in the [[Indian subcontinent]] following damage to the [[SEA-ME-WE 4]] and FLAG Telecom cables in the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name="Khaleej_Times" /&gt;  The damage to the two systems occurred separately several kilometers apart near [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Repairs begin on Middle East Web cable |work=[[The Associated Press]] |accessdate=2008-02-18 |date=2008-02-05 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/02/05/egypt.internet.ap/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209142307/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/02/05/egypt.internet.ap/index.html |archivedate=2008-02-09 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the respective contributions of the two cable systems to this [[Internet blackout|blackout]] is unclear, network outage graphs show anomalies at 0430 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] and again at 0800 UTC.&lt;ref name="Renesys"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2008/01/mediterranean_cable_break_1.shtml#more | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203133228/http://www.renesys.com/blog/2008/01/mediterranean_cable_break_1.shtml#more | archivedate=2008-02-03 | title=Mediterranean Cable Break | accessdate=2008-01-31 | last=Zmijewski | first=Earl | date=2008-01-30 | work=Renesys Blog | publisher=Renesys}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the damage to SEA-ME-WE 4 or FLAG has not been declared by either cable operator.&lt;ref name="khaleejnoships"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ships did not cause Internet cable damage |work=Khaleej Times Online |accessdate=2008-02-03 |date=2008-02-03 |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/theworld/2008/February/theworld_February77.xml&amp;section=theworld&amp;col |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206083906/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data%2Ftheworld%2F2008%2FFebruary%2Ftheworld_February77.xml&amp;section=theworld&amp;col |archivedate=6 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of sources speculated these were caused by a dragging ship [[anchor]] near Alexandria. The Egyptian Maritime Transport Ministry reviewed one day of complete video footage beginning 12 hours before and through 12 hours after the service disruption, concluding the cause of damage was not surface craft as no ships were traced sailing through the area of the alleged wire damage.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite news| title=Cable damage hits Internet connectivity | publisher=[[The Times of India]] | accessdate=2008-01-31 | date=2008-01-31 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cable_damage_hits_Internet_connectivity/articleshow/2745082.cms }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/02/04/2153455.htm |title=Ships did not cut internet cables: Egypt |date=2008-02-04 |work=ABC News |accessdate=5 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206081424/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/02/04/2153455.htm |archivedate=6 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_News" /&gt; The Kuwaitis also do not directly charge seafaring vessels, instead referring to "weather conditions and maritime traffic."&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news|author=Agence France Press |title=Indian outsourcing sector hit by Internet disruption |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gadarOY4frbM-XSyXS0_wMfxpHig |publisher=[[Google News]] |date=2008-01-31 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203184552/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gadarOY4frbM-XSyXS0_wMfxpHig |archivedate=3 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[The Economist]] reported that an earthquake may have caused the cable to fault.

====Effects====
Disruptions of 70 percent in [[Egypt]] and 60 percent in [[India]] were reported, along with problems in [[Afghanistan-AWCC]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Kuwait]], [[Maldives]], [[Pakistan]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name="BBC_News"&gt;{{cite news | title=Severed cables disrupt Internet | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7218008.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | date=2008-01-31 | accessdate=2008-01-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131231934/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7218008.stm| archivedate= 31 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cable Break Causes Wide Internet Outage | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/technology/AP-Internet-Outages.html | date=2008-02-01 | author=Associated Press | author-link=Associated Press | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Broken Submarine Cable Affects Raajje Online And Wataniya |url=http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4103 |date=2008-02-04 |author=Minivannews.com |work=Minivannews.com |accessdate=2008-02-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205042500/http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4103 |archivedate=2008-02-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1.7 million Internet users in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] were affected by the Internet disruption. Mahesh Jaishanker, an executive director for [[Du (telco)|Du]], said, “The submarine cable cuts in FLAG Europe-Asia cable 8.3&amp;nbsp;km away from Alexandria, Egypt and [[SEA-ME-WE 4]] affected at least 60 million users in India, 12 million in Pakistan, six million in Egypt and 4.7 million in Saudi Arabia.”&lt;ref name="Khaleej_Times" /&gt; A router for a university in [[Tehran]] was not responding, causing some reports of a total loss of connectivity for [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=15a_1201978059 |title=Third Internet Cable cut&amp;nbsp;— Tehran 100% Outage |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=5 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209163116/http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=15a_1201978059 |archivedate=9 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internettrafficreport.com/asia.htm|title=Details for Asia /// Internet Traffic Report|accessdate=2008-02-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080208094725/http://www.internettrafficreport.com/asia.htm| archivedate= 8 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Iranian [[embassy]] in [[Abu Dhabi]] reported that "everything was fine."&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Bowman.[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/510232-flag-plays-down-net-blackout-conspiracy-theories?ln=en Flag plays down net blackout conspiracy theories], ArabianBusiness.com, 4 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="albawaba" /&gt; Additional reports and analysis showed that while Iran was affected, it "fared much better" than many other countries in the same geographic area.&lt;ref name="disconnected1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2008/02/attention_iran_is_not_disconne_1.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207031404/http://www.renesys.com/blog/2008/02/attention_iran_is_not_disconne_1.shtml |archivedate=2008-02-07|title=ATTENTION: Iran is not disconnected!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mediterranean1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/IEPM/Effects+of+Fibre+Outage+through+Mediterranean|title=Effects of Fibre Outage through Mediterranean| accessdate= 9 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2008, [[Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited|VSNL]], a leading communications solutions provider in [[India]], confirmed that the company restored a majority of its [[Internet Protocol|IP]] connectivity into the [[MENA]] region within 24 hours of the [[Egypt]] cable breakdown. Services were largely restored within 24 hours of the cable cut by diverting traffic through the TIC and [[SEA-ME-WE 3]] cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fibresystems.org/cws/article/yournews/32739 |title=VNSL restores services after cable break |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=7 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209125550/http://fibresystems.org/cws/article/yournews/32739 |archivedate=9 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1 February===
Two days after the initial break, it was reported that the FALCON cable was cut between [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Oman]] and [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]].&lt;ref name="Khaleej_Times"/&gt; This cut was between different landing points than the 23 January cut, FLAG Telecom issued a press release later, stating the "'''[[FALCON (cable system)|FALCON cable]]''' is reported cut at 0559 hrs [[GMT]] on 1 February 2008.

===3 February===
On 3 February 2008, [[Qtel]] reported that a cable called '''[[DOHA-HALOUL]]''' connecting [[Qatar]] to the United Arab Emirates had been damaged, causing disruptions in already damaged Middle Eastern communication networks. It became the fourth cable to be damaged in 5 days.&lt;ref name="khaleejnoships" /&gt; The location of the break was between the [[Qatari]] island of [[Halul Island|Haloul]] and the UAE island of [[Das (island)|Das]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/510132-internet-problems-continue-with-fourth-cable-break?ln=en |title=Internet problems continue with fourth cable break |date=2008-02-03 |accessdate=5 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211183123/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/510132-internet-problems-continue-with-fourth-cable-break?ln=en |archivedate=11 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was said to be related to the power system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mathaba.net/news/?x=580660|title=4th Undersea Cable Break: Between Qatar and UAE| date=2008-02-04| accessdate= 5 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4 February===
On 4 February 2008 the ''[[Khaleej Times]]'' reported that [[SEA-ME-WE 4]] had also been damaged at another location, near [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. The date of this damage was not given.&lt;ref name="Khaleej_Times" /&gt;

===19 December===
On 19 December 2008 [[France Telecom]] issued a press release stating that the FLAG Telecom, [[SEA-ME-WE 4]], and [[SEA-ME-WE 3]] cables, linking [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], [[Sicily]], and [[Malta]], had been cut by either bad weather conditions or a ship's [[anchor]], resulting in substantial slowdowns in communication traffic, with [[Egypt]] experiencing an overall 80% reduction in [[Internet]] capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Three undersea cables cut: traffic greatly disturbed between Europe and Asia/Near East zone |date= 19 December 2008 |work= Press release |publisher= France Telecom |url= http://www.orange.com/en_EN/press/press_releases/cp081219en.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221171256/http://www.orange.com/en_EN/press/press_releases/cp081219en.html |archivedate= 21 December 2008 |accessdate= 5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSTRE4BJ0FV20081220|title=UPDATE&lt;!--SIC--&gt; 3-Undersea cable breaks cut Internet in Mideast, Asia|author=James Regan|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-12-20|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; France Telecom expects SEA-ME-WE 4 will be repaired first, then SEA-ME-WE 3, then FLAG, and that repairs should be concluded by 31 December. The break disrupted 75% of communication between the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]] and the rest of the world. The breaks caused companies including [[Vodafone]], [[Verizon Communications]], [[Portugal Telecom]], [[GO (Malta)|GO]] and [[France Telecom]] to experience disruption in their systems and forced them to reroute communications through different means. Others, such as [[AT&amp;T]], also received reports of service disruption.&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt; The rerouting of these communications caused large slowdowns in some areas. [[Interoute]] director Jonathan Wright stated that "You can reroute the data through other cables, but that increases traffic and can potentially create bottlenecks, so Internet connections may slow down and some phone calls could get disrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=ayPbWf_7l17w&amp;refer=europe|title=Severed Cables in Mediterranean Disrupt Communication|author=Fried, Malcolm|author2=Lars Klemming|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=[[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]]|date=2008-12-19|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GO-1]] cable connecting Malta and Sicily was also cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20081219/local/go-submarine-cable-fault-part-of-wider-number-between-italy-and-egypt|title=GO submarine cable fault part of wider disruption between Italy and Egypt|publisher=[[The Times (Malta)|Times of Malta]]|date=2008-12-19|accessdate=2008-12-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081225171226/http://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20081219/local/go-submarine-cable-fault-part-of-wider-number-between-italy-and-egypt| archivedate= 25 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telecom_Paper"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mediterrean submarine cables are cut, affecting internet |work= Telecom Paper |url= http://www.telecompaper.com/news/article.aspx?cid=650982|date=19 December 2008 |accessdate= 20 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause of cable breaks==

===Anchors===
These disruptions are attributed by some officials to accidents involving ships' [[anchor]]s,&lt;ref name="TOI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_News" /&gt; but reviews of surveillance footage of the area by [[Egypt]]ian [[government|authorities]] revealed no ships in the area.&lt;ref name="khaleejnoships" /&gt; However, FLAG Telecom indicated that the cut to the Falcon cable between the United Arab Emirates and Oman was caused by an abandoned anchor weighing five to six tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view/20080207-117457/Ships-anchor-cut-Gulf-Internet-cable----company |title=Breaking News / Infotech |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=7 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209022738/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view/20080207-117457/Ships-anchor-cut-Gulf-Internet-cable----company |archivedate=9 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid April two ships were impounded in connection with the FLAG Telecom outages near Dubai.  They were charged with improperly dropping anchor in the area of the cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/Apr/13/ships_impounded_in_middle_east_cable_cuts.html|title=Ships Impounded in Middle East Cable Cuts|date=2008-04-13|accessdate=2008-04-14|author=Rich Miller|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417070508/http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/Apr/13/ships_impounded_in_middle_east_cable_cuts.html|archivedate=2008-04-17|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19 December breaks were reported to be caused either by bad weather or a ship's anchor, though the bad weather was just a possibility and the anchor a much more likely occurrence.&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;

===Common occurrence===
According to Stephen Beckert, a senior analyst at [[TeleGeography]], the events are far less exceptional than they seem because cable cuts happen all the time. Beckert argues that "only the first two cuts had any serious impact on the Internet," and this drew public attention to other cable cuts that would not normally have been newsworthy. According to Beckert, cable cuts happen "on average once every three days." He further noted that there are 25 large ships that do nothing but fix cable cuts and bends, and that such cuts are usually the result of cables rubbing against rocks on the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/02/who-cut-the-cab.html |title=Cable Cut Fever Grips the Web |work=Wired News |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=7 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208115949/http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/02/who-cut-the-cab.html |archivedate=8 February 2008 |deadurl=no |first=Ryan |last=Singel |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Global Marine Systems]], "Undersea cable damage is hardly rare—indeed, more than 50 repair operations were mounted in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] alone last year". While a cut in a cable crossing the Atlantic has "no significant effect" due to the many alternate cables, only a handful of Internet cables serve the Middle East. These disruptions are only noticeable because of the small number of cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4244474&amp;page=1 |title=Analyzing the Internet Collapse |date=2008-02-05 |work=ABC News |accessdate=7 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208125208/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4244474&amp;page=1 |archivedate=8 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Since [[Israel]] and [[Iraq]] were not affected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathaba.net/news/?x=580589|title=One Internet cut explained, but four others still a mystery|date=2008-02-07| accessdate= 7 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the communications blackout, [[conspiracy theories]] have begun to spread throughout the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iOI6IbGndscHLRd4lRiKCqGksCSg |author=Agence France Press |title=One Internet cut explained, but four others still a mystery |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=7 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210044431/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iOI6IbGndscHLRd4lRiKCqGksCSg |archivedate=10 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalresearch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=7987 |title=Three Internet Cables Slashed in a Week: Has Iran lost all Internet Connectivity? |date=2008-02-03 |work=Global Research |accessdate=5 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306055555/http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=7987 |archivedate=6 March 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/02/05/fourth-undersea-cable-cut-near-uae-suspicions-rise | title= Fourth undersea cable cut near UAE, suspicions rise |date = 2008-02-05 | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | work = Engadget| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080209202325/http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/05/fourth-undersea-cable-cut-near-uae-suspicions-rise| archivedate= 9 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9865263-7.html |title=The newest Internet whodunnit?

On 6 February, theories that the disruption in these cables was related to an economic confrontation between the United States and Iran appeared in an opinion piece on Dow Jones Marketwatch.&lt;ref name="interruption1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/middle-east-internet-interruption-looks/story.aspx?guid=%7B6FD0D324%2D8FF9%2D4900%2DBCA9%2D614914BA3E87%7D |title=Middle East Internet interruption looks fishy |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=9 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209113151/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/middle-east-internet-interruption-looks/story.aspx?guid=%7B6FD0D324-8FF9-4900-BCA9-614914BA3E87%7D |archivedate=9 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This article points out that the disruption or damage to these cables preceded the intended launch of the [[Iranian oil bourse]] on Kish Island between 1 and 11 February.  The launch of this bourse, which was intended to broker sales of oil denominated in euros (sometimes called "[[petroeuro]]s") had been interpreted by some as an attempt by Iran to inflict additional damage to the value of the dollar by reducing the volume of oil which is traded in "[[petrodollar]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/7707.html |title=Petrodollar Warfare: Dollars, Euros and the Upcoming Iranian Oil Bourse |date=2005-08-02 |accessdate=9 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202025907/http://www.energybulletin.net/7707.html |archivedate=2 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the potential economic damage of euro-denominated oil sales in the context of on-going dollar inflation, as well as the large number of cables which appear to have been disrupted or damaged, Marketwatch's John Dvorak has written that the U.S. can expect to be blamed for the disruptions.&lt;ref name="interruption1"/&gt;

According to this sabotage theory, the damaged cables and the resulting Internet disruptions would destroy confidence in the ability of the [[Iranian Oil Bourse]] to execute trades, thereby thwarting the establishment of an alternative to dollar-denominated oil sales. In fact, Iran suffered very little from the outages, which primarily affected America's allies in the region (see 'Effects' above).&lt;ref name="disconnected1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mediterranean1"/&gt; Bloggers have also suggested that the cable disruptions were a cover for [[NSA]] installing taps on the lines for eavesdropping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/02/who-cut-the-cab/ | work=Wired | first=Ryan | last=Singel | title=Cable Cut Fever Grips the Web | date=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, 18 February, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] said that the damage could have been an act of sabotage. The [[UN]] agency's head of development, [[Sami al-Murshed]] was quoted, "We do not want to preempt the results of ongoing investigations, but we do not rule out that a deliberate act of sabotage caused the damage to the undersea cables over two weeks ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This was subsequently shown false, as on April 18, two ships parked in a restricted area during a storm, cutting the cables with their anchors. One sailor from each vessel was detained, as were both vessels. The vessels were subsequently released after restitution for the damaged cables was secured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Two+Ships+Impounded+After+Investigation+into+Undersea+Cable+Cuts/article11480.htm |title=Two Ships Impounded After Investigation into Undersea Cable Cuts |last=McGlaun |first=Shane |date=2008-04-14 |website=[[DailyTech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year '''526 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 244 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''.  The denomination 526 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

It was written in response to the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] on September 15, 1963, an attack by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] that killed four [[African-American]] girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/library/livejazz7.htm |title=All About Jazz: "The Top Ten Best Live Jazz Recordings - #7" |access-date=2009-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918203256/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/library/livejazz7.htm |archive-date=2008-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.orjazzm.pl/muzyka/john-coltrane-alabama/707 |title=John Colrane - Alabama |access-date=2010-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211155/http://www.orjazzm.pl/muzyka/john-coltrane-alabama/707 |archive-date=2012-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coltrane's Quartet performed this piece on television for an episode of [[Jazz Casual]] in 1963.

'''Amfiteatrof Music Festival''' (previously known as Festival Massimo Amfiteatrof) is a [[Classical music|classical]] and [[chamber music]] festival based in [[Levanto, Liguria|Levanto]], an Italian ''Comune'' in the [[ligurian Riviera]],  between [[Genoa]] and [[La Spezia]], since 1992. &lt;br&gt;
The festival pays tribute to [[Massimo Amfiteatrof]] (born Maksim Aleksandrovich Amfiteatrov), one of the greatest cellist of the 20th century, dubbed as the "Cellists' [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]]" (Italian: "''il Caruso dei Violoncellisti''"), who moved from [[St. Petersburg]] to Italy in the early 1920s, settling first in Cavi, a ''frazione'' of [[Lavagna]], and then in Levanto, where he died in 1990. During his lifetime Amfiteatrof worked with [[Arturo Toscanini]] and [[Fabrizio De André]] and collaborated with [[EIAR]] and subsequently with [[RAI]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cellist.nl/database/showcellist.asp?id=1608 Massimo Amfitheatrof&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The Festival has been being organized by Associazione Festival Massimo Amfiteatrof Levanto since its beginning and the administrative board is currently led by president Angela Fenwick &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.festivalamfiteatrof.com/|title=Cariche dell'Associazione|work=festivalamfiteatrof.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Festival ==
Founded two years after Amfiteatrof's death, Amfiteatrof Music Festival offers every summer, from july to september, a considerable number of concerts and music performances.
The festival is well known for the architectonic, historic and geographic hallmarks of the sites where they are held: old churches, castles, noble houses, small scenic squares (the so-called "''piazzettes''"), old towns and convents, gardens, parks and amazing heights and cliffs overlooking the [[Ligurian sea]]. Partly due to these features, a large number of tourists, including foreigners, regularly attend the concerts during the summer season in the Levanto area, near to the [[Cinque Terre]] towns. &lt;br&gt;

All the concerts are free entry with the exception of those requiring an early reservation, such as premieres, debuts, theatre shows and very famous musicians' recitals, often located in prestigious sites (for example, the gardens of Villa Agnelli in Levanto, which belonged to [[Gianni Agnelli]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenazone.it/genova/blog/2015/07/03/festival-massimo-amfiteatrof-a-levanto/|title=Festival Massimo Amfiteatrof a Levanto|work=www.zenazone.it|accessdate=11 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304142031/http://www.zenazone.it/genova/blog/2015/07/03/festival-massimo-amfiteatrof-a-levanto/|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Amfiteatrof Music Festival features classical and chamber music performances by many internationally renowned soloists and ensembles. Formative and didactic workshops, cultural lectures, children theatre and contemporary experimental performances, which blend music with other arts, also make the event. Many musicians and orchestra conductors collaborated with Amfiteatrof during his lifetime or were tied with him from caring relationships and that's one of the main reasons why they frequently come back in Levanto to perform again.
During the early years the major place of the Festival was the Convento della Santissima Annunziata in Levanto. Later on, it has been moved to the outside yard of St. Andrew's Church (Chiesa di Sant'Andrea). Nowadays there are more locations than before - both internal and external ones - in Levanto, but also in the nearby villages of the Province of La Spezia, such as [[Framura]], [[Bonassola]] (on the Riviera) and [[Brugnato]] (within the inner [[Province of La Spezia|Province]])

== Artists and performers ==
Popular and recurrent performers of the Festival are: Camerata RCO (soloists of the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]), ensemble-in-residence from 2009 to 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gazzettadellaspezia.it/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=39130:festival-amfiteatrof,-nuova-esibizione-della-camerata-rco&amp;Itemid=10038|title=Festival Amfiteatrof, nuova esibizione della Camerata RCO|work=www.gazzettadellaspezia.it|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dynamis Ensemble]], [[Elena Denisova]], [[Moni Ovadia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laspezia.mentelocale.it/32465-moni-ovadia-al-festival-amfiteatrof-2011-il-programma/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050907/http://laspezia.mentelocale.it/32465-moni-ovadia-al-festival-amfiteatrof-2011-il-programma/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 July 2011|title=Moni Ovadia al Festival Amfiteatrof 2011: il programma|work=www.laspezia.mentelocale.it/|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Lonquich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.laspeziaoggi.it/2013/08/22/alexander-lonquich-a-levanto/|title=Alexander Lonquich a Levanto|work=www.laspeziaoggi.it|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the chamber musicians of [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]], [[Palo Alto Chamber Orchestra]], [[Andrea Bacchetti]], [[Mariangela Vacatello]], [[Domenico Nordio]], [[Bruno Canino]] - Antonio Ballista piano duo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ligurianews.com/la-spezia/cultura/4595497/festival-massimo-amfiteatrof-tocca-al-duo-pianistico-ballista-e-canino|title=Festival Massimo Amfiteatrof, tocca al duo pianistico Ballista e Canino|work=www.ligurianews.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and many other popular artists

'''Animation Block Party''' is an annual [[animation]] [[film festival]] in [[New York City]], usually held over three days in late July.

==History==
===Brooklyn===
On September 9, 2004, Casey Safron, the event's founder, curated the first Animation Block Party, held in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]]. The event was rated one of the top five smaller film festivals in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/columns/topfive/9802/ "Top Five Smaller Film Festivals,"] ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', May 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Animation Block Party opened for international submissions, acquired corporate sponsorship and expanded to become an annual festival with juried awards and prizes for participating animators.&lt;ref name="ackerman"&gt;McCarton Ackerman, [http://www.greenpointnews.com/entertainment/3601/animation-block-party-arrives-in-williamsburg "Animation Block Party Arrives in Williamsburg,"] ''Greenpoint Gazette'', July 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Baisley, [http://www.awn.com/news/events/nyc-animation-block-party-screening "NYC Animation Block Party Screening,"] [[Animation World Network]], December 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the festival expanded to its current multi-day format,&lt;ref&gt;Chermelle D.

'''Anoshazad''', known in the [[Shahnameh]] as '''Noshzad''' (meaning "son of the immortal"), was a [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] prince who was the leader of a revolt in southern [[Iran]] in ca. 550. He was the oldest son of king [[Khosrow I]] (r. 531-579), while his mother was a [[Christianity|Christian]] and the daughter of the judge (''[[dadwar]]'') of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]].

== Biography ==
=== Etymology ===
''Anōshāzād'' is a [[Middle Persian]] name, while ''Nōshzād'' ({{lang|fa|نوشزاد}}) is the [[New Persian]] form. The [[Greek language|Greek]] form of the name is ''Anasozados''. Whether it is really a proper name, or rather an epithet, is unclear.

===Imprisonment===
[[File:Southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Map of the southwestern part of the [[Sasanian Empire]].]]
According to several sources, Anoshazad was sometime before his revolt imprisoned in [[Gundeshapur]] by his father. According to [[Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī|Dinavari]] and [[Ferdowsi]], it was because he had converted to [[Christianity]]. However, this is unlikely since neither [[Procopius]] nor [[Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn al-Athir]] calls him a Christian; according to Procopius, Anoshazad was imprisoned for seducing some of his father's wives, while Ibn al-Athir states that he was imprisoned because he was suspected of being a crypto-[[Manichaean]].{{sfn|Khaleghi-Motlagh|1985|pp=99-100}}

=== Revolt ===
According to Dinavari, while Khosrow I was campaigning in Syria against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], he fell ill at [[Homs|Emesa]]—according to [[Theodor Nöldeke|Nöldeke]], however, Khosrow never reached the city and instead returned to his capital, [[Ctesiphon]]. He further states that Anoshazad had spread false rumours of Khosrow having a deadly sickness. Anoshazad thereafter raised an army, which consisted of prisoners and Christians from [[Ahvaz]] and [[Gundeshapur]].{{sfn|Khaleghi-Motlagh|1985|pp=99-100}} However, according to Nöldeke, Fariburz most likely didn't manage to get support from a large number of Christians, which he tried to do so by stating that his mother was a Christian. Nevertheless, he managed to capture Ahvaz and seize its riches.{{sfn|Khaleghi-Motlagh|1985|pp=99-100}}

Burzin, who was Khosrow's vice-regent at Ctesiphon, shortly sent an army under [[Fariburz]] to besiege Gundeshapur, and informed Khosrow of the revolt. Khosrow thereafter ordered him bring Anoshazad back alive if possible, and to kill all the nobles participating in his revolt, but not the ordinary people.{{sfn|Khaleghi-Motlagh|1985|pp=99-100}} The revolt of Anoshazad was eventually suppressed, while he was captured and taken to Ctesiphon, where he was blinded.{{sfn|Khaleghi-Motlagh|1985|pp=99-100}}

The '''Battle of Yarmouk Camp (2015)''' was a battle that broke out in April 2015, during the [[Syrian Civil War]], when the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] stormed the rebel-held Yarmouk Camp. The [[Yarmouk Camp]] is a district of [[Damascus]] that is home to the largest community of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] refugees in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=googlenews&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jevFaBhWboO5_Mqrgpk7ycShh4RQ?docId=CNG.493b5bfef777e0c4e6e2103828c1614e.1b1 |accessdate=5 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219055345/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jevFaBhWboO5_Mqrgpk7ycShh4RQ?docId=CNG.493b5bfef777e0c4e6e2103828c1614e.1b1 |archivedate=19 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Battle of Yarmouk Camp (December 2012)}}
On 17 December 2012, the [[Free Syrian Army]] and anti-government Palestinians took control of the camp. After subsequent heavy fighting, the FSA and the Syrian Army agreed to leave Yarmouk as a neutral, demilitarized zone, but the camp remained besieged and sporadic clashes continued. Syrian government forces besieged Yarmouk for two years, and as a result, approximately 200 people were believed to have died of hunger in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/palestinian-refugees-at-yarmouk-are-left-to-their-fate-1.2172106 Palestinian refugees at Yarmouk are left to their fate], irishtimes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battle==

===ISIL storms the camp===
On 1 April, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] militants entered the Yarmouk Refugee Camp from the Hajar Al-Aswad district, but were expelled the next day by Syrian and Palestinian rebels. However, ISIL re-entered the camp on 4 April and took control of 90% of it.&lt;ref name="take90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISILenters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/isil-enters-yarmouk-refugee-camp-syria-capital-150403124537528.html|title=ISIL re-enters Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria's capital|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local recruits were among the ISIL forces—having joined the militants due to anger at being starved by the Syrian government and disliking some of the rebel groups that controlled Yarmouk "for playing politics with the regime rather than confronting it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The war against Islamic State (1): Creeping toward Damascus|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21648016-jihadists-advance-syria-poses-difficult-questions-america-creeping|accessdate=21 April 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April, [[Jaysh al-Islam]] claimed that its fighters were refused access to the camp by [[al-Nusra Front]] and that al-Nusra allowed ISIL to enter the camp, which led to some defections from the first party.&lt;ref name="islamarmy"/&gt; The al-Nusra Front responded by defending its neutral stance in the conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://syriahr.com/en/2015/04/jabhat-al-nusra-stands-for-impartiality-and-refuse-the-entry-of-jaysh-al-islam-to-al-yarmouk-refugee-camp/ |title=Jabhat al- Nusra stands for impartiality and refuse the entry of Jaysh al- Islam to al- Yarmouk refugee camp |author=sohranas |work=Syrian Observatory For Human Rights |accessdate=6 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407015704/http://syriahr.com/en/2015/04/jabhat-al-nusra-stands-for-impartiality-and-refuse-the-entry-of-jaysh-al-islam-to-al-yarmouk-refugee-camp/ |archivedate=7 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed to have mediated a ceasefire.

On 6 April, it was reported that about 2,000 people were evacuated from the camp since ISIL's attack.&lt;ref name="2000people"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/2000-civilians-evacuated-from-syrias-yarmouk/a-18362344|title=2,000 civilians evacuated from Syria′s Yarmouk - News - DW.DE - 05.04.2015|work=DW.DE|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, pro-government Palestinian groups led by the [[Palestine Liberation Army]], the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]], [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command|PFLP-GC]] and [[Fatah al-Intifada]] launched an assault against ISIL. They reportedly captured Morocco Street, Al-Ja’ounah Street and the Martyrs Cemetery and claimed to have killed 36 ISIL militant and controlled 40% of the Yarmouk camp.&lt;ref name="Masdar"/&gt;

On 7 April, the fighting had ceased,&lt;ref name="offers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/syria-offers-palestinians-its-firepower-in-yarmuk-battle_1575072.html|title=Syria offers Palestinians its firepower in Yarmuk battle|work=Zee News|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ISIL in control of 95% of the camp.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianobserver.com/EN/News/28964/ISIS_Controls_Percent_Yarmouk_Refugee_Camp|title=ISIS Controls 95 Percent of Yarmouk Refugee Camp |author=Al-Souria Net |work=The Syrian Observer|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebel counterattack===
On 12 April, Jaysh al-Islam and allied forces launched a counterattack on the ISIL-held Hajar al-Aswad district&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Syria_Rebel_Obs/status/587174263653797888|title=Syrian Rebellion Obs on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reportedly advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Syria_Rebel_Obs/status/587174584086097920|title=Syrian Rebellion Obs on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaysh al-Islam also recaptured Al-Zein street in Yarmouk Camp from ISIL, during a nighttime operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/EjmAlrai/status/587175600831516672|title=Elijah J. Magnier on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 16 April, ISIL and al-Nusra were still holding 80% of the Yarmouk Camp, after clashes with Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis and other rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriahr.com/en/2015/04/80-of-the-yarmouk-camp-is-under-control-by-the-is/ |title=80% of the Yarmouk camp is under control by the IS |author=Master |work=Syrian Observatory For Human Rights |accessdate=19 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603091954/http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/04/80-of-the-yarmouk-camp-is-under-control-by-the-is/ |archivedate=3 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, fighting between the rebels and ISIL expanded to the neighborhoods of al-Qaboun and Barzah.

On 19 April, an activist reported that ISIL was planning to leave the camp, although they had not yet done so. He also revealed that most of the al-Nusra Front fighters in Yarmouk Camp had defected to ISIL, and that the two groups were closely collaborating in the area. By then, Aknaf Bai al-Maqdis had dissolved and joined Syrian Government forces.&lt;ref name="areaone"/&gt; By 20 April, the ISIL attack on the two districts had been repelled.&lt;ref name="defeat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2015/04/syrian-rebels-defeat-isis-in-damascus/|title=Syrian rebels defeat ISIS in Damascus|work=ARA News|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the retreat of ISIL from the al-Qaboun and Barzah districts, the UN continued trying to bring relief aid into Yarmouk Camp. However, the camp remained sealed off, and the relief workers were only able to deliver supplies to the communities outside of Yarmouk Camp.&lt;ref name="UN continues trying to reach Yarmouk Camp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50669|title=United Nations News Centre|date=23 April 2015|work=UN News Service Section|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIL control was eventually shrunk to 40% of the area, with another 20% being contested.&lt;ref name="jihadists"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/jihadists-palestinians-battle-syria-refugee-camp-165054789.html|title=Jihadists, Palestinians battle in Syria refugee camp|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, talks continued for making the Yarmouk Camp a neutral region, with plans for the expulsion of all gunmen from the area.&lt;ref name="expelled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/05/05/Palestinian-officials-in-Syria-over-Yarmouk-camp-.html|title=Palestinian officials in Syria over Yarmouk Camp|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting between ISIL and government forces continued in the camp into late May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/05/clashes-in-jobar-and-the-yarmouk-camp-and-aerial-bombardment-on-al-sokhna-city/ Clashes in Jobar and the Yarmouk camp, and aerial bombardment on al-Sokhna city] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526155101/http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/05/clashes-in-jobar-and-the-yarmouk-camp-and-aerial-bombardment-on-al-sokhna-city/ |date=26 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June 2015, Palestinian militias in Yarmouk Camp reportedly expelled ISIL from the area of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/palestinian-militias-force-isis-out-of-yarmouk-camp/ Palestinian Militias Force ISIS Out of Yarmouk Camp]&lt;/ref&gt; However, three weeks later, it was revealed that Yarmouk Camp was still under siege by Syrian Army forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albawaba.com/news/palestinians-syria-facing-%E2%80%98imminent-threat%E2%80%99-plo-712048 Palestinians in Syria facing ‘imminent threat’: PLO]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== October 2017 ===
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) launched a big assault in the Yarmouk Camp, targeting the neighbourhoods controlled by Aknaf Beit Al-Maqdis and Jaysh Al-Islam.

According to the terrorist group’s official media wing, their forces captured the Yarmouk Hospital and several buildings nearby after overtaking the Islamist fighters in the southern part of the district.

Most of the Yarmouk Camp is under the occupation of the Islamic State, which leaves the remaining civilians inside the district at the mercy of the terrorist group.

While the Syrian Red Crescent and U.N. have attempted to deliver humanitarian aid to the beleaguered neighbourhoods of Yarmouk, they have found themselves often blocked by the Islamic State terrorists manning checkpoints between this district and nearby Palestine Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/isis-seizes-large-part-yarmouk-camp/|title=ISIS seizes large part of Yarmouk Camp|date=25 October 2017|work=AMN - Al-Masdar News {{!}} المصدر نيوز|access-date=25 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 27 January, ISIL almost entirely controlled Hajjar al-Aswad after breaking through the last lines of defense, and were on the verge of entering the town of Yalda. During the same time, further areas had also been captured in Yarmouk district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/isis-forces-verge-entering-new-town-southern-damascus-map/|title=ISIS forces on the verge of entering new town in southern Damascus - map|date=27 January 2018|work=AMN - Al-Masdar News {{!}} المصدر نيوز|access-date=17 February 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Waldman''' (October 12, 1913 – November 1, 1986) was an American physicist who flew on the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima atomic bombing mission]] as a cameraman during [[World War II]].

A graduate of [[New York University]], joined the faculty of the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1938. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Navy]] as an engineering officer. He headed a group that conducted blast measurements for the [[Trinity nuclear test]], and served on [[Tinian]] with [[Project Alberta]].

After the war he returned to Notre Dame. He was director of the [[Midwestern Universities Research Association]] Laboratory from 1960 to 1964, dean of its [[Notre Dame College of Science]] at Notre Dame from 1967 to 1979, and associate director of the [[National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory]] from 1979 to 1983.

==Early life and education==
Bernard Waldman was born in [[New York City]] on October 12, 1913. He attended [[New York University]], from which he received Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt; His thesis, on "The Resonance Processes in the Disintegration of Boron by Protons",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.nd.edu/chemistry/resources/genealogy/physics/documents/WaldmanB.pdf |title=Bernard Waldman - PhD |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; formed the basis of a paper published in the ''[[Physical Review]]''. His research supported the estimates of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Robert Serber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Resonance Processes in the Disintegration of Boron by Protons |last=Waldman |first=B. |last2=Waddel |first2=R.

Although he was a [[Congregationalist]], Waldman joined the faculty of the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1938. He became an [[assistant professor]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==
During [[World War II]], Waldman served in the [[United States Navy]] as an engineering officer, and was involved in construction and extension of naval bases in the United States.{{sfn|Jones|Mills|Sessler|Symon|2010|p=102}} He took a leave of absence from Notre Dame and joined Oppenheimer and Serber at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt; He was assigned to [[Norman F. Ramsey]]'s E-7 Group, which was part of the Ordnance (O) Division responsible for "integration of design and delivery". Most of the work involved preparing and checking instrumentation from drop tests involving dummy bombs.&lt;ref name="Trinity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/General_info/ND_Manhattan_project.pdf |title=Early Days of Nuclear Physics at Notre Dame and the Manhattan Project |first=Philipp |last=Wiescher |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agnew on Tinian.jpg|thumb|left|Waldman (bottom right) on Tinian with [[Harold Agnew]] (top left), [[Luis W. Alvarez]] (top right) and [[Lawrence H. Johnston]] (bottom left)]]
Waldman was the head of Group TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) for the [[Trinity nuclear test]] in July 1945. He developed microphones that were dropped by parachute to measure the effect of the blast. He was then assigned to [[Project Alberta]], the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy nuclear weapons, and support their use during the actual missions.&lt;ref name="Trinity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACAP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsnow.org/history/acap/institutions/manhattan.jsp |title=The Manhattan Project |publisher=Array of Contemporary American Physicists |accessdate=February 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204013045/http://physicsnow.org/history/acap/institutions/manhattan.jsp |archivedate=February 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he participated in the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], as a camera operator on the [[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|observation aircraft]]. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20030824&amp;slug=marquardtobit24 |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]  |title=George Marquardt, U.S. war pilot over Hiroshima, dies at 84 |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Alvarez|Trower|1987|p=66}}

==Later life==
After the war ended, Waldman returned to Notre Dame, where he continued his research into the [[photodisintegration]] of [[deuterium]] and [[beryllium]].{{sfn|Jones|Mills|Sessler|Symon|2010|p=102}} For a time he was in charge of a 3-million volt [[particle accelerator]] that was the world`s second most powerful source of [[X-rays]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt; In 1960, Waldman  took a sabbatical from Notre Dame to become director of the [[Midwestern Universities Research Association]] (MURP) Laboratory. He set about fixing problems with the 50 MeV accelerator. These were resolved, but the Federal Government declined to fund MURP's activities, and Walden returned to Notre Dame in 1964.{{sfn|Jones|Mills|Sessler|Symon|2010|p=102}} Waldman was appointed dean of Notre Dame's College of Science in 1967. He held this position  August, 1979, when he retired at the age of 65. He then became as associate director of the [[National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory]] at [[Michigan State University]], a position he held until 1983.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt;

Waldman died in a hospital in [[Sanford, North Carolina]], where he was being treated for cancer, on November 1, 1986. He was survived by his wife, Glenna and three daughters.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-11-16/news/8603260170_1_hiroshima-atomic-bomb-mr-waldman |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |title=Bomb Physicist Bernard Waldman |date=November 16, 1986 |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A funeral service was held at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] on the campus of the University of  Notre Dame, and he was interred in its Cedar Grove Cemetery.&lt;ref name="Star-News"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Star-News]] |date=Nov 13, 1986 |title=Atomic Bomb Scientist Bernard Waldman dies |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19861113&amp;id=P3ZSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4RMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4495,5334268 |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His papers are in the University of Notre Dame Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.nd.edu/findaids/ead/xml/wal.xml |title=Bernard Waldman Papers |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernardo Buontalenti''' ({{IPA-it|berˈnardo ˌbwɔntaˈlɛnti}}), byname of '''Bernardo Delle Girandole''' (''[[circa|c.]]'' 1531 – 25 or 26 June 1608), was an [[Italy|Italian]] stage designer, architect, theatrical designer, military engineer and artist.

==Biography==
Buontalenti was born in [[Florence]].

He entered the service of the [[Medici]] as a youth and remained with them the rest of his life. He is said to have been instructed in painting by [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Salviati]] and [[Bronzino]], in sculpture by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], in architecture by [[Giorgio Vasari]], and to have learned miniature painting under [[Giulio Clovio]]. He executed a number of miniatures for [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany |Francesco]], the son of [[Cosimo I]]. More than a painter, he was celebrated as an architect; in this role he was much employed in the design of fortifications, villas, and gardens and is considered one of the most important architects of the Mannerist period. He was also a great mechanic, and an excellent mathematician. In 1562 he travelled to [[Spain]].

His first known work is from 1568, the [[Palazzo di Bianca Cappello, Florence|Palazzo di Bianca Cappello]] in Florence. His main achievements include the project for the new city of [[Livorno]],  the decoration of [[Palazzo Pitti]] and the [[Boboli Gardens]] with the famous grotto, as well as the [[Villa di Pratolino|Parco di Pratolino]] of which little remains today, except for a giant sculpture by Giambologna, representing the Colossus of the Apennines. Buontalenti's skills as a military engineer are shown by the fortifications of the port of [[Livorno]], the [[Forte di Belvedere]] in Florence, the city walls of [[Pistoia]], [[Grosseto]], [[Prato]], [[Portoferraio]] (Elba) and [[Naples]]; he also perfected designs for cannons, and devised a new type of incendiary grenade.

In the [[Uffizi Palace]] of Florence, he built a great court stage, where, during the winter of 1585–1586, splendid festivities were produced under his direction. He designed costumes for the Medici [[intermedio|extravaganzas]]. He was also an innovator in ice conservation and is credited with inventing the precursor to modern Florentine cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=1elpxy2oCW4C&amp;lpg=PA1577&amp;ots=VTnbP3BYUn&amp;dq=Bernardo%20Buontalenti%20ice%20cream&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA1573#v=snippet&amp;q=Bernardo%20Buontalenti%20ice&amp;f=false|title=Harvest of the Cold Months: The Social History of Ice and Ices|last=David|first=Elizabeth|date=2011-01-20|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571275328|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite his successes, his prodigality led Buontalenti to financial ruin; he survived in his later life thanks to a pension given him by the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]].

==Police inquiry==
[[Vinayan]] had made it clear even before the release of the film that it is not a biopic on [[Kalabhavan Mani]]. Now, the climax of the film has become controversial as several questions have been raised regarding the death of [[Kalabhavan Mani]]. According to some reports, the investigating agency [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] has asked Vinayan for explanation on the film’s climax. The death of Kalabhavan Mani has been under CBI investigation, after the actor’s family expressed doubts about the reasons for his early death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/the-climax-of-chalakkudikkaran-changathi-become-controversial-news-malayalam-skekunajdjgfa.html|title=The climax of 'Chalakkudikkaran Changathi' become controversial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red flag.svg|thumb|Following the historic election a red flag was raised above the city chambers, although it was soon taken down.]]
'''Elections for the City of Edinburgh District Council''' took place on Thursday 3 May 1984, alongside [[Scottish District local elections, 1984|elections to the councils]] of Scotland's various other districts.

The election was the first time Labour had ever won a majority on the Edinburgh Council, with the party winning 34 of the City's 62 seats. The Conservatives came second, on 22 seats, whilst the SDP-Liberal Alliance won 4, and the SNP 2. Labour would retain its dominance for the next 23 years, until the [[City of Edinburgh Council election, 2007|2007 election]]. [[Mark Lazarowicz]] and [[Nigel Griffiths]] played prominent roles in the election, and would later both become Edinburgh Members of Parliament for Labour.&lt;ref name="EEV"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=8 April 2014 |title=30 years since Labour took Edinburgh City Council |url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/life-style/30-years-since-labour-took-edinburgh-city-council-1-3368946 |newspaper=Edinburgh Evening News |location= |access-date=8 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Wood (politician)|Alex Wood]] was the leader of the Labour group.

Following the election a [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] was raised above the [[Edinburgh City Chambers]], but it was taken down after a day.&lt;ref name="EEV"/&gt;

'''[[Dale Earnhardt]]''' was an American race car driver who gained worldwide fame as a [[stock car]] driver for [[NASCAR]], recording seven [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup]] championship victories and 76 career wins, including the [[1998 Daytona 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dale Earnhardt|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/734494/Dale-Earnhardt|work=www.britannica.com/EBchecked/|publisher=www.britannica.com/EBchecked/|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed in a final-lap collision in the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] on February 18, 2001, in which he crashed into the retaining wall after making contact with [[Sterling Marlin]] and [[Ken Schrader]]. Earnhardt's death was officially pronounced at the nearby [[Halifax Health|Halifax Medical Center]] at 5:16&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (22:16 UTC),&lt;ref name="Official Accident Report&amp;nbsp;— No. 3 Car" /&gt; although he likely died immediately upon impact. He was 49 years old. His funeral was held four days later at the Calvary Church in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Earnhardt's death was highly publicized and resulted in various safety improvements in NASCAR auto racing.&lt;ref name="That's Racin"&gt;[http://www.thatsracin.com/158/story/7999.html Dale Earnhardt's last gift 5 years after the crash, That's Racin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502163806/http://www.thatsracin.com/158/story/7999.html |date=May 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Earnhardt's death, NASCAR began an intensive focus on safety that has seen the organization mandate the use of head-and-neck restraints, oversee the installation of [[SAFER barrier]]s at oval tracks, set rigorous new inspection rules for seats and seat-belts,&lt;ref name="Official Accident Report&amp;nbsp;— No. 3 Car" /&gt;  develop a roof-hatch escape system, and the [[Car of Tomorrow]]—which eventually led to the development of a next-generation race car built with extra driver safety in mind. Earnhardt was the fourth driver to die during NASCAR competition within a year, beginning with [[Adam Petty]]'s accident in May 2000.&lt;ref name="Official Accident Report&amp;nbsp;— No. 3 Car" /&gt; Since Earnhardt's death, no Cup series driver has died during competition.

==Circumstances of Earnhardt's death==

===Rules of competition===
Earnhardt died while competing in the [[2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series#Daytona 500|2001 Daytona 500]], a NASCAR-sanctioned automobile race at [[Daytona International Speedway]]. NASCAR sanctions required the use of a carburetor [[restrictor plate]] for races held at the track.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2004-07-01-daytona-preview_x.htm Restrictor Plates Appear to be Here to Stay, USA Today]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the year before Earnhardt died, NASCAR instituted additional restrictions to the springs and shocks used on the cars, causing Earnhardt to complain to the media, "The rules took NASCAR&lt;ref name="Official Accident Report&amp;nbsp;— No. 3 Car" /&gt;  Winston Cup racing and made it some of the sorriest racing. They took racing out of the hands of the drivers and the crews. We can't adjust and make our cars drive like we want. They just killed the racing at Daytona. This is a joke to have to race like this."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/20/sports/auto-racing-jarrett-is-ahead-of-field-before-daytona-starts.html Jarrett Is Ahead of Field Before Daytona Starts, New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism such as Earnhardt's, NASCAR developed a new aerodynamic package for the cars competing in Winston Cup Series races at Daytona and [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. In the initial running of this aerodynamic package at Talladega, Earnhardt passed seventeen cars within four laps to win the fall 2000 Talladega race.&lt;ref name="Autoracing1"&gt;[http://www.autoracing1.com/goodboys/001015TalladegaRace.htm Talladega&amp;nbsp;– Earnhardt wins and that's No Bull, AutoRacing1.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 Daytona 500 was the first {{convert|500|mile|adj=on}} race run at the track with this package, which was designed to keep cars bunched up close together and to allow more frequent passing at high speed.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/101086/ I Killed Dale Earnhardt, Slate.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-race events===
In the weeks before the Daytona 500, Earnhardt elected not to attend the annual fan and media preview event, drawing vocal criticism from fellow driver [[Jimmy Spencer]]. On February 3 and 4, 2001, the first time in his career, Earnhardt participated in the [[24 Hours of Daytona|Rolex 24]] endurance race at Daytona, the event which kicks off [[Speedweeks]] at the track. Earnhardt and his teammates, [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] (Earnhardt's son), [[Andy Pilgrim]] and [[Kelly Collins]], finished 4th overall and 2nd in class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daleearnhardt.net/reports/2001/02_03.htm "2001 Rolex 24 at Daytona"];  Retrieved January 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, 2001 Speedweeks would be the first in many years that Earnhardt failed to win one race. In the [[Sprint Unlimited|Budweiser Shootout]], Earnhardt finished second to [[Tony Stewart]]. Earnhardt was also denied victory in the [[Budweiser Duel|Gatorade Twin 125]] qualifying race. Earnhardt had won every Twin 125 event he competed in during the 1990s, and was poised to win again in 2001 when [[Sterling Marlin]] pulled off a slingshot pass going down the backstretch, taking the victory away from Earnhardt.

===Race events===
The morning of the race, Earnhardt appeared confident and relaxed. Earnhardt was a front-runner throughout the race,&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; leading 17 laps. In the first three quarters of the race, there were only two caution flags: the first one on lap 49 when [[Jeff Purvis]] hit the wall exiting turn 4 and the other on lap 157 when rookie [[Kurt Busch]] hit the frontstretch wall while trying to pass [[Joe Nemechek]] and slid through the infield and onto pit road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dale Earnhardt Jr. confident after strong showing in Sprint All-Star Race|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2012-05-20/dale-earnhardt-jr-confident-sprint-all-star-race-jimmie-johnson-hendrick-motorsp|work=aol.sportingnews.com|publisher=aol.sportingnews.com|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On lap 173, Earnhardt drove his familiar black No. 3 car in third place, with two of [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.|his team's]] cars, the blue No. 15 Chevrolet driven by [[Michael Waltrip]] and the red No. 8 Chevrolet driven by his son [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], running first and second in front of him. On that lap,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dale Earnhardt Jr. says he feels like a championship contender heading into Chase|url=http://article.wn.com/view/2012/09/12/Dale_Earnhardt_Jr_says_he_feels_like_a_championship_contende/|work=article.wn.com|publisher=article.wn.com|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Big One (NASCAR)|a huge crash]] on the back straightaway eliminated 18 cars in a spectacular fashion. Those involved in the crash were [[Jason Leffler]], [[Steve Park]] (another of Earnhardt's drivers), both [[Rusty Wallace|Rusty]] (who would rally back to finish third) and [[Kenny Wallace]], [[Jeff Gordon|Jeff]] and [[Robby Gordon]], both [[Bobby Labonte|Bobby]] (the defending Cup Champion) and [[Terry Labonte]], [[Mark Martin]], [[Tony Stewart]], [[Elliott Sadler]], [[Jeff Burton|Jeff]] and [[Ward Burton]] (who had led the most laps in the race so far with 53), [[Jerry Nadeau]], [[John Andretti]], [[Buckshot Jones]], [[Dale Jarrett]] (the [[2000 Daytona 500|defending Daytona 500]] winner), and [[Andy Houston]]. The crash began when R. Gordon turned W. Burton at the exit of turn 2. Stewart got hit by W. Burton, turned backwards against the outside wall, and was pushed airborne over R. Gordon. Stewart then flipped over twice, hooking to B. Labonte's hood, and stood on his front wheels before coasting to a stop in the infield, while W. Burton's car turned sideways and collected most of the field behind him. Earnhardt, [[Ron Hornaday, Jr.]], [[Ricky Rudd]], [[Ken Schrader]], and Mike Wallace were five of the few drivers who escaped the crash scene. The race was red-flagged to remove cars from the racetrack, and clean up debris.

Between the time of the lap 173 accident and a lap 180 restart, Earnhardt conversed with his pit crew over the radio. The owner of Dale Earnhardt's car, [[Richard Childress]], describes one remark made by Earnhardt during that time. "Richard, if they don't do something to these cars, it's gonna end up killing somebody."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=EdwinTV9 |title=The Day - Remembering Dale Earnhardt (Full) |date=2012-02-22 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIn0Ca9ekg4&amp;t=1052 |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213172533/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIn0Ca9ekg4 |archivedate=December 13, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ensuing caution, Earnhardt had his last conversation with his crew, this between him and his Rolex 24 teammate Andy Pilgrim:
{{blockquote|'''Earnhardt''': So, you got any advice for me here coming up?&lt;br&gt;'''Pilgrim''': No, man, I haven't got any advice for you. Just keep doing what you're doing.&lt;br&gt;'''Earnhardt''': Okay, just wondering.&lt;br&gt;'''Pilgrim''': Cheers; talk to you later.}}

Pilgrim related that there was no further crew conversation with Earnhardt, but that he did cheer on teammates Michael (Waltrip) and (Dale Earnhardt) Junior over the radio, up to the end of the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aolnews.com/2011/02/10/ten-years-after-sharing-final-moments-and-a-drivers-seat-with/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145241/http://www.aolnews.com/2011/02/10/ten-years-after-sharing-final-moments-and-a-drivers-seat-with/ |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race restarted on lap 180, with Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. still out in front. [[Sterling Marlin]], who had beaten Earnhardt in the Gatorade Duel, led the next three laps before Waltrip took the lead again. The lead changed several times between Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. during the next few laps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE INTIMIDATOR|url=http://www.racelinecentral.com/thestory.html|work=www.racelinecentral.com|publisher=www.racelinecentral.com|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the laps wound down, Waltrip and Earnhardt, Jr. were running in first and second place, with Earnhardt Sr. behind them, blocking Marlin's attempts to pass. With less than two laps remaining, Fox commentator [[Darrell Waltrip]] noted that "Sterling had beat the front end off of that ol' Dodge (Marlin's car) just trying to get around Dale Earnhardt, Sr.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6: Dale Earnhardt dies at Daytona 500|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/6|work=sports.espn.go.com|publisher=sports.espn.go.com|accessdate=February 5, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702231354/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments%2F6|archivedate=July 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the cars entered turn 3 on the final lap, Earnhardt still held third, and was running in the middle lane of traffic. Marlin's No. 40 Dodge was just behind him and running the bottom lane, while R. Wallace's navy blue No. 2 Ford was directly behind Earnhardt and [[Ken Schrader]] was above Earnhardt riding the high lane in his yellow No. 36 Pontiac.

====Final lap crash====
The accident occurred in turn 4, when Earnhardt made light contact with Marlin and slid off course. When Earnhardt attempted to regain control and turned back onto the track, he crossed in front of Schrader, colliding with Schrader and dragging his car up the track. Earnhardt collided head-on into the retaining wall at a critical angle, damaging the car at an estimated speed between {{convert|155|and|160|mph|kph|abbr=on}}, enough to break the right rear wheel assembly off the car. Upon impact, his hood pins severed, causing it to open and slam up against the windshield multiple times. As [[Michael Waltrip]] and [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] were about to complete the race, both of the wrecked cars went down the steep banking and slid into the infield grass near the exit of turn 4. No other drivers hit Earnhardt or Schrader after the crash, as they were able to make it past them without incident. After both cars came to a stop on the infield, Schrader escaped his car with minor injuries and went to check on Earnhardt. Earnhardt's window net was still up, and Schrader pulled it down himself, then frantically signalled for paramedics. That day, and in retellings of the events, Schrader described what he saw in indirect terms: "We've got bigger problems", "Look, I'm not a doctor, I'm telling you it don't look good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=SpeedTV|title=The Day: Remembering Dale Earnhardt|date=2011-02-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdftdvWSJXg|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only shortly after the 10-year anniversary when asked about it, did Schrader finally say, "Here's the deal. When I went up to the car ... I knew. I knew he was dead, yeah. ... I didn't want to be the one who said 'Dale is dead.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2011/02/18/dearnhardt-kschrader-remembers-10.html|title=dearnhardt-kschrader-remembers-10|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Race officials threw the checkered flag and the yellow simultaneously as the front-runners crossed the finish line, aware only that a crash had occurred behind the finishers. Waltrip won the race, with Earnhardt, Jr. finishing second behind him. [[Rusty Wallace]] finished third, [[Ricky Rudd]] finished fourth, polesitter [[Bill Elliott]] finished fifth, Wallace's brother [[Mike Wallace (racing driver)|Mike]] finished sixth, Marlin finished seventh, [[Bobby Hamilton]] finished eighth, [[Jeremy Mayfield]] finished ninth, and outside polesitter [[Stacy Compton]] finished 10th. [[Joe Nemechek]] finished 11th. Earnhardt and Schrader were credited finishing 12th and 13th despite not completing the final lap (only 11 cars – Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. included – finished on the lead lap as a result of the long green flag runs and the lap 173 crash).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2001/1/data/results_official.html Official results of 2001 Daytona 500 on NASCAR.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Earnhardt, Jr. rushed to his father's location. 

As per NASCAR rules, any driver involved in a crash and unable to drive back to the pits or who must be extricated from their car, must report to the infield hospital. However, in severe cases, the driver may be sent directly to the emergency trauma room at the hospital near the circuit. Earnhardt was extricated from his car by Daytona's safety teams and was taken to the [[Halifax Health|Halifax Medical Center]]. Attempts to revive Earnhardt failed and his death was officially pronounced at 5:16&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST (22:16 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]); he was 49 years old. The official cause of Earnhardt's death was given by the Volusia County medical examiner's office as [[blunt force trauma]] to his head among other injuries due to the incident.&lt;ref name="EarnhardtInjuries"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/03/26/fish_autopsyreport/ CNNSI.com: Earnhardt autopsy report answers, leaves questions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505012105/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/03/26/fish_autopsyreport/ |date=May 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sustained a fatal [[basilar skull fracture]] on impact.

[[File:Earnhardt Crash.svg|Earnhardt's car struck the concrete retaining wall at a heading angle (angle of the vehicle measured from the wall face to the center-line of the car at point of impact) of between 55–59°, combined with a trajectory angle of 13.6° (path of vehicle approaching the wall).]]

Less than two hours after the accident, [[NASCAR]] president [[Mike Helton]] announced Earnhardt's death. A later investigation revealed that Earnhardt's car struck the concrete retaining wall at a heading angle (angle of the vehicle measured from the wall face to the center-line of the car at point of impact) of between 55–59°, combined with a trajectory angle of 13.6° (path of vehicle approaching the wall) and an estimated speed between {{convert|157|and|161|mph|kph|abbr=on}}. Earnhardt experienced a [[Impulse (physics)|crash impulse]] of approximately 80 milliseconds in duration. The result of the wall impact and the impact from Schrader's car combined to yield a change in velocity of approximately {{convert|42|-|44|mph|kph|abbr=on}}. The force exerted was equivalent to a vertical drop from a height of {{convert|61.8|ft|m}}. Later sled testing of an exemplar vehicle yielded [[g-force]]s ranging from −68 to −48&amp;nbsp;g, variation dependent on method of measurement.&lt;ref name="rpm"&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/rpm/wc/2001/0218/1093772.html Earnhardt dies instantly of head injuries, ESPN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2001-08-21-report-transcript.htm Transcript of NASCAR's report on Earnhardt crash], August 21, 2001; ''[[USA Today]]'', Retrieved November 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Earnhardt's death triggered widespread media attention. One newspaper called the day '''"Black Sunday"'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_9_225/ai_78681666/pg_1 Black Sunday&amp;nbsp;– the day Dale Earnhardt died] ''[[Sporting News]]''. Archived at ''Findarticles.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Devastated fans congregated at the headquarters of [[Richard Childress Racing]] and [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] the night of the crash and at Daytona International Speedway. Earnhardt was featured in the following week's ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, and a video from the race was played on nearly every major television channel in the United States.

Earnhardt's public funeral service was held on February 22, 2001 at the Calvary Church in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/21/sports/earnhardt-s-funeral-is-tomorrow.html|title=Earnhardt's Funeral is Tomorrow|work=New York Times|date=February 21, 2001|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His death led both to a police investigation and NASCAR-sanctioned investigation. In a reversal of previous NASCAR policy, nearly every detail of the investigation was made public.

Days after the crash, [[Sterling Marlin]] received hate mail and death threats from fans who blamed him for Earnhardt's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2001-03-13-marlin.htm | work=USA Today | title=Fans rally behind Marlin in wake of tragedy | date=March 14, 2001 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dale Earnhardt, Jr. absolved Marlin of responsibility and asked everyone who loved his father to stop assigning blame for his death. On February 20, Marlin announced to the world about his responsibility:
{{bquote|I definitely didn't do anything intentional. We were just racing our guts out for the last lap of the Daytona 500. Everybody was going for it. Dale's car got caught in the middle [three-wide with Ken Schrader]. I was as low as I could go. Whether [[Rusty Wallace]] got him loose and down into me, I don't know. You have to talk to Rusty Wallace. I watched the tape one time and that is all I want to see it.&lt;ref name="SterlingMarlin"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/2001/daytona500/news/2001/02/20/marlin_react_fish/ CNNSI.com: Marlin speaks out on Earnhardt accident] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724121250/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/2001/daytona500/news/2001/02/20/marlin_react_fish/ |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the week following the accident, [[Bill Simpson]], whose company—[[Simpson Performance Products]]—made the seatbelt Earnhardt wore during the race, also reported that he had also received death threats from angry fans. When asked about this, [[Darrell Waltrip]] stated that "NASCAR is an emotion sport and that all the fans love their drivers, so when something like this happens, the connection to these racers makes you want to blame somebody and that somebody had to be involved and unfortunately, the blame was placed in the wrong place here".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8udMmun1Ulk 2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series Dura Lube 400 Sunday - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacing Earnhardt==
Team owner [[Richard Childress]] made a public pledge that a black car with a [[GM Goodwrench]] sponsorship would no longer use the number 3, honoring the color scheme and sponsor that Earnhardt had driven with since 1988. Given the No. 3 team's 12th-place finish in the race, 2000 season status as second in owner points, and presence on the Winner's Circle bonus program, Childress requested (and NASCAR approved) the team to be renumbered to 29. The renumbered team retained the same sponsor, although the car was adorned with a reversed color scheme—a white body with black numerals and a black stripe on the bottom—for races at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] and [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]]. The team kept all bonuses earned as the No. 3 team in 2000 and the Daytona 500. For the race at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]], a new GM Goodwrench Service Plus paint-scheme was introduced, along with angled red stripes and a thin blue pinstripe resembling the [[AC Delco]]-sponsored Chevrolets driven in the [[Xfinity Series|Busch Series]]. From 2003 to 2006, when the GM Goodwrench Service Plus sponsorship came to an end, the No. 29 car was painted in black and silver, bearing a resemblance to the No. 3. From 2001 - 2013, a small No. 3 decal was placed alongside the No. 29 in Earnhardt's memory and the team's legacy. On December 11, 2013, RCR announced that the No. 3 car would return to the Cup Series for [[Austin Dillon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/12/11/austin-dillon-driving-number-3-car-dale-earnhardt-sprint-cup-series.html|title=DILLON TO DRIVE NO. 3 SPRINT CUP CAR FOR RCR|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childress's second-year Busch Series driver [[Kevin Harvick]] was tapped to replace Earnhardt beginning with the first race after his death—the [[2001 Dura Lube 400|Dura Lube 400]], held at [[North Carolina Speedway]] in [[Rockingham, North Carolina]]. Hats bearing the No. 3 logo were distributed to everyone at the track in Earnhardt's memory. Initially, the Childress team wore blank uniforms out of respect but as Harvick's performance improved, the regular GM Goodwrench Service Plus uniforms returned with the team scoring a Top 10 finish by the next race in Las Vegas, and winning the next week in Atlanta. [[Jeff Gordon]], the polesitter for Dura Lube 400, gave a [[missing man formation]] during the pace laps. This was a custom used in motorsports for mourning. [[Steve Park]] would win that race, but felt emotional in Victory Lane.

Harvick's win at Atlanta has since been memorable to many NASCAR fans. On the last lap of the [[2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500|Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500]], he beat Gordon by .006 seconds, a similar margin to Earnhardt's win over [[Bobby Labonte]] during the same race a year before (.010 seconds), and the images of Earnhardt's longtime gas man, Danny "Chocolate" Myers, crying after the victory, Harvick's tire-smoking burnout on the frontstretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window, and the Fox television call by [[Mike Joy]], [[Larry McReynolds]], and [[Darrell Waltrip]], concluding with "Gordon got loose, but he [Harvick] is gonna get him though, it's Harvick! Harvick by inches!"

[[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] won the [[2001 Pepsi 400|Pepsi 400]] on July 7, 2001. This led to an emotional celebration on the infield with Michael Waltrip (who finished second), whose victory at the Daytona 500 had been rendered hollow by the senior Earnhardt's death. Earnhardt, Jr. would win two more races that season (the fall races at Dover and Talladega), for an eighth-place finish in the points standings.

The team still scored a ninth-place finish in points for the 2001 season, led by Harvick's two wins and Top 10 finishes in the points. Harvick also captured [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors as well.

Fans honored Earnhardt by holding three fingers aloft on the third lap of every NASCAR Winston Cup race. Meanwhile, NASCAR's television partners also went silent for the third lap, a practice that was repeated until the 2002 race at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]], and in the [[2011 Daytona 500]], ten years after his death. Later in 2001, some of these gestures were also done in remembrance of the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Earnhardt was credited finishing 57th in the final point standings for 2001, despite competing in only one race. He also won the 2001 [[NASCAR's Most Popular Driver Award|Most Popular Driver Award]] at the end of year awards' ceremony. Perennial winner [[Bill Elliott]] bowed out of the running and encouraged his supporters to vote for Earnhardt instead.

==Cause of death controversy==
At a news conference five days after the crash, NASCAR officials announced that the left lap belt on Earnhardt's seat belt harness had broken. Dr. Steve Bohannon, NASCAR's medical expert, said he thought the faulty belt had allowed Earnhardt's chin to strike the steering wheel, causing the fatal [[basilar skull fracture]]. This led to speculation that Earnhardt would have survived if his seat belt had not broken.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/24/sports/auto-racing-broken-seat-belt-is-found-in-earnhardt-s-wreck-at-daytona.html Broken Seat Belt Is Found In Earnhardt's Wreck, New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paramedics to respond to the crash scene maintained that the seat belts had been loose, but the lap belt was not broken or cut when the belts were unbuckled to cut Earnhardt from the car.&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;[http://xml.newsday.com/sports/nationworld/sns-earnhardt-seatbelt-emtwoman,0,7525770.story Earnhardt Seat-belt Debate Intensifies, The Orlando Sentinel]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NASCAR's investigation concluded that each of the EMTs who attended to Earnhardt after the crash reported that the buckle position of Earnhardt's harness was off-center by {{convert|4 to 8|in|cm}}, which would have been impossible had the lap belt not broken.&lt;ref name="Official Accident Report&amp;nbsp;— No. 3 Car"&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/SPECIAL/er/html_version/ Official Accident Report&amp;nbsp;– No. 3 Car] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212095012/http://www.nascar.com/SPECIAL/er/html_version/ |date=February 12, 2007 }} NASCAR Publications, 2001, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent medical investigation revealed that belt failure did not play a significant role in Earnhardt's death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/11/sports/plus-auto-racing-earnhardt-s-death-not-linked-to-seat-belt.html Earnhardt's Death Not Linked to Seat Belt, New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the accident, [[Simpson Performance Products]]—the company which manufactured the seat belts—manufactured the seat belts used in nearly every NASCAR competitor's machine.&lt;ref name="Hinton"&gt;''Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black''. Hinton, Ed.  Warner Books, 2001. {{ISBN|0-446-52677-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Simpson]], the company's founder, maintained that the belt had failed because it had been installed in an unapproved fashion in order to increase Earnhardt's comfort, an allegation that had been supported by some who were familiar with the situation.
	
[[Ed Hinton (sportswriter)|Ed Hinton]], a sportswriter for the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', attempted to acquire Earnhardt's autopsy records and photos for study, as autopsy records were normally public documents in [[Florida]]. However, Earnhardt's widow [[Teresa Earnhardt]] petitioned a judge to seal the records. After a short court battle, it was mutually agreed to appoint Dr. Barry Myers, an expert on crash injuries at [[Duke University]], to independently study Earnhardt's death. On April 10, 2001, Myers published his report rejecting NASCAR's explanation, finding that Earnhardt's death was the result of his inadequately restrained head and neck snapping forward, independent of the broken seat belt (rendering the question of improper installation moot).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
 
Philip Villanueva, a [[University of Miami]] [[neurosurgeon]] who had previously analyzed the crash for the ''Sentinel'' before the autopsy records were available, said he had reached the same conclusion but had wanted to examine the autopsy photos to be certain. Dr. Steve Olvey, who had been the medical director of [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART]] for 22 years, and [[Wayne State University]] crash expert John Melvin also agreed with Myers' report. Bill Simpson said that the report was "The best news I've heard in seven weeks. I've been living in daily hell."&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news |author=Jim Leusner |author2=Henry Pierson Curtis |author3=Ed Hinton |last-author-amp=yes |title=Experts say belt no factor in Earnhardt's death |newspaper=Baltimore sun |date=April 10, 2001 |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/nationworld/sns-earnhardt-osreview,0,5637877.story |accessdate=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day as Myers' report was made public, NASCAR announced its own investigation, after having remained silent for six weeks since the crash. The official NASCAR report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/SPECIAL/er/download/ Nascar.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210083105/http://www.nascar.com/SPECIAL/er/download/ |date=February 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had cost over a million dollars and was published on August 21, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt's death was the result of a combination of factors, which included the last-second collision with Schrader's car, the speed and angle of impact, and the separation of the seat belt as being contributing factors. It was also noted that investigators could not determine whether a head and neck support (HANS) device would have saved Earnhardt's life, and that airline-style black boxes would be mandated for all vehicles in order to better understand the forces at work in a crash such as Earnhardt's.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/08/21/sports/main307408.shtml Of Black Boxes and Seat Belts, CBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, Bill Simpson left Simpson Performance Products, citing the stress as "too much". The Simpson company attorneys asked NASCAR to unequivocally assert the following in regards to the broken lap belt found in Earnhardt's car:&lt;ref name="cnnsi"&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2001/NEWS/cnnsi/08/21/earnhardt_cnnsi/index.html NASCAR releases findings of Earnhardt crash probe, CNNSI]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
* The belts were of high quality in workmanship and there were no design or manufacturing defects.
* The belts met the NASCAR rule book requirements. 
* The belts, as installed, did not conform to manufacturer installation requirements.
* The separation of the left lap belt was not a result of design or manufacturing defect, but caused by improper installation.
* The belt separation was not the cause of Earnhardt's death.
 
NASCAR, however, did not respond.

A year after leaving his own company under controversy, Simpson returned to the motorsports safety industry after his one-year non-compete clause expired, starting IMPACT! Racing Products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/08/21/Sports/Bill_Simpson_is_glad_.shtml St. Petersburg (FL) Times, Bill Simpson is Glad to be Back, August 21, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety improvements==
After the accident, there were several safety improvements made in the sport of stock car racing.

In response to the speculation about the broken lap belt in Earnhardt's car, many teams migrated from traditional five to six-point safety harnesses.&lt;ref name="GM PR"&gt;[http://www.huliq.com/15037/new-nascar-race-car-influenced-by-gm-racing-safety-research New NASCAR Race Car Influenced by GM Racing Safety Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of NASCAR's accident report, there were no rules requiring drivers to wear [[HANS device]]s. NASCAR president [[Mike Helton]] stated, "We are still not going to react for the sake of reacting."&lt;ref name="Orlando Sentinel"&gt;[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/motorracing/sns-nascar-earnhardt,0,629501.story NASCAR Releases Earnhardt Findings, Orlando Sentinel]&lt;/ref&gt; However, NASCAR did wish to "encourage their use". By August 19, 2001, 41 out of 43 drivers were wearing them at the [[3M Performance 400|Pepsi 400 by Meijer]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]], just two days before NASCAR's report came out.

Two months later, after the 2001 [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] EasyCare 100 at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] resulted in the death of [[Blaise Alexander]], NASCAR mandated the use of head and neck restraints. Earnhardt's eldest son [[Kerry Earnhardt]] was involved in the crash that killed Alexander, although Kerry was not injured.

In addition to head and neck restraints, NASCAR began requiring the use of [[SAFER barrier]]s at race tracks in which its top touring series compete.&lt;ref name="NASCAR.com"&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/features/04/18/safer.nascar.enterprise/index.html Putting up barriers to make NASCAR that much SAFER, NASCAR.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The soft walls feature foam and move slightly upon impact, dissipating energy and resulting in fewer forces being exerted on the driver during an impact.

Soon after Earnhardt's death, NASCAR began developing the [[Car of Tomorrow]] (CoT), which was used in competition in the [[Sprint Cup Series]] until it was replaced by the so-called "Gen 6" car for the [[2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2013 season]]. The design of the CoT incorporated the result of research conducted in the aftermath of Earnhardt's death.&lt;ref name="GM PR"/&gt; All of the safety improvements from the CoT remain in the Gen 6 design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/8950107/nascar-car-tomorrow-buried-praised |title=Thanks for the memories, CoT |first=Ryan |last=McGee |publisher=''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' |date=February 15, 2013 |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autopsy pictures==
On February 19, 2001, the [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia County]] Medical Examiner performed an autopsy for Earnhardt. The unusual act of notifying NASCAR and Teresa Earnhardt was made prior to releasing the records sought by members of the public and media. Three days later, Teresa Earnhardt filed a legal brief in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Volusia County, Florida ''(Case No. 2001-30373-CICI Div. 32)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010222_01_(S)_EARN-COMPLAINT_FOR_DECLAR_AND_INJUNCT_RELIEF_(05P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the complaint was filed, the medical examiner's office was barred from releasing the public records, including autopsy photographs, pertaining to Earnhardt, until a formal hearing on the merits of Teresa Earnhardt's case could be heard.
	
On February 28, March 13, and March 16, 2001, the ''Orlando Sentinel''; Michael Uribe, founder of WebsiteCity.com; and Campus Communications, Inc., publisher of the [[University of Florida]]'s student newspaper ''[[The Independent Florida Alligator]]'' filed motions to intervene into the Earnhardt v. Volusia litigation in order to uphold their rights to inspect and copy public records held by the Volusia County Medical Examiner to include the photographs and videotape of Dale Earnhardt's autopsy examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010228_01_(S)_SENTINEL-MOT_TO_INTERV_(03P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf Sentience Motion to Intervene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010313_01_(F)_URIBE-MOT_TO_INTERV_(03P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf Uribe Motion to Intervene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010316_04_CCI-MOT_TO_INTERV_DISM_SUM_JUDG_(03P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf CCI Motion to Intervene]&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 12 to June 13, 2001, a trial was then conducted before Judge Joseph Will. Will eventually ruled against Uribe and CCI's original public records requests and constitutional arguments to inspect and copy the medical examiner files pertaining to Earnhardt, to include autopsy photographs. Judge Will's ruling set forth in motion an extensive legal battle later fought in the [[appellate court]]s by both Uribe and CCI seeking to deem the denial of their public records request unconstitutional under Florida State and Federal laws. Then on December 1, 2003, the [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear Uribe and CCI's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/courts/CCI_v_EARN_US03-0484/pleadings/docs/20030929_01-CCI-PETITION-FOR-WRIT-OF-CERTIORARI_(93P)(CCIvEARN)(US03-0484).pdf Petition for Writ of Certiorari]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Florida Legislature's March 29, 2001, law preventing release of Earnhardt's public record autopsy photographs would remain in effect.

The Florida Legislature's March 29, 2001 law, also known as the '''Earnhardt Family Protection Act''', was sponsored by Daytona Beach's Senator [[James E. King|Jim King]] (R-Jacksonville) and changed Florida's previously long standing and historically [[Freedom of information legislation|open public records laws]] from that day onward. The Earnhardt law deemed Florida's medical examination autopsy photographs, video, and audio recordings exempt from public inspection without the express permission from applicable [[next of kin]].

In April 2002, a year after Earnhardt's death, [[TLC (band)|TLC]] singer [[Lisa Lopes]] was killed in a car accident in Honduras. A controversy similar to the release of Earnhardt's autopsy photos occurred, as within days of Lopes' crash, autopsy photos began to circulate on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CNNSI.com |url=http://www.nascar.com/2002/news/cnnsi/05/02/lopes/ |title='&amp;#39;NASCAR.com'&amp;#39; Retrieved on 04–19–07 |publisher=Nascar.com |date=May 2, 2002 |accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of Earnhardt's drivers ([[Steve Park]]; [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]]; and [[Michael Waltrip]]) responded in protest to the leak by painting a single black stripe next to their cars' left headlight decals for the [[Toyota Owners 400|Pontiac Excitement 400]] at [[Richmond International Raceway]].

The '''Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft''' (German Touring Car Championship, or '''DTM''') was a [[touring car racing]] series held from 1984 to 1996. Originally based in [[Germany]], it held additional rounds elsewhere in [[Europe]] and later worldwide.

The original DTM had resumed racing with production based cars, as the former [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]] had switched to [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] in 1977 and even to expensive [[Group C]] sportscars in 1982, leading to its decline. Since 2000, a new DTM has been run as the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]], again organised by ''ITR''.

==History==
[[File:Alfa Romeo 155 Alfa Corse in Arese 20070608.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Alfa_Romeo_155#155_V6_TI|Alfa Romeo 155 V6 TI DTM]] of 1993 champion [[Nicola Larini]]. The 155 holds the all-time record of 38 victories in DTM.]]

===Rise of the original DTM===
The original DTM was started in 1984 as '''Deutschen Produktionswagen Meisterschaft''' (German Production Car Championship), with cars entered by privateer teams and under [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group A]] rules, but was extensively modified throughout the years, allowing more modifications. In the late 1980s, works teams joined the DTM, and it became one of the most popular [[motorsport]] championships in Europe.

Turbochargers were banned at the start of 1988 season due to cost reasons.

In 1993, the Group A rules were abandoned in favor of a more liberalised 2.5 L engine category called FIA [[Class 1 Touring Cars]], with extensive use of [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[four-wheel drive]], electronic driver aids and [[carbon fibre]] chassis, the former three were technologies that were banned from [[Formula One|F1]]. [[Opel]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Alfa Romeo in motorsport|Alfa Romeo]] all fielded works teams after [[Audi]] and [[BMW]] had abandoned earlier.

===DTM to ITC and demise===
The DTM expanded its horizons for the 1995 season and the teams contested the inaugural FIA International Touring Car Series &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorsport-archive.com/index.php?mode=Season&amp;id=271 1995 ITC schedule and standings] Retrieved from www.motorsport-archive.com on 17 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the traditional DTM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorsport-archive.com/index.php?mode=Season&amp;id=31 1995 DTM schedule and standings] Retrieved from www.motorsport-archive.com on 17 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The former was contested over ten races, all held outside of Germany and the latter over fourteen races within Germany. Plans were then made to combine the two into one new series, the International Touring Car Championship, for 1996.  The ITR governing body then sought approval and support from the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] to begin the new series.  In exchange for FIA support, the ITR let the organisation take control over many aspects of the way the ITC was run: crucially, the financial side of the championship was revolutionised.  A large proportion of the revenue generated by the championship went to the FIA, with the result that less went to the teams who subsequently complained of little return on their increasingly large investment in the high-tech series (this was further exacerbated by the travel costs to the new international rounds in [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]], [[Japan]] and [[Interlagos]], [[Brazil]]). The FIA also increased the price for television rights dramatically with the result that television coverage of the series disappeared from all European countries except [[Italy]], Germany and Finland, prices for tickets to races were almost doubled, and access to the circuit paddock to meet the drivers (which had previously been a big hit with fans) was drastically reduced.  The choices of circuits on which to hold rounds of the championship were also unsuccessful – the rounds at [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]], [[France]] and particularly Interlagos suffered very poor attendance.  Questions were also raised by the manufacturers as to why they were racing in countries in which their cars were not actually sold (Alfa Romeos were not sold in Brazil).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  [[Opel]] and [[Alfa Romeo in motorsport|Alfa Romeo]] both left the championship after the 1996 season, leaving only Mercedes; the championship was consequently cancelled.

===The new DTM===
{{main|Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters}}
The DTM returned in the year 2000 with different rules and with semi-International Championship status. The DTM initials now stand for [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (German Touring Car Masters).

A '''diversionary foreign policy''', or a '''diversionary war''', is an [[international relations]] term that identifies a [[war]] instigated by a country's leader in order to distract its population from their own domestic strife. The concept stems from the Diversionary War Theory, which states that leaders who are threatened by domestic turmoil occasionally initiate an international conflict in order to shift the nation's attention away from internal troubles. As a result, this external threat would counter the domestic strife and ensure the leader's position in power. Essentially, a '''diversionary use of force''' is a manipulation of the [[Rally Round the Flag Syndrome]] effect, causing an increase of national fervor from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Sobek, David. "Rallying Around the Podesta: Testing Diversionary Theory Across Time." Journal of Peace Research 44.1 (2007): 29-45. 20 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://jpr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/44/1/29&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars of International Relations have dedicated much research to the practical application of diversionary war. A large percentage investigates [[List of Presidents of the United States|Presidents of the United States]] and their disputed culpability partaking in diversionary foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;DeRouen, Karl. "Presidents and the Diversionary Use of Force: A Research Note." International Studies Quarterly 44.2 (2000): 317-328. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3014000 &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the immense amount of effort and research, scholars have not yet formed a consensus of the accuracy of the theory, and empirical evidence is mixed at best.&lt;ref&gt;Mowle, Thomas S. "Worldviews in Foreign Policy: Realism Liberalism, and External Conflict." Political Psychology 24.3 (2003): 561-592. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3792326 &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
'''Intended'''

Generally, the pursuit of a diversionary foreign policy may offer the leader in power four benefits, all of which increase their ability to remain in power:&lt;ref&gt;Sobek, David. "Rallying Around the Podesta: Testing Diversionary Theory Across Time." Journal of Peace Research 44.1 (2007): 29-45. 20 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://jpr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/44/1/29&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

#A successful diversionary foreign policy could increase support for the domestic regime. This in turn increases that government's time to address their internal trouble.
#Artificial tension created from the international conflict may justify a leaders' [[suppression of dissent]].
#The war abroad could cause the population to simply be distracted from the issues that induced the original dissatisfaction with the government.
#The external threat may unify the country through the Rally Round the Flag Syndrome effect by creating a new out-group other than the government for the population to direct its dissatisfaction.

'''Negative'''

However, all of these benefits depend on success in the diversionary war that the government facing domestic strife incites. Failure in these international actions would backfire against the leader's initial intent. As a result, the leader would likely face more domestic strife, possibly hastening his or her loss of power &lt;ref&gt;Chiozza, Giacomo. "Peace through Insecurity: Tenure and International Conflict." The Journal of Conflict Resolution 47.4 (2003): 443-467. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3176204 &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, this possible negative effect is addressed in the Diversionary War Theory. The theory itself states that rational leaders facing a near inevitable removal from office become more likely to gamble on a risky diversionary war. If the existing dissatisfaction is prompting their removal from office, a diversionary foreign policy only leaves room for gain &lt;ref&gt;Smith, Alastair. "Diversionary Foreign Policy in Democratic Systems." International Studies Quarterly 40.1 (1996): 133-153. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600934&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
Although the theory was not officially addressed in [[academia]] until the past half-century, the benefits of a diversionary foreign policy had long been accepted by governments and others as [[conventional wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Burbach, David T.. "Diversionary Temptations: Presidential Incentives and the Political Use of Force." MIT.edu. 20 Oct. 2008 &lt;stuff.mit.edu/people/dburbach/burbach_diss_intro.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Simmel and [[Lewis A. Coser]] both published work applying the [[in-group]]/[[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]] psychology hypothesis towards International Relations. Essentially, their work postulated that populations of nations increase their cohesion during times of conflict with an out-group (another nation, organization, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;DeRouen, Karl. "Presidents and the Diversionary Use of Force: A Research Note." International Studies Quarterly 44.2 (2000): 317-328. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3014000 &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
This often includes rallying around the country's leader. As an example, President [[George W. Bush]]'s approval ratings soared to 80% following the [[attacks on September 11, 2001]]. This type of response suggests that leaders have an incentive to manufacture conflict whenever they are in the need of a boost of popularity.

From this assertion, scholars have used this conventional wisdom to expand and test the theory's true applications.&lt;ref&gt;Burbach, David T. "Diversionary Temptations: Presidential Incentives and the Political Use of Force." MIT.edu. 20 Oct. 2008 &lt;stuff.mit.edu/people/dburbach/burbach_diss_intro.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
A significant number of studies have attempted to establish connections between the instigation of war as a way to divert attention from a struggling [[economy]], or general low approval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;DeRouen, Karl. "Presidents and the Diversionary Use of Force: A Research Note." International Studies Quarterly 44.2 (2000): 317-328. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3014000 &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the theory has diverged into contemporary and traditional perspectives.

== Conditions that lead to Diversionary Foreign Policy ==
The purpose of diversionary foreign policy is to divert the attention of the public away from domestic issues. This means that the conditions leading to diversionary tactics include any sort of domestic unrest. This incorporates dissatisfaction with domestic policies and [[Poverty|poor economic conditions]]. The theory predicts that the use of external force will increase the chance of reelection, so it would be used during a time when the president does not seem to have a good chance of reelection. The necessary conditions of the opposing state differ based on which theory one ascribes to, traditional or contemporary. The traditional view of diversionary foreign policy suggests that a state will target another in which conflict is likely to be prolonged, which would be against states with comparable [[military]] capabilities. According to this point of view, the prospect of victory is not the most important aspect in choosing an enemy because it is based on a sociological "in-group/out-group" perspective. This refers to the increase of cohesion among the "in-group" because of the common enemy or "out-group." On the other hand, contemporary diversionary theory states that, due to the uncertainty of international relations and the high cost of war, a state is more likely to prey on a weaker state where victory will be more quickly and easily obtained &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Foster, Dennis. "Relative Capabilities and American Diversionary Targeting Decisions" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association, Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois, Apr 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, diversionary foreign policy is more likely seen in a [[Great power|major power]] because they are less constrained by the [[international community]]. It is also seen more in democracies where the government needs to be more responsive to public sentiment &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Clifton. "Domestic Support and Diversionary External Conflict in Great Britain, 1950- 1992." The Journal of Politics 61.3 (1999): 799-814. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2647829 &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Election cycles have a lot to do with diversionary wars because a war ideally increases the chance that the [[incumbent]] administration will remain &lt;ref&gt;Smith, Alastair. "Diversionary Foreign Policy in Democratic Systems." International Studies Quarterly 40.1 (1996): 133-153. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600934&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Pre World War II===
====Hundred Years War (1415-1453)====
In 1415, King [[Henry V of England]] invaded France shortly after his succession to the throne, resulting in a short campaign and a resounding victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]].  This campaign initiated the third phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]], termed the '''Lancastrian War''' (''see'' [[Hundred Years' War (1415-53)]]).

Sir [[John Keegan]] has opined that the primary motivation for Henry's decision to invade France (ostensibly asserting, "on dubious legal grounds", a claim to the succession of the French throne), was to solidify his popularity at home and quell unrest from other English nobles, several of whom questioned the legitimacy of his dynasty, since his father, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], had usurped the throne from [[Richard II]].&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John. ''[[The Face of Battle]]'' (1976), John Cape, London, {{ISBN|978-0140048971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russo-Japanese War====
One historical example that demonstrates the conventional acceptance of the effectiveness of a diversionary war is the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904. During the months leading up war, [[Russia]] experienced numerous [[strike action|workers strikes]] that lead to internal unsettledness.&lt;ref name="Kowner"&gt;Kowner, Rotem. Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War. Lantham, MD: The Scarecrow Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These strikes coincided with the Russian's negotiations with the Japanese over expansion in Manchuria and Korea. It has been argued that, as a way to distract their population, the Russian [[Tzar]] and his ministers decided to goad the Japanese into declaring war, thereby turning [[Japan]] into the needed out-group.&lt;ref name="Kowner"/&gt; In fact, Russia's Minister of the Interior, [[Vyacheslav von Phleve]], stated before starting the war:&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Clifton, Diana Richards, Val Schwebach, Rick Wilson, and Garry Young. "Good Times, Bad Times, and the Diversionary Use of Force: A Tale of Some Not-So-Free Agents." The Journal of Conflict Resolution 37.3 (1993): 504-535. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/174266 &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
“What this country needs is a short victorious war to stem the tide of revolution.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clearly, at least some of the Russians in power at the time believed that by a diversionary war, they would be able to distract their population from the domestic troubles that had been haunting Russia. However, there is some evidence that the Tsar himself, and some of his advisors, did not believe that, being viewed as overmatched, Japan would be willing to go to war, and intended to use only the threat of such a conflict as a diversionary tactic.

However, the Russo-Japanese War is also in example of how a diversionary war can backfire. Japan soundly defeated Russia in battle. This only aggravated the calls for replacing the Tzar, loosened the Tzar's grip on power, and some say hastened the path toward the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution]] of 1905 and eventually 1917.&lt;ref name="Kowner"/&gt;

====The French Revolutionary Wars of 1792====
In 1792, the French Government comprised a newly formed [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], which had replaced [[King Louis XVI]]. In order to unify its citizens under the new flag and new leadership, the National Assembly began the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. It first declared war on [[Austria]], soon to be joined by [[Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, Gregg. What Causes War? An Introduction to Theories of International Conflict. Salisbury, MD: Lexington Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Franco-Prussian War====
[[Otto von Bismarck]] utilized diversionary foreign policy often during his quest to [[Unification of Germany|unify Germany]]. These wars distracted the German people from the cultural difference that previously had prevented them from forming a single country. Bismarck used the success of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in a similar fashion, officially establishing a German Empire following the siege of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Watman, Kenneth. The Relationship Between Regime Strength and the Propensity. Columbus: Ohio State University, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post World War II===
Many contemporary examples involve the U.S. because they fit the mold of conditions, a democratic superpower. The examples follow a similar model in which the U.S. must decide whether or not to intervene in an international conflict. Because the U.S. is in a good position to win most military conflicts, it will most likely increase the current administration's chance of reelection if they engage in military conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Alastair. "Diversionary Foreign Policy in Democratic Systems." International Studies Quarterly 40.1 (1996): 133-153. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600934&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam War (1963–1969)====
During a period of major social movements and widespread domestic issues within the country, the United States intervened in the [[Vietnam war|conflict between North and South Vietnam]] under the policy of [[containment]]. This failed to unite the country. In fact, many did not see the justification in going to war and started a large [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war movement]], yet [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was reelected while the war was taking place.

====Gulf War (2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991)====
After [[Iraq]] invaded [[Kuwait]], the United States deployed troops to the area and were then backed by the U.N. in "[[Operation Desert Storm]]." The conflict was quickly resolved and [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]]'s approval ratings soared, although, this did not lead to his reelection.

====Iraq War (March 20, 2003–December 18, 2011)====
After the attacks on September 11, the U.S. public was devastated and afraid. The economy was also not doing well. [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction]] was presented as immediate threat to the United States. The occupation of Iraq was considered successful and the ongoing conflict led to [[George W. Bush]]'s reelection. As the war continued and the economy worsened, Bush's approval ratings dropped.

===Falklands War (1982)===
The [[National Reorganization Process]], the ruling military government of [[Argentina]], started the [[Falklands War]] to divert public attention from the country's chronic economic problems and the regime's ongoing human rights violations of the [[Dirty War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.me.gov.ar/curriform/publica/sirlin_conv_dictadura.pdf |title=Ministerio de Educación, Ciencia y Tecnología de la Nación |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318112134/http://www.me.gov.ar/curriform/publica/sirlin_conv_dictadura.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia's invasion of Crimea ===
A 2017 study in the journal ''Security Studies'' found that Russia's seizure of Crimea in early 2014 "increased national pride among Russians while support for President Vladimir Putin rose dramatically, and they suggest that the two processes were causally linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theiler|first=Tobias|date=2017-10-24|title=The Microfoundations of Diversionary Conflict|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09636412.2017.1386941|journal=Security Studies|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–26|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1386941|issn=0963-6412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on International Relation Approaches ==
'''Challenges to Realism and Liberalism'''

The focus of the Diversionary War theory on individual state actors and their domestic situations as causes for war challenges the basis of major approaches to International Relations. Many of these International Relation theories used by scholars, such as [[liberalism]] and [[Political realism|realism]], focus on states as the main actors in the international system. Technically, this is referred to as using the interstate level of analysis. These scholars attribute the motives and actions of states to the states themselves, instead of the decision makers inside their governments.&lt;ref&gt;Mowle, Thomas S. "Worldviews in Foreign Policy: Realism Liberalism, and External Conflict." Political Psychology 24.3 (2003): 561-592. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3792326 &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the use of diversionary foreign policy suggests that factors inside of a state, such as domestic disputes and economic lows, have as much of an impact on [[foreign policy]] as national interests. As a result, examinations of the use of diversionary wars shift the study of International Relations away from the interstate level of analysis, toward the domestic level of analysis, and even the individual level of analysis &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Clifton, Diana Richards, Valerie Schwebach, Rick Wilson, and Garry Young. "Good Times, Bad Times, and the Diversionary Use of Force: A Tale of Some Not-So-Free Agents." The Journal of Conflict Resolution 37.3 (1993): 504-535. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/174266 &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many critics of realism use examples of the use of diversionary wars as a means to discredit the theory. &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Clifton. "Domestic Support and Diversionary External Conflict in Great Britain, 1950- 1992." The Journal of Politics 61.3 (1999): 799-814. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2647829 &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern approaches to realism, such as neoclassical realism, regard domestic politics as a crucial variable in foreign policy. This means the diversionary foreign policy thesis does in fact fit within the neoclassical realist framework.  

== Criticisms and Problems with the Theory ==
As with most theories there are disagreements among experts regarding diversionary wars. Diversionary foreign policy is supported by anecdotal evidence because it is hard to prove a theory in international relations quantitatively. When quantitative or empirical tests are attempted, the results are fairly ambiguous and there is not enough consistency among various findings to establish a definitive conclusion &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Clifton. "Domestic Support and Diversionary External Conflict in Great Britain, 1950-1992." The Journal of Politics 61.3 (1999): 799-814. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2647829 &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
This creates a discrepancy between the theoretical and historical text and the empirical evidence.&lt;ref name="Meernik, James 1996 pp. 573-590"&gt;Meernik, James. The Myth of the Diversionary Use of Force by American Presidents. Political Research Quarterly, Vol. 49, No. 3 (Sep., 1996), pp. 573-590 Sage Publications, Inc. on behalf of the University of Utah&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a good amount of criticism arises.

To begin with, there is an opposing theory that argues a state leader has the most leverage when citizens are content with domestic policy and he has high public approval ratings. It is then assumed that leaders are most likely to engage in international conflicts when the domestic approval is highest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, some analysts argue that the entire basis for the argument, the idea that a foreign enemy brings a country together, is not as well founded as it originally seems. This idea relies heavily on sociological studies that focus on the cohesion of small groups. Problems arise when theorists try to apply this to a large group such as a nation state, which is composed of many smaller groups. In fact, there are examples of external conflict leading to more unrest between domestic groups. For example, [[World War I]] led to internal problems in Russia, eventually culminating in the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Clifton. "Domestic Support and Diversionary External Conflict in Great Britain, 1950- 1992." The Journal of Politics 61.3 (1999): 799-814. JSTOR. American University. 20 Oct. 2008. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2647829 &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some also argue that a government cannot just incite an international conflict whenever they wish. Although there are always conflicts going on among the international community, not all are compelling enough to justify the use of force to the public and the government may even be accused of overreacting to a situation.&lt;ref name="Meernik, James 1996 pp. 573-590"/&gt;

It has since expanded both the genres it screens and the activities it sponsors.

==History==
Doc Films began in 1932 as the Documentary Film Group, as the students involved collected money to foot the bill for screening documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The film snob's dictionary: an essential lexicon of filmological knowledge | last = Kamp | first = David |author2=Lawrence Levi | publisher = Broadway Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7679-1876-2 | page = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Educational Film Library Association, American Film Center. "The group first pooled funds informally to screen documentaries."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, it officially became the International House Documentary Film Group",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://docfilms.uchicago.edu/dev/about/ | title = About Doc Films | publisher = University of Chicago | accessdate = 2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1950, when an auditorium was in use for screening films, was already being hailed as "probably the oldest U.S. film society" by ''Film News''.&lt;ref name=FilmNews/&gt;

==Activities==
As the student organizers realized that they could not sustain the organization on documentaries alone, they expanded to incorporate [[Fictional film|fictional]] and [[experimental film]]s. While the University's classes are in session, Doc Films hosts nightly screenings of films selected from one of these categories at Max Palevsky Cinema, located in [[Ida Noyes Hall]]. Doc's screening selection is eclectic. Each quarter of the academic year, students and members of the public propose series of ten films that are somehow related to each other (filmmaker, actor, language, genre, era, theme, etc.). The Programming Committee, which consists of any interested students or members of the public, then chooses among these proposals to schedule a different series for each weeknight (Sunday through Friday).  Recent films, normally delayed one quarter from their nationwide release date, are shown on weekends. Occasionally, Doc screens films which have not yet been released to the general public in the area, including ''[[The Rules of the Game]]'' and ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. The goings on of the theater are also completely run by volunteers, being students or interested members of the community. These volunteers collect tickets, present films, and project film.

Other events include showings of student films and conversations with faculty and professionals connected to the film industry. It has hosted a number of film directors, including [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Woody Allen]] and [[John Ford]].

'''FV ''Ekawat Nava 5''''' was a hijacked [[Kiribati]]-flagged, [[Thailand|Tha]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;i-owned deep sea fishing trawler that was sunk by {{ship|INS|Tabar|F44}} of the [[Indian Navy]] on 18 November 2008.&lt;ref name=ie-thaifish&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Indian-Navy-sank-our-vessel--14-crew-lost--says-Thai-fishing-firm/390675|title=Indian Navy sank our vessel, says Thai fishing firm|work=The Indian Express|date=26 November 2008|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trawler sank when a fire broke out on the vessel after ''INS Tabar'' retaliated to being fired upon by pirates on board. All but one crew member of the trawler were believed killed.

==Accounts of the incident==
{{Campaignbox Piracy in Somalia}}
The ''Ekawat Nava 5'' had a crew of 15 Thais and one Cambodian. It was travelling from Oman to Yemen when it was hijacked on 18 November 2008.&lt;ref name=ie-thaifish/&gt;

On the evening of 18 November, ''INS Tabar'' was on patrol {{convert|285|nmi|km}} southwest of [[Salalah]], [[Oman]] (near {{coord|14|17.15|N|50|15.7|E|type:landmark}}), when it spotted the hijacked trawler.&lt;ref name=bbc-thaitrawler&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7749245.stm|title=Indian navy 'sank Thai trawler'|publisher=BBC News|date=25 November 2008|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was identified by the frigate as a pirate mother ship, as it had two speed boats in tow and men armed with [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s (RPG) and assault rifles on its deck. The frigate ordered the trawler to be boarded for inspection. Upon being refused and threatened by the pirates, the frigate continued to follow the trawler.

The official account from the Indian Navy states that the pirates fired at the frigate with an RPG. The frigate fired back in retaliation. Explosions were later heard on board the trawler, possibly due to ammunition or fuel stored on its deck. The trawler sank as a result of the fire.&lt;ref name=bbc-thaitrawler/&gt;&lt;ref name=et-mothership&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-11-20/news/28479128_1_pirate-ins-tabar-aden|title=INS Tabar sinks pirate mother ship|work=The Economic Times|date=20 November 2008|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Navy reported that following the fire on board the vessel, it spotted only the two speed boats fleeing from the scene. It pursued the boats and found one abandoned. It lost track of the other boat in the darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Indian navy sinks suspected pirate "mother" ship |author=Sam Dolnick| agency = Agence France-Presse | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gB7YMEDuCwwY9ncDOtPAkEI4-H2wD94I759G0 | date=19 November 2008 | accessdate=19 November 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An account of the incident narrated by the Thai representative of its owner, Sirichai Fisheries, based on information provided by a surviving Thai crew member, states that Somali pirates had boarded and just taken control of the trawler when ''INS Tabar'' arrived on the scene. The crew member's account stated that the trawler had not been used as a pirate mother ship.&lt;ref name=ie-thaifish/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-thaitrawler/&gt;&lt;ref name=toi-foil&gt;{{cite news | title=Indian navy foils another attack by Somali pirates |work = The Times of India | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-19/india/27900984_1_somali-pirates-mother-vessel-ins-tabar | date=18 November 2008 | accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the original crew members of the trawler, the only survivor was picked up by a passing merchant vessel, one was later confirmed dead, while 14 others were reported missing by the owner. The crew of ''INS Tabar'' reported seeing only the two motor boats fleeing from the scene of the incident in the darkness. They did not spot any of the original crew of the trawler. The fate of the remaining crew was unknown.&lt;ref name=yahoo-hijack&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081119/ap_on_re_as/piracy |title=Somali pirates hijack Thai fishing boat, 16 crew |last=Dolnick |first=Sam |date=19 November 2008 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=20 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201101021/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081119/ap_on_re_as/piracy |archivedate=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An account of the incident from the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]], may have originally stated that the Indian Navy captured some of the pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Daily Press Briefing |author=Sean McCormack |publisher=US Dept. of State |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2008/nov/112068.htm |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210144441/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2008/nov/112068.htm |archivedate=10 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was however not confirmed by the Indian Navy.

== Background ==
30 participants, half men and half women, were expected to compete on a remote Siberian island in the [[Ob River]] for a 100 million rouble ($1.7 million) prize on a nine month survival mission.
All contestants were said to have signed death waivers and agreed not to hold the organisers accountable for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siberian-real-life-hunger-games-will-not-stop-rape-murder-fight-1-7m-prize-1611060|title=Siberian real-life Hunger Games will 'not stop' rape or murder in fight for $1.7m prize|last=Taylor|first=Alex|date=2017-03-11|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We will refuse any claim of participants even if they were to be killed or raped. We will have nothing to do with this. This will be spelled out in a document to be signed by the participant before the start of the show.
We will not intervene into relations between participants nor monitor their sexual life either, and our cameras will not be able to follow every move in every corner of the island.|author=[[Yevgeny Pyatkovsky]], executive producer}}

However, [[Snopes]] found that 'Despite multiple misleading headlines, the waiver described by news outlets explicitly stated that contestants on the show would be obliged to "obey the laws of the Russian Federation".'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/russian-reality-show-game2-winter-allows-rape-murder/|title=Russian Reality Show ‘Game2: Winter’ Allows Rape, Murder?

The '''Hamburg State Opera''' (in German: '''Hamburgische Staatsoper''') is a Germany [[opera]] company based in Hamburg.  Its theatre is located near the square of [[Gänsemarkt]].  Since 2015, the current ''Intendant'' of the company is [[Georges Delnon]], and the current ''Generalmusikdirektor'' of the company is [[Kent Nagano]].

== History == 
{{See also|Opera in German}} 
Opera in Hamburg dates to 2 January [[1678 in music|1678]] when the [[Oper am Gänsemarkt]] was inaugurated with a performance of a biblical Singspiel by Johann Theile. It was not a court theatre but the first public opera house in Germany established by the art-loving citizens of Hamburg, a prosperous member of the [[Hanseatic League]].

The Hamburg ''Bürgeroper'' resisted the dominance of the Italianate style and rapidly became the leading musical center of the German Baroque. In 1703, [[George Friedrich Handel]] was engaged as violinist and harpsichordist and performances of his operas were not long in appearing. In 1705, Hamburg gave the world première of his opera ''[[Handel's lost Hamburg operas|Nero]]''.

In 1721, [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], a central figure of the German Baroque, joined the Hamburg Opera, and in subsequent years [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] and various Italian companies were among the guests.

[[File:Hamburg Stadttheater um 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The same building, redecorated in 1890, destroyed in 1943]]
To replace the aging wooden structure, the first stone was laid on 18 May 1826 for the ''Stadt-Theater'' on the present-day site of the Hamburg State Opera. The new theater, with seating for 2,800 guest, was inaugurated less than a year later with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] incidental music to ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]''.

In 1873, both the exterior and interior of the structure were renovated in the reigning "[[Gründerzeit]]" style of the time, and again in 1891, when electric lighting was introduced.

Under the direction of Bernhard Pollini, the house mounted its first complete ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring Cycle]]'' in 1879. In 1883, the year of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s death, a cycle comprising nine of his operas commenced. The musical directors [[Hans von Bülow]] (from 1887 to 1890) and [[Gustav Mahler]] (from 1891 to 1897) also contributed to the fame of the opera house.

In the beginning of the 20th century, opera was an important part of the theatre's repertoire; among the 321 performances during the 1907–08 season, 282 were performances of opera. The Stadt-Theater performed not only established repertoire but also new works, such as [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''[[Sancta Susanna]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Soldier's Tale]]'', [[Ernst Krenek]]'s ''[[Jonny spielt auf]]'', and [[Leoš Janáček]]'s ''[[Jenůfa]]''. [[Ferruccio Busoni]]'s ''[[Die Brautwahl]]'' (1912) and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]'s ''[[Die tote Stadt]]'' (1920) both had their world premieres in Hamburg. In the 1930s, after Hitler came to power, the opera house was renamed ''Hamburgische Staatsoper''.

On the night of 2 August 1943, both the auditorium and its neighbouring buildings were destroyed during air raids by fire-bombing; a low-flying airplane dropped several petrol and phosphorus containers on to the middle of the roof of the auditorium, turning it into a conflagration.

[[File:Hamburg Staatsoper Zuschauerraum 03.jpg|thumbnail|Current interior]]
The current Staatsoper opened on 15 October 1955 with Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]''. Hamburg continued to devote itself to new works, such as [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''[[Der Prinz von Homburg (opera)|The Prince of Homburg]]'' (1960), Stravinsky's ''The Flood'' (1963), [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s ''[[Help, Help, the Globolinks!]]'' (1968), and [[Mauricio Kagel]]'s ''Staatstheater'' (1971).

In 1967, under the direction of Joachim Hess, the Hamburg State Opera became the first company to broadcasts its operas in color on television, beginning with ''Die Hochzeit des Figaro'' (a German translation of ''[[Le Nozze di Figaro]]'').  Ten of these television productions have been released on DVD by [[ArtHaus Musik]] as ''Cult Opera of the 1970s'', as well as separately.  All of these were performed in German regardless of the original language (six were written in German, one in French, two in English, and one in Italian).

More recently, Hamburg gave the world premières of [[Wolfgang Rihm]]'s ''[[Die Eroberung von Mexico]]'' (1992) and [[Helmut Lachenmann]]'s ''Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern'' (1997), for which it received much international acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Herbort |first=Heinz Josef |date=14 February 1992 |title=Dieser Schrei ist ein Traum  |trans-title=This Scream is a Dream |url=http://www.zeit.de/1992/08/dieser-schrei-ist-ein-traum |work=[[Die Zeit]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Umbach |first=Klaus |date=27 January 1997 |title=Qualm vom Quälgeist |trans-title=Smoke from a tormenting spirit |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-8652148.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has won the "[[Opera house of the year|Opera House of the Year]]" award by the German magazine Opernwelt in 1997 and in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |trans-title=Hamburg is "Opera House of the Year", new project by Metzmacher / Konwitschny |date=23 September 2005 |title=Hamburg ist "Opernhaus des Jahres", neues Projekt von Metzmacher/Konwitschny |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article166450/Hamburg-ist-Opernhaus-des-Jahres-neues-Projekt-von-Metzmacher-Konwitschny.html |location=Hamburg |publisher=[[Die Welt]] |agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] |access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Herbie'''" was an [[American elm]] tree located in  [[Yarmouth, Maine]]. It stood by present-day East Main Street ([[Maine State Route 88|State Route 88]]), at its intersection with Yankee Drive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjcme.edu/magazine/summer07/elm.php "Will elm trees make their way back?" - St. ''Joseph's College Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; between 1793 and January 19, 2010.

"What are you going to do to Herbie? Don't cut Herbie!" they cried, and the name stuck.

A plaque on its trunk stated:

On May 1, 1834, the town gave Herbie some company by planting rows of elm trees along East Elm Street. From 1957 onward, however, most of them succumbed to [[Dutch elm disease]].&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; As of 2003, only twenty of Yarmouth's original 739 elms had survived.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[http://www.americanprofile.com/heroes/article/2967.html "Champion of Trees" - American Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212014413/http://www.americanprofile.com/heroes/article/2967.html |date=2011-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After battling fifteen bouts of Dutch elm disease, in 2007, stripes appeared under the tree's bark, indicating a worsening condition.&lt;ref name="Boston.com"/&gt; In August 2009, it was revealed that Herbie would be cut down on January 18 and 19, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yarmouth.me.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={3BC710CA-C840-417A-9B74-A684B5565116} "The Herbie Project" - Town of Yarmouth's website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PPH"/&gt; at a cost of $20,000.&lt;ref name="Boston.com"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2009/12/27/when_this_tree_falls_he_will_feel_it/?page=2 "When this tree falls, he will feel it"] - Boston.com, December 27 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, the plaque was removed from its trunk and replaced with a laminated version, and before the end of the year, "The Herbie Project" fund-raising campaign was set up to raise money to care for and plant other trees in the town.&lt;ref name="Boston.com"/&gt; After the tree's demise, local [[woodworker]]s used its wood to make products which will be auctioned off to raise money for the trust.&lt;ref name="Boston.com"/&gt;

A snowstorm during the night of January 17–18, 2010 postponed the removal. The tree was removed on January 19. A preliminary count of the tree's rings, done on site, revealed its age to be at least 212 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/story.php?id=310050&amp;ac=PHnws "Farewell to Herbie and a 'beautiful relationship'"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'', January 19 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, however, the official count showed it to be 217. The stump was removed over the weekend of May 29 and 30.

A section of the trunk's base was on show at the 2010 [[Yarmouth Clam Festival]]. It is now on permanent display outside Yarmouth town hall, on Cleaves Street, a project of the local [[Eagle Scouts]].

Frank Knight, the town's former "tree warden", died at the age of 103 on May 14, 2012.

'''Hulwan''' ({{lang-fa|حلوان}}) was an ancient town on the [[Zagros Mountains]] in western [[Iran]], located on the entrance of the Paytak Pass, nowadays identified with the village of [[Sarpol-e Zahab]].

== History ==
Later Arab tradition, as recorded by [[al-Tabari]], considered the town a [[Sasanian]] foundation dating to [[Kavadh I]] ([[reign]]ed 488–496, 498–531), but it is far more ancient: it was known since [[Assyria]]n times as '''Khalmanu''', when it lay on the border between [[Babylonia]] and [[Media (region)|Media]].{{sfn|Lockhart|1986|pp=571–572}} To the [[Seleucids]], it was known as '''Chala''' ({{lang-el|Χάλα}}) and was the capital of the district of '''Chalonitis''' (Χαλωνῖτις).{{sfn|Lockhart|1986|pp=571–572}}{{sfn|Huart|2013|p=10}}&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{Cite DGRG|title=Chala|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:id=chala-geo}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], the name derives from the settlement of Greek captives from [[Boeotia]] by [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], who founded the town of Celonae or Kelonai (Κέλωναι).&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Under the Sasanian Empire, the district of Hulwan was called '''[Khusraw] Shad Peroz''' ("the joy of Khusraw the victorious"), and the city itself probably '''Peroz Kavad''' ("victorious Kavad"). After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], the words were [[Arabicized]] and became known as: '''[Khusraw] Shadh Firuz''' and '''Firuz Qubadh'''. Although like the rest of Media it belonged to the quarter (''[[Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr#Kusts of Eranshahr|kust]]'') of the North, under [[Khosrau II]] (r. 590–628) it was included in the quarter of the West, along with [[Mesopotamia]], as the Sasanian rulers began to use the Zagros Mountains as a summer retreat away from the capital of [[Ctesiphon]] on the Mesopotamian plain.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=141}} 

After the [[Battle of Qadisiyya]] in 636, the last Sasanian ruler, [[Yazdegerd III]] (r. 632–651), took refuge in Hulwan for a while during his flight from Ctesiphon.{{sfn|Lockhart|1986|pp=571–572}}{{sfn|Zarrinkub|1975|pp=12–13}} After another heavy defeat at the [[Battle of Jalula]] in 637, Yazdegerd left Hulwan for the eastern provinces of his realm,{{sfn|Zarrinkub|1975|p=13}}{{sfn|Morony|2005|pp=192–193}} and the town fell into the hands of the pursuing Arabs under Jarir ibn Abdallah Bajali in 640.{{sfn|Zarrinkub|1975|p=19}} In the early 640s, the town was of strategic importance as a frontier post between the Mesopotamian lowlands and the still Sasanian-controlled [[Iranian plateau]], and was garrisoned by troops, including Persian defectors (the ''Khamra''), who were settled there under the [[Rashidun]] caliphs.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=141}} 

In the early Islamic period, until the 10th century, the town is described "as a flourishing town in a fertile district producing much fruit" (L. Lockhart).{{sfn|Lockhart|1986|pp=571–572}} It was situated on the [[Khurasan Road]], and was the first town of the [[Jibal]] province to be met travelling eastwards from [[Baghdad]].{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=62–63, 191, 227–228}} Nevertheless, as in Sasanian times, it was fiscally tied to the Mesopotamian lowlands (the ''[[Sawad]]'').{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=142}} Under [[Mu'awiya I]] (r. 661–680) it became the capital of western Jibal (''[[Mah al-Kufa]]'').{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=142}} 

According to the 10th-century traveller [[Ibn Hawqal]], the town was half the size of [[Dinavar]], and its houses were built of both stone and bricks. Though the climate was hot, dates, pomegranates and figs grew abundantly. According to the 10th-century ''[[hudud al-'alam]]'' the town's figs were dried and widely exported, while [[al-Muqaddasi]] adds that the town was surrounded by a wall with eight gates, and included, alongside a mosque, a [[Jews|Jewish]] synagogue.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=191}}

The town was also a [[Hulwan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|metropolitan province]] of the [[Church of the East]] between the 8th and 12th centuries.

Around the turn of the 11th century, the town was governed by the semi-independent [[Annazid]] dynasty, until they were expelled by the [[Kakuyids]].{{sfn|Lockhart|1986|pp=571–572}}{{sfn|Busse|1975|pp=297–298}} It was taken and burned by the [[Seljuq Turks]] in 1046, while an earthquake in 1049 completed the town's destruction. Although rebuilt, it never recovered its former prosperity, and is now the small village of [[Sarpol-e Zahab]].{{sfn|Lockhart|1986|pp=571–572}}

==Biography==

Imtiaz Ahmed was born in [[Gujranwala]], [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in [[British Indian Empire|India]] on 4 June 1935, according to the Indian author, P.C. Joshi.{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name="Anmol Publications Pvt. Limited, Joshi" /&gt; After his [[Matriculation in Pakistan|matriculation]], he joined the [[Pakistan Army]] and entered in the [[Pakistan Military Academy]] in [[Kakul]], and decided to attend the [[Military College of Engineering (Pakistan)|Military College of Engineering]] in [[Risalpur]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]].{{rp|131}}&lt;ref name="National Defence University press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad|first1=Imtiaz|title=National Defence College Journal|date=2004|publisher=National Defence University press|accessdate=15 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[civil engineering]], and earned [[Commissioned officer|commission]] as [[Second lieutenant|2nd-Lt.]] in the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1960.{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name="Anmol Publications Pvt. Limited, Joshi" /&gt;{{rp|131}}&lt;ref name="National Defence University press"/&gt;

His career is mostly spent in the [[Corps of Engineers, Pakistan Army|Corps of Engineers]], and served on the [[Combat Engineer Vehicle|combat engineering formations]] during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|second war]] with India in 1965 and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|third war]] with India in 1971.{{rp|35–36}}&lt;ref name="Anmol Publications Pvt. Limited, Joshi" /&gt; After 1971, Ahmed was directed to attend the staff course at the [[Command and Staff College]] in [[Quetta]].{{rp|131}}&lt;ref name="National Defence University press"/&gt;

Due to his cunningness and the [[Eye color#green|greenish-eye]] feline colors, Ahmed was famously known by his codename in the ISI as "[[Cat|''billa'']]" (the [[Cat|male cat]]).{{rp|30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Herald|date=1991|publisher=Pakistan Herald Publications.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGi8prOK-oAC&amp;q=billa|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1970s, he joined the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) as an [[Security analysis|security analyst]] and remained associated with the [[Pakistan|country's]] [[Pakistan Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] for many years.{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press, Kiessling" /&gt; In 1979, [[Major]] Ahmed was posted on a [[security detail]] assignment on the [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant]] (KANUPP), involved in running the [[background check]]s and providing covert security to the technicians working on the [[power plant]].&lt;ref name="The News International , Abbasi (2009)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abbasi|first1=Ansar|authorlink1=Ansar Abbasi|title=Brig Imtiaz reveals CIA plots|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/|accessdate=17 November 2017|agency=The News International|publisher=The News International , Abbasi|date=1 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201012027/http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=24241|archivedate=1 February 2010|location=Islamabad|language=en-pk|format=web.archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he became aware of an [[American CIA]] [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] working as an engineer who was trying to seek security details on the commercial nuclear power plant for the [[Nuclear sabotage|sabotage]] purposes.&lt;ref name="The News International , Abbasi (2009)"/&gt;

After thoroughly running the background checks, Ahmad identified the suspected mole and eventually led a [[Operation Rising Sun|sting operation]] that successfully resulted in an arrest and conviction of a local Pakistani CIA agent, declaration of a few undercover CIA agents, and U.S. diplomats at the [[Consulate General of the United States, Karachi|U.S. Consulate General]] in Karachi as ''[[personae non gratae]]'' and their return to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="The News International , Abbasi (2009)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The details and veracity of such assignment has been criticized in the editorial written in [[Dawn (newspaper)|''Dawn'']], whose [[Investigative journalism|investigations]] identified the engineer who was working for the [[Karachi Electric]] (KE) [[electric power transmission]] and had been a prominent member of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], not working for the [[KANUPP|nuclear power plant]] as claimed by Brig. Ahmed.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, Abbasi (2009)" /&gt;

{{Main|Jam Saqi case|Operation Midnight Jackal}}
In 1980, [[Lieutenant-Colonel|Lt-Col.]] Ahmed joined the [[ISI of Pakistan|Joint Counterintelligence Bureau]] (JCIB), mainly working in [[counterintelligence]] management and overseeing the [[Jam Saqi case|anti-communist]] operations in [[Sindh]].{{rp|119–122}}&lt;ref name="Vanguard, Ahmad (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Khaled|title=Pakistan: The State in Crisis|date=2002|publisher=Vanguard|accessdate=18 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, he began investigating the [[Al-Zulfiqar|al-Zulikar]], led by [[Murtaza Bhutto]], after the [[1981 Pakistan International Airlines hijacking|hijacking]] of the [[Pakistan International Airlines|PIA Flight–326]], eventually expanding the spying on the leaders of the [[Movement for Restoration of Democracy]] led by [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1982–85.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, Abbasi (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbasi|first1=Zafar|last2=Editorial|first2=Dawn|title=Only bean-spilling spooks can tell why|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/487888|website=DAWN.COM|publisher=Dawn Newspapers|accessdate=18 November 2017|location=Islamabad, Pakistan|date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983–88, he also monitored the [[Anti-communism|anticommunist]] [[Jam Saqi case|judicial probe]] that implicated the journalists [[Jam Saqi]] and [[Sohail Sangi]], and harboured doubts of [[Mutual fund|foreign funding]] of [[Movement for the Restoration of Democracy]] (MRD) alliance led by [[Benazir Bhutto]].&lt;ref name="The News International, TH Khan (2009)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Tahir Hassan|title=The politics of Brigadier 'Billa'|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/|accessdate=19 November 2017|work=thenews.com.pk|agency=The News International|publisher=Tahir Hassan Khan's report at The News International|date=31 August 2009|archiveurl=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:EmIrq0D5F7MJ:https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/194088-the-politics-of-brigadier-billa+&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|archivedate=31 August 2009|location=Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan|language=en-pk|format=webarchives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over this judicial probe, the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]] politicians have leveled accusations on Ahmed's [[Special Security Unit|CI bureau]] in Sindh of ''wrongfully''&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, Abbasi (2009)" /&gt; investigating on the [[Nazeer Abbasi]]'s political ambitions whose [[Death in custody|death resulted in the custody]] of the [[Sindh Police]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, Abbasi (2009)" /&gt;

In 1986–87, [[Colonel|Col.]] Ahmed was appointed as the Director-General [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Intelligence Bureau]] (DGIB) before being posted to take over the directorship of the [[ISI of Pakistan|JCIB]] in [[Islamabad]] when [[Lieutenant-General|Lt-Gen.]] [[General Akhtar Abdur Rahman|Akhtar Abdur Rahman]] became [[:Category:Directors General of Inter-Services Intelligence|DG ISI]].{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiessling|first1=Hein|title=Faith, Unity, Discipline: The Inter-Service-Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849048637|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_cgDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82#v=onepage&amp;q=Imtiaz%20Ahmed%20Brig%20counter-intelligence|accessdate=18 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Brigadier|Brig.]] Ahmed was appointed as director of [[ISI (Pakistan)|Political Wing]] of the [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI]] in [[Islamabad]], managing the country's [[internal security]] and tried uniting the [[Pakistan National Alliance|conservative mass]] against the left-oriented [[Pakistan Peoples Party]].{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sirrs|first1=Owen L.|title=Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate: Covert Action and Internal Operations|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317196082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzGTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT163#v=onepage&amp;q=brigadier%20imtiaz%20ahmed|accessdate=19 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the complaints of [[Naseerullah Babar]], [[Interior Minister of Pakistan|Security Adviser]] at the [[Ministry of Interior (Pakistan)|Interior Ministry]], Brig. Ahmad was rotated back to the [[Corps of Engineers, Pakistan Army|Corps of Engineers]] on a [[construction engineering]] assignment in [[Risalpur]] but his skills on intelligence [[Intelligence analysis management|management]] and [[Extraction (military)|extraction]] was valuable, eventually found a way to secretly serve in the [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Intelligence Bureau]].{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiessling|first1=Hein|title=Faith, Unity, Discipline: The Inter-Service-Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849048637|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_cgDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82#v=onepage&amp;q=brigadier%20imtiaz%20ahmed%20engineers|accessdate=19 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Brig. Imtiaz, in secret conversation with [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Amir Khan (Pakistan Army officer)|Amir Khan]], talked on sponsoring the [[:Category:Pakistani MNAs 1988–90|Members of Parliament]] (MP) belonging to the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] to bring about a [[vote of no-confidence]] movement to remove [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] in order to bring [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|PML(N)]] led by its then-[[President of Pakistan Muslim League (N)|President]] [[Fida Mohammad Khan|Fida Mohammad]] and his chief secretary [[Nawaz Sharif]] in the administration.{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiessling|first1=Hein|title=Faith, Unity, Discipline: The Inter-Service-Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849048637|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_cgDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82#v=onepage&amp;q=Imtiaz%20Ahmed%20benazir|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|146}}&lt;ref name="Routledge.

Both [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brig.]] Ahmed and [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Amir Khan (Pakistan Army officer)|Amir Khan]] were [[Military discharge|discharged]] from their [[Commissioned officer|military commission]] in 1989, and the inquiry remains classified since it is still unclear who the real culprit behind the plot was or was it under the instructions of the DG ISI [[Shamsur Rahman Kallu]].{{rp|146}}&lt;ref name="Routledge.

When the [[Pakistani general election, 1990|general elections]] were held in [[1990 in Pakistan|1990]], which saw [[Nawaz Sharif]] forming the [[First Sharif ministry|first government]], Imtiaz Ahmed was re-appointed as the [[:Category:Directors General of the Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Director-General]] of the [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Intelligence Bureau]] (DGIB).{{rp|124}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sehgal|first1=Ikram ul-Majeed|title=Defence Journal|date=2005|publisher=Ikram ul-Majeed Sehgal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qa3fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=+Imtiaz|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he aided in launching of the [[Operation Clean-up|armed operation]] to cleanse the Karachi of "anti-social" elements, and ultimately targeting the [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement|MQM]] once the [[Jinnahpur|conspiracy]] to partitioned Karachi from [[Sindh]] was unearthed.{{rp|75}}&lt;ref name="Anthem Press, Hoodbhoy (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoodbhoy|first1=Nafisa|title=Aboard the Democracy Train: A Journey Through Pakistan's Last Decade of Democracy|date=2011|publisher=Anthem Press|location=Karachi, Pakistan|isbn=9780857289063|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEnHdnvCW4MC&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Brigadier%20Imtiaz%20%20clean%20up|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en|format=google books|chapter={{small|News is what the rulers wants to hide}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

After the resignations of the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] Sharif and [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]], Ahmed resigned from the directorship of the [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Intelligence Bureau]], which he termed his resignation as "on principle" on 19 April 1992.{{rp|29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=JPRS Report: Near East &amp; South Asia|date=1993|publisher=Foreign Broadcast Information Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ui6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Brigadier+Imtiaz+DG+IB|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and allegations==

The [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) led by [[Benazir Bhutto]] secured the [[Plurality voting|plurality]] after the [[Pakistani general election, 1993|general elections]] held in [[1993 in Pakistan|1993]], and [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] opened the investigation and inquiry when authorizing the [[arrest warrant]]s of Imtiaz Ahmed on charges of indulging in illegal activities in 1994.{{rp|159–160}}&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Raman (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raman|first1=B.|title=Intelligence: Past, Present &amp; Future|date=2002|publisher=Lancer Publishers|isbn=9788170622222|pages=400|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTf1vRYx_U4C&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q=Brigadier%20Imtiaz%20arrested|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en|format=google books|chapter={{small|Financial and Narcotics Intelligence}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case against him was marked on the political motives, and he was later released due to lack of evidences.{{rp|159–160}}&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Raman (2002)"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}&lt;ref name="Gyan Publishing House (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|title=World in Transition.|date=2003|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788178352657|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmNTY6smsUEC&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=Brigadier%20Imtiaz%20arrested|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|turnover of the government]] in 1999 by General [[Pervez Musharraf]], the inquiries led by the [[National Accountability Bureau]] (NAB) indicted him on large-scale corruption and misappropriation of funds while serving as the Director of IB, eventually found him guilty in 2001.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan Bureau (2001)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff writer|first1=staff|title=Former Pakistan intelligence chief sentenced|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1466874.stm|accessdate=20 November 2017|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC Pakistan Bureau|date=31 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to sentenced to eight years imprisonment for corruption., released in 2008–09&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan Bureau (2001)"/&gt;

On 21 September 2010, Imtiaz Ahmed was again arrested along with Adnan Khawaja, the former chairman of the [[Oil and Gas Development Company|OGDC]], and was shifted to [[Adiala Jail|Adiala Prison]] where they were earlier arrested from the courtroom.&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brig (R) Imtiaz released on bail - The Express Tribune|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/53930/brig-r-imtiaz-released-on-bail/|accessdate=20 November 2017|work=The Express Tribune|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court bench]] headed by then-[[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]] who heard the NRO implementation case, Ahmed was arrested from the court on orders by Supreme Court during the hearing of a case relating the implementation of National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO).&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune (2010)"/&gt;

In 2009, [[Humayun Akhtar Khan]], the  former [[Commerce Minister of Pakistan|Commerce minister]] and son of Gen. [[Akhtar Abdur Rahman]], had leveled accusations when he reportedly marked: ''Brig.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4571">The '''Kiev uprising of 1068''' was a revolt against Grand Prince [[Iziaslav Yaroslavich]] of Kiev in the aftermath of a [[Kievan Rus’]] defeat at the hands of the [[Cuman people|Cumans]] at [[Battle of the Alta River]] near the city of [[Pereyaslav-Khmelnytskyi|Pereiaslavl]], southeast of Kiev.

The Polovtsy raid of 1068–1069 was only the tribe's second major raid into Rus’ (they had negotiated a treaty with Prince [[Vsevolod Yaroslavich]] of Pereislavl’ (the father of [[Vladimir Monomach]]) in 1055, but the tribesmen broke the treaty and attacked Kievan Rus’ six years later, defeating Vsevolod in battle).  In 1068-1069, the Polovtsy penetrated the earthwork defensive lines built up over the years by Prince [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir Svyatoslavich]] (r. ca. 980–1015) and his son, [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (r. 1019–1054).  They were met by a combined army of Yaroslav’s sons: Grand Prince Iziaslav of Kiev and his brothers, Princes [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Sviatoslav Yaroslavich]] of Chernigov, and Vsevolod, which was defeated and fled back to Kiev in disarray.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, ''Medieval Russia 980-1584'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polovsty continued to raid throughout the area, prompting the Kievans to call on the grand prince to rearm them so they could march out and meet the threat.  Iziaslav refused, prompting the rebellion.  ''The Tale of Bygone Years'' (in Russian ''Povest Vremennikh Let''), a part of ''The Lavrentian Chronicle'', relates what happened next:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kievans who had escaped to their native city held a veche (literally "created a veche") on the marketplace and sent the following communication to the Prince [Iziaslav]: 'The Polovtsy have spread over the country.  O Prince, give us arms and horses, that we may offer them combat once more.'  Iziaslav, however, paid no heed to this request.  Then the people began  to murmur against  his general (voevoda) Konstantin.  From the place of the assembly, they mounted the hill and arrived before the house of Konstantin.&lt;ref&gt;''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'' (''Povest Vremennikh Let''), in ''Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei'', Vol. 1, cols. 170-1; see also Boris D. Grekov, ''Kiev Rus'', trans. by Y. Sdobnikov (Moscow, Foreign Language Publishing House. 1959), 656-7; Martin, ''Medieval Russia'', 35, 49; Mikhail Tikhomirov, ''The Towns of Ancient Rus'', trans. by Y. Sdobnikov (Moscow, Foreign Language Publishing House. 1959), 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Kievan mob ransacked Konstantin's house, apparently blaming him for the defeat. They then drove out Iziaslav and freed Prince [[Vseslav of Polotsk]], who had been imprisoned earlier by Iziaslav, Vsevolod, and Sviatoslav, and placed him on the Kievan throne in hopes that he could stop the Polovtsy. Iziaslav, for his part, fled to [[Boleslaus II of Poland|Boleslaw II]] of Poland, who supported him with arms with which he returned to Kiev the following May (1069) and took back the throne.

In Iziaslav's absence, Prince Sviatoslav managed to defeat a much larger Polovetsian army on November 1, 1068 and stem the tide of Polovetsian raids. A small skirmish in 1071 was the only disturbance by the Polovtsy for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Medieval Russia, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the Battle of Alta River was a disgrace for Kievan Rus' and led briefly to the ouster of the grand prince, Sviatoslav's victory the following year relieved the Polovtsy threat to Kiev and Chernigov for a considerable period and allowed Iziaslav the breathing space necessary to reclaim the throne.

The uprising has been seen by a number of Russian and Soviet historians as proof of the power of the [[veche]], which was rather more important in the northwestern Rus' cities of [[Novgorod the Great]] and [[Pskov]] (and at a later period) and less important in the south, but showed itself to be important here in displacing a Kievan grand prince and bringing in another one.  The ''veche'', usually seen as a public assembly and often quite institutionalized in the literature, would, however, appear in this instance to be little more than an angry mob which sacked the ''voevoda's'' house and drove out the prince.  It does not appear to be anything like a parliament or legislature as it has often been portrayed in the traditional historiography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12127">[[File:WeaponsInspector.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A UN weapons inspector in Iraq]]

The '''lead-up to the Iraq War''' (i.e., the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and [[Iraq War|subsequent hostilities]]) began with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687]] and subsequent [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission|UN weapons inspectors inside Iraq]]. This period also saw low-level hostilities between Iraq and the United States-led coalition from 1991-2003.

==1991–2000: UN inspectors, no-fly zones, and Iraqi opposition groups==
Following the 1991 [[Gulf War]], as part of the ceasefire agreement, the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687]] mandated that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi chemical, biological, nuclear, and long range missile programs]] be halted and all such weapons destroyed under [[United Nations Special Commission]] control. [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission|The UN weapons inspectors inside Iraq]] were able to verify the destruction of a large amount of WMD-material, but substantial issues remained unresolved in 1998 when the inspectors left Iraq due to then current UNSCOM head [[Richard Butler (diplomat)|Richard Butler]]'s belief that U.S. and UK military action was imminent. Shortly after the inspectors withdrew, the U.S. and UK launched a [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|four-day bombing campaign in Iraq]]. Also, during this period the [[U.S. Congress]] and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] issued a [[Iraq Liberation Act|resolution calling for regime change in Iraq.]]    
   
In addition to the UN inspections, the U.S. and UK (along with France until 1998) engaged in a low-level conflict with Iraq by enforcing non-UN mandated northern and southern [[Iraqi no-fly zones]]. These were known as [[Operation Provide Comfort|Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Provide Comfort II]] then followed by [[Operation Northern Watch]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in the north and [[Operation Southern Watch]] in the south, and were seen by the Iraqi government as an infringement of Iraq's [[sovereignty]]. These overflights intensified one year before the Iraq war began when the U.S. initiated [[Operation Southern Focus]] in order to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq before the invasion.

===Iraqi expatriate opposition groups===
Following the 1991 Gulf War, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] signed a presidential finding directing the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to create conditions for Hussein's removal from power in May 1991. Coordinating anti-Saddam groups was an important element of this strategy and the [[Iraqi National Congress]] (INC), led by [[Ahmed Chalabi]], was the main group tasked with this purpose. The name INC was reportedly coined by [[public relations]] expert [[John Rendon]] (of the [[Rendon Group]] agency) and the group received millions in covert funding in the 1990s, and then about $8 million a year in overt funding after the passage of the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] in 1998. Another opposition group was the [[Iraqi National Accord]] which continues to have influence in the current Iraqi government through its leader [[Ayad Allawi]].

===Presidential involvement===
In late April 1993, the United States asserted that Saddam Hussein had attempted to have former President George H. W. Bush assassinated during a visit to Kuwait on April 14–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/1000.html |title=How Do We Know that Iraq Tried to Assassinate President George H.W. Bush? |publisher=Hnn.us |author=FBI Study |accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, as per order of then-President Clinton, U.S. warships stationed in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea [[Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (June 1993)|launched a cruise missile attack]] at the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] building in downtown [[Baghdad]] in response to Iraq's plot to assassinate former President George H. W. Bush. Clinton briefed President-elect [[George W. Bush]] in December 2000, expressing his regret that people he regarded as the world's two most dangerous individuals, including Hussein, were still alive and free. He warned Bush that Hussein will "cause you a world of problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Chollet, Derek and James Goldgeier |title = America Between the Wars: From 11/9 to 9/11; The Misunderstood Years Between the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the Start of the War on Terror | publisher = Public Affairs, Perseus Books Group | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Paul O'Neill (Secretary of the Treasury)|Paul O'Neill]] said that Bush's first two [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meetings included a discussion of invading Iraq. He was given briefing materials entitled "Plan for post-Saddam Iraq," which envisioned peacekeeping troops, war crimes tribunals, and divvying up Iraq's oil wealth. A Pentagon document dated March 5, 2001 was titled "Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield contracts," and included a map of potential areas for exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rebecca|first=Leung|title=Bush Sought 'Way' To Invade Iraq?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-592330.html|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=60 Minutes|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, [[Colin Powell]] wrote Bush to inform him that [[Tony Blair]] was ready to support the invasion of Iraq, and would present further advice regarding "strategic, tactical, and public affairs lines" during Blair's forthcoming visit to [[Crawford, Texas|Crawford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3277402/Smoking-gun-emails-reveal-Blair-s-deal-blood-George-Bush-Iraq-war-forged-YEAR-invasion-started.html | title=Smoking gun emails reveal Blair's 'deal in blood' with George Bush over Iraq war was forged a YEAR before the invasion had even started | accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIA SAD Teams==
{{main|Operation Viking Hammer}}
The CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) teams were the first U.S. forces to enter Iraq in July 2002, prior to the U.S. Invasion. Once on the ground, they prepared for the subsequent arrival of U.S. Army Special Forces to organize the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]]. This joint team (called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element (NILE)) &lt;ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004"&gt;''Plan of Attack'', Bob Woodward, Simon and Schuster, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; combined to defeat [[Ansar al-Islam]], an ally of Al Qaeda, in the North East corner of Iraq. This battle was for control of a territory that was occupied by [[Ansar al-Islam]] and was executed prior to the invasion. It was carried out by Paramilitary Operations Officers from SAD and the Army's [[10th Special Forces Group (United States)|10th Special Forces Group]]. This battle was a significant defeat of a key terrorist organization and the uncovering of a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]] facility at Sargat.&lt;ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004"/&gt; Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war.&lt;ref name="Tucker 2008"&gt;{{cite book |title=Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq |first1=Mike |last1=Tucker |first2=Charles |last2=Faddis  |year=2008 |publisher=[[The Lyons Press]] |isbn=978-1-59921-366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wamu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wamu.org/audio/dr/08/10/r2081007-22101.asx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930081326/http://wamu.org/audio/dr/08/10/r2081007-22101.asx |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }} An interview on public radio with the author&lt;/ref&gt;

SAD teams also conducted missions behind enemy lines to identify leadership targets.  These missions led to the initial strikes against [[Saddam Hussein]] and his Generals. Although the strike against Saddam was unsuccessful in killing him, it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces. Other strikes against his Generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to, and maneuver against the U.S. led invasion force.&lt;ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Behind lines, an unseen war, Faye Bowers, Christian Science Monitor, April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers into surrendering their units once the fighting started.&lt;ref name="Tucker 2008" /&gt;

[[Turkey]] refused to allow the U.S. Army entry into Northern Iraq. Therefore, joint SAD and Army Special forces teams and the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] were the entire Northern force against Saddam. They managed to keep Saddam's Army in place rather than moving the northern army to contest the U.S. led coalition force coming from the south. The efforts of the Kurds, SAD and 10th Special Forces Group with the Kurds likely saved the lives of many US and coalition forces during and after the invasion.&lt;ref name="plan"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Plan of Attack]] |first=Bob |last=Woodward |authorlink=Bob Woodward |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster|Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc]] |isbn=978-0-7432-5547-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As described by Mike Tucker and Charles Faddis in their book entitled, ''"Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War Inside Iraq"'', four of these CIA officers were awarded the Intelligence Star for their heroic actions.&lt;ref name="Tucker 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wamu.org"/&gt;

==Congressional Assessment of the Need for War==

Sen. [[Bob Graham]] chaired the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 2002, when the Congress voted on the Iraq War Resolution.  He first became aware of the significance of Iraq in February 2002, when Gen. Tommy Franks told him the Bush administration had made the decision to begin to de-emphasize Afghanistan in order to get ready for Iraq. In September, the Senate Intelligence Committee met with George Tenet, Director of the CIA, and Graham requested a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq.  Tenet responded by saying "We've never done a National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, including its weapons of mass destruction." and resisted the request to provide one to Congress. Graham insisted "This is the most important decision that we as members of Congress and that the people of America are likely to make in the foreseeable future. We want to have the best understanding of what it is we're about to get involved with." Tenet refused to do a report on the military or occupation phase, but reluctantly agreed to do a NIE on the weapons of mass destruction.  Graham described the Senate Intelligence Committee meeting with Tenet as "the turning point in our attitude towards Tenet and our understanding of how the intelligence community has become so submissive to the desires of the administration. The administration wasn't using intelligence to inform their judgment; they were using intelligence as part of a public relations campaign to justify their judgment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/interviews/graham.html “Frontline interview with Sen. Bob Graham” Jan 31, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress voted to support the war based on the NIE Tenet provided in October 2002. However, the bipartisan "Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Prewar Intelligence" released on July 7, 2004, concluded that the key findings in the 2002 NIE either overstated, or were not supported by, the actual intelligence.  The Senate report also found the US Intelligence Community to suffer from a "broken corporate culture and poor management" that resulted in a NIE that was completely wrong in almost every respect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB129/intro_part1.pdf “Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Prewar Intelligence” July 7, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of a few major corporate collapses==

The ''Heptavium'' concert, representing also the '''[[Live Earth]] concert in [[Rome]]''', took place on 7 July 2007 at the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], the Cathedral of Rome and subject to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Holy See. It was part of a series of high-profile concerts organised by [[Al Gore]] and [[Kevin Wall]], which took place across the globe to raise awareness about climate change. [[Jonas Lauren Norr]] of Ethos Investments was responsible for the collaboration of Live Earth with the Heptavium concert as a producer of the event. The concert was masterminded and written by composer and researcher of philosophy Michael I.D'Alessandra. The concert was officially backed by the Vatican, thus being the Catholic Church's autonomous presence at the [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth]] events.

== Heptavium/Live Earth: The Concert==
[[Image:Michael D'alessandra 3.jpg|thumb|200px|left|M° Michael D'Alessandra]]
The Heptavium/Live Earth event was inaugurated by Paul Cardinal Poupard, who explained the scope and meaning of the evening, a prelude to the ''Cathedralia'' Project, an endeavour of original sacred music between Rome and the USA, conceived and composed by D'Alessandra and planned for the next decade. A reading of a page from St. Augustine's "City of God" followed, mentioning the sacred aspect of earthly nature,  concluded by an intervention on behalf of the Live Earth event by acclaimed film producer Lawrence Bender.

The concert was performed exclusively in two different locations of the Cathedral of Rome: before its Holy Door, and inside the Cathedral, in the central nave. During the first part of the concert, various works for string quartet and grand piano composed by M° Michael D'Alessandra  were performed by the Bernini Quartet, a string ensemble of virtuosos from Rome, and D'Alessandra, a piano virtuoso and organist himself; the performance was shown inside the Church through HD screens placed aside the Church's canopy. 

The second part of the concert, consisting of symphonic and choral sacred music, saw the deployment of the largest orchestra the Church had ever experienced. Performing were the [[London Oratory School Schola]], Michael D'Alessandra, The Rome Philharmonic Orchestra and M°Cristiano Serino. The choir and orchestra performed ''Vexilla Regis'', a variation on Franz Liszt's ''Via Crucis'' conducted by Michael D'Alessandra, connected to  ''Septem postrema verba'', a concerto for choir, orchestra and cello solo written by M°Cristiano Serino conducting it. The last seven words of Jesus Christ on the cross were utilised for the libretto, culminating towards the core of the concert: D'Alessandra's ''Missa Sylvestri II'', a funeral Mass, beginning with an eerie ''Kyrie Eleison'' progressing to a fast-paced ''Sanctus'', through a solemn ''Benedictus'', reminiscent of German baroque progressions and Russian Orthodox melodies, and concluding with an elegiac ''Agnus Dei''. This funeral Mass, regarded as a masterpiece of new sacred music in Vatican cultural circles, was written for the 1000th anniversary of Pope Sylvester II's death (May 12, 1003) and premiered in the year 2003 in the very Cathedral of Rome, where Sylvester II is buried. The last performance, ''Gloria'', a piece endowed with Wagnerian traits uttered a finale in which, D'Alessandra conducting, 140 musicians and singers reached the acme of their performance.

This ceremonial concert coincided with the issuance of the motu proprio, ''Summorum Pontificum'' relating to the traditional Latin Mass, also on 7 July 2007.

==Heptavium/Live Earth in the media==

The concert was broadcast either in full or in part by many television and radio networks. The concert was broadcast in Italy, America, Australia and New Zealand, and a short clip showing D'Alessandra's funeral ''Kyrie Eleison'' was also shown on [[BBC One]] in the UK, along with Live Earth's world feed, thus honouring the British choir performing in Rome, in remembrance of the victims fallen on the terrorist attacks in London on 7 July 2005, a tragedy mentioned also during Card. Poupard's introduction to the event. Articles about the concert also appeared in [[The Tablet]] and [[The Catholic Herald]]. The fact that a performance of original sacred music of such elevated standards connected the "Mother of all Churches" (as the Cathedral of Rome is also called) to an event featuring iconic rock acts like Metallica or The Police, denotes a surprising dynamism of certain Vatican departments, although remaining  conservative, thus representing a promising breakthrough for the dialogue of a sensible Roman Catholic world with secularized modernity, and overall, with contemporary global culture.

==The Heptavium symbolism==
[[Image:Sevensevenseven.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Liber 777]] ''Heptavium'' (literally meaning 'place where seven ways meet') is a Latin neologism conceived by D'Alessandra, who, beside being a musician has an extensive background in Vatican Universities and Institutes as a researcher. This new word aims at condensing in one concept the Arts of the ''trivium'' (grammar, logic, rhetoric)  and ''quadrivium'' (mathematics, geometry, astronomy, music), the body known as the seven Liberal Arts, as taught in the Cathedral schools and Universities during the Middle Ages.
The city of Rome has always been connected to the number seven since its very foundation: built on seven hills, ruled by seven kings, and furthermore enriched by seven churches and by the seven sacraments, the rhythm of Rome and its symbolism has been and is being governed numerically by the number 7 during its pagan imperial rule and since it became the cradle of Christianity. Therefore, ''Heptavium'' may become an esoteric ''nomen secretum'', a secret name for Rome itself, literally the "City where seven ways meet".

These concepts and prerogatives were mentioned during Card. Paul Poupard's introductory speech to the concert, linking the symbolical contents directly to the music performed. Moreover, the ''Heptavium'' concert was performed both outside and inside the Church, and with two different repertoires and styles of music, profane and sacred-symphonic, to stress the transition from the pagan sphere to the one divinely inspired that the city of Rome has been experiencing for  over two millennia.

However, the reason why the date 7 July 2007 was chosen by Pope Benedict XVI as the date for the release of a Motu Proprio related to the traditional Latin Mass remains uncertain, as the date July 7 and even more so, the number 777, both seem to reflect the spirit of gnostic and esoteric numerology more than the Spirit of the Latin Mass canonized by St. Pius V. Undeniably, this number holds its great significance in the Western symbolic tradition; nevertheless, the importance of a Motu Proprio aiming at reintroducing liturgical functions in Latin for the Church of Rome, weighed on D'Alessandra's decision to utilise exclusively Latin for the ''Heptavium'' concert's libretto, stressing ''Heptavium'''s alignment to the symbolical orientation of the current pontificate. This original liturgical music in Latin and a Latin neologism with a concept related to Rome paid homage to the city's Cathedral and seat of the Papal authority, ranking even higher than Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican and any other Roman Catholic church in the world in terms of canonical primacy.

As a resultance of these two occurrences combined, namely: I) the Heptavium/Live Earth concert, II) the promulgation of ''Summorum Pontificum'', 7 July 2007 may from now on be defined as  the ''Heptavium Dies'', the Heptavium Day for the Roman Catholic Church and its future approach to the city of Rome in the contemporary artistic scenario.

The responsibility for investigation was delegated to the [[Dutch Safety Board]] (DSB) and the Dutch-led [[#Criminal investigation|joint investigation team]] (JIT), who concluded that the airliner was downed by a [[Buk missile system|Buk]] [[surface-to-air missile]] launched from pro-Russian [[Novorossiya (confederation)|separatist-controlled territory]] in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="DSB_Final_Report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=MH17 crash report: Dutch investigators confirm Buk missile hit plane – live updates |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/oct/13/mh17-crash-report-ukraine-live-updates |website=the Guardian |accessdate=13 October 2015 |first=Matthew |last=Weaver}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the JIT, the Buk that was used originated from the [[53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]],&lt;ref name="BBC 5.24.18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44235402|work=[[BBC News]]|title=MH17 missile owned by Russian brigade, investigators say|date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 5.24.18"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/24/europe/mh17-plane-netherlands-russia-intl/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|title=Missile that downed MH17 'owned by Russian brigade'|first1=Laura|last1=Smith-Spark|first2=James|last2=Masters|date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash, fired from a field in a rebel-controlled area, and the launcher returned to Russia after it was used to shoot down MH17.&lt;ref name="BBC News 28 September 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 5.24.18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH JIT" /&gt; On the basis of the JIT's conclusions, the governments of the Netherlands and Australia hold Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation and are taking steps to hold Russia formally accountable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2018/05/25/mh17-the-netherlands-and-australia-hold-russia-responsible|title=MH17: The Netherlands and Australia hold Russia responsible|last=Algemene Zaken|first=Ministerie van|last2=Buitenlandse Zaken|first2=Ministerie van|website=www.government.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evidence in The Australian"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mh17-shot-down-by-missile-from-russia-by-its-military-report-finds/news-story/d3d1cafaa0033e7acc42d9b9fc38dbf4 | title=MH17 evidence points to ‘rogue state’ Russia, Tony Abbott says | website=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSB and JIT findings confirmed earlier claims by American and German intelligence sources as to the missile type and launch area.

[[Ukrainian Prime Minister]] [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] laid the blame on professional soldiers that he said came from Russia, stating that "it wasn't drunken militants with Ukrainian passports [who shot down the Malaysian plane], it was done by Russian professionals and coordinated from Russia", adding that "the whole world has learned about the Russian lies and Russian propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/yatsenyuk-russia-is-not-planning-to-conduct-any-humanitarian-mission-live-361699.html|title=Yatsenyuk: 'We need to survive first'|date=22 August 2014|work=Kyiv Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2018, the Russian government rejects claims that Russia bears any responsibility for the crash, and denies involvement.

==Crash==

[[File:MH17 Flight Route (en).svg|thumb|upright=1.364|Routes of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) and Singapore Airlines Flight 351 (SQ351), including airspace restrictions]]

On Thursday, 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 departed from [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] Gate G3 at 12:13&amp;nbsp;[[Central European Summer Time|CEST]] (10:13&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])&lt;ref name="DSB_Final_Report"/&gt;{{rp|23}} and took off at 12:31 local time (10:31 UTC). It was due to arrive at [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] at 06:10 [[Time in Malaysia|MYT]], Friday, 18 July (22:10 UTC, 17 July).&lt;ref name=BBCbothsides/&gt;

According to the original flight plan, MH17 was to fly over Ukraine at [[flight level]] 330 (33,000&amp;nbsp;feet or 10,060&amp;nbsp;metres) and then change to FL 350 around the Ukrainian city of [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&amp;nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air control approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350. At 16:00 local time (13:00&amp;nbsp;UTC), the crew asked for a deviation of {{convert|20|nmi|km}} to the left (north) of course, on [[Airway (aviation)|airway]] L980, due to weather conditions. This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]]. The crew then asked if they could climb to FL 340, which was rejected as this flight level was not available, so MH17 remained at FL 330. At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&amp;nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&amp;nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar. ''RND Control'' confirmed that the plane had disappeared.&lt;ref name="dsb1"/&gt;

The Dutch Safety Board reported a last flight data recording at 16:20 local time (13:20&amp;nbsp;UTC), located west of the [[urban-type settlement]] Rozsypne (Розсипне), near [[Hrabove, Donetsk Oblast|Hrabove]] heading  [[Points of the compass|east-southeast]] (ESE, 115°) at {{convert|494|kn|km/h mph}}.&lt;ref name="dsb1"/&gt;

At exactly 16:20:03 local time (13:20:03 UTC) a [[Buk missile system|Buk]] [[surface-to-air|ground-to-air missile]], which had been launched from an area east from the aircraft, detonated outside the aircraft just above the cockpit to the left. An [[Uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]] occurred, resulting in both the cockpit and tail sections tearing away from the middle portion of the fuselage. All three sections disintegrated as they fell rapidly towards the ground.

The majority of debris landed near [[Hrabove, Donetsk Oblast|Hrabove]], a village located north of [[Torez]] in eastern Ukraine's [[Donetsk Oblast]].

==Aftermath==
About 90 minutes after the incident, Ukraine closed all routes in Eastern Ukrainian airspace, at all altitudes.&lt;ref name="DSB_Final_Report"/&gt;{{rp|101}} The incident dramatically heightened fears about airliner shootdowns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Air India flight with 126 on board was right behind MH 17 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Air-India-flight-with-126-on-board-was-right-behind-MH-17/articleshow/38601142.cms |date=18 July 2014 |work=The Times of India |accessdate=12 November 2014 |quote=&lt;!--"But such fears did not exist over Europe, at least till Terrible Thursday."--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to some airlines announcing they would avoid overflying conflict zones.

Shortly after the crash, it was announced that Malaysia Airlines would retire [[flight number]] MH17 and change the Amsterdam–Kuala Lumpur route to [[flight number]] MH19 beginning on 25 July 2014, with the outbound flight unchanged.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/07/18/malaysia-flight-17-retired-numbers/12827633/ |title=Malaysia will stop using No. 17 next week |first=Bart |last=Jansen |date=18 July 2014 |accessdate=18 July 2014 |work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCAust001"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-21/mh17-malaysia-airlines-retires-flight-number-out-of-respect-/5610864 |title=MH17: Malaysia Airlines retires flight number after Ukraine crash |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In association with the retirement of the Boeing 777 aircraft type from Malaysia Airlines' fleet, Malaysia Airlines terminated service to Amsterdam, opting to codeshare with [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines|KLM]] on the KUL-AMS route for service beyond 25 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airlineroute.net/2015/12/03/mh-amscdg-jan16cxld/ |title=Malaysia Airlines Cancels Amsterdam / Paris Routes from late-Jan 2016 |work=Airlineroute.net |date=3 December 2015 |accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2014, shares in Malaysia Airlines dropped by nearly 16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/malaysia-airlines-shares-tank-2014-7 |title=Malaysia Airlines Shares Tank |publisher=Business Insider |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2014, two Ukrainian military jets were hit by missiles at the altitude of {{convert|17000|ft}} close to the area of the MH17 crash. According to the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|Ukrainian Security Council]], preliminary information indicated that the missiles came from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trust.org/item/20140723154118-im9dy |title=Ukraine: missiles that brought down jets may have been fired from Russia |accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Malaysia proposed that the [[United Nations Security Council]] set up an international tribunal to prosecute those deemed responsible for the downing of the plane. The Malaysian resolution gained a majority on the Security Council, but was vetoed by Russia.&lt;ref name="churkin" /&gt;  Russia had proposed its own rival draft resolution, which pushed for a greater U.N. role in an investigation into what caused the downing of the aircraft and demanded justice, but their proposal would not have set up a tribunal.&lt;ref name="veto" /&gt;

On 9 June 2016, a Russian businessman claimed that the shooting down of the plane put an end to [[Novorossiya (confederation)|hopes of a Russian nation in Ukraine]] and prolonged the War in Donbass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loiko|first1=Sergei|title=The Unraveling Of Moscow's 'Novorossia' Dream|url=http://www.rferl.mobi/a/unraveling-moscow-novorossia-dream/27772641.html|website=Radio Free Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unnamed American intelligence official stated that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 may have been shot down in error by pro-Russian separatists, citing evidence that separatists launched an SA-11 surface-to-air missile that blew up the Malaysian airliner.

On 28 July 2014, Ukrainian security official Andriy Lysenko announced, at a press conference, that black box recorder analysis had revealed that the aircraft had been brought down by shrapnel that caused "massive explosive decompression."

On 8 September 2014, the [[BBC]] released new material by [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]] who cited three civilian witnesses from Donbass who saw the Buk launcher in the rebel-controlled territory on the day when MH17 crashed.

On 8 October 2014 the president of the German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|Federal Intelligence Service]] (BND) gave a presentation about MH17 to a German parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence activities.  According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', the report contained a detailed analysis which concluded that pro-Russian separatists had used a captured Ukrainian Buk system to shoot down Flight MH17. The report also noted that "Russian claims the missile had been fired by Ukrainian soldiers and that a Ukrainian fighter jet had been flying close to the passenger jet were false" and that Ukraine had published manipulated photographs.&lt;ref name=spiegel-bnd-de&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/mh17-laut-bnd-waren-separatisten-fuer-absturz-verantwortlich-a-997885.html |title=Ostukraine: BND macht Separatisten für MH17-Absturz verantwortlich|trans-title=Eastern Ukraine: BND says separatists are responsible for MH17 crash |work=Der Spiegel |date=19 October 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/10/20/world/germany-says-ukraine-rebels-downed-mh17-seized-missiles-report/ |title=Germany says Ukraine rebels downed MH17 with seized missiles: report |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=20 October 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2014}} "He also said Ukrainian photos had been "manipulated", the magazine reported but did not elaborate on what the pictures showed, who had provided them or altered them."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney General of Germany]] opened an investigation against unknown persons due to a suspected [[war crime]].&lt;ref name=spiegel-bnd&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/german-intelligence-blames-pro-russian-separatists-for-mh17-downing-a-997972.html |title=Deadly Ukraine Crash: German Intelligence Claims Pro-Russian Separatists Downed MH17 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=19 October 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between November 2014 and May 2016, UK-based investigative collective [[Bellingcat]] made a series of conclusions, based on their examination of photos in social media and other open-source information. Bellingcat said that the launcher used to shoot down the aircraft was a Buk 332 of the Russian [[53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade]] based in [[Kursk]], Russia, which had been transported from [[Donetsk]] to [[Snizhne]] and was controlled by separatists in Ukraine on the day of the attack.&lt;ref name="Bellingcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Origin-of-the-Separatists-Buk-A-Bellingcat-Investigation1.pdf|title=MH17: Source of the Separatists' Buk|author=Bellingcat MH17 Investigation Team|date=8 November 2014|publisher=Bellingcat|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109132619/https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Origin-of-the-Separatists-Buk-A-Bellingcat-Investigation1.pdf|archive-date=9 November 2014|deadurl=no|access-date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/journalists-find-solid-russian-ties-to-missile-that-hit-mh17-371161.html|title=Journalists find 'solid' Russian ties to missile that hit MH17|last=Gorchinskaya|first=Katya|date=9 November 2014|work=Kyiv Post|accessdate=18 June 2015|last2=Lavrov|first2=Vlad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/meet-eliot-higgins-putins-mh17-nemesis-345485|title=Meet Eliot Higgins, Putin's MH17 Nemesis|last=Tucker|first=Maxim|date=22 June 2015|work=Newsweek|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/bellingcat-new-evidence-against-russian-soldiers-on-mh17/a-18959585|title=Bellingcat: New evidence against Russian soldiers on MH17|work=DW.COM|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/05/03/the_lost_digit/|title=bellingcat – The Lost Digit: Buk 3x2 – bellingcat|work=bellingcat|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also published a statement from a witness who was said to be a separatist fighter (referred to by first name only) who confirmed that the launcher was placed in that area on the day of the Boeing crash to prevent Ukrainian airstrikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/us-ukraine-crisis-airliner-idUSKBN0M81XF20150312 |title=Exclusive: From 'Red October' village, new evidence on downing of Malaysian plane over Ukraine |agency=Reuters |accessdate=12 March 2015 |author=Anton Zverev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, [[News Corp Australia]] published the transcript of a 17-minute video recorded at the scene shortly after the crash. The transcript and published segments of the video indicated that Russian-backed rebels arrived at the crash site in the expectation of finding the wreckage of a military aircraft and of locating crew that had parachuted from the aircraft.&lt;ref name="NC150717"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/full-transcript-russian-backed-rebels-ransack-the-wreckage-of-mh17-in-shocking-17-minute-video/story-e6frfkp9-1227444629703|title=Full transcript: Russian-backed rebels ransack the wreckage of MH17 in shocking 17-minute video|last=|first=|date=17 July 2015|work=|accessdate=17 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717004444/http://www.news.com.au/national/full-transcript-russian-backed-rebels-ransack-the-wreckage-of-mh17-in-shocking-17-minute-video/story-e6frfkp9-1227444629703|archive-date=17 July 2015|dead-url=yes|publisher=[[news.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stratfor's concluded that a Buk system had moved from the Russian border toward Donetsk on 15 July 2014, and then moved back to the east on the afternoon of 17 July 2014, hours before Flight MH17 was shot down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Examining the Evidence of Russia's Involvement in a Malaysia Airlines Crash|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/examining-evidence-russias-involvement-malaysia-airlines-crash|accessdate=16 May 2016|publisher=Stratfor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch Safety Board reports===

On 9 September 2014, the preliminary report was released by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB).&lt;ref name="dsb1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/09/world/europe/netherlands-ukraine-mh17-report/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 |title=Report: MH17 hit by burst of 'high-energy objects' from outside |date=9 September 2014 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dsbprelim"&gt;{{citation |title=Preliminary report – Crash involving Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 Flight MH17 |format=PDF |work=DSB |date=17 July 2014 |accessdate=24 September 2014 |url=http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/uploads/phase-docs/701/b3923acad0ceprem-rapport-mh-17-en-interactief.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} This preliminary report concluded that there was no evidence of any technical or operational failure in the aircraft or from the crew prior to the ending of the [[Flight recorder|CVR and FDR]] recordings at 13.20:03 hrs (UTC). The report also said that "damage observed on the forward fuselage and cockpit section of the aircraft appears to indicate that there were impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft". According to the investigators, this damage probably led to a loss of structural integrity that caused an in-flight break-up first of the forward parts of the aircraft and then of the remainder with an expansive geographic spread of the aircraft's pieces.

[[Tjibbe Joustra]], Chairman of the Dutch Safety Board, explained that the investigation thus far pointed "towards an external cause of the MH17 crash", but determining the exact cause required further investigation. They also said that they aimed to publish the final report within a year of the crash date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Prof. mr. dr.

The report concluded that the crash was caused by a [[Buk missile system|Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile]] with a 9N314M [[warhead]]. The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit. The impact killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airplane leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants.&lt;ref name="DSB_Final_Report"/&gt; Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the plane having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash. The DSB calculated the trajectory of the missile and found it was fired within a {{convert|320|km2|sqmi|adj=on}} area southeast of [[Torez]]. Narrowing down a specific launch site was outside the DSB's mandate.&lt;ref name="DSB_Final_Report"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/uploads/phase-docs/1006/debcd724fe7breport-mh17-crash.pdf |title=Crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 |publisher=[[Dutch Safety Board]] |date=13 October 2015 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cFSGnsRg?url=http://cdn.onderzoeksraad.nl/documents/report-mh17-crash-en.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2015 |deadurl=yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|147}} The findings do not specify who launched the Buk missile but according to Al Jazeera, the area identified by the DSB was controlled by separatists at the time of the downing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/dutch-board-russian-missile-downed-mh17-151013112210934.html |title=Dutch board says Russian-made missile downed MH17 |date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the technical investigation, the selection of the flight route was also investigated by the DSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation crash MH17, 17 July 2014 |url=http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014/onderzoek/1543/dutch-safety-board-heads-investigation-investigation-effort-in-full-swing-black-boxes-currently-being-read-out |website=onderzoeksraad.nl |publisher=[[Dutch Safety Board]] |accessdate=24 July 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ShD1V2ae?url=http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014/onderzoek/1543/dutch-safety-board-heads-investigation-investigation-effort-in-full-swing-black-boxes-currently-being-read-out |archivedate=19 September 2014 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt; Many airlines had avoided the Eastern Ukrainian airspace for months prior to the MH17 disaster.

===Criminal investigation===
The criminal investigation into the downing of MH17 is being led by the [[Openbaar Ministerie|Public Prosecution Service]] of the [[Dutch Ministry of Justice]], and is the largest in Dutch history, involving dozens of prosecutors and 200 investigators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation |title=MH17 criminal investigation largest ever in the Netherlands |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=15 August 2014 |accessdate=27 October 2014 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2014-08/15/c_126873336.htm |editor=Mu Xuequan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826002055/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2014-08/15/c_126873336.htm |archive-date=26 August 2014 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators interviewed witnesses and examined forensic samples,  satellite data, intercepted communications, and information on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=MH17 crash: Investigation focuses on '25 metal shards' |publisher=BBC News |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=27 October 2014 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29180887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating in the investigation along with the Netherlands, are the four other members of the joint investigation team (JIT),&lt;ref name="TheStarJIT" /&gt; Belgium, Ukraine, Australia, and lastly, Malaysia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Speculation on MH17 is damaging to investigations |newspaper=Free Malaysia Today |agency=[[Bernama]] |date=22 November 2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014 |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/11/22/speculation-on-mh17-is-damaging-to-investigations/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which joined in November 2014.&lt;ref name="TheStarJIT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/12/01/mh17-malaysia-to-be-part-of-investigating-team/ |title=MH17: Malaysia accepted as full member of probe team |newspaper=The Star |location=Petaling Jaya, Malaysia |date=1 December 2014 |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early in the investigation, the JIT eliminated accident, internal terrorist attack or air-to-air attack from another aircraft as the cause of the crash.&lt;ref name="SMH JIT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17-was-shot-down-from-prorussian-rebel-controlled-territory-investigation-finds-20160928-grqter.html|title=Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down from pro-Russian rebel controlled territory, investigation finds|first=Nick|last=Miller|date=29 September 2016|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, in a letter to the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], the Netherlands [[United Nations|UN]] representative wrote that "The Dutch government is deliberately refraining from any speculation or accusations regarding legal responsibility for the downing of MH17."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter to President of the UNSC |first=Karel J.G |last=van Oosterom |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 |url=http://www.tweedekamer.nl/downloads/document?id=adbae747-b7f0-4713-ad97-1a7e1b75dcd2&amp;title=Brief%20van%20Permanent%20Representative%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in December, the assistant secretary of the [[United States Department of State]]'s European and Eurasian Affairs said America had given all of its information, including classified information to the Dutch investigators and to the [[ICAO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US Submits Classified Information on MH17 to Investigators: State Dep't |newspaper=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] |date=17 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 |url=http://sputniknews.com/military/20141217/1015956748.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2015, the JIT released a Russian-language video calling for witnesses in the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk regions]] who might have seen a [[Buk missile system]].&lt;ref name="JITMH17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jitmh17.com/ |title=Call for witnesses |publisher=Joint Investigation Team |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video included some previously undisclosed recordings allegedly of tapped phone conversations between rebel fighters about the Buk. In one recording, of a conversation a few hours after the shoot down, a fighter says that a member of the Buk's accompanying crew had been left behind at a checkpoint. In another recording, dated the day after the shootdown, a rebel allegedly says the Buk system and its crew had been brought from Russia by "the Librarian."  The video presents a "scenario" whereby a Buk missile was transported on a [[Volvo]] low loader truck from Sievernyi (Сєверний), a town located within a kilometre of the Russian border (near [[Krasnodon]]), to [[Donetsk]] during the night of 16/17 July.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olQNpTxSnTo MH17] ''Politie [Police]''  International Joint Investigation Team&lt;/ref&gt;
In the week following the public appeal, the JIT received more than 300 responses resulting in dozens of "serious witnesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/23903198/__Bruikbare_tips_over_daders_MH17__.html|trans-title=Dozens of useful tips about MH17 |title=Tientallen bruikbare tips over MH17 |last=van der Graaf |first=Jolande |language=Dutch |newspaper=De Telegraaf |date=9 April 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/04/09/hundreds-respond-to-call-for-mh17-witnesses-tips/ |title=Hundreds respond to call for MH17 witnesses |last=Van Jaarsveldt |first=Janene |date=9 April 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2015 |newspaper=NL Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the presence of the [[transloading|transloader]] of matching color with a Buk missile was confirmed on a satellite photo of the area taken just a few hours before the downing of the plane, which was described as "correlating with other evidence" by [[Stratfor]] who found the photo in [[DigitalGlobe]] archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/examining-evidence-russias-involvement-malaysia-airlines-crash|title=Examining the Evidence of Russia's Involvement in a Malaysia Airlines Crash|website=Stratfor|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/mh17-the-satellite-images-russia-doesnt-want-us-to-see/news-story/8c03f8e87971d36f70b5402ffbda16ff|title=The image Russia doesn't want the world to see|website=NewsComAu|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April 2015 Dutch authorities made available 569 documents concerning the shoot-down. Personal information and official interviews had been redacted. A further 147 documents were not made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/wat-we-niet-mogen-zien-147-documenten-mh17-blijven-geheim |title=Wat we niet mogen zien: 147 documenten MH17 blijven geheim |work=RTL Nieuws |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Findings of the joint investigation team (JIT)====
On 28 September 2016, the JIT gave a press conference in which it concluded that the aircraft was shot down with a [[Buk missile system|9M38 Buk missile]] fired from a rebel-controlled field near Pervomaisky (Первомайський), a town {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Snizhne]].&lt;ref name="NLTimesJIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/09/28/jit-mh17-shot-down-by-a-9m38-buk-missile-from-russian-origin/|title=JIT: MH17 shot down with missile fired from pro-Russian rebel controlled field}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found the Buk missile system used had been transported from Russia into Ukraine on the day of the crash, and then back into Russia after the crash, with one missile less than it arrived with.&lt;ref name="SMH JIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 28 September 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37495067 |title= MH17 missile 'came from Russia', Dutch-led investigators say |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 28 September 2016|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= [[BBC]] | accessdate= 2 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The JIT said they had identified 100 people, witnesses as well as suspects, who were involved in the movement of the Buk launcher, though they had not yet identified a clear chain of command to assess culpability, which was a matter for ongoing investigation. The Dutch chief prosecutor said "the evidence must stand before a court" which would render final judgement.&lt;ref name="SMH JIT"/&gt; During the investigation, the JIT recorded and assessed five billion internet pages, interviewed 200 witnesses, collected half a million photos and videos, and  analysed 150,000 intercepted phone calls.&lt;ref name="NLTimesJIT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/mh17-crash/@96066/presentation/ |title=Presentation preliminary results criminal investigation MH17 28-09-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to JIT head prosecutor Fred Westerbeke the criminal investigation is based on "immense body of evidence," including testimonies of live witnesses who saw the "Buk" launcher, primary radar data, original photos and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2017/10/16/74192-the-purpose-is-to-bring-this-matter-to-court|title="The purpose is to bring MH17 matter to court"|work=Новая газета – Novayagazeta.ru|access-date=16 October 2017|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Engineering Technologies 2010 Part3 0031 copy.jpg|thumb|A Buk SAM of the type used by the [[53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade]]]]
On 24 May 2018, after extensive comparative research, the JIT concluded that the Buk that shot down the flight came from the Russian [[53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade]] in [[Kursk]].&lt;ref name="jit"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/mh17-crash/@103196/update-criminal-0/ |title=Update in criminal investigation MH17 disaster|publisher=[[Openbaar Ministerie]]| date=24 May 2018| accessdate =24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the National Investigation Service of the Dutch police asked the eyewitnesses and insiders to share information about the identities of the Buk crew members, the instruction the crew members followed and persons responsible for the operational deployment of the involved Buk on 17 July 2014.&lt;ref name="jit"/&gt; According to Dutch [[Openbaar Ministerie|Public Prosecution Service]], by 24 May 2018 "the authorities of the Russian Federation have ... not reported to the JIT that a Buk of the 53rd Brigade was deployed in Eastern Ukraine and that this Buk downed flight MH17."&lt;ref name="jit"/&gt; In response, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] stated that Russia will analyze the JIT conclusion, but will acknowledge it only if it becomes a party in the investigation.&lt;ref name="kommersant"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3638260|title=Владимир Путин пообещал изучить выводы следствия о катастрофе Boeing MH17|work=[[Kommersant]]| language=Russian|date=24 May 2018| accessdate =24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Defence]] in turn stated that no Russian Buk crossed the border with Ukraine.&lt;ref name="kommersant"/&gt;

On 25 May 2018 the governments of the Netherlands and Australia issued a joint statement in which they laid responsibility on Russia "for its part" in the crash.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Netherlands and Australian foreign ministers stated that they would hold Russia legally responsible for shooting the airliner down. Netherlands Foreign Minister [[Stef Blok]] stated that "the government is now taking the next step by formally holding Russia accountable," and, "The Netherlands and Australia today asked Russia to enter into talks aimed at finding a solution that would do justice to the tremendous suffering and damage caused by the downing of MH17. A possible next step is to present the case to an international court or organization for their judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/netherlands-australia-flight17-statement-russia-1.4677473|title = Netherlands, Australia holding Russia 'accountable' for downing of MH17|access-date = 25 May 2018|author=[[The Associated Press]] |work = [[CBC News]]|date = 25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other countries and international organisations expressed their support for the JIT's conclusions and the joint statement by the Netherlands and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2233506-internationale-reacties-op-mh17-rusland-moet-verantwoordelijkheid-nemen.html |title=Internationale reacties op MH17: Rusland moet verantwoordelijkheid nemen |access-date=29 May 2018 |work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] |date=25 May 2018 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Foreign Secretary [[Boris Johnson]] said the United Kingdom "fully supports Australia and the Netherlands," calling on Russia to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-statement-on-the-mh17-investigation |title=Foreign Secretary statement on the MH17 investigation |access-date=29 May 2018 |work=[[Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office]] |date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; High Representative [[Federica Mogherini]] of the EU stated that the European Union "calls on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility" and to cooperate as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/05/25/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-on-the-findings-of-the-joint-investigation-team-on-the-downing-of-flight-mh17/ |title=Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the findings of the Joint Investigation Team on the downing of flight MH17 |access-date=29 May 2018 |work=[[European Council]] |date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German government called on Russia to "fully explain the tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Artikel/2018/05/2018-05-25-ukraine-mh17-gutachten.html |title="Die Schuldigen ermitteln" |access-date=29 May 2018 |work=[[Bundesregierung]] |date=25 May 2018 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of State issued a statement saying that the United States "strongly support the decisions by the Netherlands and Australia," requesting Russia to acknowledge its involvement and to "cease its callous disinformation campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/05/282502.htm |title=Calling Russia To Account for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 |access-date=29 May 2018 |work=[[United States Department of State]] |date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]] called on Russia to "accept responsibility and fully cooperate ... in line with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2166]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_154585.htm |title=Statement by the NATO Secretary General on MH17 investigation |access-date=29 May 2018 |work=[[NATO]] |date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the JIT's conclusions, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] reiterated that the Russians are "not involved in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/57556 |title=St Petersburg International Economic Forum plenary session |access-date=29 May 2018 |work=[[Kremlin]] |date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proposed international tribunal====
In June 2015, the Netherlands, supported by the other JIT members, sought to create an international tribunal to prosecute those suspected of downing the Malaysian airliner, which would take up the case after the closing of the criminal investigation. The Dutch hoped that an international tribunal would induce Russian cooperation, which was considered critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive: International tribunal looks like best chance for MH17 justice – Dutch sources |agency=Reuters |date=23 June 2015 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/23/us-ukraine-crisis-mh-idUSKBN0P326E20150623 |first=Anthony |last=Deutsch |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2015, the Russian government rejected a request by the five countries on the investigative committee to form a UN tribunal which would try those responsible for the shooting down of the aircraft, calling it "not timely and counterproductive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/russia-rejects-calls-for-un-tribunal-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17 |title=Russia rejects calls for UN tribunal to prosecute MH17 suspects |work=The Guardian |agency=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=28 June 2015 |date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2015, Malaysia, a member of the [[UN Security Council]], distributed a draft resolution to establish such a tribunal. This resolution was jointly proposed by the five JIT member countries. Russian UN Ambassador [[Vitaly Churkin]] responded, "I don't see any future for this resolution. Unfortunately, it seems that this is an attempt to organize a grandiose, political show, which only damages efforts to find the guilty parties."&lt;ref name=churkin&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/malaysia-airlines-mh17-russia-rebukes-push-for-un-tribunal-1.3146029 |title=Malaysia Airlines MH17: Russia rebukes push for UN tribunal |date=10 July 2015 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia later circulated a rival resolution which criticised the international investigation's lack of "due transparency" and demanded those responsible be brought to justice, but which did not call for a tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia's UN Draft on MH17 Crash Doesn't Call for Tribunal |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/russias-draft-mh17-crash-call-tribunal-32575088 |agency=Associated Press |date=20 July 2015 |author=Edith M.

====Criminal prosecution====
In a statement by the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs of 5 July 2017, it was announced that the JIT countries will prosecute any suspects identified in the downing of flight MH17 in the Netherlands and under Dutch law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2017/07/05/statement-by-the-minister-of-foreign-affairs-on-mh17-5-july-2017 |title=Statement by the minister of Foreign Affairs on MH17, 5 July 2017 |work=Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands |agency=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date= 7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A future treaty between the Netherlands and Ukraine will make it possible for the Netherlands to prosecute in the cases of all 298 victims, regardless of their nationality.

==British ISC report==
On 20 December 2017, the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|Intelligence and Security Committee]] of the UK Parliament published its annual report. It contains a short section entitled "Russian objectives and activity against UK and allied interests" which quotes MI6 as stating: "Russia conducts information warfare on a massive scale... An early example of this was a hugely intensive, multichannel propaganda effort to persuade the world that Russia bore no responsibility for the shooting down of [Malaysian Airlines flight] MH-17 (an outright falsehood: we know beyond any reasonable doubt that the Russian military supplied and subsequently recovered the missile launcher)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toler|first1=Aric|title=British Intelligence Report Confirms Russian Military Origin of MH17 Murder Weapon|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/12/20/british-intelligence-report-confirms-russian-military-origin-mh17-murder-weapon/|website=Bellingcat|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCP Annual Report 2016-2017|url=https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/2016-2017_ISC_AR.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqS8WVJqzXucCjkPcD1PkT4M4RJspBV9tHBYEJAZLobTFw2rG67hpLh55zoZsZ9_9Xrmtqiq4CzbwmhAUpzCTh3AW-lBjOdmWFYJds1-EYzBgJGRmPWubVpg_Yl0SrMUrYTcKGn-8HtPvf5AARiu60msxtT2SpjJfdv78EEeqkINZBUythVem1KHFtKbbziZLQNdiiOymaCinv1pUa1FIpSVaHOkjNwmyfFteiMvnTRX00Qz_0%3D&amp;attredirects=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil cases==

On the evening of the crash, the [[Life (news agency, Russia)|LifeNews]] portal released a statement from the separatists saying that a "Ukrainian Air Force [[An-26]] transport plane" had been shot down by a missile and crashed.&lt;ref name="lifenews 136801"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Ополченцы сообщили о сбитом Ан-26 на востоке Украины |url=http://lifenews.ru/news/136801 |quote=On July 17 near the village of Rassypnoye over the Torez city in Donetsk region an An-26 transport plane of Ukrainian Air Force was taken down, said the militia. According to them, the plane crashed somewhere near the "Progress" mine, away from residential areas. According to one of the militias, at about 17:30 local time an An-26 flew over the city. It was hit by a rocket, there was an explosion and the plane went to the ground, leaving a black smoke. Debris fell from the sky |accessdate=17 July 2014 |date=17 July 2014 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ITAR-TASS]] and [[RIA Novosti]] also reported that an An-26 had been shot down by the separatist militia near Torez at around 16:00 local time in what it described as "yet another victory of DPR self-defence".&lt;ref name="itartasblamesrebels"&gt;{{cite news|title=Donetsk People's Republic militia downs another Ukraine's An-26 plane – eyewitnesses |url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/741164 |accessdate=18 July 2014 |agency=[[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia]] |date=17 July 2014 |ref=TASS2 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RA3m6ZDd?url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/741164 |archivedate=18 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Транспортный Ан-26 сбит на востоке Украины, заявили очевидцы |url=http://ria.ru/world/20140717/1016409306.html |website=ria.ru |agency=RIA Novosti |date=17 July 2014 |accessdate=13 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RR2Ynt9a?url=http://ria.ru/world/20140717/1016409306.html |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no evidence about altitude and weapons used.

Shortly after it became evident that the plane was a civilian one the separatist media denied any involvement in the crash and possession of anti-aircraft missiles capable of reaching this altitude.&lt;ref name="vk.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Сводки от Стрелкова Игоря Ивановича |url=http://vk.com/strelkov_info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717152222/http://vk.com/strelkov_info |archivedate=17 July 2014 |website=VKontakte |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arthur Bright"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0717/Web-evidence-points-to-pro-Russia-rebels-in-downing-of-MH17-video |title=Web evidence points to pro-Russia rebels in downing of MH17 (+video) |author=Arthur Bright |date=17 July 2014 |website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

=== Conspiracy theories ===
On 18 July Commander of the [[Donbass People's Militia]] [[Igor Strelkov (officer)|Igor Girkin]] was quoted as stating that "a significant number of the bodies weren't fresh". He followed up by saying "Ukrainian authorities are capable of any baseness"; and also claimed that blood serum and medications were found in the plane's wreckage in large quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/rebel-leader-gives-bizarre-account-plane-crash-182256709.html|title=Rebel leader gives bizarre account of plane crash|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=18 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721032149/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/rebel-suggests-malaysia-plane-victims-long-dead|archivedate=21 July 2014|deadurl=yes|publisher=Yahoo!

The Russian government-funded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Squires |first=Nick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10976920/British-journalist-working-for-Russian-TV-resigns-over-bias-in-Ukraine-MH17-coverage.html |title=British journalist working for Russian TV resigns over bias in Ukraine MH17 coverage |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 July 2014 |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlet [[RT (TV network)|RT]] initially said that the plane may have been shot down by Ukraine in a failed attempt to assassinate Vladimir Putin, in a plot which was organised by Ukraine's "Western backers". This was quickly dismissed as Putin's flight route was going hundreds of kilometres north of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75477,16347795,Moskwa_obwinia_Ukraine.html?piano_t=1 |title='Zamach na Putina', 'Ile odszkodowań zapłacą Ukraińcy' i zmiany w Wikipedii.

Other conspiracy theories propagated by Russian media included that the Ukrainians shot down the plane by mistake, drawing parallels to downing [[Siberia Airlines Flight 1812]] in 2001 (reported in July&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c39_1406649680 |title=German media published a shock confessions of pilots Ukraine on Su-25 in day when MH17 got disaster |publisher=LiveLeak |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30597555 |title=MH17: Russia reveals 'witness' who blames Ukraine pilot |publisher=BBC |date=24 December 2014 |accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;); that Ukrainian air traffic controllers purposefully redirected the flight to fly over the war zone (proven false by the DSB investigation); and that the Ukrainian government organised the attack on the plane to bring infamy upon the pro-Russian rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/russians-fed-conspiracy-theories-ukraine-crash-064400429.html |title=Russians Fed Conspiracy Theories on Ukraine Crash |work=Yahoo News |date=22 July 2014 |accessdate=22 July 2014 |first=Laura |last=Mills |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of alternative theories disseminated in Russian mass media started growing as the DSB and JIT investivations increasingly pointed towards the separatists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buran.ru/htm/mh17.htm|title=Как и почему погиб рейс МН17 над Донбассом? Брифинг Министерства обороны России|website=buran.ru|access-date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2014, Russia's [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]] reported on a supposedly leaked spy satellite photo which showed the plane being shot from behind by a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1tv.ru/news/social/271864 |title=Снимок малайзийского "Боинга", сбитого под Донецком, обсуждают во всем мире |date=15 November 2014 |website=Channel One Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Russia's Channel One show satellite photo evidencing MH17 was downed by fighter jet |work=TASS |date=14 November 2014 |accessdate=15 November 2014 |url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/759835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other Russian media reprinted the photo but its authenticity was immediately dismissed as the airplanes were out of scale which indicated poor copy-and-paste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/sensational-russian-photo-of-mh17-being-shot-debunked-by-citizen-journalist-group-20141115-11nbqs.html |title='Sensational' Russian photo of MH17 being shot debunked by citizen journalist group |last=Miller |first=Nick |date=15 November 2014 |accessdate=15 November 2014 |newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was disclosed, that the photo had been initially emailed to the Vice-President of the [[Russian Union of Engineers]] by a self-described aviation expert who had found it on a Russian online forum.&lt;ref name="BUZZnov2014"&gt;{{citation |title=Russian TV Airs Clearly Fake Image To Claim Ukraine Shot Down MH17 |first=Max |last=Seddon |date=15 November 2014 |accessdate=15 October 2014 |work=BuzzFeed |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/russian-tv-airs-clearly-fake-image-to-claim-ukraine-shot-dow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aviation expert later apologised, saying that he was unhappy with how the information had been used.&lt;ref name="BUZZnov2014" /&gt;

In July 2014, Sara Firth, who had worked as a correspondent with RT for the previous five years, resigned in protest at the channel's coverage of the crash, which she described as "lies".&lt;ref name="sarafirth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/mh17-fallout-russian-reporter-sara-firth-quits-over-ukraine-lies/story-fnizu68q-1226994372531|title=MH17 fallout: Russian reporter Sara Firth quits over Ukraine 'lies'|date=28 March 2014|publisher=News.com.au|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RT said Firth had left to take another job.&lt;ref name="ReporterResigns"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/18/mh17-russia-today-reporter-resigns-sara-firth-kremlin-malaysia|title=Russia Today reporter resigns in protest at MH17 coverage|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Dutch newspaper ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' described how false stories about the MH17 crash had been propagated with the support of [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] politician [[Pieter Omtzigt]], who introduced a Russian-speaking Ukrainian man as an "eyewitness" to the crash on a public expert debate in May 2017. The man, who was an asylum-seeker from Ukraine, did not witness the crash and his speech, texted to him by Omtzigt prior to the interview, repeated the Russian-promoted version that Ukrainian jets downed the Boeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/11/10/hoe-twijfel-rond-mh17-in-de-hand-wordt-gewerkt-13959091-a1580806|title=Hoe twijfel rond MH17 in de hand wordt gewerkt|work=NRC|access-date=13 November 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Ukrainian Buk" version ===
In May 2015 ''Novaya Gazeta'' published a report by "a group of Russian military engineers" that came to the conclusion that the airplane was shot down by a [[Buk missile system|Buk-M1 launcher]] with 9M38M1 missile. The authors also analysed the visible impact traces on the surface of the airplane and suggested that the missile couldn't have been fired from [[Snizhne]], but was instead fired from [[Zaroshchenske]] and claimed that a Ukrainian anti-air unit was located there at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/inquests/68332.html |title=Это был "Бук-М1" |publisher=Novaya Gazeta |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=5 May 2015 |trans-title=This was "Buk-M1"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 the report was the subject of a press conference and was attributed to Mikhail Malisevskiy, chief engineer at Moscow-headquartered [[Almaz-Antey]], the Buk missile manufacturer.&lt;ref name="TheAgeAlmaz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/mh17-plane-was-shot-down-by-a-buk-missile-russian-weapons-manufacturer-says-20150602-ghfdco.html |title=MH17 plane was shot down by a Buk missile, Russian weapons manufacturer says |author=Nick Miller |date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Security Service of Ukraine]] said that there were inaccuracies in this version, and called part of the report a fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopfake.org/sbu-novye-dokazatelstva-krusheniya-boeing-na-donbasse-osnovany-na-fejkovyh-snimkah/ |title=СБУ: Новые "доказательства" крушения Boeing на Донбассе основаны на фейковых снимках |date=6 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2015 |website= |publisher=StopFake.org|trans-title = SBU called the Russian analysis on Boeing based on fake photos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian military expert Vadim Lukashevich argued on [[TV Rain]] that the spatial orientation of the rocket at the moment of explosion did not exclude the possibility that it was launched from Snizhne, as the report claimed. Lukashevich also noted that the report admitted a Buk missile as the cause of the crash, discrediting the previous theories about the crash (Su-25 etc.) circulated in Russian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.tvrain.ru/teleshow/here_and_now/ja_ne_uvidel_v_etom_doklade_ekspertov_vpk_aviatsio-386961/ |title=Я не увидел в этом докладе экспертов ВПК".

On 17 September 2018, Russia's Ministry of Defense held a press conference that aimed to cast doubt on Moscow's culpability for the tragedy. Lt. Gen. Nikolai Parshin, chief of the Missile and Artillery Directorate, told that after Dutch investigators displayed parts of the missile and their serial numbers, they studied and declassified archives at the research center that produced the Buk missiles. Parshin said the Russian archives show that the missile that was made of these parts was transported to a military unit in western Ukraine in 1986, and to Russia's knowledge never left Ukraine. Officials also claim that video evidence presented by Joint Investigation Team (JIT), in which the missile that allegedly shot down the plane being moved from Russia into Ukraine, were fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/09/17/world/europe/ap-eu-russia-mh17.html |title= Russia: Missile That Shot Down Flight MH17 Was Ukrainian |date= 17 September 2018 |work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JIT responded that it had requested Russia in May 2018 on the issue of details about recovered missile parts, but had received no answer. Information from the Russian Ministry of Defense will be carefully studied as soon as the documents were made available, as requested in May 2018 and required by [[United Nations Security Council|UNSC]] in 2016. JIT stated it had always carefully analysed information provided by Russia, but information presented to the public was inaccurate on several points. Russia has given differing accounts over time of how MH17 was shot down; for example they also claimed to have evidence (radar image) of Ukrainian fighter fired an air-to-air missile to MH17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MH17 crash: Dutch ask Russia to submit new claims |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45546611 |accessdate=18 September 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parket |first1=Landelijk |title=Reaction JIT to press conference of Russian Ministry of Defense |url=https://www.om.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/@104053/reaction-jit-to/ |website=Openbaar Ministerie |accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oleksandr Turchynov]], secretary of [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine]], said that Russia's claim is "yet another failed fake report that the Kremlin made up in order to cover up their crime that has been proven by the official investigation as well as independent experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newsweek.com/russian-propaganda-moscow-releases-audio-blaming-ukraine-downing-mh17-flight-1124371 |title= Russian propaganda?

[[File:Chester_Brown_(2016)_Mary_Wept_Over_the_Feet_of_Jesus_(cover).jpg|thumb|''Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus'', [[Chester Brown]], 2016, 270&amp;nbsp;pages]]
'''''Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus''''' is a [[graphic novel]] by Canadian cartoonist [[Chester Brown]], published in 2016.  The book is subtitled '''''Prostitution and Religious Obedience in the Bible''''', and is made up of adaptations of stories from the Bible that Brown believes promote pro-prostitution attitudes among early Christians, and argues for the decriminalization of prostitution.{{sfn|Donachie|2016}}

==Background==

{{Empty section|date=January 2018}}

==Content==

As in his previous graphic novel ''[[Paying for It]]'' (2011), Brown takes a pro-prostitution stance in ''Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus''.  He declares his research has determined that [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was a prostitute, that early Christians practised prostitution, and that Jesus' [[parable of the talents or minas|Parable of the Talents]] should be read in a pro-prostitution light.  Brown describes himself as a Christian who is "not at all concerned with imposing 'moral' values or religious laws on others" and believes that Biblical figures such as [[Cain and Abel|Abel]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] "find favour with God because they oppose his will or challenge him in some way".{{sfn|Lehoczky|2016}}

Brown adapts the stories or portions of stories of [[Cain and Abel]], Tamar, [[Rahab]], [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], [[Bathsheba]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], the [[Parable of the talents or minas|Parable of the talents]], [[Mary of Bethany]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]].{{sfn|Brown|2016}}  Handwritten appendices make up the final third of the book, including commentary on the comics, a 55-title bibliography,{{sfn|Lehoczky|2016}} and a 20-page comics adaptation of the [[Book of Job]].{{sfn|Hatfield|2016}}

==Analysis==

{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}

Brown lays out the simple, precise artwork in a fixed grid of four panels to a page.  The dialogue is plain and direct.  The cover features a vagina-shaped frame into which Brown incorporates two smiling snakes and an open book, from which red drops fall.{{sfn|Brown|2016}}

In the book's appendices, Brown puts forth his interpretations of the stories.  He argues that prostitution had an honorable place in Biblical society, and that Matthew left clues in his narrative that Mary was a prostitute.  Brown details facts from his research that coloured his interpretations, such as that ''feet'' was used as a euphemism for "penis".  He also tells of where he used [[artistic license]] in his retellings, and of errors he made, such as depicting coins at a time when coins had not yet come into use.{{sfn|Brown|2016}}

'''Melodifestivalen 2018''' was the 58th edition of the Swedish music competition [[Melodifestivalen]], which selected Sweden's entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]. The competition was organised by [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) and took place over a six-week period between 3 February and 10 March 2018.

The format of the competition consists of 6 shows: 4 semi-final rounds, a second chance round and a final. An initial 28 entries were selected for the competition through three methods: an open call for song submissions, direct invitations to specific artists and songwriters and a wildcard given to one of the artists that participated in the&amp;nbsp;''Svensktoppen nästa''&amp;nbsp;competition organised by&amp;nbsp;[[Sveriges Radio P4]]. The 28 competing entries were divided into four semi-finals, with seven compositions in each. From each semi-final, the songs that earn first and second place qualify directly to the final, while the songs that place third and fourth proceed to the Second Chance round. The bottom three songs in each semi-final will be eliminated from the competition. An additional four entries qualify from the Second Chance round to the final, bringing the total number of competing entries in the final to 12. All 6 shows were hosted by [[David Lindgren]] and [[Fredrik Svensson (presenter)|Fredrik Svensson]], known as Fab Freddie.

The winner of the competition is [[Benjamin Ingrosso]] with the song "[[Dance You Off]]." He represented Sweden at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]] which was held in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], where he came seventh with 274 points.

'''Nafovanny''' in [[Vietnam]] is the largest captive-breeding primate facility in the world, supplying [[Crab-eating Macaque|long-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis'') to [[animal testing]] laboratories, including [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Covance]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070218140802/http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/monkeybusiness/about.htm "About Nafovanny"], [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]]; see also [https://web.archive.org/web/20070218140902/http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/monkeybusiness/introduction.htm "Introduction"]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070218140812/http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/monkeybusiness/conditions.htm "Conditions"]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070218140921/http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/monkeybusiness/wild.htm "Wild Capture"], BUAV.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Nafovanny was set up in 1994 by Vanny Chian Technology, a [[Hong Kong]] company, according to [[Reuters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~vern/wild-trade/docs/vanny-scmp.txt Vietnam: Hong Kong Firm Starts Vietnam Monkey Business], Reuters, December 5, 1994, link courtesy of the Australian National University, accessed February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The company is reported to have set up a [[United States dollar|U.S.]]$2 million joint venture company, called Nafovanny, with Vietnam's Forestry Ministry, with the intention of creating a network of monkey farms in southern Vietnam.

Responding to criticism of the project from Dr. John Wedderburn, a former member of the [[RSPCA]]'s ruling council, Daniel Chen, a director of Vanny Chain Technology, said: "We have not got a problem with that because what we are doing is very humane and it is for the welfare of human beings."&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Keith. [http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~vern/wild-trade/docs/vanny-scmp.txt Vietnam: Anger at Monkey Farm Plan], ''South China Morning Post'', December 6, 2004, link courtesy of the Australian National University, accessed February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and size==
Nafovanny consists of two main farms in Long Thanh&lt;ref name=HansardJan222007&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070122/text/70122w0019.htm "Animals: Scientific Procedures Inspectorate"], ''Hansard'', January 22, 2007, Column 1529W.&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[Cambodia]]n border, with a total area of 90,000 square meters, able to hold 30,000 monkeys. According to the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV), the facility also maintains satellite breeding farms on the Cambodian border, in which the BUAV alleges wild monkeys may also be held; the existence of these farms is not referenced in the company's brochure, according to the BUAV.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070218140802/http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/monkeybusiness/about.htm "About Nafovanny"], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Home Office|British Home Office]] has said it has no knowledge of Nafovanny satellite farms. However, it also said that "This decision was premised upon the contractual arrangements having been entered into in good-faith whilst Nafovanny was still considered to be an acceptable source, and animals already selected for onward supply to the UK. The view was taken that proper provision would be made for the welfare of these animals prior to their being shipped to the UK – and that this could be verified from the records and findings on arrival." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/freedom-of-information/released-information/foi-archive-research1/4999-non-human-primates-overseas?view=Html "Questions on the acquisition and supply of non-human primates from overseas sources (Nafovanny)"], Home Office, February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customers==
The British government approved Nafovanny to export [[primate]]s to British laboratories in 1999.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The British [[Animal Procedures Committee|Animal Scientific Procedures Inspectorate]] visited Nafovanny in March 2005, and identified "shortcomings in animal accommodation and care," but since then the government has "received assurances and evidence that significant improvements have been made."&lt;ref name=HansardNov232006&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061123/text/61123w0016.htm "Primates"], ''Hansard'', November 23, 2006, Column 231W.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Viet Nam News'', 3,000 Nafovanny macaques were exported to the [[United States|U.S.]] for testing purposes in 2000.&lt;ref name=Tran&gt;Tran Dinh Thanh Lam.

'''Osama bin Laden's compound''', known locally as the '''Waziristan Haveli''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|وزیرستان حویلی}}}}), was an upper-class mansion that was used as a [[safe house]] for [[militant Islamist]] [[Osama bin Laden]], who was  [[Death of Osama bin Laden|shot and killed]] there by U.S. forces on May 2, 2011. The compound was located at the end of a dirt road 1,300 metres (0.8 mi) southwest of the [[Pakistan Military Academy]] in [[Bilal Town]], [[Abbottabad]], [[Pakistan]], a suburb housing many retired military officers. Bin Laden was reported to have evaded capture by living in a section of the house for at least five years, having no Internet or phone connection, and hiding away from the public, who were allegedly unaware of his presence.

Completed in 2005, the main buildings in the compound lay on a {{convert|3500|m2|sqft|adj=on}} plot of land, much larger than those of nearby houses. Its perimeter was 3.7- to 5.5-metre (12 to 18 ft) concrete walls topped with barbed wire, and there were two security gates. The compound had very few windows. Little more than five years old, the compound's ramshackle buildings were badly in need of repainting. The grounds contained a well-kept vegetable garden, rabbits, some 100 chickens and a cow. The house itself did not stand out architecturally from others in the neighbourhood, except for its size and exaggerated security measures; for example, the third-floor balcony had a 2-metre (7 ft) privacy wall. Photographs inside the house showed excessive clutter and modest furnishings. After the American mission, there was extensive interest in and reporting about the compound and its design. To date, the Pakistani government has not responded to any allegations as to who had built the structure.

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the U.S. [[Search for Osama bin Laden|searched for bin Laden]] for nearly 10 years. By tracking his courier [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]] to the compound, U.S. officials surmised that bin Laden was hiding there. During a raid on May 2, 2011, 24 members of the [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] arrived by helicopter, breached a wall using explosives, and entered the compound in search of bin Laden. After the operation was completed and bin Laden was killed, Pakistan demolished the structure in February 2012.

In the urban setting, the architecture of the bin Laden hideout was called by an architect as "surprisingly permanent – and surprisingly urban" and "sure to join [[Saddam Hussein]]'s last known address among the most notorious examples of hideout architecture in recent memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/05/the-architecture-of-assassination-looking-at-the-compound-where-osama-bin-laden-was-killed.html|title=Architecture on the lam: The compound where Osama bin Laden was killed|date=2 May 2011|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=4 May 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPtf41jt|archivedate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound was fortified with many safeguard features intended to confuse would-be invaders, and U.S. officials described the compound as "extraordinarily unique".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Osama bin Laden's hideaway was more fortress than home |last=Alleyne |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8488339/Osama-bin-Ladens-hideaway-was-more-fortress-than-home.html |work=Daily Telegraph |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associated Press]] identified the owner as [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]], who purchased the vacant land for the complex in 2004 and four adjoining lots between 2004 and 2005 for the equivalent of US$48,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/gungrey/Article_2011-05-04-AS-Pakistan-Bin-Laden/id-ab8058320c0f46dda2fafd95a34d8df2 |title=Property records give new insights into bin Laden|author1=Nahal Toosi  |author2=Zarar Khan |lastauthoramp=yes |agency=Associated Press|date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed between 2003 and 2005, the three-story structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/trail-that-led-from-guantanamo-to-a-1&amp;nbsp;m-compound-in-pakistan-2278032.html |last=Sengupta |first=Kim|title=Trail that led from Guantanamo to a $1&amp;nbsp;m compound in Pakistan |work=The Independent  |location=UK|date=3 May 2011|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was located on a [[dirt road]]&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-dead.html |title=Obama Calls World Safer After Death of Bin Laden|last=Myers|first=Steven Lee|author2=Elisabeth Bumiller |date=3 May 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|4|km|0}} northeast of the city centre of [[Abbottābad]].

Security cameras were found installed, and aerial photographs show several satellite dishes.&lt;ref name=Mobile/&gt; There were two security gates and the third-floor balcony had a two meter (7 ft) privacy wall. The compound measured {{convert|3500|m2|sqft}} in size, and had relatively few windows.&lt;ref name="rfe20110502"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rferl.org/content/osama_bin_laden_abbottabad_pakistan/16800510.html |title=Abbottabad, The Peaceful Pakistani City Where Osama Bin Laden Met His Violent End|date=2 May 2011|work=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compound was known as Waziristan Haveli ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|وزیرستان حویلی}}}}) by the local residents. The compound's casual name referred to [[Waziristan]], a region in Pakistan, and a ''[[haveli]]'', which means "[[mansion]]".&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |title=What was life like in the Bin Laden compound? |publisher=BBC |date=3 May 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13266944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was owned by a transporter from Waziristan; bin Laden previously spent time in the Waziristan area of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/05/03/was-osama-killed-by-us-troops-or-his-own-guard.html |title=Was Osama killed by US troops or his own guard? |author=Ismail Khan |work=Dawn |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main builders of the compound, Gul Mohammed, was instructed to construct the {{convert|5.5|m|ft|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="Mobile"/&gt; high perimeter fence and then to build another wall 2 metres (7 ft) tall around one of the dwellings. He became suspicious and when he asked about the huge, fort-like walls, he was told it was none of his business.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3563898/Osama-Bin-Ladens-builder-insists-he-only-knew-his-boss-as-The-Master.html|title=Osama Bin Laden's builder insists he only knew his boss as The Master|work=The Sun |location=UK |accessdate=5 May 2011|first=Nick|last=Parker|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mohammed, one or two men came to supervise the project and they were not stingy with funds.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; He was told to refer to the main occupant of the household as "The Master" even though he never met him.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

===Furnishings===

The house where the bin Laden family lived on the two upper floors was large and modestly furnished. It had "cheap foam mattresses, no air conditioning (but central heating) and old televisions."&lt;ref name="Guardian6"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/06/osama-bin-laden-family-compound|title=Osama bin Laden family compound|work=The Guardian  |location=UK|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=6 May 2011|first1=Jason|last1=Burke|first2=Saeed|last2=Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the bedrooms had an attached kitchen and a bathroom. One of the first floor rooms was furnished with a whiteboard, markers and textbooks, to serve as a classroom for the children in the house, who were [[home-schooled]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Guardian6"/&gt;

===Food===
The self-described brothers of the house known to the neighbours would frequently visit the local shops.&lt;ref name="Guardian6"/&gt; They would buy enough food to feed ten people, and purchased "the best brands—Nestle milk, the good-quality soaps and shampoos", [[Pepsi]] and [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-03/bin-laden-aides-bought-big-orders-of-pepsi-coke-grocer-says.html|title=Bin Laden aides bought big orders of Pepsi and Coke grocer says|publisher=Bloomberg|date=5 May 2011|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The food found at the house by the Pakistani authorities was basic, such as dates, nuts, eggs, olive oil and dried meat.&lt;ref name="Guardian6"/&gt; The brothers would visit Rasheed's corner store, about a minute's walk from the house, with young children for whom they bought sweets and soft drinks.&lt;ref name="Guardian6"/&gt; They also purchased bread from a local bakery.&lt;ref name="radiofree"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/hiding_in_plain_sight_how_neighbors_cant_believe_osama_lived_nextdoor/24090582.html|title='Can We Get Our Ball Back, Mister?' – Living Next Door To Osama Bin Laden|date=3 May 2011|publisher=Radio Free Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbits, 100 chickens and a cow were reared on the compound grounds. A vegetable garden at the back of the house was well-kept, and ''Shamraiz'', a neighbouring farmer, was paid to plant vegetables about twice a year. Days before the May 2011 raid ''Shamraiz'' was called to plough additional ground in the compound using a tractor. He never went inside the house itself.&lt;ref name="Guardian6"/&gt;

The compound had an adjacent grazing area that hosted cows and a buffalo as well as a deep water well, possibly allowing it a water supply separate from the local municipality.

American intelligence officials discovered bin Laden's whereabouts by tracking one of his couriers, [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]].

====Local residents====
Locals disclosed details about their interactions with the residents of the compound to an [[Associated Press|AP]] journalist in Pakistan. A woman who distributed [[polio vaccine]]s to the compound said she saw expensive [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] parked inside. The men received the vaccine and instructed her to leave. A woman in her 70s said one of the men from the hideaway gave her a ride to the market in rainy weather. Her grandchildren played with the children living in the house, and received rabbits as presents. One farmer said, "People were skeptical in this neighbourhood about this place and these guys. They used to gossip, say they were [[smuggler]]s or [[drug dealer]]s. People would complain that even with such a big house they didn't invite the poor or distribute charity." Present at some neighbourhood funerals, two men from the compound were "tall, fair skinned and bearded" and self-identified as cousins from elsewhere in the region.&lt;ref name="Toosi"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42884499/ns/world_news-death_of_bin_laden/ |title=Bin Laden's neighbors noticed unusual things |last=Toosi |first=Nahal |author2=Khan, Zarar |work=[[MSNBC]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=3 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPmsITRm |archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors said that if a child's ball went over the fence, the men in the compound did not return that ball; instead they paid the child 100–150 [[Pakistani rupee]]s (about US$2–$3), many times the value of the ball.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hodge|first=Amanda|title=Security agencies were 'clueless' but neighbourhood kids on the ball|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/security-agencies-were-clueless-but-neighbourhood-kids-on-the-ball/news-story/01c4667851b1792c4063a922a89243e3?sv=f25964b9163871651dcea54d5a268d39|accessdate=28 Oct 2018|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17742">{{Insolvency}}

'''Provisional liquidation''' is a process which exists as part of the [[insolvency|corporate insolvency]] laws of a number of [[common law jurisdictions]] whereby after the lodging of a petition for the [[winding-up]] of a [[company]] by the court, but before the court hears and determines the petition, the court may appoint a liquidator on a "provisional" basis.&lt;ref name=Practical&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-384-0074?service=finance |title=Provisional liquidation: a quick guide |publisher=Practical Law |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The provisional liquidator is appointed to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the ''[[status quo]]'' pending the hearing of the petition.)  Unlike a conventional [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]], a provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company's assets to [[creditor]]s.&lt;ref name=Worrells&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worrells.net.au/InsolvencyResources/FactsheetArticle.aspx?ArticleId=14 |title=Provisional Liquidation |publisher=Worrells |author= |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some type of allegation of [[fraud]] or other misconduct relating to the company.&lt;ref name=Fraud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=159e63e1-69ec-43c9-af12-e9b516fc0f01|title=Provisional liquidation and fraud |publisher=Lexology|author=Steven Fennell and Darren Bradshaw|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

Typically, an application for the appointment of a provisional liquidator is made by either:&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;
# a creditor, where they are concerned that the assets of the company are at risk or might be dissipated or put beyond the reach of creditors during the period before the winding up application is heard;
# the shareholders, where they are concerned that the [[board of directors|directors of the company]] are acting improperly; or
# the company itself.  This may arise due to a dispute between directors and other officers, or because the company is insolvent and the directors do not want to risk insolvent trading claims in the period before an official liquidator is appointed.  In some jurisdictions (but not all) the company may apply to put itself into provisional liquidation to shield itself from creditor claims whilst it tries to implement a [[restructuring]].

The remedy is an exceptional one, and most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator are made because of concerns about some type of material impropriety.&lt;ref name=Fraud /&gt;  In exceptional cases it is also possible for public authorities to apply for the appointment of a provisional liquidator to protect the public interest from fraud or other similar conduct, although this is much less common.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite bailii|litigants=Re Treasure Traders Corporation Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=2774}}, in which the company was operating an unlawful lottery.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court invariably has a discretion whether to appoint a provisional liquidator.  A court will not normally approve the application unless it is satisfied that there is a strong liklihood that a liquidator will be appointed on the substantive application.  But even if the company is likely to go into liquidation, provisional liquidation is still an exceptional interim or "emergency remedy".&lt;ref name=Kill &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3harecourt.com/assets/asset-store/file/articles/Lewis-Yousuf.pdf |title=Provisional liquidations - kill or cure? |publisher=Business Rescue |author=Daniel Lewis and Nyla Yousuf |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There needs to be special reasons for the appointment of a provisional liquidator in the interim period.  Normally this is because the assets must face a high risk of dissipation or there must be some other urgent reason why a liquidator is required for the interim period.&lt;ref name=Clayton &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claytonutz.com/area_of_law/restructuring_and_insolvency/docs/ProvisionalLiquid.pdf |title=Restructuring &amp; Insolvency - Provisional liquidation |publisher=[[Clayton Utz]] |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications are most likely to be granted in situations where:&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;
* it is necessary to have an independent person investigate the company and its affairs;
* there was an urgent need to act to preserve assets of the company;
* there was a material [[conflict of interest]] between a director and the company; or
* there had been impropriety in the conduct of company’s affairs.

Conversely, because there needs to be some urgency or risk of dissipation of assets, applications are likely to be refused if:&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;
* the only reason relied on by a creditor was that the company was insolvent (without more);
* an [[administrative receiver]] or [[administrator (law)|administrator]] had already been appointed, negating the risk of dissipation of assets;
* the application was made for an improper purpose, such as to maximise the applicant’s own position;
* the application was made simply to try and permit the company to continue to trade where the company is insolvency and clearly should be wound up; or
* there was a genuine dispute as to the creditor’s debt.

Given their nature, applications for provisional liquidation are often made urgently and without giving notice to the company or its directors.  Where the application is made without notice:&lt;ref name=Practical /&gt;
# the applicant is under a duty to give "full and frank disclosure" to the court of all material facts (including any facts which are adverse to the applicant); and
# the applicant will normally have to give an undertaking in damages to compensate the company for any loss caused if it subsequently transpires after a full hearing that the order should not have been.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Highfield Commodities Ltd'' [1984] BCLC 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==

If the court makes the order then a provisional liquidator is appointed over the company, and the control of all assets of the company, and the conduct of any business and other affairs of the company are transferred to the provisional liquidator.  The directors cease to have any authority.&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;  In almost all jurisdictions, the provisional liquidator will normally have to be a licensed insovency practitioner.   

The provisional liquidator will generally only have the powers and functions conferred upon him or her by the order of the court.  It is not normally part of the role of a provisional liquidator to collect and sell the assets of the company, or otherwise take steps in relation to the actual winding up the company.  The principal reason for the appointment is the preservation of the company's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the common functions of a provisional liquidator is to investigate whether the company's property has been misappropriated or its business has been wrongfully conducted.  But generally speaking a provisional liquidator will not have power to bring proceedings on behalf of the company for [[wrongful trading]], or to challenge transactions as [[undervalue transaction]]s or [[unfair preference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=In the matter of Overnight Limited|year=2009|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==

Provisional liquidation will normally come to an end in one of three ways:&lt;ref name=Practical /&gt;
# a full winding up order is made;
# an order of the court is made discharging the provisional liquidation (normally at an ''inter partes'' hearing to challenge the original appointment); or
# the winding up petition itself is dismissed.

==Specific jurisdictions==

The effect of provisional liquidation varies from jurisdiction to the jurisdiction.

===Australia===

{{Main|Australian insolvency law}}

In Australia provisional liquidation is regulated by section 472(2) of [[Corporations Act 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s472.html|title=Corporations Act 2001, section 472|accessdate=30 July 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia provisional liquidators must be licensed insolvency practitioners.&lt;ref name=Worrells /&gt;

===British Virgin Islands===

{{Main|British Virgin Islands bankruptcy law}}

Under British Virgin Islands law provisional liquidation is regulated by section 170(4) of the Insolvency Act 2003.&lt;ref name=BVI&gt;{{cite book|title=British Virgin Islands Commercial Law|author=[[Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels]]|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|edition=3rd|year=2014|isbn=9789626615294|at=7.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Akai Holdings Limited v Brinlow Investments Limited''&lt;ref&gt;(BVIHCV 2006/0134) at [44] onwards.&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that an applicant would need to show four things:
# a petition before the court for the appointment of a liquidator;
# a good arguable case that a ground for the appointment of a liquidator exists;
# a good arguable case that the applicant has the necessary standing; and
# that the court should exercise its discretion to maintain the ''status quo'' in relation to the company’s assets.

===Canada===

In Canada provision liquidation is regulated under section 28 of the Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/w-11/page-8.html |title=Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11) |publisher=Justice Laws Website |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cayman Islands===

{{Main|Cayman Islands bankruptcy law}}

In the Cayman Islands provisional liquidation is principally regulated by section 104(3) of the Companies Law (2013) Revision.  One unusual feature of provisional liquidation in Cayman is that it is possible to appoint a provisional liquidator and still allow the directors to retain their powers of management.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Winding Up Rules (2008 Revision), Order 4, rule 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;  This in part facilitates a slightly unusual use of provisional liquidation in the Cayman Islands as part of a [[debtor in possession]] corporate rehabilitation prcoess.  The company itself will apply for an order for provisional liquidation, and provisional liquidators are appointed which effectively creates a stay on the claims of [[unsecured creditor]]s.  The  board of directors can then use that "breathing space" to try and implement a restructuring of the company's debts pursuant to a [[scheme of arrangement]], or pursuant to an international restructuring process in the courts of another jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=Maples &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maplesandcalder.com/news/article/cayman-islands-provisional-liquidations-in-support-of-chapter-11-proceedings-433/ |title=Cayman Islands Provisional Liquidations in Support of Chapter 11 Proceedings |publisher=[[Maples and Calder]] |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach has not been rejected in the courts of other jurisdictions (such as Hong Kong),&lt;ref name=Legend &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f806367c-2c17-db11-8a10-00065bfd3168 |title=Corporate Rescue: The Need for Legislation |publisher=International Law Office |author=Andrew Kinnison and Jacky Yeung |date=4 August 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but accepted in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;pg=PT136&amp;lpg=PT136&amp;dq=new+zealand+law+provisional+liquidation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-jp6iPhZb&amp;sig=mwLDD1xUQfxnM6jdHn3ywmCg6Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20zealand%20law%20provisional%20liquidation&amp;f=false |title=Principles of International Insolvency |publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |author=Philip R. Wood |isbn=9781847032102 |year=2007 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong there are three types of provisional liquidators.&lt;ref name=BWF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briscoewongferrier.com/web2/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ProvisionalLiquidators1.pdf |title=Provisional Liquidators |publisher=Briscoe Wong Ferrier |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are "traditional" provisional liquidators, appointed under section 193 of the Hong Kong Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32); there are also provisional liquidators appointed pursuant to a members' voluntary liquidation under section 228A of the Ordinance, and there are "Panel T" appointments under section 194(1A) of the Ordinance whereby the Official Receiver is appointed as provisional liquidator.  

Since the decision in the ''Legend'' case in 2006&lt;ref&gt;''Re Legend International Resorts Ltd'' [2006] 2 HKLRD 192&lt;/ref&gt; provisional liquidation may not be used as a means of shielding the company from creditor's claims to facilitate a restructuring in Hong Kong,&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; although prior to that date the practice was relatively common.&lt;ref name=BWF /&gt;

===South Africa===

In South Africa "provisional liquidation" has a very different meaning.  When a creditor or other person applies to the court for the liquidation of a business, then the order is first made a provisional basis, and then subsequent confirmed (or not) at a full hearing, much like a ''decree nisi'' and a ''decree absolut'' in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findanattorney.co.za/content_business-liquidation|title=Liquidating a Business in South Africa|publisher=FindanAttorney|author=Nanika Prinsloo|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|United Kingdom insolvency law}}
In the United Kingdom the power to appoint a provisional liquidator is found in section 135(1), of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], and it is regarded as an "emergency procedure".&lt;Ref name=Practical /&gt;  The categories of persons who may apply for the appointment are set out at rule 4.25(1) of the Insolvency Rules 1986.&lt;ref&gt;SI 1925 of 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under English law all provisional liquidators are required to be licensed insolvency practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 1986, section 388(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; 
If, upon the application for the appointment of a liquidator, there are concerns about potential dissipation of assets, or misconduct on the part of the directors, then the court may order the appointment of a [[provisional liquidator]].&lt;ref name=PL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-384-0074?service=finance |title=Provisional liquidation: a quick guide |publisher=Practical Law |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Provisional liquidation is essentially an 
"emergency procedure".  A provisional liquidator may only be appointed by the court only after a winding-up petition has been presented&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 1986 s 135(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  The main reason for appointing a provisional liquidator is normally to preserve the company's assets.  In practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some kind of [[fraud]] or other misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=159e63e1-69ec-43c9-af12-e9b516fc0f01|title=Provisional liquidation and fraud |publisher=Lexology|author=Steven Fennell and Darren Bradshaw|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The applicant will normally need to show that (a) it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and (b) the company's assets are at risk prior to the hearing of the petition (which includes either dissipation of the company's assets, or the potential loss or destruction of the company's books and records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=Revenue &amp; Customs v Rochdale Drinks Distributors Ltd|year=2011|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=1116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, it will normally be necessary to establish either (or both) that: (a) the company is clearly insolvent, and it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and/or (b) there has been the type of misconduct that would justify a just and equitable winding-up.  An appointment of a provisional liquidator may also be made where it is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=Re Treasure Traders Corporation Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=2774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the emergency nature of the remedy applications for provisional liquidation are very often made urgently and without giving notice to the company.  In such cases the applicant is under a legal obligation to give full and frank disclosure to the court of all material facts, including facts which are adverse to the applicant's own case.  The applicant will also normally be required to give an undertaking in damages in the event the court subsequently determines that the order should not have been made to compensate the company for any damage caused to it by the appointment.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Highfield Commodities Ltd'' [1984] BCLC 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a provisional liquidator is appointed then the powers of the company's directors are effectively terminated, and the board will retain only a residual power to apply to dismiss or resist the winding-up petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bailii|litigants=Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd|year=2005|court=EWHC|division=Ch|num=1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appointment of a provisional liquidator comes to an end when:&lt;ref name=PL /&gt;
# a liquidator is appointed at a full hearing;
# the provisional liquidator is discharged by order of the court; or
# the underlying winding up petition is dismissed.

'''''Rhythm of Structure''''' is a multimedia interdisciplinary project founded in 2003. It features a series of exhibitions, performances, and academic projects that explore the interconnecting structures and process of [[mathematics and art]], and language, as way to advance a movement of mathematical expression across the arts, across creative collaborative communities celebrating the rhythm and patterns of both ideas of the mind and the physical reality of nature.

==Introduction==
''Rhythm of Structure'', as an expanding series of art exhibitions, performances, videos/films and publications created and curated by multimedia mathematical artist and writer [[John Sims (artist)|John Sims]], explores and celebrates the intersecting [[structure]]s of mathematics, art, community, and nature.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Q&amp;A: John Sims on mathematical art|journal=Nature|date=15 April 2010|volume=464|page=983|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/464983a.pdf?origin=ppub|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bombmagazine"&gt;{{cite web |author1=A.M.

From his catalog essay from the ''Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic exhibition'', Sims sets the curatorial theme where he writes: "Mathematics, as a parameter of human consciousness in an indispensable conceptual technology, essential is seeing beyond the retinal and knowing beyond the intuitive. The language and process of mathematics, as elements of, foundation for art, inform an analytic expressive condition that inspires a visual reckoning for a convergence: from the illustrative to the metaphysical to the poetic. And in the dialectic of visual art call and text performative response, there is an inter-dimensional conversation where the twisting structures of language, vision and human ways give birth to the spiritual lattice of a social geometry, a community constructivism -- a place of connections, where emotional calculations meet spirited abstraction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Sims|title=Rhythm of Structure Catalogue - A John Sims Project|date=Oct 8, 2011|publisher=Selby Gallery, Ringling College of Art and Design|page=7|url=https://issuu.com/mathartist/docs/testcata1|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First premiering at the Fire Patrol No.5 Gallery in 2003, with the show ''Rhythm of Structure: MathArt'' in [[Harlem]]. This interdisciplinary project has featured numerous exhibitions around the country collaborating with many notable artists, writers, and musicians including: [[Sol Lewitt]], [[Adrian Piper]], [[Dorothea Rockburne]], [[Alvin D. Loving|Al Loving]],[[Joe Overstreet]], [[Howardena Pindell]], [[Helaman Ferguson]], [[John A. Hiigli|John Hiigli]], [[Vandorn Hinnant]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Dread Scott]], [[DJ Spooky|Paul D. Miller]], [[Bob Holman]], Kate Rushin, [[Roman Verostko]], Joan Waltemath, [[Tara Betts]], [[Brent Collins]], Mike Field, Kazmier Maslanka, Ken Hiratsuka, Yael Acher Moriano, [[Richard Kostelanetz]], [[Kristin Prevallet]], John Sims, and former U.S. Poet Laureate [[Mark Strand]].&lt;ref name="bathshebagrossman"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shows |url=https://www.bathsheba.com/artist/shows.html |website=Bathsheba Sculpture |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agnesdenes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Exhibitions |url=http://www.agnesdenesstudio.com/exhibitions.html |website=Agnes Denes |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the exhibitions, another major aim of ''Rhythm of Structure'' is the building of a interdisciplinary creative community around the intersection of mathematics and all forms of art, as it might inspire new art, innovation art and mathematics education, and increased respect and understanding of the [[rhythm]] and structure of nature itself. Such community experiences are created through call and response performances, social media and special video music projects such as The Rhythm of Structure and The Pi Day Anthem featuring John Sims and Vi Hart .&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection|url=http://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1085|website=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pi Day Anthem: Mathematics, Art and Beyond|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-sims-/pi-day-mathematics-art-an_b_9411708.html|website=HuffPost|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Rhythm of Structure has its beginnings in Sims’ work as one of the international curators for the exhibition ''Science in the Arts - Art in the Sciences'', a city wide exhibition, in conjunction with the [[UNESCO#General Conference|UNESCO-ICSU World Conference of Science]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science in the Arts - Art in the Sciences|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/artsci.html|website=Doug Dunham|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A World of Science|journal=UNESCO|date=Oct 2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=6|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001307/130715e.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to the exhibition, ''MathArt/ArtMath'', curated by John Sims (then Coordinator of Mathematics at Ringling)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist John Sims to explore correlation between quilting, math, community|url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2014/10/23/Artist+John+Sims+to+explore+correlation+between+quilting,+math,+community|website=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acclaimed "Math Artist" John Sims to speak at Texas State|url=http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2005/04/Sims041105.html|website=Texas State|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kevin Dean, at the Selby Gallery [[Ringling College of Art and Design]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="creativeloafing"&gt;{{cite web |title=Numbers Man |url=https://www.cltampa.com/arts-entertainment/article/20721530/numbers-man |website=Creative Loafing Tampa Bay |accessdate=11 June 2018 |date=21 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Art And The Mathematical Instinct |date=2004 |publisher=Tweed Museum Of Art, University of Minnesota |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iLPpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Mathart/artmath%22&amp;dq=%22Mathart/artmath%22|isbn=9781889523279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artist John Sims not coming to campus, but exhibit still planned at Gettysburg College |url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/press_release_detail.dot?id=806fcc2d-7ed5-4338-bdbc-67845b9a648e |website=News @ Gettysburg |accessdate=13 June 2018 |date=30 Aug 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show presented a general survey of art inspired and framed by mathematics ideas of mostly American [[Modern art|modern]] and [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] artists, as well as mathematicians working in the area of visual mathematics.

After the ''MathArt/ArtMath'' exhibition, Sims began working on a text about the nature of mathematical art leading to his chapter, ''Trees, Roots and a Brain: A Metaphorical Foundation for Mathematical Art'', in the book ''Mathematics and Culture II: Visual Perfection: Mathematics and Creativity''. In his chapter, he presents his ideas on the interconnection of mathematics, [[Environmental art|art and nature]], setting the stage for his next group of exhibitions called ''Rhythm of Structure''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics and Culture II |date=2005 |publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-540-26443-9 |pages=163–170 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26443-4_14 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NYU course==
In the spring of 2010, in connection to the ''Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection'' at the Bowery Poetry Club, John Sims was invited to teach a course for the department of Art and Public Policy at [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. The course, "Rhythm of Structure: Trees, Flags and Clock", examined the mechanisms/structures of developing John Sims' three large-scale interdisciplinary art projects (as case studies), which explored issues of social justice, community building, and the politics of grand scale works. With these multi-level projects-in-progress, which intersect the space of art with mathematics, visual politics, and social networking,  the course investigated the various strategies and challenges in creating a system of objects-texts-sounds-works that employs the tools of social organizing, media, technology, [[culture jamming]], performance, poetry, and satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Art &amp; Public Policy: Past Courses |url=http://tisch.nyu.edu/art-public-policy/courses/course-archive |website=NYU Tisch |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtubestructureclass"&gt;{{cite web |title=MathArtPoem by John Sims and Rhythm of Structure Class |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGFdqHEGA9U |website=YouTube |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17362">The '''September Six''' were six members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) who were excommunicated or disfellowshipped by the church in September 1993, allegedly
for publishing scholarly work against Mormon doctrine or criticizing church doctrine or leadership. The term "September Six" was coined by ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' and was used in the [[mass media|media]] and subsequent discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=58060420&amp;itype=CMSID Salt Lake Tribune, June 16, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church's action was referred to by some as evidence of an [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] posture on the part of church leadership.&lt;ref name="Ostling351"&gt;

== Individuals ==&lt;!--in chronological order of sanctions--&gt;

=== Lynne Kanavel Whitesides ===
Lynne Kanavel Whitesides is a [[Mormon feminism|Mormon feminist]] and is noted for speaking on the [[Heavenly Mother (Latter Day Saints)|Mother in Heaven]]. Whitesides was the first of the group to experience church discipline and was disfellowshipped September 14, 1993. Though technically still a member, Whitesides claims that she "burst" out of the church and her marriage in 1993, and she now considers herself a practitioner of Native American philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|oKjASwbutsE|Whitesides, Lynne. "Spiritual Paths After September 1993." Sunstone Symposium, 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avraham Gileadi ===
[[Avraham Gileadi]] is a Hebrew scholar and literary analyst, who is considered theologically conservative. Following his 1981 Ph.D. in Ancient Studies from [[Brigham Young University]], he published a new interpretive translation of the [[Book of Isaiah]] in 1988 and a study of its eschatological prophesies in 1991. Mormon scholars, including [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Truman G. Madsen]] and [[Ellis Rasmussen]], praised his work, but his argument that the Isaiah prophesies pointed to a human "Davidic king" who would emerge in the [[Last Days]], apart from Jesus Christ, was controversial, and his second book was pulled from the shelves by its publisher, church-owned [[Deseret Book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=4&amp;num=1&amp;id=86 |title=Review of "The Book of Isaiah: A New Translation with Interpretive Keys from the Book of Mormon" |accessdate=2014-06-18 |last=Porter |first=Bruce |coauthors= |date=1992 |work=Review of Books on the Book of Mormon |publisher= [[Maxwell Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for his excommunication on September 15 are unclear. According to Margaret Toscano (whose husband was among the September Six and who would also later be excommunicated), Gileadi's "books interpreting Mormon scripture challenged the exclusive right of leaders to define doctrine,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.thelizlibrary.org/undelete/library/library012.html |contribution= What other judgment can I judge by but my own? |work= The Liz Library |first= Margaret Merrill |last= Toscano |date= nd |publisher= Irene Stuber at undelete.org, reprinted by The Liz Library }}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Gileadi himself disputes that characterization.&lt;ref name="Testimony"/&gt; The church afterwards reversed its disciplinary action against him and expunged it from the church's records, which is now officially regarded as having never happened.&lt;ref name="Testimony"&gt;{{citation |url= http://avrahamgileaditestimony.blogspot.com |title= Avraham Gileadi Testimony |accessdate= 2012-06-12 |date= 14 June 2012 |work= Judeo-Mormon Perspectives |publisher= [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gileadi is currently an active member of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=840 |title=Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism |accessdate=2012-08-19 |last=Hanks |first=Maxine |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[http://www.signaturebooks.com Signature Books]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/zion@topica.com/msg04375.html |title=The September Six Today |accessdate=2009-02-14 |last=Redelfs |first=John W. |coauthors= |date=2003-08-09 |work= |publisher=[http://www.mail-archive.com The Mail Archive]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has continued to write books on Isaiah, including ''The Literary Message of Isaiah'' (2002) and ''Isaiah Decoded: Ascending the Ladder to Heaven'' (2002).

=== Paul Toscano ===
Paul Toscano is a Salt Lake City attorney who co-authored, with Margaret Merrill Toscano, a controversial book, ''Strangers in Paradox: Explorations in Mormon Theology'' (1990), and in 1992, he co-founded [[Mormon Alliance|The Mormon Alliance]]. He later wrote the book '' The Sanctity of Dissent'' (1994) and its sequel, ''The Sacrament of Doubt'' (2007).

He was excommunicated from the church on September 19, 1993. The reasons for his excommunication, as reportedly given by church leaders, were apostasy and false teaching. According to Toscano, the actual reason was insubordination in refusing to curb his sharp criticism of LDS Church leaders' preference for legalism, ecclesiastical tyranny, white-washed Mormon history, and hierarchical authoritarianism, which privilege the image of the corporate LDS Church above its commitment to its members, to the teachings and the revelations of founder [[Joseph Smith]], and to the gospel of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toscano |first= Paul |chapter="The Sanctity of Dissent" |title= Dissent and the Failure of Leadership |editor= Stephen Banks (ed.), series ed.

In 2007, Toscano wrote that he lost his faith "like losing your eyesight after an accident." He regrets that LDS Church leaders have disregarded his criticisms of what he considers the church's growing anti-intellectualism, homophobia, misogyny, and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toscano|first=Paul|title=The Sacrament of Doubt|publisher=Signature Books|year=2007|isbn=1-56085-146-5|pages=147–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toscano's wife, Margaret, faced her own disciplinary council for her doctrinal and feminist views and was excommunicated on November 30, 2000. Some view her excommunication as constituting a "seventh" member of the September Six, as she was summoned in 1993, but ecclesiastical focus shifted to her husband. Margaret's discipline was delayed until 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL01272.mp3 ''Tidying Up Loose Ends?: The November 2000 Excommunication of Margaret Toscano], 2001 Salt Lake Sunstone Symposium, Sunstone Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret later wrote "The Missing Rib: The Forgotten Place of Queens and Priestesses in the Establishment of Zion" as well as the tenth chapter of ''Transforming the Faiths of our Fathers: Women who Changed American Religion'' (2004), edited by Ann Braude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/5528550/TOC |title=Table of Contents: Transforming the faiths of our fathers: |publisher=Catalog.lib.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maxine Hanks ===
Maxine Hanks is a Mormon feminist theologian, who compiled and edited the book [http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=840 ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism''] (1992). She was excommunicated on September 19, along with fellow contributor [[D. Michael Quinn]]. In February 2012, Hanks was [[rebaptism|rebaptized]] as a member of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/54514350-80/hanks-mormon-lds-church.html.csp ''Excommunicated Mormon to tell how she came back to the faith'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lavina Fielding Anderson ===
[[Lavina Fielding Anderson]] is a Mormon feminist writer who edited the books ''Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective'' (1992) and  ''[[Lucy's Book]]'', the definitive edition of the [[Lucy Mack Smith]] narrative. She is a former editor for the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' and served as editor for the ''[[Journal of Mormon History]]'' from 1991 to May 2009. She was excommunicated September 23.

Anderson continues to attend LDS Church services as a non-member. She writes on Mormon issues, including editing the multi-volume ''Case Reports of the Mormon Alliance'', an ongoing collection of interviews with Mormons who believe they were unfairly disciplined by the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Case Reports of the Mormon Alliance |url= http://mormonalliance.org/casereports/casereports.htm |publisher= [[Mormon Alliance]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021004007/http://mormonalliance.org/casereports/casereports.htm |archivedate= 2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== D. Michael Quinn ===
{{main|D. Michael Quinn}}
[[D. Michael Quinn]] is a Mormon historian. Among other studies, he documented LDS Church-sanctioned [[plural marriage|polygamy]] from 1890 until 1904, after the [[1890 Manifesto]] that officially abandoned the practice.&lt;ref&gt;"LDS Church Authority and New Plural Marriages, 1890-1904," ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' [http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/dialogue&amp;CISOPTR=15581&amp;REC=7 18 (Spring 1985) 9-105]&lt;/ref&gt; He also authored the 1987 book, ''Early Mormonism and the Magic World View'', which argues that early Mormon leaders were greatly influenced by [[folk magic]] and superstitious beliefs including [[scrying|stone looking]], [[talisman|charms]], and [[divining rods]]. He was excommunicated September 26. 

Quinn had been summoned to a disciplinary council to answer charges of "conduct unbecoming a member of the Church and apostasy," including "'very sensitive and highly confidential' matters that were not related to Michael's historical writings."&lt;ref name = dnamormons/&gt; Anderson has suggested that the "allusion to Michael's sexual orientation, which Michael had not yet made public, was unmistakable."&lt;ref name = dnamormons/&gt;

Quinn has since published several critical studies of Mormon hierarchy, including his two-volume work of ''The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power'' and ''The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power''. He also authored the 1996 book ''Same-Sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-Century Americans: A Mormon Example'', which argues that homosexuality was common among early Mormons and was not seen as a serious sin or transgression.

Despite his excommunication and critical writings, Quinn, who is now [[openly gay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/interviews/quinn.html |title=Interview of D. Michael Quinn |author= |date=30 April 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |work= |publisher=[[PBS]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; still considers himself to be a Latter-day Saint.&lt;ref name = dnamormons&gt;Lavina Fielding Anderson. "DNA Mormon: D. Michael Quinn," in ''Mormon Mavericks: Essays on Dissenters'', edited by John Sillitoe and Susan Staker, Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002, pp. 329-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church measures taken==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
Except for Whitesides, all of the September Six were [[Disciplinary council#Possible outcomes|excommunicated]]. Whitesides was [[Disciplinary council#Possible outcomes|disfellowshipped]], a lesser sanction that does not formally expel one from church membership. To date, three of the September Six have retained or regained church membership: Avraham Gileadi&lt;ref&gt;Fidel, Steve. [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/476161/SCHOLAR-REBAPTIZED-INTO-LDS-CHURCH.html?pg=all "Scholar Rebaptized Into LDS Church."] ''Salt Lake City and Utah Breaking News.'' ''Deseret News,'' 8 March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Maxine Hanks,&lt;ref&gt;Stack, Peggy Fletcher.

''The Salt Lake Tribune'', 26 July 2012. Web. 09 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; who were rebaptized, and Lynne Whitesides, who remains a disfellowshipped member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/sltrib/news/58060420-78/mormon-church-lds-excommunicated.html.csp|title=Where Mormonism's 'September Six' are now|last=Tribune|first=Peggy Fletcher Stack  The Salt Lake|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the LDS Church sometimes announces that a prominent member has been excommunicated, the default policy is to refuse to publicly discuss details about the reasons for any excommunication, even if details of the proceedings are made public by that person. Such disciplinary proceedings are typically undertaken locally, initiated by leaders at the [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]] or [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] level, but at least one of the September Six has suggested that his excommunication was orchestrated by higher-ranking LDS Church leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2012/11/d_michael_quinn_and_mormon_excommunication_the_complicated_life_of_a_mormon.single.html|title=The Case of the Mormon Historian: What happened when Michael Quinn challenged the history of the church he loved|first=David|last=Haglund|publisher=Slate|date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procedures pertaining to the organization of these disciplinary councils are found in the LDS Church's scriptural ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'' [http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/102?lang=eng section 102] as well as in the church's administrative ''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1]]''; members who are summoned to the councils are notified beforehand by their local church leaders.

The LDS Church later excommunicated sisters [[Janice Merrill Allred]] in 1995 and Margaret Merrill Toscano in 2000, who had collaborated with several of the September Six and were also involved in disciplinary actions during 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Allred, Janice, 1997. "My Struggle for a More Loving, Tolerant, and Egalitarian Church", ''Case Reports of the Mormon Alliance'' 2(4). http://mormon-alliance.org/casereports/volume2/part4/v2p4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the summons sent to each of the six (specifying that their behavior was "contrary to the laws and order of the church"), the LDS Church's is silent on why a member was disciplined.

      <comment>rv, he is not called Sinbad in English sources. Also the original name is in fact 'Sunpadh', as Sinbad is a Arabicized version.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4891">'''Sunpadh''' ({{lang-fa|سندباد}}; also spelled '''Sunpad''' and '''Sunbadh''') was an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] nobleman from the [[House of Karen]], who incited an uprising against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the 8th century.

== Background ==
Sunpadh was a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] nobleman, who was a native of a village called Ahan in [[Nishapur]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1985–2007|loc=v. 28: p. 44}} He most likely belonged to the ancient [[House of Karen]], formerly one of the [[Seven Parthian clans|seven great families]] of the pre-Islamic [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] eras.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2017}} Khorasan had originally been a fief of the Karenids, but the family lost control of the province at the [[battle of Nishapur]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest of Iran]], thus forcing many Karenid nobles to withdraw to Tabaristan, where a branch of the family, the [[Qarinvand dynasty]], had managed to withstand the Arab incursions.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2017}}

== Revolt ==
Following the betrayal and subsequent death of the Iranian general [[Abu Muslim]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] (r. 754-775) in 755, the enraged Sunpadh revolted. He captured the cities of Nishapur, [[Qumis, Iran|Qumis]], and [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], and was called ''"Firuz [[ispahbadh]]"'' ("the victorious ''ispahbadh''"). At Ray, he seized the treasuries of Abu Muslim.{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1985–2007|loc=v. 28: p. 44}} Most of his supporters were from [[Jibal]] and [[Tabaristan]]—the [[Dabuyid dynasty|Dabuyid]] ruler, [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Khurshid]] (r. 740–760), supported the anti-Abbasid rebellion of Sunpadh, and was in return given a part of Abu Muslim's treasure. 

According to [[Nizam al-Mulk]], [[Ibn al-Athir]], and [[Mīr-Khvānd|Mirkhvand]], Sunpadh swore to march on [[Mecca]] and destroy the [[Kaaba]]. However, according to Patricia Crone, this is unlikely, who says "the idea that he should have rushed off in anger from Nishapur in order singlehandedly to bring down the caliphate and Islam is absurd."{{sfn|Crone|2012|p=38}} Other sources state that Sunpadh declared himself as a prophet, and disagreed on Abu Muslim's death, claiming to be his mediator. Sunpadh allegedly further preached that "Abu Muslim has not died, and when Mansur meant to slay him, he chanted God's great name, turned into a white dove and flew away. Now he is standing with [[Mahdi]] and [[Mazdak]] in a castle of copper and they shall emerge by and by." This, however, is a misrepresentation of Sunpadh, whose intention by revolting, was most likely to remove the Muslims from power.{{sfn|Crone|2012|p=38}}

A force of 10,000 Abbasid troops under Jahwar ibn Marrar al-Ijli was shortly sent towards Sunpadh—they clashed between [[Hamadan]] and Ray, where Sunpadh was defeated and routed.{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1985–2007|loc=v. 28: p. 45}} According to the historian [[Ibn Isfandiyar]], countless of Abu Muslim's and Sunpadh's supporters were killed in the defeat that their bones were still noticeable in 912.{{sfn|Crone|2012|p=36}} Sunpadh then fled to Tabaristan, but was killed there by one of Khurshid's cousins, ostensibly because he had failed to show the man proper respect. It is possible, however, that the murder was instigated by Khurshid, in the hope of acquiring the remainder of Abu Muslim's treasure.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2017|pp=314–315}}

The '''TCR International Series''' was an international [[Touring car racing|touring car]] championship. The championship was promoted by World Sporting Consulting (WSC), founded by former World Touring Car Championship manager [[Marcello Lotti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/07/04/former-wtcc-boss-marcello-lotti-behind-new-tc3-series/|title=Former WTCC boss Marcello Lotti behind new TC3 series|work=TouringCarTimes.com|publisher=Hudson, Neil|date=4 July 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was marketed as a cost-effective spin-off of the WTCC, targeted at [[C-segment]] [[hatchbacks]] production-based touring cars. The title TCR follows the naming convention now used by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] to classify the cars that compete in touring car racing, with TC1 referring to the top tier as used by the [[World Touring Car Championship|FIA WTCC]] and TC2 referring to the legacy cars which principally compete in the [[European Touring Car Cup|FIA ETCC]].

On 6 December 2017, FIA’s World Motorsport Council announced that the series will merge with [[World Touring Car Championship]] and [[European Touring Car Cup]] starting in [[2018 World Touring Car Cup|2018]].

==Announcements in 2014==
On 15 July Lotti revealed further details on the TCR series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/07/15/marcello-lotti-reveals-further-details-on-tc3-series/|title=Marcello Lotti reveals further details on TC3 series|work=TouringCarTimes.com|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the same day it was announced that the TCR series will award a Drivers' Championship title and a Teams' Championship title. The number of teams will be limited to eight and the number of competitors to twenty-four. It was also announced that the series will run alongside [[2015 Formula One season|Formula One]] at selected events.&lt;br&gt;
On 21 July more details about the series became available:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/07/21/initial-view-of-new-tc3-series-race-format-and-calendar/|title=Initial view of new TC3 series race format and calendar|work=TouringCarTimes.com|publisher=Hudson, Neil|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the race weekend format will be structured like the WTCC, with two free practice sessions and a two part qualifying session, followed by two races on Sunday. The first event would take place in [[Italy]] in March, but when a provisional calendar for the [[2015 TCR International Series season|2015 season]] was released on 31 October,&lt;ref name="Hudson, Neil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/10/31/tc3-international-series-releases-its-provisional-calendar-for-2015/|title=TC3 International Series releases its provisional calendar for 2015|work=TouringCarTimes.com|publisher=Hudson, Neil|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became clear that the first event will take place at the [[Sepang International Circuit]] on 29 March. Lotti confirmed the technical principles of the [[SEAT León Eurocup|SEAT León Cup Racer]], which is also set to be adopted in the Single-Make Trophy category of the European Touring Car Cup in [[2015 European Touring Car Cup season|2015]], will be used by the TCR Series.&lt;br&gt;
On 29 July former WTCC driver [[Pepe Oriola]] said in an interview with TouringCarTimes that he hopes to compete in the new series, because he was set to drive for the [[Onyx Grand Prix|Onyx Race Engineering]] team in the [[2014 World Touring Car Championship season|2014 WTCC]] season with their new [[Ford Fiesta]] TC1 car for the last part of the season, before the project was abandoned with no support for homologation from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/07/29/pepe-oriola-eyeing-up-opportunities-in-new-tc3-series/|title=Pepe Oriola eyeing up opportunities in new TC3 series|work=TouringCarTimes.com|publisher=Hudson, Neil|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September the TCR organisation announced the first cars, teams, regulations and events of its inaugural season in [[2015 TCR International Series season|2015]].&lt;ref name="TouringCarTimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/09/15/tc3-announces-first-cars-teams-regulations-and-events/|title=TC3 announces first cars, teams, regulations and events|work=TouringCarTimes.com|date=15 September 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Target Competition]] became the first team to confirm entry in the series and will run [[SEAT León Eurocup]] cars in 2015. [[Onyx Grand Prix|Onyx Race Engineering]] has also confirmed they are developing the [[Ford Focus]] for the championship.&lt;br&gt;
A week later [[Paolo Coloni Racing]] announced plans to enter the championship in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/09/22/paolo-coloni-racing-announce-plans-to-enter-2015-tc3-series/|title=Paolo Coloni Racing announce plans to enter 2015 TC3 series|work=TouringCarTimes.com|publisher=Hudson, Neil|date=22 September 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team principal [[Paolo Coloni]], son of [[Scuderia Coloni|F1-team]] founder [[Enzo Coloni]], is known for its accomplishments in the [[GP2 Series]] in [[2005 GP2 Series season|2005]] and in [[2009 GP2 Series season|2009]] to [[2012 GP2 Series season|2012]]. The team will confirm at a later date their planned car and driver line-up.

On 31 October a provisional calendar for its inaugural season was released.&lt;ref name="Hudson, Neil"/&gt; It will consist of twelve weekends, four in [[Asia]], five in [[Europe]], two in [[South America]] and one to be announced.

On 7 November the fourth team was announced: the Swedish [[Scandinavian Touring Car Championship|STCC]] team [[WestCoast Racing]] will join the series with three [[Honda Civic (ninth generation)|Honda Civics]] build by [[JAS Motorsport]]. On 20 November [[Engstler Motorsport|Liqui Moly Team Engstler]] announced they will participate with [[Volkswagen Golf Mk7|Volkswagen Golfs]] and [[Franz Engstler]] will be driving one of the [[Volkswagen|VWs]].

On 5 December the series was approved by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] and renamed TCR International Series instead of using the original TC3 International Series name.

===TCR Asia Series===
[[TCR Asia Series]] was announced on 14 August 2014 by the organisation behind the TCR series under the name TC3 Asia Series - later changed to TCR Asia Series along with the other announced series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/08/14/tc3-asia-series-organisation-announced/|title=TC3 Asia Series organisation announced|work=TouringCarTimes.com|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Sonenscher]], boss of the company [[Motorsport Asia]], will be maintaining the series. He has previously run the [[Asian Touring Car Series]] and the [[Porsche Carrera Cup|Porsche Carrera Cup Asia]]. Initially seven races were planned for [[2015 TCR Asia Series season|2015]], but later were reduced to 5 and the final calendar was with 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/12/23/2015-tcr-asia-calendar-released/|title=2015 TCR Asia calendar released|work=TouringCarTimes.com|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2015/02/25/tcr-asia-series-amends-2015-calendar/|title=TCR Asia Series amends 2015 calendar|work=TouringCarTimes|publisher=Mediaempire Stockholm AB|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]] rounds were run together with the TCR International Series, while the rest supported the [[GT Asia Series]] calendar.

===TCR Benelux Touring Car Championship===
In December 2014 the Royal Automobile Club of Belgium (RACB) and [[Kronos Racing|Kronos Events]] announced the formation of the TCR Benelux Touring Car Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/12/19/tcr-benelux-series-announced-for-2016-season/|title=TCR BeNeLux series announced for 2016 season|work=TouringCarTimes.com|publisher=Hudson, Neil|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural season is set for 2016 with one-off event planned for 15 October 2015 at the [[Circuit Jules Tacheny Mettet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2015/02/04/tcr-benelux-to-stage-one-off-event-in-2015-ahead-of-full-2016-launch/|title=TCR BeNeLux to stage one-off event in 2015 ahead of full 2016 launch|work=TouringCarTimes.com|publisher=Hudson, Neil|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2015/07/20/tcr-benelux-series-getting-ready-for-2015-debut/|title=TCR Benelux Series getting ready for 2015 debut|work=TouringCarTimes.com|publisher=Casillo, Pietro|date=20 July 2015|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule consists of seven rounds in the [[Benelux]] region, across [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]]. Each round includes five races: a 60 minutes endurance race, with mandatory pit stop, and four 20 minutes sprint races. The starting grid for the endurance race is established by a popular vote via [[Facebook]], through the ''Making the Grid'' application (later changed to aggregate score from the votes and the fast lap practice session with fan voting having bigger weight); sprint race 1 uses the best lap of after pit during long race to determine the starting grid, race 3 uses the best lap of before pit during long race; races 2 and 4 include a rolling start using the finishing order, respectively, of race 1 and 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tcrbenelux.eu/docs/TCR-2016-pres-video-V3.pdf|title=TCR Benelux Series 2016 pres video V3|work=tcrbenelux.eu|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2017 season the fan voting was droped and the starting grid for the endurance race was determined by a qualifying session instead. All races were held alongside Clio Cup Benelux, but with standalone classifications for both. At the end of the season Kronos Events withdrew their support for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2017/10/25/kronos-pulls-promoter-tcr-benelux-series/|title=Kronos pulls out as promoter of the TCR Benelux series - TouringCarTimes|date=2017-10-25|work=TouringCarTimes|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''10 percent of the brain myth''' is a widely perpetuated [[urban legend]] that most or all humans only use 10 percent (or some other small [[percent]]age) of their [[human brain|brains]]. It has been misattributed to many people, including [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=people-only-use-10-percent-of-brain| title=Do People Only Use 10 Percent Of Their Brains| publisher=[[Scientific American]]| date=7 February 2008| accessdate=7 February 2008| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117113321/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=people-only-use-10-percent-of-brain| archivedate=17 November 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extrapolation, it is suggested that a person may harness this unused potential and increase [[intelligence]].

Changes in grey and white matter following new experiences and learning have been shown, but it has not yet been proven what the changes are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Oxford|date=16 October 2009|title=Juggling Enhances Connections In The Brain|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=30 May 2012|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091016114055.htm|quote="We've shown that it is possible for the brain to condition its own wiring system to operate more efficiently."|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229124326/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091016114055.htm|archivedate=29 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular notion that large parts of the brain remain unused, and could subsequently be "activated", rests in popular folklore and not science. Though mysteries regarding brain function remain—e.g. memory, consciousness—the physiology of brain mapping suggests that all areas of the brain have a function.&lt;ref name="snopes10pct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percent.asp| title=The Ten-Percent Myth| first=Benjamin| last=Radford| publisher=snopes.com| date=8 February 2000| accessdate=13 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brainconnection.com/topics/?main=fa/brain-myth| title=Myths About the Brain: 10 percent and Counting| first=Eric| last=Chudler| accessdate=12 April 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060402235936/http://brainconnection.com/topics/?main=fa%2Fbrain-myth| archivedate=2 April 2006| deadurl=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
One possible origin is the reserve energy theories by Harvard psychologists [[William James]] and [[Boris Sidis]] in the 1890s who tested the theory in the accelerated raising of child prodigy [[William Sidis]]; thereafter, James told audiences that people only meet a fraction of their full mental potential, which is a plausible claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Debunking Common Brain Myths | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/debunking-common-brain-myths | accessdate = 24 May 2011 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130510025422/http://bigthink.com/videos/debunking-common-brain-myths | archivedate = 10 May 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, American writer [[Lowell Thomas]] summarized this idea (in a foreword to [[Dale Carnegie]]'s ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'') by adding a falsely precise percentage: "Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Shortcut to Distinction | url = http://www.cyberspacei.com/englishwiz/library/friends/how_to_win_friends.htm | accessdate = 24 May 2011 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110515143209/http://www.cyberspacei.com/englishwiz/library/friends/how_to_win_friends.htm | archivedate = 15 May 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was not the first to use the 10 percent figure, which was already circulating within the [[self-help]] movement before then; for example, the book ''Mind Myths: Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain'' includes a chapter on the ten percent myth that shows a self-help advertisement from the 1929 ''[[World Almanac]]'' with the line "There is NO LIMIT to what the human brain can accomplish. Scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about TEN PERCENT of our brain power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beyerstein | first = Barry L. | contribution = Whence Cometh the Myth that We Only Use 10% of our Brains? | title = Mind Myths: Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain | editor-last = Della Salla | editor-first = Sergio | page = 11 | publisher = Wiley | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0471983033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, psychologist and educator [[Georgi Lozanov]] proposed the teaching method of [[suggestopedia]] believing "that we might be using only five to ten percent of our mental capacity".&lt;ref&gt;Larsen-Freeman, Diane (2000). Techniques and Principles in Language Teaching. ''Teaching Techniques in English as a Second Language'' (2nd ed.). Oxford.

According to a related origin story, the ten percent myth most likely arose from a misunderstanding (or misrepresentation) of neurological research in the late 19th century or early 20th century. For example, the functions of many brain regions (especially in the [[cerebral cortex]]) are complex enough that the effects of damage are subtle, leading early neurologists to wonder what these regions did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Welcome to Your Brain: Why You Lose Your Car Keys but Never Forget How to Drive and Other Puzzles of Everyday Life | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9KmDhPtIcoMC&amp;pg=PR19&amp;lpg=PR19&amp;dq=sam+wang+user+guide+to+brain#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20wang%20user%20guide%20to%20brain&amp;f=false | author = "Wang, Sam and Aamodt, Sandra | isbn = 9781596912830 | date = 2 February 2008| accessdate= 25 September 2011 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain was also discovered to consist mostly of [[glial cells]], which seemed to have very minor functions. James W. Kalat, author of the textbook ''Biological Psychology'', points out that neuroscientists in the 1930s knew about the large number of "local" [[neurons]] in the brain. The misunderstanding of the function of local neurons may have led to the ten percent myth.&lt;ref&gt;Kalat, J.W., ''Biological Psychology'', sixth edition, Pacific Grove: Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., 1998, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The myth might have been propagated simply by a truncation of the idea that some use a small percentage of their brains at any given time.&lt;ref name="sciam" /&gt; In the same article in ''Scientific American'', John Henley, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota states: "Evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of the brain".&lt;ref name="sciam" /&gt;

Although parts of the brain have broadly understood functions, many mysteries remain about how brain cells (i.e., neurons and glia) work together to produce complex behaviors and disorders. Perhaps the broadest, most mysterious question is how diverse regions of the brain collaborate to form conscious experiences. So far, there is no evidence that there is one site for consciousness, which leads experts to believe that it is truly a collective neural effort. Therefore, as with James's idea that humans have untapped cognitive potential, it may be that a large number of questions about the brain have not been fully answered.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

==Analysis==
[[File:10 % brain myth (2nd version).jpg|thumb|"10% of the brain" myth]]
Neurologist Barry Gordon describes the myth as false, adding, "we use virtually every part of the brain, and that (most of) the brain is active almost all the time."&lt;ref name="sciam" /&gt; Neuroscientist [[Barry Beyerstein]] sets out seven kinds of evidence refuting the ten percent myth:&lt;ref name="beyerstein"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beyerstein|first=Barry L.|authorlink=Barry Beyerstein|title=Mind Myths: Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain|editor=Sergio Della Sala|publisher=Wiley|year=1999|pages=3–24|chapter=Whence Cometh the Myth that We Only Use 10% of our Brains?|isbn=0-471-98303-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Studies of brain damage: If 10 percent of the brain is normally used, then damage to other areas should not impair performance. Instead, there is almost no area of the brain that can be damaged without loss of abilities. Even slight damage to small areas of the brain can have profound effects.
# Brain scans have shown that no matter what one is doing, all brain areas are always active. Some areas are more active at any one time than others, but barring brain damage, there is no part of the brain that is absolutely not functioning. Technologies such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) allow the activity of the living brain to be monitored. They reveal that even during [[sleep]], all parts of the brain show some level of activity. Only in the case of serious damage does a brain have "silent" areas.
# The brain is enormously costly to the rest of the body, in terms of oxygen and nutrient consumption. It can require up to 20 percent of the body's energy&amp;mdash;more than any other organ&amp;mdash;despite making up only 2 percent of the human body by weight.&lt;ref name="power-sciam"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swaminathan|first=Nikhil|title=Why Does the Brain Need So Much Power?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-the-brain-need-s|work=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc.|accessdate=19 November 2010|date=29 April 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712223051/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-the-brain-need-s|archivedate=12 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CarpenterCh1&gt;[[#refCarpenter|''Carpenter's Human Neuroanatomy'']], Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; If 90 percent of it were unnecessary, there would be a large survival advantage to humans with smaller, more efficient brains. If this were true, the process of [[natural selection]] would have eliminated the inefficient brains. It is also highly unlikely that a brain with so much redundant matter would have evolved in the first place; given the historical risk of death in childbirth associated with the large brain size (and therefore skull size) of humans,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, K.R., "The Evolution of Modern Childbirth" in ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'' 35, 1992, p. 89–124.&lt;/ref&gt; there would be a strong selection pressure against such a large brain size if only 10 percent was actually in use.
# Localization of function: Rather than acting as a single mass, the brain has [[Localization of brain function|distinct regions for different kinds of information processing]]. Decades of research have gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found.
# Microstructural analysis: In the [[single-unit recording]] technique, researchers insert a tiny electrode into the brain to monitor the activity of a single cell. If 90 percent of cells were unused, then this technique would have revealed that.
# [[Synaptic pruning]]: Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate.  Hence if 90 percent of the brain were inactive, [[autopsy]] of normal adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration.
In debunking the ten percent myth, [[Knowing Neurons]] editor Gabrielle-Ann Torre writes that using one hundred percent of one's brain would not be desirable either. Such unfettered activity would almost certainly trigger an epileptic [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://knowingneurons.com/2018/02/13/10-neuromyth/|title=The Life and Times of the 10% Neuromyth - Knowing Neurons|date=2018-02-13|work=Knowing Neurons|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315133927/https://knowingneurons.com/2018/02/13/10-neuromyth/|archivedate=15 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torre writes that, even at rest, a person likely uses as much of his or her brain as reasonably possible through the [[default mode network]], a widespread brain network that is active and synchronized even in the absence of any cognitive task. Thus, "large portions of the brain are never truly dormant, as the 10% myth might otherwise suggest."

==In popular culture==
Several books, films, and short stories have been written closely related to this myth. They include the movie ''[[Flight of the Navigator]]'', the novel ''[[The Dark Fields]]'', its film adaptation, the 9th book (''[[White Night (The Dresden Files)|White Night]]'') of [[Jim Butcher]]'s book series ''[[The Dresden Files]]'', the ''[[Limitless (film)|Limitless]]'' film (claiming 20 percent rather than the typical 10 percent), the [[shōnen]] [[manga]] ''[[Psyren]]'', and the 2014 film ''[[Lucy (2014 film)|Lucy]]'', all of which operate under the notion that the rest of the brain could be accessed through use of a drug.&lt;ref name="msnbc news ref"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahn|first=Christopher|title='Limitless' brainpower plot isn't all that crazy|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41953704/ns/today-entertainment/|accessdate=31 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313105800/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41953704/ns/today-entertainment/|archivedate=13 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lucy'', in particular, depicts a character who gains increasingly godlike abilities once she surpasses 10 percent, though the film suggests that 10 percent represents brain capacity at a particular time rather than permanent usage.

The myth was "busted" on a [[MythBusters (2010 season)#Brain Drain|27 October 2010 episode]] of ''[[MythBusters]]''. The hosts used [[magnetoencephalography]] and functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brain of someone attempting a complicated mental task, and found that over 10%, as much as 35%, was used during the course of their test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/ten-percent-brain/|title=10 Percent of Brain|accessdate=26 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331010605/http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/ten-percent-brain/|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10 percent brain myth occurs frequently in advertisements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/tenper.html| title=Neuroscience For Kids| publisher=Eric H. Chudler, Ph.D. (Executive Director, CSNE; University of Washington)| accessdate= 14 November 2008 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081027004544/http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/tenper.html| archivedate= 27 October 2008 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in entertainment media it is often cited as if it were fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetyPercentOfYourBrain|title=90% of Your Brain - TV Tropes|author=|date=|website=tvtropes.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027134009/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetyPercentOfYourBrain|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[New Age]] proponents propagate the "ten percent of the brain" belief by asserting that the "unused" ninety percent of the human brain is capable of exhibiting [[psionics|psychic powers]] and can be trained to perform [[psychokinesis]] and [[extra-sensory perception]].&lt;ref name="snopes10pct" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beyerstein" /&gt;  There is no scientifically verified body of evidence supporting the existence of such powers.&lt;ref name="beyerstein" /&gt;

In 1980,  [[Roger Lewin]] published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', "Is Your Brain Really Necessary?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Roger Lewin | title=Is Your Brain Really Necessary? | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=12 December 1980 | volume=210 | pages=1232–1234 | doi=10.1126/science.7434023 | pmid=7434023 | issue=4475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about studies by [[John Lorber]] on cerebral cortex losses. He reports the case of a [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield University]] student who had a measured IQ of 126 and passed a Mathematics Degree but who had hardly any discernible brain matter at all since his cortex was extremely reduced by [[hydrocephalus]]. The article led to the broadcast of a [[Yorkshire Television]] documentary of the same title, though it was about a different patient who had normal brain mass distributed in an unusual way in a very large skull.&lt;ref&gt;The skull had been enlarged by pressure from the hydrocephalus fluid. Her brain was thinly spread, but occupied her entire braincase, and its thickness was such that she had a brain volume of approximately 200 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The woman had been told all her life that she had only 15% of normal brain mass, but those who told her this had not taken the form of her cranium into account. {{cite web |url=http://www.metafilter.com/26688/Well-what-about-pain |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014070420/http://www.metafilter.com/26688/Well-what-about-pain |archivedate=14 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade''''', first published in New York on [[April Fool's Day]] 1857, is the ninth book and final novel by American writer [[Herman Melville]]. The book was published on the exact day of the novel's setting. ''The Confidence-Man'' portrays a ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''–style group of [[steamboat]] passengers whose interlocking stories are told as they travel down the [[Mississippi River]] toward [[New Orleans]]. Scholar Robert Milder notes: "Long mistaken for a flawed novel, the book is now admired as a masterpiece of irony and control, though it continues to resist interpretive consensus."&lt;ref&gt;Milder (1988), 440&lt;/ref&gt; After the novel's publication, Melville turned from professional writing and became a professional lecturer, mainly addressing his worldwide travels, and later for nineteen years a federal government employee.

==Analysis==
[[File:Houghton bMS Am 188 (365) - Melville Confidence Man manuscript.jpg|thumb|left|Manuscript fragment from Chapter 14 of ''The Confidence-Man''.]]
The novel's title refers to its central character, an ambiguous figure who sneaks aboard a Mississippi steamboat on [[April Fool's Day]]. This stranger attempts to test the confidence of the passengers, whose varied reactions constitute the bulk of the text. Each person, including the reader, is forced to confront that in which he places his [[trust (emotion)|trust]].

The novel is written as cultural satire, [[allegory]], and metaphysical treatise, dealing with themes of [[sincerity]], [[identity (social science)|identity]], [[morality]], [[religiosity]], [[economic materialism]], [[irony]], and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]]. Many critics have placed ''The Confidence-Man'' alongside Melville's ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' and "[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]" as a precursor to 20th-century literary preoccupations with [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], and [[absurdism]].

The work includes presumed satires of 19th century literary figures: Mark Winsome is based on [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] while his "practical disciple" Egbert is [[Henry David Thoreau]]; Charlie Noble is based on [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] inspired a beggar in the story.&lt;ref&gt;Delbanco, Andrew. ''Melville, His World and Work''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005: 248. {{ISBN|0-375-40314-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
The novel was turned into an opera by [[George Rochberg]]; it was premiered by the [[Santa Fe Opera]] in 1982, but was not held to be a success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vecCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=%22The+Confidence-Man%22+opera&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dZGD4zruL-&amp;sig=4lFfcLrxU4QJ3uPwmMwivqUfefc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yLnJTNydLYGglAft7aWIAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Confidence-Man%22%20opera&amp;f=false "Lost in the Desert"], ''New York Magazine'', August 23, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">'''Tokbergen Abiyev''' ({{lang-kk|'''Тоқберген Әбиев'''}}) is a Kazakh [[journalist]]. An editor of the paper ''[[Zakon i Pravosudiye]]'', an Astana-based newspaper which specializes in documenting government corruption, he went missing on 20 December 2012, just hours after he announced to the Kazakh media that he had a sensational news report about to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/2012/12/journalist-press-club-founder-disappears-in-kazakh.php|title=Journalist, press club founder disappears in Kazakhstan|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=27 December 2012|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abiyev reappeared on 4 January 2013.

==Incarceration==
Abiyev spent July 2008 to May 2011 in jail, after being convicted of bribing a representative of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Fighting Economic and Corruption Crimes (Financial Police), with the intent of obtaining information on judicial law enforcement agents. He claimed his arrest was linked to his editorial position at ''Zakon i Pravosudie''.&lt;ref name='Reporters without borders'&gt;{{cite news | title = Journalist missing after announcing intent to shed light on corruption | date = 25 Dec 2012 | url = http://en.rsf.org/kazakhstan-journalist-missing-after-25-12-2012,43832.html | work = [[Reporters Without Borders]] | accessdate = 2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CPJ'&gt;{{cite news | title = Journalist, press club founder disappears in Kazakhstan | date = 27 Dec 2012 | url = http://www.cpj.org/2012/12/journalist-press-club-founder-disappears-in-kazakh.php | work = Committee to Protect Journalists | accessdate = 2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On 20 December, Abiyev sent an email to fellow journalists stating:

{{Quote|Dear Colleagues, Tomorrow, 21 December (…) an exclusive news conference will be held [with the title of] ‘A corrupt person must go to prison.’ You will not be disappointed. Your presence is expected.}}

[[Reporters Without Borders]] claims there is "little doubt" that Abiyev's disappearance is connected with the planned press release, and has stated they are "very worried" about the situation.&lt;ref name='Reporters without borders'/&gt; The case has been compared to that of his former colleague, [[Oralgaisha Omarshanova]], who has been missing since 2007.

The '''Town Police Clauses Act 1847''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (10 &amp; 11 Vict c. 89). The statute remains in force and is frequently used by [[Local government in England|local councils]] to close roads to allow public events such as processions or [[street party|street parties]] to take place. The Act is also used to regulate the local [[hackney carriage]], [[Taxicabs of the United Kingdom#Hackney_carriages|taxi]] and [[Taxicabs of the United Kingdom#Private_hire_.28.27minicabs.27.29|private-hire]] trade in many areas. It deals with a range of street obstructions and nuisances, for example, it makes it illegal to perform certain actions in a public street or other thoroughfare, such as hanging washing, beating carpets, and flying kites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4619942.stm|title=Ever been drunk driving a steam engine?|publisher=BBC News|date=17 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, it was highly significant legislating against [[indecent exposure]], [[indecent acts]], [[Obscene Publications Acts|obscene publications]], and [[Prostitution in the United Kingdom|prostitution.]]

== Background ==
In 1847, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] on [[Private bill|Private Bills]] presented a report. In 1842 to 1843, the average number of Private Bills passed was 161, rising to an average of 347 from 1845 to 1846. By 21 July 1847, the House of Commons, 490 petition for Private Bill that year. Already in place, resulting from early reports by the select committee new mechanisms were in place to deal more efficiently with Private Bills.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Third Report from the Select Committee on Private Bills together with Minutes of Evidence, Appendix, and Index|last=House of Commons|first=|publisher=House of Commons|year=1847|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2018|reason=The last two sentences make no sense}}

Noting was that much of the business the House of Commons was dealing with were numerous [[Local and personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|private bills]], which due to the clauses they contained, were essentially [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Public General Acts|public bills]]. Drawing up Private Bills to deal with public functions had consequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The select committee wrote,

{{cquote|text=''..some varying or interfering with the general statute or common law of the country; some, though ordinary in their nature, yet of a perplexing and needless diversity in form; and, finally, some so contradictory and mutually discordant as to render their enforcement impossible, and to make the law doubtful and embarrassing even to those who are professionally versed in it"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Third Report from the Select Committee on Private Bills together with Minutes of Evidence, Appendix, and Index.''|publisher=House of Commons|year=1847|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To provide uniformity in legislation in different geographical areas, to reduce the number of private bills about public functions, and to reduce expense, the select committee proposed eight public acts, each dealing with a different topic:

* [[Markets and Fairs Clauses Act 1847|Markets and fairs]]
* [[Gasworks Clauses Act 1847|Gasworks]]
* [[Commissioners Clauses Act 1847|Public commissioners]]
* [[Waterworks Clauses Act 1847|Waterworks]]
* [[Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847|Harbour, docks and piers]]
* [[Towns Improvement Clauses Act 1847|Town improvements]]
* [[Cemeteries Clauses Act 1847|Cemeteries]]
* Police&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The police legislation was enacted as the Town Police Clauses Act 1847.

== Original purposes of the act ==
The original Act covered six areas,
* Police regulations and administration
* Obstructions and nuisances, including several significant offences about [[indecent exposure]], [[indecent acts]], and obscene publications
* Fires and administration of [[Firefighting|fire fighting]]
* Regulating places of public resort, for example, coffee shops and refreshment house used as meeting places for [[thieves]] and prostitutes, places for [[Bear-baiting|bear baiting]] and [[Cockfight|cock fighting]]
* Public bathing
* Hackney carriages&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1847/89/pdfs/ukpga_18470089_en.pdf|title=Town Police Clauses Act 1847 (as enacted)|website=legislation.Gov.UK|access-date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisions still in force ==
Many clauses of the act are still in force; these are provisions dealing with

* Preventing obstructions during street processions
* Prohibiting stage carriages from diverting from a prescribed route
* Powers enabling the building of pounds for stray animals
* Impounding stray cattle, selling them, and unlawfully releasing them from a pound
* A significant number of nuisances and obstructions to the highway
* Violent and indecent behaviour in a police station
* Accidentally allowing chimney fires
* Keeping places for animal fighting, baiting, or worrying them, for example bear baiting and cock fighting
* Hackney carriages&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/10-11/89|title=Town Police Clauses Act 1847 (as amended)|last=|first=|date=|website=legislation.gov.uk|access-date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act is still relevant to policing the highway. Many offences in the act relating to nuisance and obstruction in the street, and the act is also a means of regulating [[Roadblock|road closures]] for special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=South  Somerset District Council|first=|date=2018|title=Road Closure for Special Events Under the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 - Application Form|url=https://www.southsomerset.gov.uk/media/61297/road_closure_application_form_14-15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law controls the use of [[Fireworks law in the United Kingdom|fireworks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwight.com/azservices/documents/1337-Fireworks-and-Firework-Displays.pdf|title=Fire Safety Public Advice Fireworks and Firework Displays|publisher=Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the wanton discharge of firearms in the street.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973732993|title=Police law|last=Richard,|first=Card,|others=English, J.

'''Triplemanía XII''' was the twelfth [[Triplemanía]] [[professional wrestling]] show promoted by [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The show took place on June 20, 2004 in Naucalpan, Mexico like the previous year’s event. The Main event featured a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' "Mask vs. mask" match between [[La Parka II|La Parka]] and [[Cibernético]].

==Production==

===Background===
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]], later known simply as "AAA" or Triple A. After making a deal with the ''Televisa'' television network AAA held their first show in April 1992.&lt;ref name=SLOrbit&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Peña and AAA held their first [[Triplemanía]] event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's [[Super Bowl]] event, similar to the [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] being the biggest show of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 Triplemanía was the 12th year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the 17th overall show under the Triplemanía banner.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía XII show featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

2010 saw the festival expand into other media platforms by incorporating a "Sights and Stories art Exhibit" featuring recorded audio and visual documents from community members regarding the festival.

2011 marked the 12th anniversary of the festival and featured a return to [[Market Square, Victoria|Market Square]] and an expanded schedule, making the festival 5 days long. The expansion of media platforms increased with the introduction of the Rocksteady Collective. This feature included live body painting, exclusive or unique performances and workshops with artists, as well as interactive art canvases allowing patrons to create their own Ska &amp; Reggae Fest memories. Since its inclusion in 2011, the Rocksteady Collective has grown to host its own series of concerts during the festival, as well as hosting culinary arts and burlesque dancing, in addition to remaining the visual arts component of the festival.

The 18th annual Victoria Ska Festival will be held June 14-18, with headline shows at their marquee venue at Ship Point in Victoria's Inner Harbour with evening concerts hosted at various locations around the downtown core.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">The '''Willie Clancy Summer School''' ([[Irish language|Irish]] ''Scoil Samhraidh Willie Clancy'') is [[Ireland]]'s largest traditional music [[summer school]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/whistling-a-sad-tune-as-festival-funds-face-axe-1805715.html Festival in danger due to cutbacks] Last visited 21-11-2009.&lt;/ref&gt; held annually since 1973 in memory of the [[uilleann pipes|uilleann piper]] [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]]. During the week, nearly a thousand students from every part of the world attend daily classes taught by experts in [[Irish music]] and [[Irish dance|dance]]. In addition, a full program of lectures, recitals, dances ([[céilidh|céilithe]]) and exhibitions are run by the summer school.

All events happen in the town [[Milltown Malbay]], in [[County Clare]], on the west coast of Ireland, during the week beginning with the first Saturday of July. The weekly registration includes six classes, all lectures and recitals (except the Saturday concert) and reduced price admission to céilithe. Lectures, recitals, concert and céilithe are open to the public.

==The school==
Founded by a committee of local people, after the death of their friend and neighbour Willie Clancy, at a young age, in early 1973. The group included Paddy McMahon, Paddy Malone, Micheal O Friel, [[Junior Crehan]], [[Martin Talty]], [[Sean Reid]], JC Talty and [[Jimmy Ward (banjo player)|Jimmy Ward]]. These were later joined by [[Muiris Ó Rócháin]] (moved from Kerry 1971), [[Peadar O'Loughlin]] (Kilmaley) and after the first ten years of the school Eamonn McGivney and Harry Hughes.

The school has a fine reputation as an event where Irish traditional music can be learned and practised by all. The school was founded with the idea that music could be learned outside of the strictures of competition or borders. Students are children or teenagers as well as adults. All are mixed within classes according to level of musicianship on a particular instrument. It is possible during the week to attend activities as different as [[Reed (music)|reed]] making workshops for [[Uilleann pipes|pipes]], as well as [[concertina]] classes, for example.

Classes are held in different venues: schools, hotels, and private houses. Depending on the student's wishes, it is possible to change teachers during the week. Teachers are chosen for their expertise and many are renowned exponents of Irish music and song.

==The craic==
''Craic agus ceol'': "fun and music" in Irish, is a frequent description for the atmosphere. During the week, crowds come to Milltown Malbay solely for informal playing, or to listen to traditional Irish music in all kinds of venues - pubs, kitchens, and streets. This audience does not necessarily attend classes.
