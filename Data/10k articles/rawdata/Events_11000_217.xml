'''''Accidental Friendship''''' is a 2008 [[Hallmark Channel]] original film directed by [[Don McBrearty]], and written by [[Anna Sandor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NE3MS885t1qI64 |title=Chandra Wilson Experiences an ''Accidental Friendship'' |accessdate=19 November 2008 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=3 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on a true story.  It stars [[Chandra Wilson]] and [[Ben Vereen]].

==Plot==
Homeless woman Yvonne Caldwell ([[Chandra Wilson]]) is a woman with good reason to be bitter: she has lost everything except her two beloved dogs, Bebe and Man-Man.  With her one friend, Wes ([[Ben Vereen]]), Caldwell lives the daily struggle of being [[homeless]] in [[Los Angeles]] until a chance encounter caused by her dogs leads to a friendship with [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officer Tami Baumann ([[Kathleen Munroe]]), and hope for a better life begins in earnest for Yvonne.  Friendship between the two women seemed improbable, but their friendship provided a base of support and respect for Yvonne and Tami for more than five years.

==Cast==
* [[Chandra Wilson]] as Yvonne Caldwell
* [[Kathleen Munroe]] as Tami Baumann
* [[Ben Vereen]] as Wesley "Wes" Smith
* [[Gabriel Hogan]] as Kevin Brawner
* [[Alison Sealy-Smith]] as Tami's colleague and friend

==True story==
In real life, Yvonne Caldwell met Officer Tami Baumann, an officer at [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]’s 77th Street Division, in 2003.  It was Yvonne’s three dogs that caught Tami’s attention, and the overwhelming care she took of the strays.  Tami, who was well known in the department for her love of animals – and who had been finding homes for strays since she was a child – used this connection to form a bond with Yvonne.

Over time, Yvonne began to open up to Tami, relating her gradual fall into poverty, a tale of struggling with abuse and abandonment which led to a long battle with [[alcoholism]].  By mid-2001, her prized [[SUV]] was her home and only possession, but that too was taken from her when she couldn’t afford the fees to release it from [[wikt:impound|impound]] after it was stolen.  Fortunately, Tami was eventually able to convince Yvonne to enter [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] and embark on a program designed to save her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Hallmark Channel Press Site |title=Press Release 9/23/08 |url=http://www.hallmarkchannelpress.com/publish/pr/home/corporate/press_releases_1/press_release_092308.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929112128/http://www.hallmarkchannelpress.com/publish/pr/home/corporate/press_releases_1/press_release_092308.html |archivedate=2008-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film was generally well-received by critics.  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that the director "doesn't stoop to the usual gimmicks," and called the script "thoughtful."  They also thought the story was "simple" and "meaningful," and said it was "more of a character study than a message movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Variety|title=''Accidental Friendship'' Review|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939029.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1 | first=Laura | last=Fries | date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marilyn Moss of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave it a milder review, stating that the film "stretches it a bit in the sentimental category," but still "holds a grip without too much effort," yet at the same time "there is hardly anything to set a spark."  She also said, "When the corn doesn't get in the way of the story, this movie is believable and affecting."  Chandra Wilson was praised for her portrayal as a "bitter"; Moss stated that "she easily takes hold of the frame whenever she's in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hollywood Reporter |title=TV Review: ''Accidental Friendship'' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/tv-reviews/tv-review-accidental-friendship-1003895724.story |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205203/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/tv-reviews/tv-review-accidental-friendship-1003895724.story |archivedate=December 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award and honors==
[[Chandra Wilson]] was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Hallmark Channel Press Site |title=Chandra Wilson Receives Emmy Nomination for Hallmark Channel Original Movie ''Accidental Friendship'' |url=http://www.hallmarkchannelpress.com/PageList/PressReleaseDetails.aspx?ID=75&amp;PageID=116 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021064040/http://hallmarkchannelpress.com/PageList/PressReleaseDetails.aspx?ID=75&amp;PageID=116 |archivedate=2010-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 it moved to the Japantown area in San Francisco, where it stayed briefly.&lt;ref name="ABOUT-AOD"/&gt; before in 2014, moving to The Hyatt in [[Burlingame, California]] located near the San Francisco International Airport. In 2016, AOD moved to the Santa Clara Convention Center. The next year, it moved to the Marriott in [[Santa Clara, California]], its final location for 2017. On November 22, 2017, the convention announced on its Facebook page it would be ceasing operations effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AODCon/posts/1765160273495007&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Copenhagen Fashion Week was held in 2006, the result of a merger of previous Danish clothing trade fairs, Dansk Modeuge and Dansk Herremodeuge, which date back to the 1950s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danish fashion history|url=http://danishfashioninstitute.dk/en/node/720|website=Danish Fashion Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copenhagen Fashion Week is owned by the [[Danish Fashion Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashionforum.dk/2016/08/23/ny-ambitioes-strategi-fra-danish-fashion-institute/|title=Ny ambitiøs strategi fra Danish Fashion Institute|language=Danish|publisher=Fashion Forume|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the event takes place in February and August, and is the [[Nordic region]]'s largest fashion event with more than 1,600 exhibitors and 2,800 branded collections&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenfashionweek.com/17707/About Copenhagen Fashion Week] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007142537/http://www.copenhagenfashionweek.com/17707/About |date=2011-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to 40-45 runway shows on the official show schedule. 

Copenhagen Fashion Week consists of a market week with 3 big fairs: CIFF at [[Bella Center]], Revolver at Øksnehallen and [[Art museum|Gallery]] that connects showrooms in the city of Copenhagen&lt;ref name="cfw.dk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfw.dk/|title=Copenhagen Fashion Week|work=cfw.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a diverse range of fashion shows at [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and the Royal Academy of Music.  The Copenhagen Fashion Summit brings together industry leaders to discuss topics such as ethical fashion, the impact of technology and industry trends. 

Copenhagen Fashion Week also offers a programme open to all, for [[consumer]]s, [[citizen]]s and [[tourist]]s. This open part of the week, Copenhagen Fashion Festival, is developed in collaboration between Wonderful Copenhagen, Copenhagen City Centre and Copenhagen Fashion Week.More than 50.000 professionals from the fashion industry visit the three fairs.

Copenhagen Fashion Week is organised by the three fairs and the company Copenhagen Fashion Week, which aims to promote Danish fashion on international markets. Among the [[fashion house]]s that stand out in Copenhagen Fashion Week are Ivan Grundahl, [[Bruuns Bazaar]], Wood Wood, Dagmar of Sweden, [[By Malene Birger]], Henrik Vibskov, [[Baum und Pferdgarten]] and Day Birger et Mikkelsen.

The '''Council of Economic Advisers''' ({{lang-el|Συμβούλιο Οικονομικών Εμπειρογνωμόνων}}; SOE) is an advisory body that is part of the Greek [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Ministry of Finance]]. The current Chairman of the Council is [[George Chouliarakis]], also an Alternate Minister of Finance.

==Purpose and role==

According to Panos Tsakloglou, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council is "the think tank of the government in economic issues." It consists of "a board composed of academics, which meet regularly, and a scientific team that operates on a daily basis." Practically, it is responsible for representing Greece in EU and other international organisations' working groups, for monitoring the implementation of the memorandum, for carrying out various ''ad hoc'' duties within the Ministry of Finance, and for providing expertise to the Greek government when they request it.&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview of Panos Tsakloglou, Chairman of the Council of Economic Experts, to Dimitris Katsikas, Head of the Observatory|url=http://crisisobs.gr/en/2013/04/%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%BE%CE%B7-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%80%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%AD/|accessdate=8 June 2016|work=Crisis Observatory|date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers represents Greece in EU working groups and on the [[Economic and Financial Committee (European Union)|Economic and Financial Committee]]. They are also Greece's deputy at meetings of the [[Eurogroup]] and the [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council]] (ECOFIN).&lt;ref name=inter /&gt; In April 2015, [[George Chouliarakis]], then-Chairman, became Greece's representative to the 'Brussels Group' - the detailed technical negotiations taking place in Brussels over the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third bailout package]].&lt;ref name="faces"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malkoutzis|first1=Nick|title=The faces change, the issues remain the same|url=http://www.macropolis.gr/?i=portal.en.the-agora.2466&amp;cid=701|accessdate=8 June 2016|work=MacroPolis|date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In United Kingdom law, '''dangerous driving''' is a [[statutory]] offence. It is also a term of art used in the definition of the offence of [[causing death by dangerous driving]]. It replaces the former offence of reckless driving.  Canada's [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] has equivalent provisions covering dangerous driving (see "Canada" section below).

==England and Wales and Scotland==

===Statute===
This offence is created by section 2 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1988]] (as substituted by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1991]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Road+Traffic+Act+1991&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1806808&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1806813&amp;filesize=6993 Section 1] Road Traffic Act 1991&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;):

{{cquote|A person who drives a mechanically propelled vehicle dangerously on a road or other public place is guilty of an offence.}}

===="Dangerously"====

A person is to be regarded as driving dangerously for the purposes of sections 1 and 2 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1988]] if 
*the way he/she drives falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, and it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Act 1988]], section 2A(1) (as inserted by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1991]])&lt;/ref&gt; or
*if it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving the vehicle in its current state (for the purpose of the determination of which regard may be had to anything attached to or carried on or in it, and to the manner in which it is attached or carried) would be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Act 1988]], sections 2A(2) and (4) (as inserted by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1991]])&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, "dangerous" refers to danger either of injury to any person or of serious damage to property; and in determining what would be expected of, or obvious to, a competent and careful driver in a particular case, regard shall be had not only to the circumstances of which he could be expected to be aware but also to any circumstances shown to have been within the knowledge of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Act 1988]], sections 2A(3) (as inserted by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1991]])&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Attorney General's Reference (No 4 of 2000)'' (2001) 2 Cr. App. R. 417 Woolf CJ said at p 422:
:The essential limbs, as is common ground, do not require any specific intent to drive dangerously. Section 2A sets out a wholly objective test. The concept of what is obvious to a careful driver places the question of what constitutes dangerous driving within the province of the jury.

Thus, whereas the underlying test of dangerousness is objective, a test based on the concept of "obviousness" considers the extent of knowledge as to [[Causation (law)|causation]]. This test is hybrid, drawing both on the actual subjective knowledge that the accused had in his or her mind at the time the ''[[actus reus]]'' of driving occurred, and on the knowledge that would have been in the mind of a [[reasonable person]] (see ''[[mens rea]]'' and [[criminal negligence]] for discussion on the nature of these tests and the scope of the reasonable person).

The [[Court of Appeal]] held in the case of  R v Banister &lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/1571.html Bannister, R. v] [2009] EWCA Crim 1571 (28 July 2009)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  that police drivers get no special treatment. "...the special skill (or indeed lack of skill) of a driver is an irrelevant circumstance when considering whether the driving is dangerous."

===Sentence===
In England and Wales and Scotland, a person guilty of dangerous driving is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years, or to a fine, or to both, or on summary conviction, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]], section 33 and Part I of Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Any conviction for dangerous driving (or [[causing death by dangerous driving]]) for a driver holding a licence issued by the [[Driver and Vehicle Agency]] ([[Northern Ireland]]) or [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (for licences issued in [[England]], [[Wales]] or [[Scotland]]) will result in a mandatory disqualification if the offence took place in the [[United Kingdom]] proper, [[Isle of Man]] or [[Republic of Ireland]] (see also [[Traffic violations reciprocity]]).  The driver must return to being a learner driver, even if the offence did not result in death or grievous bodily harm, and an [[United Kingdom driving test|extended practical driving test]], about 70 minutes long and about 30 minutes longer than the regular driving test, must be taken by the driver to regain his or her [[UK driving licence|full driving licence]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===History===

The offence of causing death by reckless driving was created by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1972]] and then by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1988]]. It was abolished, and replaced with the offence of [[causing death by dangerous driving]] by section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1991]].

After it was substituted by section 50(1) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 read as follows:

{{blockquote|A person who causes the death of another person by driving a motor vehicle on a road recklessly shall be guilty of an offence.}}

A person guilty of this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. Guidance as to sentencing was given in R v Boswell 79 Cr App R 277, [1984] 1 WLR 1047, [1984] 3 All ER 353, 6 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 257, [1984] RTR 315, [1984] Crim LR 502, [[Court of Appeal|CA]].

The offence of dangerous driving was created by section 2 of the [[Road Traffic Act 1972]]. It was abolished by section 50 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].

The expression "motor vehicle" was defined by section 190(1), and the expressions "drive" and "road" were defined by section 196(1).

'''"Recklessly"'''

The [[mens rea]] of this offence was considered in [[Recklessness (law)#R v Caldwell and R v Lawrence|R v Lawrence]] [1982] AC 510, [1981] 2 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 524, 73 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 1, [1981] 1 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 974, [1981] RTR 217, [1981] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 409, [[House of Lords Judicial Committee|HL]], reversing 71 Cr App R 291.

==Northern Ireland==

===Statute===
This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1995/2994/article/10 article 10] of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995/2994 (N.I.)).

===Sentence===
A person guilty of dangerous driving is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both.&lt;ref name="nidirect.gov.uk"&gt;http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/motoring/the-highway-code-index-page/full-contents/penalties.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causing death or grievous bodily injury by dangerous driving===
This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1995/2994/article/9 article 9] of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995/2994 (N.I.)).

It carries a mandatory disqualification of at least 24 months.&lt;ref name="nidirect.gov.uk"/&gt;

==Prevention==
Research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. A key article by Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person's close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S., Christina K.C. Lee, Clinton Weeks and Maria Kaya (2013), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf "How to stop binge drinking and speeding motorists: Effects of relational-interdependent self-construal and self-referencing on attitudes toward social marketing "], ''Journal of Consumer Behaviour'', 12, 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=criminal-law&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law|url=http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-h-and-m-law-firm-pc-los-angeles|publisher=H&amp;M|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

===Excluding causing death or bodily harm by dangerous driving===

The equivalent, under the country's [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], to "dangerous driving", is [[:wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle|Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle]].  The offence can be [[Hybrid offence|tried summarily or on indictment]].  The maximum prison sentences, that can be given out, are:
* if tried summarily, 6 months
* if tried on indictment, 5 years

A [[Driving licence in Canada|licence suspension]] is mandatory, and will be for a minimum of 12 months if the person has no prior Criminal Code driving convictions on his or her record.  Anyone with a prior conviction, for a Criminal Code driving offence, will receive a longer licence suspension, but will also receive a prison sentence.  Some provinces count equivalents, to Criminal Code driving convictions, if such convictions occur in certain American states. The [https://www.ontario.ca/driving-and-roads/what-happens-if-i-get-outofprovince-demerit-points Ontario] [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario|Ministry of Transportation]] counts equivalents, to Criminal Code driving convictions, if they occur in New York or Michigan.  Those equivalent to dangerous driving are included.

===Causing death or bodily harm===

The above types of dangerous driving charges can only be tried on indictment.  Custodial sentences will almost always be given as a result of a conviction for either type of dangerous driving charge.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Anyone convicted of (or who pleads guilty to) Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle Causing Bodily Harm is subject to a maximum prison sentence of 10 years (14 years if the conviction or guilty plea is for a related [[Street racing#Canada|street racing]] offence).  The Criminal Code defines [[Bodily harm#Canada|bodily harm]] as "any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature."

Anyone convicted of (or who pleads guilty to) Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle Causing Death is subject to a maximum term of 14 years, but can be sentenced to up to [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]] if the related offence is a street racing one.  A sentence of greater than 14 years, on the death-by-dangerous-driving charge, can only otherwise be imposed if any of the remaining charges of which the offender is convicted carry a maximum prison sentence of more than 14 years (e.g. a conviction for [[Criminal negligence#Canada|Causing death by criminal negligence]], as in [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2012/2012onsc3089/2012onsc3089.html R v Smith], because that charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment) or the judge decides to sentence the offender to serve a sentence, on a different charge (e.g. [[Hit and run#Canada|hit and run]]), consecutively to the death-by-dangerous-driving sentence.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Although the minimum driving prohibition of 12 months (or more, if the conviction or guilty plea is to a 2nd or subsequent Criminal Code offence) applies to any conviction of causing death or grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving, driving prohibitions, in these cases, are [[:wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Cases/Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle|often longer than 12 months]].

Some provinces, such as [http://www.drivetest.ca/EN/licensing/Pages/Requirements-for-an-Expired-DL.aspx Ontario], [http://www.servicealberta.ca/1742.cfm#Renew Alberta] and [https://novascotia.ca/snsmr/paal/rmv/paal269.asp#group3 Nova Scotia], require the resitting of all theory and practical driving tests if the licence suspension is longer than a prescribed time period.

:''Not to be confused with the [[Morgan Prize]], an annual award given to an undergraduate student in the US, Canada, or Mexico.''
The '''De Morgan Medal''' is a prize for outstanding contribution to [[mathematics]], awarded by the [[London Mathematical Society]]. The Society's most prestigious award, it is given in memory of [[Augustus De Morgan]], who was the first President of the society.

The medal is awarded every third year (in years divisible by 3) to a mathematician who is normally resident in the [[United Kingdom]] on 1 January of the relevant year. The only grounds for the award of the medal are the candidate's contributions to mathematics.

'''Dosmoche''' is a festival celebrated in [[Ladakh]], India. It is celebrated in [[Leh]], [[Likir Monastery|Likir]] and [[Diskit Monastery|Diskit monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Leh Likir Dosmoche"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leh, Likir Dosmoche begins|url=http://news.statetimes.in/leh-likir-dosmoche-begins/|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the last festival of New Year Celebrations, other one is [[Losar]].&lt;ref name="Singh2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutinder Singh|title=Tourist Places in Jammu and Kashmir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ckw0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|date=15 September 2017|publisher=Educreation Publishing|pages=50–|id=GGKEY:3EN6BQXNEE3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dosmoche Festival|url=https://www.lehladakhindia.com/festivals/dosmoche|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-day Dosmoche festival is a gazetted holiday for Leh district and Zanskar Sub Division.&lt;ref name="Leh Likir Dosmoche"/&gt; Dosmoche is also known as the "Festival of Scapegoat" &lt;ref name="Singh2017"/&gt; and is one of Ladakh's most popular prayer festivals.

==History==
Dosmoche was started by the rulers of Ladakh.&lt;ref name="oneIndia"/&gt; The festival was started during kingdom of King Lhachen Gongdup/ Lha-chen-Dnos-grub(1295-1320).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Antiquities of Indian Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WG4J4IKd014C&amp;pg=PA98|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0769-9|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oneIndia"/&gt; He  fought two battles with invaders from Nyungti (Kullu of Himachal Pradesh) to inhibit the exterminatory forces of the battles.&lt;ref name="oneIndia"/&gt; Sacred mask dances which is known as [[Cham dance]] are carried out in the courtyard of the old chapel.

==Celebrations==

High pitched sound of [[gyaling]] with the periodic sound of the [[cymbal]]s echoed off the bare rocky slopes with the rhythmic beats of the drum.&lt;ref name="oneIndia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ladakh celebrates winter festival of 'Dosmoche'|url=https://www.oneindia.com/2009/02/25/ladakh-celebrates-winter-festival-of-dosmoche.html|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monk]]s looks attractive in multicoloured [[robe]]s and various [[mask]]s which represent the forms of various [[deity|deities]] including [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name="oneIndia"/&gt; They danced to the beats with colorful fluttering surge to ward off evil and welcome universal peace and happiness.&lt;ref name="oneIndia"/&gt; mask dances is an essential part of Tantric tradition of [[Mahayana Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="State Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=’Leh, Likir Dosmoche begins’|url=http://news.statetimes.in/leh-likir-dosmoche-begins/|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an one-kilometre stretch  from Moti-Market to the other end of [[Leh]] Bazaar thousands of stalls are also famous in two-day long festival.&lt;ref name="State Times"/&gt; Thousands of people in colourful dresses got together at Leh bazaar&lt;ref name="Sharma2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Usha Sharma|title=Festivals In Indian Society (2 Vols.

==Schedule==
Since Ladakh follows the Tibetan lunar calendar and Dosmoche festival comes on the twenty-eighth and twenty ninth and day of the twelfth month [[Tibetan calendar]], every year the festival falls on a different date of the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="Calendar of Monastic festival"&gt;{{cite news|title=Calendar of Monastic festival|publisher=Leh official website|accessdate=1 March 2018|url=http://leh.nic.in/tourist/calender.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dragon Festival''' is a Spanish [[free festival]] which ran from 1997 to 2009, held at Los Cigarrones on the riverbed of the Rio [[Guadalfeo]], 2&amp;nbsp;km to the south of [[Órgiva]], and from 2010 at Santa Fé, Granada, [[Spain]], during the month of March, and culminating on the weekend nearest the [[March equinox]]. The festival is a celebration of various alternative cultures and includes live music and theater.&lt;ref name="olivepress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theolivepress.es/news/2007/03/13/dragon-festival-revs-up/ |title=Dragon Festival Órgiva &amp;#124; Olive Press Newspaper &amp;#124; News |publisher=Theolivepress.es |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The town of Órgiva (a garrison town that marked a front line throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]]) is renowned now for its alternative '[[hippy]]' scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah Turner and Alison Tyler |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/27/escape2 |title=Where the spirit of '67 lives on &amp;#124; Travel &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 2007-05-27|accessdate=2011-03-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, flooding washed away a huge swath of land in Cigarrones, clearing the way for a gathering. On March 14, 1997 a huge sail depicting a jolly dragon was raised in Cigarrones and the Dragon Festival was born. The hundred or so people present could never of imagined that by 2001 nearly 10,000 people would attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soitu.es/soitu/2008/03/23/info/1206293853_382308.html |title=La Fiesta del Dragón, que congrega a miles de hippies, culmina sin incidentes |publisher=soitu.es |date=2008-03-23 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of people who had bought land at Cigarrones were party to the festival, the idea of so many people turning up for a 'wild weekend' which on occasions continued for weeks, inevitably caused some rifts in the community.&lt;ref name="olivepress" /&gt;

Police presence had been virtually nonexistent but by 2002 the festival's increasing size was attracting the attention of the local [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) majority council. The Mayor placed a prohibition order on the festival and called in police reinforcements in order to create a noticeable police presence.&lt;ref name="ideal_corazon"&gt;En el corazón del dragón | From Ideal | 14 March 2003 | [http://www.ideal.es Ideal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragon Festival was causing a national media stir, firstly because banning a fiesta in Andalucia was simply unheard of but mostly because two people had died at the festival in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/andalucia/500/personas/acampan/Orgiva/Fiesta/Dragon/fue/prohibida/elpepiespand/20040320elpand_24/Tes?print=1 |title=500 personas acampan en Órgiva para la Fiesta del Dragón, que fue prohibida · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date=2004-03-20 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prohibition attempt ==

In 2003 an attempt was made by the authorities to prevent the Dragon Festival taking place with the heavy of [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] in the road leading to the festival site.&lt;ref name="ideal_corazon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travellersschool.plus.com/spring-2004.html |title=TSC News Spring 2004 |publisher=Travellersschool.plus.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715093754/http://www.travellersschool.plus.com/spring-2004.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the impending Iraq war gave voice to the festival's call for peace. For several weeks, residents from the festival site, daily dressed in pink and sang their way to the police line to offer the police tea and cakes.&lt;ref name="ideal_corazon" /&gt; On the eve of the festival the police stepped aside, allowing the festival to take place.&lt;ref name="ideal_corazon" /&gt;

Local elections brought a new [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Partido Socialista Obrero Español]] (PSOE - center-left) [http://www.psoe.es/provinciadegranada/docs/456769/page/maria-angeles-blanco-lopez.html Mayoress] to power who had previously been quite vocal about 'embracing' the Dragon Festival, however it was unanimously felt in the festival community that any interface with the local authorities was not the way to go since it could mean restrictive regulations and control.

== Local opposition ==

Over the years, a few members of the Cigarrones neighborhood had made their opposition to the festival known.&lt;ref name="olivepress" /&gt;

Early in 2009 a huge earth moving vehicle arrived at the festival site with support from the Guardia Civil and one member of the Policia Local. They proceeded to excavate holes two meters deep and two meters wide across the entire festival site, claiming they were for a tree planting project. More than two thousand holes were excavated across public land making it impossible to park anywhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rafael Vilchez Y E. P. |url=http://www.ideal.es/granada/20090320/local/provincia-granada/unos-vehiculos-concentran-orgiva-200903201227.html |title=Unos 400 vehículos se concentran ya en Órgiva para celebrar la Fiesta del Dragón. Ideal |publisher=Ideal.es |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; so if there was to be a 2009 Dragon Festival it would only be possible on the relatively small areas of pro-festival owners' land left without holes.

Two days before the 2009 Spring Equinox a prohibition order was posted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/agencias/efe/211693/mas-de-mil-personas-celebran-la-primavera-con-una-fiesta-hippie-en-orgiva |title=Más de mil personas celebran la primavera con una fiesta hippie en Órgiva - Público.es |publisher=Publico.es |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaiming a ban on the Dragon Festival on grounds of health and safety and that anyone found organizing the event would be charged and if convicted, receive hefty fines.&lt;ref name="ban"&gt;{{cite web|author=hjjkl |url=http://www.granadahoy.com/article/granada/644980/quotla/fiesta/dragon/no/tiene/organizadorquot.html |title=La Fiesta del Dragón no tiene organizador |publisher=Granada Hoy |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prosecutions ==

Within days of the posting of the prohibition order, seven pro-festival land owners received paperwork telling them they had been found guilty on an 'administrative' charge (ie.. ignoring a local authorities' ban) and had each been fined the sum of thirty thousand and fifty Euros.&lt;ref name="ban" /&gt; Failure to pay would mean the seizure of any assets, including their land.

The charge against three people were dropped but the remaining four people have taken their case to the Crown Court in Granada on the grounds that nothing was done to enforce the ban on the festival in 2009 so in their defense, these land owners claim that they could have done little themselves to stop it even if they had wanted to.&lt;ref name="ban" /&gt;

The court cases were resolved with the exception of one against Mr Alex Brimmel. Mr Brimmel's lawyer claims the charges against Mr Brimmel brought by the Town Hall should have expired but the Town Hall bypassed normal channels so the case cannot be resolved. Mr Brimmel has brought a case against the Town Hall for unconstitutional practices in order to resolve his case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2011/07/18/dragon-festival-orgiva-alex-brimmel/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relocation ==

The long wet winter of 2009/2010 once again flooded Cigarrones, filling in most of the holes and cutting off access, effectively stopping any large gathering in 2010.&lt;ref name="elmundo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/03/19/andalucia/1269015245.html |title=La Fiesta del Dragón hippie se muda de Órgiva a Santa Fe &amp;#124; Andalucía |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 an estimated 1500 people created a free festival in [[Santa Fe, Granada|Santa Fe]], 4&amp;nbsp;km to the west of [[Granada]] (60&amp;nbsp;km north of Orgiva) and is widely perceived as the new home of the Dragon Festival.&lt;ref name="elmundo" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21870">The '''effect of Brexit on Gibraltar''' concerns the status of [[Gibraltar]] after the [[Brexit|withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union]]. The UK voted to leave the EU in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 referendum]] and formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw in March 2017. Gibraltar is not part of the UK but, as a [[British Overseas Territory]], participated in the referendum and will, by default, cease to be a part of the EU upon the UK's withdrawal.

Gibraltar's position during the process of UK withdrawal from the European Union presents unique issues during the negotiations. Gibraltar voted strongly to remain in the European Union during the referendum, and its unique situation could lead to difficulties in [[Brexit negotiations]] due to the [[Spanish claim on Gibraltar]], the large contribution of on-line gambling, offshore banking and duty-free shopping to the Gibraltar economy, and the possibility that Gibraltar will cease to be a part of the [[single market]]. With the British government's initiation of the official EU withdrawal process on 29 March 2017, Gibraltar's participation in the United Kingdom's European Union membership will cease on 30 March 2019.

== History ==

=== Gibraltar's status in EU elections ===

Gibraltar did not participate in the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|1975 UK European Communities membership referendum]] even though the result had a direct impact on it. Neither did it participate in any European Parliamentary Elections between 1979 and 1999, but in 2002 legislation was passed by the [[British Parliament]] which allowed Gibraltar to formally take part in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Gibraltar)|2004 European Parliament election]] as part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]] constituency in all subsequent European elections. Following the surprise election victory by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in May 2015 it was announced that Gibraltar would fully participate in the proposed referendum on continuing EU membership, and this was legislated for in the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]].  This meant that Gibraltar was the only [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the [[European Union]] (EU) and uniquely it has the right to vote in EU elections and in referenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/02/spain-drops-plan-to-impose-veto-if-scotland-tries-to-join-eu|title=Spain drops plan to impose veto if Scotland tries to join EU|first=Jennifer|last=Rankin|date=2 April 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre referendum===
In 2015, [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar]] [[Fabian Picardo]] suggested that Gibraltar would attempt to remain part of the EU in the event the UK voted to leave,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibraltar suggests it wants to stay in EU in the event of Brexit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/gibraltar/11534580/Gibraltar-suggests-it-wants-to-stay-in-EU-in-the-event-of-Brexit.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 February 2016|last=Swinford|first=Steven|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reaffirmed that, regardless of the result, the territory would remain a British overseas territory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gibraltarpanorama.gi/15209/191011/a/happy-birthday-your-majesty|title=Happy Birthday, Your Majesty|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the UK [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]], he requested that Gibraltar be considered in negotiations post-Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.gi/2016/03/britain-must-include-gibraltar-in-post-brexit-negotiations-report-says|title=Britain must include Gibraltar in post-Brexit negotiations, report says|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the referendum, [[José García-Margallo y Marfil|José García-Margallo]], the Spanish minister of foreign affairs at the time, stated that in the event of Brexit, Gibraltar would not have access to the single market unless a formula giving Spain co-sovereignty were agreed for a transitional period; after the referendum, he saw the result as increasing the chance of a Spanish flag on Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news|work=[[Le Monde]]|url= http://www.lemonde.fr/referendum-sur-le-brexit/article/2017/04/03/brexit-l-espagne-inflige-deux-camouflets-a-londres_5104823_4872498.html| accessdate=8 April 2017|date=3 April 2017|title= Brexit: l’Espagne inflige deux camouflets à Londres

M. Garcia-Margallo s’était ensuite félicité du vote pro-Brexit en soulignant que 'le drapeau espagnol sur le Rocher n’a jamais été aussi proche'.'' [... shortly before the British vote, the then Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel Garcia-Margallo, stated that 'in the event of Brexit, Gibraltar would not have access to the internal market, unless a formula were agreed that provided for Spanish co-sovereignty for a transitional period'. Mr Garcia-Margallo later welcomed the pro-Brexit vote, emphasizing that 'the Spanish flag on the Rock has never been so close'.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said Spain would seek talks on Gibraltar, whose status is [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|disputed]], the "very next day" after a British exit from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spanish PM's anger at David Cameron over Gibraltar |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36548175 |publisher=BBC News |date= 16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union (Referendum) Act 2016 (Gibraltar)]],&lt;ref&gt;Act No. 2016-01 (Legislation Number (L.N.) 2016/034, as amended by L.N. 2016/035, L.N. 2016/082 and L.N. 2016/120.&lt;/ref&gt; was passed by the [[Gibraltar Parliament]] and implemented in Gibraltar after the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]] was passed by the UK Parliament.

During the campaign leading up to the United Kingdom's national referendum on whether to leave the European Union (known as "[[Brexit]]") the Spanish government warned that if the UK chose to leave, Spain would push to reclaim control over Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/6/23/12005364/brexit-vote-gibraltar-britain-spain|title=The Brexit vote result has reignited a 300-year-old fight between Britain and Spain|last=Williams|first=Jennifer|date=2016-06-24|website=Vox|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Minister of Gibraltar [[Fabian Picardo]] warned the UK of the threat to Gibraltar's safety posed by Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3480292/Spain-demand-control-Gibraltar-day-Brexit-warns-foreign-minister-sparks-fresh-row-Rock.html|title=Spain would demand control of Gibraltar the 'next day after Brexit'|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three parties represented in the legislature supported remaining in the EU during the referendum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.gi/2016/01/feetham-urges-joint-strategies-with-govt-on-key-issues|title=Feetham urges joint strategies with Govt on key issues|work=[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]|accessdate=20 February 2016|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibraltar Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.gi/2016/01/garcia-flags-constitutional-reform-and-brexit-in-new-year-message|title=Garcia flags constitutional reform and Brexit in New Year message|work=[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]|accessdate=20 February 2016| date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Remain campaign was known as [[Gibraltar Stronger in Europe]].

The referendum result within Gibraltar was declared early on Friday 24 June 2016 by the counting officer and Clerk to the [[Gibraltar Parliament]] Paul Martinez at the [[University of Gibraltar]] at 0040 CEST making it the first of the 382 voting areas to declare and its result was fed into the [[South West England]] regional count and then the overall national count. The result saw the single biggest "Remain" vote of all the 382 voting areas with only 4% of Gibraltarian voters opting to leave on a very high turnout of 84% with large queues reported at polling stations. Overall the [[United Kingdom]] voted narrowly by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the [[European Union]]. Despite its overwhelming vote to remain in the [[European Union]], Gibraltar will be leaving the [[European Union]] as it was a popular vote of the whole of the [[United Kingdom]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Gibraltar in the Brexit negotiations==
Gibraltar has no direct say in the negotiations between the UK and the 27 remaining countries of the European Union (EU27); the duty and responsibility of dealing with foreign affairs rest with the UK, as do the duties of defence and internal security in Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=HC 461 - Gibraltar: Time to Get Off the Fence |publisher=The Stationery Office |date=1 July 2014 |ISBN=9780215073280}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} 

[[Robin Walker]] MP [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] visited Gibraltar in March 2017 to discuss Brexit with [[Fabian Picardo]] [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar]] and [[Joseph Garcia (Gibraltarian politician)|Joseph Garcia]] Deputy Chief Minister of Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourgibraltartv.com/politics/13994-mar-15-uk-brexit-minister-to-visit-gibraltar?fb_comment_id=1367974226588460_1368228609896355#fcdc6fc28 |title=Mar 15 - UK Brexit Minister To Visit Gibraltar |publisher=your Gibraltar TV |date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the impending [[Brexit]] negotiations, the House of Lords produced a report entitled "Brexit: Gibraltar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/116/116.pdf |title=Brexit: Gibraltar |publisher=Parliament |date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Council]] released a series of guidelines for the EU27 on negotiations for withdrawal. Within these guidelines, core principle number 22 stated that "After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/31_03_17_eu_draft_guidelines.pdf |title=Draft guidelines following the United Kingdom's notification under Article 50 TEU|language=en-GB|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-Brexit conservative  M.P. [[Jack Lopresti]] thought it shameful that the EU would attempt to allow Spain an effective veto over the future of British sovereign territory, ignoring the will of the people of Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15196509.EU_leaders_attacked_over__quot_shameful_quot__Brexit_talks_move_to_give_Spain_veto_over_Gibraltar__39_s_future/ |title=EU leaders attacked over "shameful" Brexit talks move to give Spain veto over Gibraltar's future |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign minister [[Boris Johnson]] re-iterated the United Kingdom's commitment to Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/gibraltar-brexit-uk-boris-johnson-spain-a7661471.html |title=UK will 'stand up for Gibraltar' in Brexit row with Spain, says Boris Johnson |publisher=Independent |date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Esteban González Pons]], a Spanish MEP and chairman of the Brexit working group of the [[European People's Party]], met with Ireland's Minister for European affairs [[Dara Murphy]] in May, when he (Pons) called Gibraltar a "colony" and pushed for support for the Spanish position that the status of the Rock is a bilateral issue solely for the UK and Spain to resolve. Ireland recognises that the issue is a  bilateral one but wishes to avoid parallels being drawn with the status of [[Northern Ireland]]. Murphy stated that “Ireland will address issues regarding the nature of the relationship of Gibraltar with the European Union post-Brexit as and when they arise in the course of negotiations on the future relationship of the UK with the European Union.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.gi/2017/03/gibraltars-future-with-eu-will-form-part-of-uks-brexit-talks-irish-government-says/ |title=Gibraltar’s future with EU will form part of UK’s Brexit talks, Irish Government says |publisher=Gibraltar Chronicle |date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2017, the former director of operational capability at the UK [[Ministry of Defence]], Rear Admiral [[Chris Parry (Royal Navy officer)|Chris Parry]], said, “We could cripple Spain in the medium term and I think the Americans would probably support us too.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/787061/britain-could-cripple-spain-rear-admiral-chris-parry-gibraltar-royal-navy-commander&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key issues ==

=== Sovereignty ===
{{see also|Disputed status of Gibraltar}}

The day after the result, Spain's acting Foreign Minister, [[José Manuel García-Margallo]], renewed calls for joint Spanish–British control of the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36618796|title=Brexit: Spain calls for joint control of Gibraltar – BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These calls were strongly rebuffed by [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar|Gibraltar's Chief Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibraltarolivepress.com/2016/09/12/chief-minister-fabian-picardo-says-british-means-british-at-national-day-political-rally/|title=Chief Minister Fabian Picardo says 'British Means British' at National Day political rally|first=Joe Duggan|last=(Reporter)|date=12 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the result Spain reiterated its position that it wanted to jointly govern Gibraltar with the United Kingdom and said it would seek to block Gibraltar from participating in talks over future deals between the UK and EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-gibraltar-idUKKCN0ZA169|title=Spain seeks to jointly govern Gibraltar after Brexit |publisher=Reuters |language=en-GB| date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] reiterated that "the UK would seek the best possible deal for Gibraltar as the UK exits the EU, and there would be no negotiation on the sovereignty of Gibraltar without the consent of its people.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/gibraltar-sovereignty-not-up-for-negotiation-theresa-may-tells-donald-tusk |title=UK won't negotiate away Gibraltar sovereignty, May tells Tusk |publisher=The Guardian |date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Spanish Foreign Minister [[Alfonso Dastis]] announced that Spain hoped to sign off a bilateral agreement with Britain over Gibraltar before October so as not to hinder a Brexit transition deal. Talks between London and Madrid had progressed well. While reiterating the Spanish long-term aim of "recovering" Gibraltar, he said that Spain would not hold Gibraltar as a "hostage" to the EU negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-gibraltar/spain-hopes-for-brexit-deal-on-gibraltar-before-october-foreign-minister-idUSKCN1HB2U7 |title=Spain hopes for Brexit deal on Gibraltar before October: foreign minister |publisher=Reuters |date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movement over the border ===

Questions were raised over the future of free-flowing traffic at the [[Gibraltar–Spain border]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.gi/2017/01/govts-stark-analysis-highlights-brexit-border-challenge/|title=Govt’s stark analysis highlights Brexit border challenge – Gibraltar Chronicle|work=chronicle.gi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== People ====
Gibraltar, like the UK, is outside the [[Schengen Area]]. All people crossing the border to/from Spain have therefore always been required to go through British and Spanish border controls. 10,000 people living in [[La Línea de la Concepción|La Línea]], in Spain, cross the border every day to work in Gibraltar. La Línea has an unemployment rate of 35% whereas Gibraltar has a 1% unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2017/01/23/dont-prejudice-thousands-gibraltar-jobs-using-border-choke-point/ |title=Don’t prejudice thousands of Gibraltar jobs by using border as ‘choke point’ |publisher=The Olive Press |date=23  January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Goods ====
Gibraltar was never part of the EU's customs union, so there are already more detailed checks on goods moving over the Spanish-Gibraltar border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39484900 |title=What could Brexit mean for Gibraltar? |publisher=BBC |date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Air travel ====
A Spanish diplomat has indicated that any agreement on airline landing rights agreed during Brexit negotiations would not apply to the [[Gibraltar International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/98f1cedc-1582-378e-8b54-b635997fed7f |title=Brexit deal will not automatically apply to Gibraltar – EU guidelines |publisher=Financial Times |date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finance industry ===
The Government of Gibraltar told a European Parliament committee in May that the finance industry in Gibraltar is essential to the economy of the Rock, and that the industry was resigned to a loss of access to the EU market but had been given firm assurances {{bywho|date=November 2018}} that Gibraltar would have greater access to UK markets which will bring opportunities, including "automatic access to the United Kingdom in banking, insurance, investment services and any other similar area where cross-border directives currently apply".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.gi/2017/05/gibraltar-planning-for-a-hard-brexit-tipping-tells-brussels/ |title=Gibraltar ‘planning for a hard Brexit’, Tipping tells Brussels |publisher=Gibraltar Chronicle |date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brexit Agreement==
On 18 October 2018, Spanish Prime Minister [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]] announced that he had reached an agreement with Britain, declaring the Gibraltar protocol "resolved" and further stating that the Spanish government would hold no objection to the United Kingdom leaving the EU with specific regards to Gibraltar as being one of the British Overseas territories and currently within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-gibraltar/spain-says-agreement-reached-on-gibraltar-status-in-brexit-negotiations-idUSKCN1MS2DH |title=Spain says agreement reached on Gibraltar status in Brexit negotiations |date=18 October 2018 |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oct2&gt;{{Cite |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/uk-spain-reach-brexit-deal-over-gibraltar-spanish-pm/article/534934 |title=UK, Spain reach Brexit deal over Gibraltar: Spanish PM |date=18 October 2018 |work=Digital Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any dispute which Spain has or may have over the sovereignty of Gibraltar will also no longer affect a future trade agreement between Britain and the EU.&lt;ref name=oct2 /&gt;

On 22 November 2018, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez threatened to veto Brexit if Spanish concerns over Gibraltar were not addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/spanish-pm-pedro-sanchez-threatens-brexit-veto-over-gibraltar-uk-spain/ |title=Spanish PM threatens Brexit ‘veto’ over Gibraltar|date=23 November 2018 |work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |title=After my conversation with Theresa May, our positions remain far away. My Government will always defend the interests of Spain. If there are no changes, we will veto Brexit. |user=sanchezcastejon |number=1065719004923342850 |date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on Saturday 24 November, British EU Ambassador Sir Tim Barrow assured Spanish leadership that no future trade deals around Brexit would pertain to Gibraltar's market, likely clearing the way for the Brexit deal to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/24/brexit-may-gives-way-over-gibraltar-after-spains-veto-threat|title=Brexit: May gives way over Gibraltar after Spain's 'veto' threat|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|last2=Jones|first2=Sam|date=2018-11-24|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erraï''' (الرأي meaning "Opinion") is a weekly [[Arabic|Arab language]] newspaper which was published in [[Tunis]] between December 1977&lt;ref&gt;Didier Le Saout et Marguerite Rollinde, ''Émeutes et mouvements sociaux au Maghreb : perspective comparée'', éd. Karthala, Paris, 1999, pp. 112-113 {{ISBN|978-2-8653-7998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and December 1987.
&lt;div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; width: 36.5em; text-align: center; font-size: 0.92em; font-family: lucida grande, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"&gt;
&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #999999; background: #c6dbf7; text-align: center; padding: 1em 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #999999; background: #ffffff; text-align: left; padding: 0.5em 0.5em; text-align: left;"&gt;
''' Hassib Ben Ammar on Erraï''':

:"We opened our columns to everyone. Even to [[Rashid al-Ghannushi]] ([[Islamist]]) and to [[Mohamed Harmel]] ([[Communist]]), while not supporting their positions. We did this in the name of free expression. I even published an editorial which defended [[integrism|fundamentalists]].

:''"Nous avons ouvert nos colonnes à tous. Même à Rachid Ghannouchi (islamiste) et à Mohamed Harmel (communiste), alors que nous n'épousions pas leurs positions. Cela au nom de la liberté d'expression. J'ai même publié un éditorial qui prenait la défense des intégristes"''&lt;ref name="garon52"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lise Garon |title=Le silence tunisien : les alliances dangereuses au Maghreb  |edition= L'Harmattan, Paris |date= 1998 |page=52 |isbn=9782894890400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The newspaper was launched by [[Hassib Ben Ammar]], a leading [[Tunisia]]n [[politician]] and journalist/editor.  He was a powerful campaigner for [[human rights]].&lt;ref name=LeadersobitHBA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/0270-hassib-ben-ammar|title=Hommage à ...

In December 1987, a few weeks after [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] [[1987 Tunisian coup d'état|took power]], Ben Ammar scuttled the newspaper, of which at this time he was the director.&lt;ref name="camaugeisser"&gt;Michel Camau et [[Vincent Geisser]], ''Habib Bourguiba. La trace et l'héritage'', éd. Karthala, Paris, 2004, p. 352 {{ISBN|2845865066}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Writing under her pseudonym,  Om Ziad (أم زياد), the journalist [[Naziha Réjiba]] used the pages of '''Erraï''' to warn readers, "Do not be in too much of a hurry to applaud Ben Ali.  Do not forget his military past, nor his background with the police.   And what if he takes us down a path even worse than [[Habib Bourguiba|his predecessor's]]?   Do not give him a blank check!".&lt;ref name=OmZa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justiceinfo.net/fr/component/k2/2106.html |author=Olfa Belhassine|title=Tunisie : " la propagande est revenue" |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=8 March 2016 |work=« Tunisie : cinquante ans de développement économique et de répression politique » originally published 31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;« N'applaudissez pas trop vite Ben Ali. N'oubliez pas son passé militaire, ni son passé policier. Et s'il nous entraînait sur une voie bien pire que Bourguiba ? Ne lui donnez pas un blanc-seing! »&lt;/ref&gt;

The article would enrage the newly installed president, who placed a ban on the edition in question and launched a campaign of intimidation against [[Hassib Ben Ammar]] who was cornered into putting an end to the newspaper's publication.&lt;ref name="camaugeisser"/&gt;
&lt;!---
Cet article aurait déclenché la colère du président qui aurait alors fait interdire le numéro en question et lancé une campagne d'intimidation contre Ben Ammar qui, « acculé », aurait alors mis fin à la publication3.

An '''extraordinary general meeting''', commonly abbreviated as '''EGM''', is a meeting of members of an organisation, shareholders of a company, or employees of an official body that occurs at an irregular time.''&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/egm.asp EGM]&lt;/ref&gt;'' The term is usually used where the group would ordinarily hold an [[annual general meeting]] (AGM) but where an issue arises that requires the input of the entire membership and is too serious or urgent to wait until the next AGM. Members and/or shareholders must be informed of the purpose of the EGM so that they may attend in a position where they can discuss and exercise intelligent judgment, or else any resolutions passed are invalid.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jcEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA799&amp;dq=when+are+Extraordinary+General+Meeting+usually+called%3F&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=when%20are%20Extraordinary%20General%20Meeting%20usually%20called%3F&amp;f=false Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;''

Procedure: Before the EGM the [[Deliberative assembly|board]] of the organisation will have agreed upon one or more [[Resolution (law)|resolution]]s that will be put to the shareholders or members for approval at the EGM. The wording of the resolution is sent to the shareholders with a note about its importance. The theory is that the board has a better knowledge of the situation, and the resolution is in effect their ideal solution, but it may not be in the interests of individual shareholders. Usually, the chairman of the EGM reads out and recommends the resolution to those present for approval, takes questions about the resolution from those present, supervises the vote and declares the result. The rules for conducting an EGM and the options for altering a resolution at an EGM or for taking [[Proxy voting|proxy votes]] will vary from one organisation to another. 

In some settings, this is known as a special general meeting or an emergency general meeting.

In the United Kingdom, the directors of a public company must convene an EGM if the net assets fall to half or less of the amount of its called-up share capital (section 656 of the [[Companies Act 2006]]). Shareholders who meet certain criteria can requisition a general meeting: within 21 days from the date of receipt of requisition the directors must send out a notice to convene a meeting within 28 days after the date of giving the notice.

The '''Ferrari Challenge''' is a [[One-Design|single-marque]] [[Auto racing|motorsport]] championship that was created in 1993 for owners of the [[Ferrari 348|348 Berlinetta]] who wanted to become involved in racing. It now encompasses three official championships in the United States, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.&lt;ref name="Driver-team-listings"&gt;[http://www.shell.com/home/content/ferrari-en/road_car/ferrari_challenge/2007_ferrari_challenge/teams/dir_teams_drivers.html Driver and Team Listings] From ''shell.com.'' Retrieved September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors from each series are brought together at the annual World Finals (Finali Mondiali) event. From 2007-10, the Ferrari Challenge exclusively used the [[Ferrari F430]] model. 2011 saw the introduction of the [[Ferrari 458|458 Challenge]] with the 458 Challenge Evoluzione following in 2014. In 2018 Ferrari introduced the 488 Challenge.

==Series==

[[Image:Ferrari F430 Challenge 88 Side.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Ferrari F430 Challenge car used in the North American series.]]

Currently there are three distinct series, but in 2001, the number of championships peaked at five, with three in Europe, one in the United States, and one in Japan.&lt;ref name="2004intro"&gt;[http://www.shell.com/home/content/ferrari-en/road_car/ferrari_challenge/2004_ferrari_challenge/intro/intro.html?LN=/road_car/ferrari_challenge/2005_ferrari_challenge 2004 Ferrari Challenge] From ''shell.com.'' Retrieved September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, the Ferrari Challenge is managed by Ferrari's Corse Clienti department ("customer racing").

===Ferrari Challenge Italy===
The now defunct Ferrari Challenge Italy used a two-class format in which distinguished between professional competition drivers in the ''Trofeo Pirelli'' (lit. "[[Pirelli]] Trophy") and amateur "gentleman drivers" in the ''Coppa Shell'' (lit. "[[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Cup").&lt;ref name="autosport"&gt;Straw, Edd. "Ferrari Challenge", ''Autosport magazine'', November 16, 2006, pp.63.&lt;/ref&gt; This format has now been transferred to the Europe Challenge series. It was originally launched in 1993, with backing from Pirelli. Its popularity has resulted in a 2007 entry list of ten teams represented by 37 drivers. The Challenge Italy series is now merged with the European Challenge-series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shell.com/home/content/ferrari-en/road_car/ferrari_challenge/2007_ferrari_challenge/teams/italy/drivers_italy.html Driver and Team Listing – Italy] From ''shell.com.''

Retrieved September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferrari Challenge Europe===
Like the Challenge Italy, the European series is a two-class championship. For the 2012 calendar it contains 7 races, with 4 of them being held on Italian circuits. This is done in sync with the Italian series now merged into the European. The remaining 3 races are held at [[Hungaroring]], [[Spa-Francorchamps]], and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://corseclienti.ferrari.com/2012en/championship/ferrari-challenge-europe/]&lt;/ref&gt; The European Challenge is by far the largest series, with between 50–55 entrants for the 2012 season.

===Ferrari Challenge North America===

[[Image:Ferrari F430 Challenge Group.JPG|thumb|[[Ferrari F430 Challenge]] racer at [[New Jersey Motorsports Park]], North American series (2008 season).]]

The North American also features the Trofeo Pirelli and Coppa Shell class system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shell.com/home/content/ferrari-en/road_car/ferrari_challenge/2007_ferrari_challenge/standings/usa/standings_usa.html 2007 USA Standings] From ''shell.com.'' Retrieved September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This championship was inaugurated in 1994. It is organized by Ferrari North America and sanctioned by [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]].&lt;ref&gt;"An insider's look...."

The 2012 grid of the FCNA includes 20 drivers, making it the smallest Challenge-series worldwide in terms of entrants.

===Ferrari Challenge Asia-Pacific===
The Asia-Pacific is the most recent of the Challenge series since the 2011 season, inaugurated in combination with the growing interest and sales for Ferrari in Asia. The season encompasses events in Japan, China, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. The Asia-Pacific also features the Trofeo Pirelli and Coppa Shell class system. Grid is made up of 35 to 40 drivers for the 2012 season.

===Unofficial series===
The Ferrari Challenge has inspired other national club-level championships that are not affiliated with Ferrari S.p.A. itself. The 'Ferrari Scandinavia Challenge' is an unofficial championship with events in Sweden, and Denmark. It was created in 2001 and is not exclusive to the latest Challenge cars, with many classes so that models all the way back to the 348 are eligible for entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferrarichallenge.dk/index.htm Ferrari Scandinavia Challenge] From ''ferrarichallenge.dk.'' Retrieved September 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK has a similar unofficial series comprising three championships for older cars that is organised by the Ferrari Owners' Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferrariownersclub.co.uk/events/index.asp Events] From ''ferrariownersclub.co.uk.'' Retrieved September 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, a club championship open to all Challenge cars har been organized in the US under the name of Ferrari Club Racing Championship/Association as an alternative to the Ferrari Challenge North America, which many competitors felt was too expensive. The FCRA hosts 6 rounds during a season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferrariclubracing.com/schedule.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
A brand new 458 Challenge will cost around $300,000 in the US. The only options available on the car is the color and size of the passenger seat. All new 458C's come delivered on rain tyres. Racing in the Ferrari Challenge North America series will cost roughly around $15,000–$20,000 per race weekend if the car is run by a dealer team, which they in most cases are. This includes crew support, a fee to Ferrari North America, transportation and living costs plus additional spares. The fee to FNA is approximately $2,000–$3,000 which gives the competitors fuel and tires. Privateer entries can be run at a slightly smaller cost as there will be no dealer fee included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ferrarichat.com/forum/showthread.php?t=300136]&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-make racing==

[[File:Imm035 35A.jpg|thumb|The [[Ferrari 360|Ferrari 360 Challenge]] was the Ferrari Challenge racer replacing the F355 Challenge.]]
The Ferrari Challenge uses [[One-make racing|a single model]] from the manufacturer's road car range, suitably modified to make them safe for competition use. The lineage began with the [[Ferrari 348|348 Berlinetta]] in 1993, followed by its successor, the [[Ferrari F355|F355 Berlinetta]], and the [[Ferrari 360|360 Modena]] was introduced in 2000. The F355 remained eligible during 2000 and 2001.&lt;ref name="2004intro" /&gt; The [[Ferrari 360|360CS]] (Challenge Stradale) version was the first competition-orientated version to be marketed to the public. The [[Ferrari F430|F430 Challenge]] was phased in during a transitional year in 2006, with the same being the case for the [[Ferrari 458|458 Challenge]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shell.com/home/content/ferrari-en/road_car/ferrari_challenge/2007_ferrari_challenge/intro/intro.html 2007 Trofeo Pirelli] From ''shell.com.'' Retrieved September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The F430 introduced [[Composite material|carbon]]-[[ceramic]] brake discs for the first time and gained 80[[Horsepower|bhp]] over the 360CS, which has reduced lap times to approximately three seconds shy of the F430 GT2.&lt;ref name="autosport" /&gt; The current 458 Challenge is the first to have driver controlled aids such as traction control, stability management and adjustable ABS brakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TeBJlyUts0]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferrari Challenge racers===
The 458 Challenge is the most recent in a line of Ferraris used in the Ferrari Challenge series. The lineage is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferrari.com/English/GT_Sport%20Cars/Classiche/All_Models/Pages/360_Challenge.aspx 360 Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ferrari 348|Ferrari 348 Challenge]] (1993–1995)
*[[Ferrari F355|Ferrari F355 Challenge]] (1995–2000)
*[[Ferrari 360|Ferrari 360 Challenge]] (2000–2006)
*[[Ferrari F430 Challenge]] (2006–2011)
*[[Ferrari 458 Italia|Ferrari 458 Challenge]] (2011–2017)
*[[Ferrari 488 GTB|Ferrari 488 Challenge]] (2017–)

All the cars used in the series are track only, although some 360 Challenges have been made road legal in Australia, with extensive modifications. However, due to new legislation, this is not possible anymore. The 360 Challenge used in the series should not be confused with the [[Ferrari 360|360 Challenge Stradale]], which was a road-legal, track day oriented version of the 360, similar to the [[Ferrari F430|F430 Scuderia]].
&lt;!--==Regulations==--&gt;

==Racing simulators based on the series==
In 1999, [[Sega]]'s producer [[Yu Suzuki]] created ''[[Ferrari F355 Challenge|Ferrari F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa]]'', a video game based on the [[Ferrari F355|Ferrari F355 Challenge]] series.

In 2008, [[System 3 (software company)|System 3]]'s [[Mark Cale]] created ''[[Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli]]'', the official game of the Ferrari Challenge featuring the licensed [[Ferrari F430 Challenge]] Italian, European and North American 2007 series.

'''Giorgos Papakonstantinou''' ({{lang-el|Γιώργος Παπακωνσταντίνου}}), born October 30, 1961&lt;ref name="European Parliament profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/public/inOut/viewOutgoing.do?language=EN&amp;id=97006 |title=MEP profile - Giorgos PAPAKONSTANTINOU |work=[[European Parliament]] |publisher=europarl.europa.eu |accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Athens, Greece, is a Greek economist and politician and former [[Minister for the Environment (Greece)|Minister for the Environment, Energy and Climate Change]] of Greece and former [[Minister for Finance (Greece)|Minister for Finance]].  He is currently working in an advisory capacity in the private sector.

==Education and career==

He graduated from the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). He later obtained a Master of Arts in Economics from New York University and a PhD in Economics from LSE.

After his studies, he worked as a senior economist at the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in Paris from 1988 to 1998.

In 1998, Papakonstantinou returned to Greece and was appointed an adviser to then-Prime Minister [[Costas Simitis]] on "[[information society]]" issues.

Two years later, he was appointed Special Secretary for the "Information Society" at the [[Minister for Economy and Finance (Greece)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]] (2000–2002). Between 2002 and 2004 he served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors of the [[Minister for Economy and Finance (Greece)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]], as a board member of [[OTE]] (Hellenic Telecommunication Organization), and as the Greek representative to the [[European Union|European Union's]] Economic Policy Committee (EPC). In 2003 he coordinated the "[[Lisbon Strategy]]" for economic and social reforms during the Greek [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the EU]].

Between 2004 and 2007, Papakonstantinou served as economic advisor to [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], the president of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK). He was also a board member of the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies, PASOK's think tank, from 2005 to 2008.

Between 2003 and 2007, Papakonstantinou also taught economics at Department of Management Science and Technology of the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] and advised the [[European Commission]] on research and information society issues, participating in various international research projects.

==Political career==
In May 2005, Papakonstantinou was elected a member of the National Council of PASOK. In September 2007, he was elected member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] to represent the district of [[Kozani]],&lt;ref name="CV George Papakonstantinou website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpapak.gr/cv-en/ |title=Curriculum Vitae of George Papakonstantinou |work=George Papakonstantinou website |publisher=gpapak.gr |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009022702/http://www.gpapak.gr/cv-en/ |archivedate=2009-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently appointed PASOK's Press Spokesman in March 2008.

Papakonstantinou headed PASOK's list of candidates for the European Parliament in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Greece)|2009 European elections]] and was elected [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] in June 2009. In October 2009 he was appointed Finance Minister in the government formed by Papandreou, the former [[Prime minister of Greece|prime minister]], after the [[Greek legislative election, 2009|national elections]].&lt;ref name="Papandreou gov't Cabinet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ana-mpa.gr/anaweb/user/showplain?maindoc=8023855&amp;service=142|title=New Papandreou gov't Cabinet announced|date=2009-10-06|work=[[ANA-MPA]]|publisher=ana-mpa.gr|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Finance Minister, he revealed that the Greek deficit was much larger than what was reported by the previous government, and when Greece was shut out of international markets, he negotiated a [[Greek government-debt crisis#Rescue packages provided by the EU and IMF|€110bn loan agreement for Greece]] with the EU and the [[International Monetary Fund]], together with a programme of severe fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. During his tenure, he overhauled the budget process, instituting a medium-term fiscal framework with expenditure monitoring and assessment mechanisms, and an independent statistical authority; embarked on tax reform, with legislative and organizational changes to combat [[tax evasion]]; implemented a wide-ranging program of structural reforms in product, service and financial markets; and designed a large-scale and wide-ranging privatization strategy. When he left office, the public deficit was more than 6 percentage points of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] lower than upon his appointment, while Greece had recovered half the competitiveness lost since [[Eurozone]] entry and was named the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] country with the fastest pace of structural reforms.

In June 2011, Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] reshuffled the government and appointed him Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, a post he kept in the government of [[Lucas Papademos]] until he handed over to a caretaker Minister in May 2012. In the field of environment, he accelerated the closure of uncontrolled landfills; revamped the waste management and recycling systems; helped implement a large number of water management projects co-funded by [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|EU Structural Funds]]; advanced the completion of land and urban planning and of the national [[cadastre]]. In energy, he brought legislation to liberalize the energy market; oversaw a large increase of Greece’s renewable energy capacity and presented a road map for energy policies to 2050; spearheaded ambitious renewable energy projects, such as Project Helios for exporting solar energy; pursued Greek participation in international gas routes; and brought forward the exploration of Greece’s hydrocarbon potential.

He was one of a number of Papademos' cabinet who failed to be re-elected in the May 6, 2012 General election that saw PASOK lose almost 120 seats in the house.

Following the elections, Papakonstantinou has faced a parliamentary investigation into the handling of the so-called [[Lagarde list]], containing information on the deposits of roughly 2,000 Greek citizens at [[HSBC]] bank's [[Geneva]] branch, which he asked for and received from French authorities in 2010. While Papakonstantinou asked the Greek tax authorities to investigate the list, they failed to do so. In late 2012, prosecutors asked for a fresh copy of the Greek list and compared it to the one they had, they found that three names were missing from the list, all relatives of Papakonstantinou.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/herve-falcianis-great-swiss-bank-heist&lt;/ref&gt; Those allegations resulted in his expulsion from the PASOK political party.&lt;ref name="Greek ex-minister expelled for 'protecting relatives'"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek ex-minister expelled for 'protecting relatives'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20862037 |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=28 Dec 2012 |date=29 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has consistently denied all charges and claims he is being made a [[scapegoat]] for  the inaction of others on this issue as well as for the public’s need to punish politicians for the austerity policies in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21569069-did-former-finance-minister-tamper-evidence-protect-his-family-culprit-or-scapegoat&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a Special Court convened for this case and composed of 13 judges drawn from the two highest Greek courts unanimously cleared him of the breach of faith charge, concluding that there had been no damage to the State from his actions. At the same time, with an 8 to 5 majority by the court, he received a suspended misdemeanour conviction for the tampering charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/24/greek-finance-minister-suspended-sentence-lagarde-list|title=Former Greek finance minister given suspended sentence over 'Lagarde list'|last=Smith|first=Helena|date=2015-03-24|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he published a book in which he told his story as finance minister of Greece when the debt crisis unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Game Over: The Inside Story of the Greek Crisis|last=Papaconstantinou|first=George|date=2016-05-26|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781530703265|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Papakonstantinou is married to [[travel writer]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacoline Vinke|nl}}. They have two sons, Nicolas and Stefanos.

==History==
GPF founder Hyun Jin Preston Moon, an Olympic equestrian, first visited Paraguay in 2007 and travelled on horseback through the remote Chaco region to learn about the life of Paraguay’s vaqueros, or ranchers. Impressed by the experience, he later addressed the National Congress on the value of Paraguay’s traditions, and the importance of ethics and values in public life. In July 2008 Moon organized a cultural peace festival and city-wide youth service projects in Asuncion.&lt;ref&gt;"“Why Paraguay?” Dr. Hyun Jin Moon Closing Remarks for the Global Peace Convention 2014."

In 2010, GPFF advanced environmental and youth service projects in Kenya and Nepal, including restoration of the dangerously polluted Nairobi River that gathered thousands of local volunteers, and establishment of the Rift Valley Peace Initiative in a region that witnessed some of the worst outbreaks of ethnic violence following the disputed elections of 2007-08. The 2010 Global Peace Convention, “One Family under God: Conflict Resolution, Peace and Development,” in Nairobi won the backing of Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga, political rivals who governed Kenya in a power-sharing arrangement. More than 1000 participants from 40 nations attended the convention.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Peace Convention 2010." Global Peace Convention 2010. Global Peace Foundation, n.d.

Global Peace Foundation expanded its work in 2011 with a conference in Mongolia focusing on Northeast Asia peace and the special role of Mongolia, which has normalized diplomatic relations with both North and South Korea, in reducing tensions and promoting economic development on the Korean peninsula. The 2011 Global Peace Convention in Seoul, South Korea hosted experts and policy makers from 40 countries with a focus on prospects for Korean unification and scenarios for a post-unification culture.

In 2011 and 2012 Global Peace Foundation organized multiple forums and conferences in Latin America to address underdevelopment, crime, and government corruption in the region. GPF work in Paraguay included the introduction of character education in public schools with support from Paraguay’s Ministry of Education, and economic development projects in Alto Paraguay, the largest, poorest, and most sparsely populated region of the country.

GPF also enlisted support from former heads of state from throughout Latin America to advance economic development and good governance in the region. The 2012 Global Peace Convention, “Moral and Innovative Leadership: Building Healthy Families, Ethical Societies, and a Global Culture of Peace,” in Atlanta, USA marked the launch of the Latin American Presidential Mission at the Carter Presidential Center and the participation of nine former heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;Four-day Global Peace Conference to draw hundreds to Atlanta, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, November 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Global Peace Convention 2012 Atlanta, Georgia, United States (Report)."

The Global Peace Foundation began work in Nigeria in 2013 in response to growing extremist violence with a series of conferences and meetings that gathered prominent Muslim and Christian clerics and traditional rulers. Just days after a declaration of a state of emergency in three states by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, GPF held a Consultative Meeting, “The Role of Religious Leaders and Traditional Rulers in Building a Culture of Peace, National Unity and Integration,” on May 16, 2013 in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. A Global Peace Leadership Conference and festival in November sponsored in partnership with the Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution, an agency of Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, inaugurated the nationwide One Family under God campaign to mitigate sectarian divisions.

Another conference outcome was the launch of the African Peace Service Corps and the Africa Leadership Mission on Peace-building, Young Leadership and Service, co-chaired by Seychelles founding President Sir James Mancham and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo.

The 2013 Global Peace Convention in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia included a delegation of 40 Nigerian political and religious leaders. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib was presented with the Global Peace Award for Promoting a Culture of Peace at the conclusion of the convention.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Peace Convention 2013."

The Nepal convening was supported by partners including the U.S. Peace Corps, KOICA, Australian Volunteers International, JCYC Nepal, Nepalese Young Entrepreneurs' Forum, Nepal Water Week and Global Peace Youth  - Nepal.

Following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck central Nepal on April 25, the Global Peace Foundation and Asia-Pacific Peace and Development Service Alliance worked to coordinate youth volunteer efforts in support of earthquake victims.

The ongoing emergency volunteer mobilization is part of a long-term strategic development plan for Nepal supported by the Global Peace Foundation, Nepal’s Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Asia Pacific Peace and Development Service Alliance, and the Alliance’s many international, regional and national public and private partners and youth networks.

A Global Peace Leadership Conference was held in Belfast, Northern Ireland in September 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eastwest.ngo/idea/how-de-glorify-and-discredit-isis|title=How to De-glorify and Discredit ISIS {{!}} EastWest Institute|website=www.eastwest.ngo|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guillaume Schnaebelé''' or '''Wilhelm Schnäbele'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/1887/ 1887 Chronology] (German). [https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dhm.de%2Flemo%2Fhtml%2F1887%2Findex.html English translation] (Google)&lt;/ref&gt; (1831 – 5 December 1900) was a French official from [[Alsace]], best known for being arrested by Germans in the April 1887 '''Schnaebele incident''' (or '''Affair''') which nearly led to war between France and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise noted, the content of this article is verbatim from: {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/handbookfordiplo00ande#page/128/mode/2up |title=Handbook for the Diplomatic History of Europe, Asia, and Africa, 1870–1914 |author1=[[Frank Maloy Anderson]] |author2=[[Amos Shartle Hershey]] |year=1918 |publisher=GPO |pages=128-9 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}} Edits for modernization, clarity and content corrections have been made.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E2DD1E3BEE33A25755C0A9649D946197D6CF |title=M.

Who caused the incident and why remains speculative, but it has been suggested German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] was its instigator, for a number of possible motivations&amp;nbsp;— baiting France into starting a war; or, gauging the extent of French support for [[Boulangism]]; or, creating a strained situation with France to force the renewal of a [[Reinsurance Treaty|Russian-German alliance of neutrality]] that was under debate at the Russian court. Others see it as simply a series of [[unintended consequences]], notable for the role played by France's General [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]]. This and a number of other incidents involving General Boulanger are elements of what is known as the [[Boulanger Affair]], a series of embarrassments for the newly formed government of the [[French Third Republic]] that some consider to have nearly led to a coup d'état.&lt;ref name= sowerine/&gt;

==Biography==
Guillaume Schnaebelé or ''Wilhelm Schnäbele'' was an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] born in 1831 in [[Eckbolsheim]], near [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name=boeglin/&gt;  After the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and Germany's subsequent annexation of Alsace in 1871, he emigrated to France, probably altering the spelling of his name accordingly. He had served in the war and was awarded a [[Legion of Honor|Knight of the Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref name= boeglin/&gt; After the incident of 1887 he was moved to a post at [[Laon]].&lt;ref name=barclay/&gt; He died on 5 December 1900 in [[Nancy, France]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  In 2005, as part of the arrival of the [[TGV]] to Pagny-sur-Moselle, a bridge was named for Schnaebelé.&lt;ref name=boeglin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-storialdelorraine.com/Schnaebele.html |title=Schnaebelé Affair |language=French |work=Edouard Boeglin - L’Alsace/Le Pays |author= |date=April 1999 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schnaebele Affair==
[[Image:Schnaebele-snatch.jpg|thumb|Illustration: Schnaebelé being grabbed at the border by two German secret policemen in disguise.]]
[[Image:Schnaebele-snatch2.jpg|thumb|Illustration: Schnaebelé is dragged by his assailants to the German (left) side of the border. Note the border marker on left edge of the road marking the boundary between the French road and German railway embankment.]]

[[Image:Schnaebele-snatch4.jpg|thumb|Illustration: After the incident, French customs officials looking across the border (to the left), marked by the square-topped pole on the left.]]

On 21 April 1887 the French [[Havas]] news agency published a dispatch to the effect that Schnaebelé, a mid-level and obscure French police inspector, had been arrested by two agents of the German secret police on the Franco-German frontier near [[Pagny-sur-Moselle]], as he was on his way to [[Ars-sur-Moselle|Ars an der Mosel]] (now: Ars-sur-Moselle) for a meeting with the German police inspector there, at the latter's request. A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory (see "Account of incident" below); but regardless, the French claimed that under the circumstances Schnaebelé was entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. The reason given by the German authorities for the arrest was that in a previous inquiry into charges of treasonable practices against a number of [[Alsace|Alsatians]], evidence had been produced that Schnaebelé was involved in transmitting to Paris information as to German fortresses, furnished by Alsatians in the pay of the French Government, and that an order had been given to arrest him if ever he should be found on German soil. In other words, the Germans believed Schnaebelé to be a spy.&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt;

Within a week of his arrest, on 28 April, Schnaebelé was released by order of the German Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]]. In a dispatch of the same date to the French ambassador at Berlin, Bismarck explained that, although the German Government considered, in view of the proofs of guilt, the arrest to be fully justified, it was deemed expedient to release Schnaebelé on the ground that business meetings between frontier officials "must always be regarded as protected by a mutually-assured safe conduct."&lt;ref&gt;The full letter from Bismarck is translated and published in: {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/internationalcas01stowuoft#page/226/mode/2up |title=International Cases |volume=1 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |author1=[[Ellery Cory Stowell]] |author2=Henry Fraser Munro |year=1916 |pages=226–8 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ended the Schnaebelé incident.

The week-long incident, between 21 and 28 April, had such threatening and provocative language from both sides, as to cause serious concern of war.  A large section of the German press demanded that Germany make no concession. In France, the Cabinet voted 6 to 5 against an ultimatum demanding the release of Schnaebelé with an apology, which would almost certainly have meant war, as had happened with the [[Ems Dispatch]] in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/internationalcas01stowuoft#page/224/mode/2up |title=International Cases |volume=1 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |author1=Ellery Cory Stowell |author2=Henry Fraser Munro |year=1916 |pages=225 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed ultimatum had been put forward by French war hawk and Minister of War [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], who also brought in a bill to mobilise an army corps.&lt;ref name=barclay&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/thirtyyearsanglo00barc#page/90/mode/2up |title=Thirty Years, Anglo-French Reminiscences (1876–1906) |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |author=[[Thomas Barclay (economic writer)|Thomas Barclay]] |year=1914 |pages=90–1 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schnaebelé's release and Bismarck's letter, many in the French public thought Bismarck backed down, because he was afraid of Boulanger&lt;ref name=sowerine/&gt; which increased Boulanger's rising star as a national hero and bolstered his image as a "Revenger" for France against Germany. However, it was, in truth, an embarrassment to the Republican government, who knew the French army was no better off than in 1870, when Germany quickly defeated it in the [[Franco Prussian War]] — Boulanger's antagonism against Germany during the week long crisis was indeed a danger to the Republic.&lt;ref name=sowerine&gt;{{cite book  |title=France Since 1870 |publisher=Palgrave |author=Charles Sowerine |year=2001 |pages=60–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other reasons, on 7 July 1887 Boulanger was released as Minister of War and dispatched by the government to a provincial post to be hopefully forgotten, but not before admiring throngs tried to stop his train from leaving Paris: loyal to his military orders, he was smuggled out in a switched engine.&lt;ref name= sowerine/&gt;

===Cause===
The reasons for the arrest and release of Schnaebelé have never been entirely explained, but there are theories, both contemporary and modern.

Contemporary theorists include Elie de Cyon, who asserted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=La France et la Russie |journal=La Nouvelle Revue |author1= |date=15 April 1890 |volume=63 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Bismarck brought about the incident intentionally (for reasons explained below); that [[Czar Alexander III]], made apprehensive for the peace of Europe, wrote an autographic letter to William I in regard to the matter, and that the Kaiser, going over the head of his chancellor Bismarck, ordered the release of Schnaebelé. Several French politicians at the time suspected the incident of being a calculated experiment by Bismarck to gauge the depth of the anti-German feeling in France, a means of testing, by an incident, which could be closed at any time by a mere apology, without any shock to German national dignity, whether Boulanger had a sufficient following in public opinion to make [[Boulangism]] a real danger to peace.&lt;ref name=barclay/&gt; In Germany, the incident occurred during a time when Bismarck was trying to force a new and very expensive military law through the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]],&lt;ref&gt;The Septennate army law, or seven years credit for military expenses.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has occasionally been speculated that it was necessary to inflame the menace of war to justify these new taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/diplomacyofgreat00bull#page/20/mode/2up |title=The Diplomacy of the Great War |publisher=The Macmillan Company |author=Arthur Bullard |year=1917 |pages=21–2 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Army Bill was passed on 11 March, three weeks before Schnaebelé crossed the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Book Review: Bismark |journal=The American Historical Review |author1=Sidney B. Fay |date=October 1919  |volume=XXV |number=1 |page=102 |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanhistoric19191920jame#page/102/mode/2up |doi=10.2307/1836385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bismarck might have been trying to agitate conflict with France before Germany's treaty of neutrality with Russia expired that year (signed in 1881 and renewed in 1884) — Germany knew from experience that it could not afford a war with France without a neutral or allied Russia.&lt;ref name=fuller/&gt; Russia would only remain neutral if the responsibility for war was cast on the French, as happened in 1870.&lt;ref name=fuller/&gt; When the French government stood its ground and presented an irrefutable case, failing to throw the responsibility on the French, Bismarck knew, from previous experience, that he could not count on Russia's neutrality if conflict came, and he had to back down: Schnaebelé was therefore set free.&lt;ref name=fuller/&gt; Related to the Russians, Bismarck may have wanted to create a strained situation with France, to counteract the [[Panslavist]] party in Russia, who, at the time, were lobbying the cabinet of the Russian Emperor not to renew the Russian-German alliance.&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/bismarcksdiploma00fulluoft#page/170/mode/2up |title=Bismarck's Diplomacy at Its Zenith |publisher=Harvard University Press |author=Joseph Vincent Fuller |year=1922 |pages=171–84 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern (1989) research suggests a simpler explanation. Schnaebelé was, in fact, engaged in espionage, working under the express request of Boulanger.&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt; However, Schnaebelé had been invited onto German territory by his German counterpart, which was a guarantee of safe-conduct, and thus his arrest, whilst on German territory, was legally irregular, which is why Bismarck agreed to his release.&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt; Bismarck had backed down, exclusively, because of the circumstances surrounding the arrest.&lt;ref name=irvine&gt;{{cite book |title=The Boulanger Affair Reconsidered |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=[[William D. Irvine]] |year=1989 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Account===
According to one account, the incident occurred as follows:&lt;ref name=boeglin/&gt; It was a cool day and Schnaebelé was wearing a coat and top hat. He walked briskly on the road leading from [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (France) to [[Metz]] (then in [[Alsace-Lorraine|Lothringen]], German Empire). The road is deserted. To his left are two French brothers working in a vineyard. To his right are a number of German railroad workers out of sight, but within earshot. Gautsch, his German colleague of [[Ars-sur-Moselle|Ars an der Mosel]] who he is supposed to meet, is not in sight. Schnaebelé wonders if Gautsch has reneged on the meeting. Schnaebelé is waiting impatiently, a few steps from the German side. Suddenly, a man in a gray blouse appears from the German side, hails Schnaebelé, then rushes at him, trying to lead him into Germany. Schnaebelé successfully resists but then a second man in a gray blouse appears. Returning a few steps into French territory, Schnaebelé exclaims (in German): "What do you want from me? I'm Guillaume Schnaebele Commissioner Special Pagny. I am here at home! This is the border." His two attackers do not listen and continue to grapple him across the border. The two French farmers do not intervene, but the six German rail workers on hearing the cries for help come into view. But what they see deters action: the two assailants remove their blouses and are shown to be wearing uniforms of the German police. Everything is then perfectly clear. They handcuff Schnaebelé by the wrist and lead him on foot to the village of Novéant and then by train to Metz. There he is thrown into prison and held incommunicado.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">Lieutenant General '''Keith Coster'''  [[Independence Decoration (Rhodesia)|ID]] [[OBE]] [[Order of the Star of South Africa|SSAS]] (19 April 1920-5 June 2012) was a South African army officer who rose to command the Rhodesian Army from 1968 to 1972.

Keith Coster was born on the 19 April 1920 in Eshowe, Kwa-Zulu-Natal, South Africa. He was educated at [[Maritzburg College]],&lt;ref name="Maritz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maritzburgcollege.org.za/mcob/military?showall=&amp;start=3 | title=Military old boys | accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]].  After his matriculation at the school in 1936, he enlisted in the [[Special Service Battalion]] of the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Union Defence Force]] (UDF) (of South Africa), and was commissioned into the [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF) on 6 September 1939. While flying a [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Mohawk V]] with [[5 Squadron SAAF]], he was shot down over North Africa by a Bf109 in 1942 and was a prisoner of war until May 1945.

==Post World War II==
After the war, he transferred to the South African army, and during 1952 attended the Royal Army Staff College at Camberley in England. In 1955, he left the South African Permanent Force to join the Army of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] as a major. In 1959, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE). 

On the dissolution of the federation, he joined the [[Rhodesian Army]], in which he rose to the rank of lieutenant general and was appointed as general officer commanding. He retired from that post in 1972 as a [[lieutenant-general]], having commanded the Rhodesian Army from 1968 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=DWboTJOvHYy2hAeNg5wP |journal=Africa Research Bulletin |volume=9 |year=1972 |title=Military Appointments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Coster was received the Independence Decoration (Rhodesia) in 1965 and was awarded a [[Order of the Star of South Africa|Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of South Africa]] in 1981.

'''Kiwiburn''' is a regional [[Burning Man]] event celebrating principles such as inclusion, radical self-expression, gifting, participative art and culture.

==History==
In 1994 Mark ‘Yonderman’ Stirling and his partner Jane discovered [http://www.burningman.com/ Burning Man] by accident while on a camping trip in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada. Mark decided to stage the first regional burn in New Zealand in late 2003 as part of the South Island’s Visionz festival. It was met with great enthusiasm from the participants, so the 2005 and 2006 burns took place as stand-alone events, attracting around 200 people (Mark co-ran these events with Grant ‘Tribalman’ Knowles, a friend and local drum-maker/festival organizer).

2007 marked the first year the festival was held in the North Island. In mid-2006, amidst the planning for the 2007 event, a group of highly enthused, motivated burners joined with Yonderman to form an organizational structure and bring the event north. The event was aptly named Megamorphosis, which means Massive Change. [http://kiwiburn.com/ Kiwiburn] has helped create a large community of burners around New Zealand, and the annual event, along with the occasional localized gatherings, continues to maintain its unique culture [http://www.kiwiburn.com/about/]

Kiwiburn celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2013, with the theme enlighTENment! 

After seven burns in [[Whakamaru]], Kiwiburn moved to a private farm in [[Hunterville]] in 2014. It was a huge undertaking to find a new site, close to a town and away from roads, where the locals immediately embraced the festival's culture.

A small team of devoted and talented Kiwiburners from around the country now organise Kiwiburn. These people had a vision of what a New Zealand burner event could be like, and the people who came not knowing a thing about the culture of Burning Man continue to embrace it, and want more. Information and reviews of subsequent Kiwiburns can be found in the annual Afterburn Report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kiwiburn.com/afterburn Afterburn Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[Image:Kiwiburn 2008 firewhip.jpg|right|thumbnail|Fire poi at Kiwiburn '08]]

As a Regional [[Burning Man]] Event, Kiwiburn adheres to the ten principles of [[Burning Man]].  Among these are the [[Leave No Trace]] philosophy, radical self-expression, radical self-reliance, and communal effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiwiburn.com/about/guiding-principles/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theme Camps are one of the key components of vibrant regional Burning Man events.  Theme Camps are established by participants to enhance the experience for all participants. Theme Camps often put on events during Kiwiburn so that participants get to know each other and encourage each other to get more involved [http://www.kiwiburn.com/participate/theme-camps/].

Notable, recurrent [[Burning Man#Villages and theme camps|theme camps]] include "The Green Fairy", "The Green Room", "Balrogs", "Dancealot", "Wilderland", "Chur", "Taradise" and "Camp F*ck Yeah".

The theme for 2017 was The Robots are Coming [http://www.kiwiburn.com/about/theme/]

[[Air Commodore]] '''Leonard Joseph Birchall''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM|OBE|DFC|OOnt|CD}} (6 July 1915 – 10 September 2004), "The Saviour of Ceylon", was a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) officer who warned of a Japanese attack on the island of [[Ceylon]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadaveteranshallofvalour.com/BirchallLJ.htm "Leonard Birchall."] ''Canada Veterans Hall of Valour''. Retrieved: 18 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Birchall was born in [[St. Catharines]], Ontario and graduated from St. Catharines Collegiate. He was always interested in flying, and worked odd jobs around St. Catharines to pay for flying lessons.

==Military service==
After serving in the [[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals]], Birchall enrolled as a cadet at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in Kingston, Ontario (student #2364) in 1933. He was commissioned in the RCAF upon graduation in 1937 and was trained as a pilot.

===Second World War===
[[File:Supermarine Stranraer 2 ExCC.jpg|thumb|right|RCAF Stranraer in wartime camouflage]]
At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, [[Flying Officer]] Birchall flew convoy and anti-submarine patrols from [[Nova Scotia]] flying with [[No. 5 Squadron RCAF|No. 5 Squadron]].&lt;ref name="Milberry  p. 207"/&gt; The squadron was equipped with the [[Supermarine Stranraer]].

On June 10, 1940, Birchall was responsible for the capture of an Italian merchant ship, the ''Capo Nola'', in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], hours after Canada declared war on Italy. Birchall had been tasked with locating any Italian vessels still in Canadian waters as the outbreak of war became imminent. On June 10, he found the ''Capo Nola''. Birchall had been informed of the declaration of war by radio so made a low pass over the freighter, as if making an attack. This panicked the captain into running his vessel aground against a sandbank. Birchall then touched down nearby and waited until Royal Canadian Navy vessels reached the scene. The ''Capo Nola's'' crew were the first Italian prisoners taken by the Allies during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Pigott, 2003, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1942, he joined [[No. 413 Squadron RCAF|413 Squadron]], then based in the [[Shetland Islands]] and flew patrols over the [[North Sea]]. After the Japanese successes in southeast Asia, the squadron was sent to [[Ceylon]] to provide a reconnaissance force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/secondwar/asia/overindian "Canadians in Asia 1945-1995: Over the Indian Ocean."] ''Veterans Affairs Canada'', 23 October 1998. Retrieved: 18 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 1942, only two days after his arrival, [[Squadron Leader]] Birchall was flying a [[PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]] that was patrolling the ocean to the south of Ceylon.  Nine hours into the mission, as the plane was about to return to base, ships were spotted on the horizon.  Investigation revealed a large Japanese fleet, including five [[aircraft carrier]]s, heading for Ceylon, which at that time was the base for the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[British Eastern Fleet|Eastern Fleet]].&lt;ref name="Milberry  pp. 18–181"&gt;Milberry 1984, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;  Birchall's crew managed to send out a radio message, but the Catalina was soon shot down by six [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M2 Zero]] fighters from the carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiryū||2}}. The [[Easter Sunday Raid]] went ahead despite Birchall's signal, but his warning put the defenders on alert and allowed the harbour to be partially cleared before the Japanese attacked Colombo.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Rob.[http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo7/no4/stuart-eng.asp "Leonard Birchall and the Japanese Raid on Colombo."] ''Canadian Military Journal, Volume 7 Number 4.''  Retrieved: 3 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prisoner of war===
Three of his crewmen were killed in the action and the others, including Birchall, spent the rest of the war as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs).&lt;ref name="Milberry  pp. 18–181"/&gt; For many captured servicemen, a trip to a Japanese camp meant death.&lt;ref name="cdnabbrotherhood.ca"&gt;Craggs, Samantha. [http://www.rickdykstra.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1591&amp;Itemid=49 "St. Catharines' Len Birchall was 'The Saviour of Ceylon'."] ''Canadian Airborne Brotherhood'', 25 July 2008. Retrieved: 12 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the senior Allied officer in four successive Japanese prisoner of war camps, the resistance led by Birchall helped to reduce the Allied death rate from an average of 30% to less than 2%. During his time in the POW camps, he repeatedly stood up to the Japanese and demanded fair treatment of the prisoners, in compliance with the [[Geneva Convention]].  In his first camp, he struck a Japanese soldier who was forcing a wounded Australian to work.  This earned Birchall a severe beating and solitary confinement, but won him the respect of the other POWs.  In 1944, Birchall encountered a situation in which sick men were being forced to work on the docks.  He ordered all of the men to stop working until the sick were excused.  Birchall was beaten and sent to a special discipline camp, where he again was beaten. He saved many ill soldiers by taking their beatings.&lt;ref name="Milberry  pp. 18–181"/&gt;

Birchall was liberated on 27 August 1945 by American troops.&lt;ref name="Milberry  p. 207"&gt;Milberry 1979, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2017}} His wife Dorothy had not known whether he was dead or alive for two years. His diaries, written during his captivity and buried, formed the basis of a number of Allied wartime trials at which Birchall testified.&lt;ref name="cdnabbrotherhood.ca"/&gt;

==Postwar==

In the immediate postwar years, Birchall served on the Canadian attaché staff in [[Washington, D.C.]], then was a member of the Canadian [[NATO]] delegation in [[Paris]]. He later commanded a fighter base&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1472001/Air-Commodore-Leonard-Birchall.html "Leonard Birchall Obituary."]  ''Daily Telegraph,''  11 September 2004. Retrieved: 12 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} and was commandant of the Royal Military College of Canada from 1963 until his retirement from the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1967. He retired from the RCAF rather than be associated with the unification of the Armed Forces.  He later served as honorary colonel of [[No. 400 Squadron RCAF|400 Tactical Helicopter and Training Squadron]] and 413 Squadron in the Air Reserve.

From 1967 to 1982 Birchall was chief executive and administrative officer of the Faculty of Administrative Studies at [[York University]], which awarded him the degree of Doctor of Laws ''honoris causa'' on the occasion of his retirement in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?Article=3382 "File - York's Daily Bulletin -Passings".]  ''York University.'' Retrieved: 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 general election in [[Sri Lanka]], Birchall was an official observer.

Birchall died in [[Kingston, Ontario]] at the age of 89.

==Honours==

Birchall was made an officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in 1946, after his return to Canada for his work at prisoner of war camps. The citation, in part, read: "he continually displayed the utmost concern for the welfare of fellow prisoners with complete disregard for his own safety. His consistent gallantry and glowing devotion to his men were in keeping with the finest traditions of the service".  Leonard Birchall was also awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (UK)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) for his part in detecting the attack on Ceylon and for alerting the Allies during that 1942 flight.&lt;ref name="cdnabbrotherhood.ca"/&gt; The presentation was made on 29 April 1946 at the Embassy of Ceylon in [[Washington DC]], United States. [[Hume Wrong]], the Canadian Ambassador to the United States presented the OBE and the DFC to Leonard Birchall, in the presence of the Ambassador of Ceylon, Sir [[Claude Corea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ivan_corea.tripod.com/id30.html "The presentation to Leonard Birchall in the presence of Ceylon's Ambassador Sir Claude Corea in Washington DC, USA."] Photograph in the ''Ceylon Daily News,'' 1946. Retrieved: 12 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

When citizens of his hometown, St. Catharines, Ontario heard Birchall was missing in action, students of Connaught school planted a memorial tree. The Len Birchall Memorial Circle is also in St. Catharines.&lt;ref name="cdnabbrotherhood.ca"/&gt;

In 1950, U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] appointed Birchall an officer of the [[Legion of Merit]], saying: "His exploits became legendary throughout Japan and brought renewed faith and strength to many hundreds of ill and disheartened prisoners."

In 2000, Birchall received the [[Order of Canada]]. In 2001, he was inducted into Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame. He was honorary colonel at the Royal Military College of Canada.&lt;ref name="cdnabbrotherhood.ca"/&gt;  Birchall was the only member of the Canadian military to have earned five clasps for his [[Canadian Forces Decoration]] (CD), representing 62 years of service with the air force.  The only other person with five clasps was [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]].

As a recipient of the 2001 [[Vimy Award]], Birchall was recognized as a Canadian who made a significant and outstanding contribution to the defence and security of Canada and the preservation of Canada's democratic values. He was also honoured for his years of service to the community, including building a facility in 1993 at a Kingston Girl Guide camp at his own cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmcclub.ca/everitaswp/?p=1430#more-1430 "e-Veritas."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207122811/http://www.rmcclub.ca/everitaswp/?p=1430 |date=2008-12-07 }} ''rmcclub.ca.'' Retrieved: 18 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leonard Birchall Sports pavilion at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], in the area of the Navy Bay sports fields, was constructed in his honour, from December 2008 to September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classof1960.rmcclub.ca/class_foundation_projects.htm "Class Foundation Projects."] ''classof1960.rmcclub.ca.'' Retrieved: 18 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The road leading to the terminal and hangars at Kingston's Norman Rogers Airport is named Len Birchall Way.

Birchall was honoured in 2009 as one of the 100 most influential Canadians in aviation and had his name emblazoned directly behind the starboard roundel on the fuselage with the others on the 2009 [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18]] Centennial of Flight demonstration Hornet.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Mary.

Retrieved: 14 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

His widow Kathleen Birchall donated money to the [[Air Cadet League of Canada]] to set up a scholarship in his name. On 9 November 2011, 883 Air Commodore Leonard Birchall Squadron of the [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]] based in [[Markham, Ontario]] was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.883markhamair.com/sqn-information 833 Squadron Information] Retrieved: 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Air Commodore Birchall's name was also added to the wall of honour at the Royal Military College of Canada.

Birchall was dubbed the "Saviour of Ceylon" by the Canadian press and not, as claimed by many, by Winston Churchill.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The '''Lexington Opera House''' is a theatre located at 401 West Short Street in downtown [[Lexington, Kentucky]].  Built in 1886, the Opera House replaced the former theatre, located on the corner of Main and Broadway, after fire destroyed it in January 1886. The new Opera House was designed by the renowned architect [[Oscar Cobb]] and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its historical and architectural significance. Now owned and operated by the Lexington Center Corporation, the Lexington Opera House is host to ballet, opera, children's productions, family shows, comedy, music and professional national Broadway tours. The Lexington Opera House is one of the only 14 theatres in the country built before 1900 with less than 1,000 seats that is still in operation as a live performance venue.

==History==
The Lexington Opera House officially opened on July 19, 1887, with a concert by the [[Cincinnati Symphony]], and in August hosted its first production of Our Angel by the Lizzie Evans Stock Company. Following the production, the Opera House quickly received widespread attention throughout the region. Over the years, the Opera House hosted a variety of notable performances with famous acts including [[Al Jolson]], [[W.C. Fields]], [[Will Rogers]], [[Harry Houdini]], [[Lillian Russell]], [[Sarah Bernhard]]t and many more.

Distinguished performances with elaborate details solidified the Opera House's popularity. In 1890, the production of Henley Regatta flooded the stage and the majority of the performance took place in rowboats; then, in 1893, the Country Circus featured 100 animals in a mile-long parade. For the production of Ben Hur, significant remodeling occurred to house an on-stage chariot race. 
The Opera House continued to successfully provide entertainment throughout the region for a quarter of a century. But, with cultural changes on the rise, the Opera House was unable to sustain management due to a decline in profits. The development of automobiles, radio entertainment and motion pictures mounted a myriad of obstacles that led to the downfall of live productions.

The last live performance in the Opera House was The Arabian, in 1926. Soon after, the transformation into a movie house was launched. A false ceiling was attached to block off everything above the first balcony, and the box seats were enclosed with plasterboard. Occasionally, vaudeville and burlesque shows performed until 1936.

The Harry Schwartz family was confident in the Opera House's conversion into a movie house. Price Coomer went to work for Harry Schwartz in 1930 and bought the house from him in 1955. Coomer remodeled the house and fortunately saved it from the first wrecker's ball. In 1961, under the urban renewal project, the Opera House was scheduled to be demolished, but in due course the Opera House was not torn down, rather a windbreak that protected the theatre was removed.

In 1968, a windstorm caused the false ceiling to collapse, which raised attention for leaders in the urban renewal project to demolish the theatre. Then in 1973, a second windstorm caused the roof of the building to collapse. The dilapidated theatre was seen invaluable and was only a third-run movie house during that time.

Private and public campaigns were established to educate and inform the public regarding the history and tradition of the Opera House's significance to the community. Building inspectors determined that it would be cheaper to renovate the Opera House for $2.5 million than to reconstruct a new building for $7 million. The Opera House was purchased by the city as part of the Lexington Center Corporation and was provided financial assistance from the Opera House Fund, Inc. The fund was developed by local philanthropists William T. Young and George and Linda Carey.

The Opera House Fund, Incorporated, was founded in 1974 and is a non-profit community service that is dedicated to assisting the Lexington Center Corporation in support of the Lexington Opera House. The fund supports the Opera House through the presentation of professional touring artists on the Broadway Live and Variety Live series, as well as a subsidy program for local performing arts groups.

==Architecture==
Oscar Cobb of Chicago designed the three-story building and the Broadway Real Estate Company awarded the architecture-construction contract to H.L. Rowe of Lexington. The theatre originally seated 1,250 people and was constructed of two balconies with two boxes on each side of the stage. The theatre consisted of two parts: a 3,360 square-foot auditorium and a 2,220 square-foot stage area. Perhaps the greatest spectacle of the Opera House was its intricate design work. The 596 seats were upholstered with Turkish [[Morocco leather|Morocco]] and velvet, and each box included its own hat rack, cane and umbrella holder. There were 250 gaslights, 37 sets of scenery and a drop curtain. The stage development was undoubtedly progressive and featured innovations such as the Edison light board and a series of trap doors to enable animals to be used during productions. To avoid another fire, the Opera House had standpipes with water pressure and hose connections that could flood the stage, if needed. 

In 1975 the rehabilitation of the Opera House, led by the Lexington Center Corporation, began by removing the false ceiling, reopening the two balconies and restoration to the boxes. The stage was reconstructed and updated to house modern stage equipment, but the Edison light board was restored for historical purposes. The renovation was completed in 1976.

Now, the restored theatre has less than 1,000 seats, hosts 85,000 patrons annually, and is one of the smallest theatres in the country to host touring Broadway shows. The unique 19th century atmosphere creates a one-of-a-kind aesthetic and remains a premier cultural and historical destination in downtown Lexington.

{{dynamic list}}
This is a '''list of solved missing persons cases''' of people whose mysterious disappearances were notable and remained unexplained for a long time, but were eventually explained by their return or the recovery of their bodies, or the conviction of the perpetrator(s) responsible for their disappearances.

&lt;!--By consensus, entries must be those of people or disappearances that are notable because an article about them already exists. Do not add an entry if you cannot link to such an article.--&gt;
&lt;!--When adding ages to these tables please note:

* If any person went missing below the age of 10 (i.e. single digits), please use data-sort-value for those persons on the date value to ensure that it is kept at the top. e.g. for an age of 8, use data-sort-value="008"
* If any person went missing below the age of 1 (i.e. they were X weeks/months old), please use data-sort-value for those persons on the date value to ensure that is kept at the top. e.g. for an age of 9 weeks, work what proportion of that age was in a year:
      * Use the formula for age in months (assuming equal length of months):
            (age in months)/12
      * Use the formula for age in weeks (assuming 4 weeks in a month):
            (age in weeks)/(12*4)
      * Use the formula for age in days (assuming 4 weeks in a month and 7 days per day):
            (age in days)/(12*4*7)

* If any person in the table was missing above the age of 100, please ensure that ALL of the other dates use data-sort-value. e.g. for an age of 50 use data-sort-value="050"

This ensures that ages are in the right order

|Sir Hugh Willoughby, an English explorer, set sail from London on 10 May 1553 to search for a sea route right around the north of Europe and Asia to China. His second-in-command was [[Richard Chancellor]] of Bristol. Off the coast of Norway the two men were separated by a storm. Willoughby's ship ended up stuck in ice off [[Sápmi|Lapland]] and he and all of his crew died. Their frozen bodies were found several years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowke|first1=Bob|title=What They Don't Tell You About The Tudors|date=2001|publisher=[[Hodder Children's Books]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-340-78808-0|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of having blond hair as reported by a number of persons, she had deep black hair and the dark complexion of the gypsies.

|Williams, a successful property appraiser from [[Tallahassee, Florida]], was last seen leaving his house to go duck hunting early in the morning of 16 December 2000.

Investigators initially concluded his remains had been eaten by alligators in the lake; Williams was declared legally dead six months later. In 2004, a reopening of the case prompted by pressure from Williams' mother discredited the alligator theory and found other suspicious aspects of the case suggesting the accident at the lake might have been staged and evidence planted; it was later investigated as a possible [[insurance fraud]].&lt;ref name="Jerry Michael Williams"&gt;{{cite news|last=Portman |first=Jennifer |title=Six years ago, this hunter disappeared |url=http://www.tallahassee.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061215/NEWS01/102190004 |newspaper=[[Tallahassee Democrat]] |date=14 December 2006 |accessdate=8 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226153618/http://www.tallahassee.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061215%2FNEWS01%2F102190004 |archivedate=26 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 police announced his remains had been found, and that he was the victim of a [[homicide]], but gave no details.&lt;ref name="Jerry Michael Williams found"&gt;{{cite news|last=Portman|first=Jennifer|title=FLDE special agent: 'Mike Williams was murdered'|url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2017/12/20/fdle-give-update-mike-williams-disappearance/968920001|newspaper=[[Tallahassee Democrat]]|date=20 December 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 May 2018, police arrested Williams' former wife, who had remarried.

'''Matthew 27:59''' is the fifty-ninth verse of the twenty-seventh chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. This verse describes [[Joseph of Arimathea]] gathering Jesus' body after the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].

The original [[Koine Greek]], according to [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], reads:
:και λαβων το σωμα ο ιωσηφ ενετυλιξεν αυτο [εν] σινδονι καθαρα

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible it is translated as:
:And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

The modern [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=27:59&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 27:59]

In the previous verse Joseph obtained permission from [[Pontius Pilate]] to give the body of Jesus a proper burial, and in this verse he collects Jesus from the cross. In art, taking the body of Jesus is an event known as the [[Descent from the Cross]], and has been the subject of many paintings and works of art. Matthew gives few details about this event. Matthew does not mention the figure of [[Nicodemus]], who helps Joseph in the Gospel of John. Taking Jesus down from the cross would have been the work of more than one person. [[Raymond E. Brown|Brown]] believes that this verse implies that the body was taken down by the Romans and delivered to Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Raymond E. ''Death of the Messiah.'' Doubleday, 1994. pg. 1252&lt;/ref&gt;

This verse is a modification of material found at [[Mark 15:46]], and is paralleled by [[Luke 23:53]] and [[John 19:40]]. Matthew adds a mention of the linen being "clean" one of four places in his gospel that the author of Matthew adds a mention of cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982. pg. 581&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other gospels, Matthew does not mention any anointing of Jesus' body. Perhaps the events of [[Matthew 26:12]] are considered by the gospel writer to be sufficient anointment.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. T. France|France, R.T.]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 pg. 1090&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph wraps the body in cloth, covering Jesus' nakedness that was the result of [[Matthew 27:35]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W.D. and Dale C. Allison, Jr. ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew''. Edinburgh : T. &amp; T. Clark, 1988-1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The word translated as 'cloth' is ''sindon''. It refers to one large piece of cloth, and can also be translated as ''[[shroud]]''. By tradition the cloth mentioned here is preserved today as the [[Shroud of Turin]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Daniel J. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Liturgical Press, 1991 pg. 405&lt;/ref&gt; The cloth is described differently at [[John 19:40]] where the word ''othonia'' is used. That word is understood to mean a tightly wrapped collection of smaller cloths, and thus presents a different vision of Jesus' burial garb, but France notes that the term isn't very specific.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. T. France|France, R.T.]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 pg. 1090&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mr Selfridge''''' is a British [[period drama]] television series about [[Harry Gordon Selfridge]] and his department store, [[Selfridges|Selfridge &amp; Co]], in London, set from 1908 to 1928. It was co-produced by [[ITV Studios]] and [[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece]]/[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]&lt;ref name="selfridgeannouncement"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Masterpiece on PBS and ITV Studios Announce ''Mr. Selfridge'' Starring Jeremy Piven |date=25 July 2012 |publisher=WGBH |location=Boston|url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/media/cms_page_media/16/SelfridgeAnnouncement_3.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-10-09 |quote=MASTERPIECE/WGBH and ITV Studios have announced a coproduction deal that includes Mr. Selfridge (w.t.), a highly anticipated new drama series starring Jeremy Piven (Entourage) in the title role.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for broadcast on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]. The series began broadcasting on ITV on 6 January 2013 and 30 March 2013 on [[PBS]] in the United States.

==Development and production==
It was announced on 24 May 2011 that ITV was in discussions with ITV Studios about developing an adaptation of Lindy Woodhead's biography ''Shopping, Seduction &amp; Mr Selfridge''.&lt;ref name=announce /&gt; [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] was confirmed to be working on the script.&lt;ref name=announce&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title=Selfridges story to be made into TV series |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a321291/selfridges-story-to-be-made-into-tv-series.html |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=18 February 2013|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in London in 1908, during a time period when women were enjoying an ever-increasing amount of freedom, it tells the story of Harry Gordon Selfridge, the founder of Selfridges department store and includes members of his family, particularly his wife [[Rose Selfridge]].

It was originally planned to be screened in 2012. However, it is claimed that ITV was forced to push back airing the drama due to rival [[BBC]] airing a similarly themed drama series ''[[The Paradise (TV series)|The Paradise]]''.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Anita|title=From Selfridges to John Lewis, we've a treat in store |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9562846/From-Selfridges-to-John-Lewis-weve-a-treat-in-store.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |accessdate=11 February 2013|date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A set to the north of London was built to house a replica of the 1909 Selfridge's store interior. The exterior of the store was recreated in [[Chatham Dockyard|The Historic Dockyard Chatham]], in Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2013/01/mr-selfridge-2013/|title=Kent Film Office Mr Selfridge Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The disused [[Aldwych tube station]] was used to film Rose Selfridge travelling on the [[London Underground]] and scenes in the first episode.

On 8 February 2013, ITV announced ''Mr Selfridge'' had been commissioned for a second series of ten episodes, to start on 19 January 2014.&lt;ref name=dist&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr Selfridge commissioned for another series|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/mr-selfridge-commissioned-another-series |publisher=[[ITV Plc]] |accessdate=11 February 2013|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Byrne, who directed three episodes of series one, returned to direct some of the new episodes.&lt;ref name=direct&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title='Mr Selfridge' gets second series from ITV |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a457398/mr-selfridge-gets-second-series-from-itv.html |work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 February 2013|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2013, PBS also purchased a second series that aired in 2014 as part of its ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece Classic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/pbs-orders-second-season-of-mr-selfridge/ |title=PBS Orders Second Season of 'Mr. Selfridge' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=22 July 2013 |author=De Moraes, Lisa |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second series is set in 1914 and portrays the consequence of World War I to the store and staff. On 21 February 2014, it was announced that ''Mr. Selfridge'' had been renewed for a third series, to air in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-02-19/mr-selfridge-to-return-for-a-third-series|title=Mr Selfridge to return for a third series|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March 2015, ITV announced ''Mr Selfridge'' had been commissioned for a new 10-part fourth and final series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/mr-selfridge-commissioned-new-10-part-fourth-series|title=Mr Selfridge commissioned for new 10-part fourth series|work="ITV Press Centre"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting==
An American casting director was employed to find an actor suitable to play Harry Selfridge.&lt;ref name=lady/&gt; [[Jeremy Piven]]'s agent informed him of the role. Producer Chrissy Skinns and director Jon Jones met Piven in Los Angeles and were impressed by his understanding of the character.&lt;ref name=lady&gt;{{cite web|last=Barber|first=Richard|title=The secrets of Mr Selfridge|url=http://www.lady.co.uk/culture/television-film-radio/1540-the-secrets-of-mr-selfridge |work=[[The Lady (magazine)|The Lady]] |accessdate=17 February 2013|date=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer Kate Lewis was "thrilled to attract" [[Frances O'Connor]] to the role of [[Rose Selfridge]] because she had long been a fan of the actress.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{cite web|title=''Mr Selfridge'' production notes (Series 1) |url=http://www.itv.com/documents/pdf/Mr%20Selfridge%20Production%20Notes%20FINAL.pdf |work=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=22 October 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former ''[[Coronation Street]]'' actress [[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]] signed up to play Lady Mae Loxley and returned for Series 2 and Series 4.

He decides to build the biggest and finest department store in the world at the "dead end" of Oxford Street, but his business partner pulls out of the project. Via a pressman he receives help from socialite Lady Mae Loxley and her contacts, one of whom invests.

Months after inadvertently getting Agnes Towler fired from Gamage's for "conduct unbecoming" (she let him behind the counter while he was looking to purchase a pair of gloves), he hires her for Selfridge's.

He observed that there is "so much crisis with so little drama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Phil|title=Rewind TV: Mr Selfridge; Spies of Warsaw; The Polar Bear Family and Me – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/12/rewind-tv-mr-selfridge-review|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'s'' [[Ian Hyland]] was impressed with the series and praised the performances of Piven, Tapper and Loftus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyland|first=Ian|title=Sold, to the man on the sofa|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2260163/Mr-Selfridge-reviewed-Ian-Hyland-Sold-man-sofa.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|authorlink=Ian Hyland|date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Sweeney from Cultbox said that the show had direction but lacked "actual substance and any real surprises".

The '''quinquennial Neronia''' was a massive [[Greece|Greek]]-style festival created by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Nero]].  The festival was in three parts.  The first was [[music]], [[Eloquence|oratory]] and [[poetry]], the second was [[gymnastics]], and the last was [[Equestrianism|riding]].  It was held twice—once in AD 60 and once in AD 65. 

These games followed a tradition set by [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Augustus]] of having celebratory games to mark the anniversary of their reign.

Timing of the quinquennial Neronia has puzzled historians.  "[[Quinquennial]]" means "every five" but in practice means every four.  Romans counted things inclusively.  So between 1 and 5, there are 4 years.  Additionally, being a Greek festival, a four-year cycle is consistent with customs.

Yet, the quinquennial Neronia took place in AD 60, 6 years after Nero's rise to power in AD 54, and then again in AD 65, 5 years after that.

The quinquennial Neronia is mentioned in [[Suetonius]], [[The Twelve Caesars|''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'']] Life of Nero 12 and ''The Lives of the Poets'' Life of Lucanus, [[Tacitus]], [[Annals (Tacitus)|''Annals'']] XIV.20 and XVI.2, and [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' LXI.21.

{{Campaignbox Reconstruction Era}}
{{slavery}}
{{Periods in US history}}
The '''Reconstruction era''' was the period from 1863 to 1877 in [[history of the United States|American history]]. The term has two applications: the first applies to the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the [[American Civil War]]; the second, to the attempted transformation of the 11 ex-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] from 1863 to 1877, as directed by [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Reconstruction ended the remnants of Confederate secession and ended slavery, making the newly free slaves citizens with civil rights apparently guaranteed by three new Constitutional amendments. Three visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction: the reconciliationist vision, which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought; the [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] vision, which included terror and violence; and the emancipationist vision, which sought full freedom, citizenship, and Constitutional equality for [[African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;David W. Blight, ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Andrew Johnson]] both took moderate positions designed to bring the South back into the Union as quickly as possible, while [[Radical Republican]]s in Congress sought stronger measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans, including the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], while curtailing the rights of former Confederates, such as through the provisions of the [[Wade–Davis Bill]]. Johnson, a former Tennessee Senator and former slave owner, followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates. Lincoln's last speeches show that he was leaning toward supporting the [[suffrage|enfranchisement]] of all [[freedmen]], whereas Johnson was opposed to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James M. Campbell |author2=Rebecca J. Fraser |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Reconstruction: People and Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGmD0Zl27GIC&amp;pg=PR15|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's interpretations of Lincoln's policies prevailed until the Congressional elections of 1866.  Those elections followed outbreaks of violence against blacks in the former rebel states, including the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] that same year.  The subsequent 1866 election gave Republicans a majority in Congress, enabling them to pass the 14th Amendment, take control of Reconstruction policy, remove former Confederates from power, and enfranchise the freedmen. A Republican coalition came to power in nearly all the southern states and set out to transform the society by setting up a free labor economy, using the [[U.S. Army]] and the [[Freedmen's Bureau]]. The Bureau protected the legal rights of freedmen, negotiated labor contracts, and set up schools and churches for them. Thousands of Northerners came south as missionaries, teachers, businessmen and politicians. Hostile whites began referring to these politicians as "[[carpetbagger]]s". In early 1866, Congress passed the Freedmen's Bureau and Civil Rights Bills and sent them to Johnson for his signature. The first bill extended the life of the bureau, originally established as a temporary organization charged with assisting refugees and freed slaves, while the second defined all persons born in the United States as national citizens with equality before the law. After Johnson vetoed the bills, Congress overrode his veto, making the Civil Rights Act the first major bill in the history of the United States to become law through an override of a presidential veto. The Radicals in the House of Representatives, frustrated by Johnson's opposition to Congressional Reconstruction, [[impeachment of Andrew Johnson|filed impeachment charges]]. The action failed by one vote in the Senate.  The new national reconstruction laws – in particular laws requiring suffrage (the right to vote) for freedmen – incensed white supremacists in the south, giving rise to the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  During 1867-69 the Klan murdered Republicans and outspoken freedmen in the south, including Arkansas Congressman [[James M. Hinds]].

Elected in 1868, Republican [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] supported Congressional Reconstruction and enforced the protection of African Americans in the South through the use of the [[Enforcement Acts]] passed by Congress. Grant used the Enforcement Acts to effectively combat the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which was essentially wiped out, although a new incarnation of the Klan eventually would again come to national prominence in the 1920s. Nevertheless, President Grant was unable to resolve the escalating tensions inside the Republican Party between the northerners on the one hand, and those Republicans originally hailing from the South on the other (this latter group would be labelled "[[Scalawag]]s" by those opposing Reconstruction). Meanwhile, "[[Redeemers]]", self-styled Conservatives (in close cooperation with [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|a faction of the Democratic Party]]) strongly opposed reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. Rodrigue|title=Reconstruction in the Cane Fields: From Slavery to Free Labor in Louisiana's Sugar Parishes, 1862–1880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvK13hta7rQC&amp;pg=PA168|year=2001|publisher=LSU Press|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; They alleged widespread corruption by the "Carpetbaggers", excessive state spending and ruinous taxes. Meanwhile, public support for Reconstruction policies, requiring continued supervision of the South, faded in the North after the Democrats, who strongly opposed Reconstruction, regained control of the House of Representatives in 1874. In 1877, as part of a Congressional bargain to elect Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as president following the close [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 presidential election]], U.S. Army troops no longer supported Republican state governments. Reconstruction was a significant chapter in the history of [[civil and political rights|American civil rights]]. Historian [[Eric Foner]] argues:

==Dating the Reconstruction era==
In the different states Reconstruction began and ended at different times; federal Reconstruction ended with the [[Compromise of 1877]]. In recent decades most historians follow Foner in dating the Reconstruction of the south as starting in 1863 (with Emancipation and the Port Royal experiment) rather than 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'' (1988)  p xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;  The usual ending has always been 1877. Reconstruction policies were debated in the North when the war began, and commenced in earnest after Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]], issued on January 1, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=W. J. Rorabaugh|author2=Donald T. Critchlow|author3=Paula C. Baker|title=America's Promise: A Concise History of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FakXv4W96f4C&amp;pg=PA302|year=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
As Confederate states came back under control of the U.S. Army, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] set up reconstructed governments in [[History of Tennessee|Tennessee]], [[History of Arkansas|Arkansas]], and [[History of Louisiana|Louisiana]] during the war. He experimented by giving land to blacks in [[History of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. By fall 1865, the new President [[Andrew Johnson]] declared the war goals of national unity and the ending of slavery achieved and reconstruction completed. Republicans in Congress, refusing to accept Johnson's lenient terms, rejected and refused to seat new members of Congress, some of whom had been high-ranking Confederate officials a few months before. Johnson broke with the Republicans after vetoing two key bills that supported the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] and provided federal civil rights to the [[freedmen]]. The 1866 Congressional elections turned on the issue of Reconstruction, producing a [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1866|sweeping Republican victory]] in the North, and providing the [[Radical Republicans]] with sufficient control of Congress to override Johnson's vetoes and commence their own "Radical Reconstruction" in 1867.&lt;ref name="Foner 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=If Lincoln hadn't died&amp;nbsp;...

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That same year, Congress removed civilian governments in the South, and placed the former Confederacy under the rule of the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;Except in Tennessee, where anti-Johnson Republicans already were in control.&lt;/ref&gt; The army conducted new elections in which the freed slaves could vote, while whites who had held leading positions under the Confederacy were temporarily denied the vote and were not permitted to run for office.

In ten states,&lt;ref&gt;Not including [[Virginia]].&lt;/ref&gt; coalitions of freedmen, recent black and white arrivals from the North ([[carpetbagger]]s), and white Southerners who supported Reconstruction ([[scalawag]]s) cooperated to form [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] biracial state governments. They introduced various reconstruction programs including: funding [[State school|public schools]], establishing charitable institutions, raising taxes, and funding public improvements such as improved railroad transportation and shipping. Conservative opponents called the Republican regimes corrupt and instigated violence toward freedmen and whites who supported Reconstruction. Most of the violence was carried out by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), a secretive terrorist organization closely allied with the southern Democratic Party.  Klan members attacked and intimidated blacks seeking to exercise their new civil rights, as well as Republican politicians in the south favoring those civil rights.  One such politician murdered by the Klan on the eve of the 1868 presidential election was Republican Congressman [[James M. Hinds]] of Arkansas.  Widespread violence in the south led to [[Enforcement Acts|federal intervention]] by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1871, which suppressed the Klan. Nevertheless, white [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], calling themselves "[[Redeemers]]", regained control of the south state by state, sometimes using fraud and violence to control state elections. A deep national economic depression following the [[Panic of 1873]] led to major Democratic gains in the North, the collapse of many railroad schemes in the South, and a growing sense of frustration in the North.

The end of Reconstruction was a staggered process, and the period of Republican control ended at different times in different states. With the Compromise of 1877, military intervention in Southern politics ceased and Republican control collapsed in the last three state governments in the South. This was followed by a period which white Southerners labeled "Redemption", during which white-dominated state legislatures enacted [[Jim Crow laws]] and, beginning in 1890, [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites through a combination of constitutional amendments and electoral laws. The white Democratic Southerners' memory of Reconstruction played a major role in imposing the system of [[white supremacy]] and [[second-class citizen]]ship for blacks using laws known as [[Jim Crow]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Baker, ''What Reconstruction Meant: Historical Memory in the American South'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Reconstruction addressed how the eleven seceding rebel states in the south would regain what the Constitution calls a "republican form of government" and be reseated in Congress, the civil status of the former leaders of the Confederacy, and the Constitutional and legal status of freedmen, especially their civil rights and whether they should be given the right to vote. Intense controversy erupted throughout the South over these issues.&lt;ref&gt;A somewhat similar "reconstruction" process took place in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia, but they had never left the Union and were never controlled by Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws and constitutional amendments that laid the foundation for the most radical phase of Reconstruction were adopted from 1866 to 1871. By the 1870s, Reconstruction had officially provided freedmen with equal rights under the constitution, and blacks were voting and taking political office. Republican legislatures, coalitions of whites and blacks, established the first public school systems and numerous charitable institutions in the South. White [[paramilitary organization]]s, especially the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and also the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] formed with the political aim of driving out the Republicans. They also disrupted political organizing and terrorized blacks to bar them from the polls.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'' (2007), p. 75–77.&lt;/ref&gt; President Grant used federal power to effectively shut down the KKK in the early 1870s, though the other, smaller, groups continued to operate. From 1873 to 1877, conservative whites (calling themselves "[[Redeemers]]") regained power in the Southern states. They joined the [[Bourbon Democrat|Bourbon wing]] of the national Democratic Party.

In the 1860s and 1870s the terms "radical" and "conservative" had distinctive meanings. "Conservative" was the name of a faction, often led by the planter class. Leaders who had been Whigs were committed to economic modernization, built around railroads, factories, banks and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Alexander, "Persistent Whiggery in the Confederate South, 1860–1877", ''Journal of Southern History'', (1961) 27#3 pp. 305–329 {{JSTOR|2205211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the "radical" Republicans in the North were men who believed in integrating African Americans by providing them civil rights as citizens, along with free enterprise; most were also modernizers and former Whigs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen W. Trelease, "Republican Reconstruction in North Carolina: A Roll-Call Analysis of the State House of Representatives, 1866–1870", ''Journal of Southern History'', (1976) 42#3 pp&amp;nbsp;319–344 {{JSTOR|2207155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Liberal Republicans" of 1872 shared the same outlook except they were especially opposed to the corruption they saw around President Grant, and believed that the goals of the Civil War had been achieved so that the federal military intervention could now end.

Passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendments]] is the constitutional legacy of Reconstruction. These [[Reconstruction Amendments]] established the rights that led to Supreme Court rulings in the mid-20th century that struck down school segregation. A "Second Reconstruction", sparked by the [[Civil Rights Movement]], led to civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965 that ended segregation and re-opened the polls to blacks.

==Material devastation of the South in 1865==
{{further|History of the Southern United States#Material ruin and human losses}}
[[File:Broad Street Charleston South Carolina 1865.jpg|thumb|The Southern economy had been ruined by the war. Charleston, South Carolina: Broad Street, 1865]]

Reconstruction played out against an economy in ruin. The Confederacy in 1861 had 297 towns and cities with a total population of 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. The number of people who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's combined urban and rural populations. The rate of damage in smaller towns was much lower—only 45 courthouses were burned out of a total of 830.&lt;ref name = Paskoff&gt;Paul F. Paskoff, "Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy," ''Civil War History'' (2008) 54#1 pp&amp;nbsp;35–62 doi:10.1353/cwh.2008.0007&lt;/ref&gt;

Farms were in disrepair, and the prewar stock of horses, mules and cattle was much depleted; 40% of the South's livestock had been killed.&lt;ref name="mcpherson2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=McPherson, James M | year=1992 | page=38 | isbn=978-0-19-507606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South's farms were not highly mechanized, but the value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million and was reduced by 40% by 1870.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Hesseltine, ''A History of the South, 1607–1936'' (1936), pp. 573–574.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[transportation]] [[infrastructure]] lay in ruins, with little railroad or [[riverboat]] service available to move crops and animals to market.&lt;ref&gt;John Samuel Ezell, ''The South since 1865'' (1963), pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad mileage was located mostly in rural areas and over two-thirds of the South's rails, bridges, rail yards, repair shops and rolling stock were in areas reached by Union armies, which systematically destroyed what they could. Even in untouched areas, the lack of maintenance and repair, the absence of new equipment, the heavy over-use, and the deliberate relocation of equipment by the Confederates from remote areas to the war zone ensured the system would be ruined at war's end.&lt;ref name = Paskoff/&gt; Restoring the infrastructure—especially the railroad system—became a high priority for Reconstruction state governments.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey N. Lash, "Civil-War Irony-Confederate Commanders And The Destruction Of Southern Railways." ''Prologue-Quarterly Of The National Archives'' 25.1 (1993): 35-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous cost of the Confederate war effort took a high toll on the South's economic infrastructure. The direct costs to the Confederacy in [[human capital]], government expenditures, and physical destruction from the war totaled $3.3 billion. By 1865, the [[Confederate dollar]] was worthless due to high inflation, and people in the South had to resort to bartering services for goods, or else use scarce Union dollars. With the emancipation of the southern slaves, the entire economy of the South had to be rebuilt. Having lost their enormous investment in slaves, white [[planters]] had minimal capital to pay freedmen workers to bring in crops. As a result, a system of [[sharecropping]] was developed where landowners broke up large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] and rented small lots to the freedmen and their families. The main feature of the Southern economy changed from an elite minority of landed gentry slaveholders into a [[tenant farming]] agriculture system.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia D. Goldin, and Frank D. Lewis, "The economic cost of the American Civil War: Estimates and implications." ''Journal of Economic History'' 35.2 (1975): 299-326. [https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2662305/Goldin_EconomicCost.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Civil War was accompanied by a large migration of new freed people to the cities.&lt;ref name="Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jacqueline|title=Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow: Black Women, Work, and the Family, from Slavery to the Present|year=2010|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cities, African Americans were relegated to the lowest paying jobs such as unskilled and service labor. Men worked as rail workers, rolling and lumber mills workers, and hotel workers. The large population of slave artisans during the [[wikt:antebellum|antebellum]] period had not been translated into a large number of freemen artisans during Reconstruction.&lt;ref name="To 'Joy My Freedom"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Tera W.|title=To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War|year=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=21–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black women were largely confined to domestic work employed as cooks, maids, and child nurses. Others worked in hotels. A large number became laundresses. The dislocations had a severe negative impact on the black population, with a large amount of sickness and death.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Downs, ''Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a quarter of Southern white men of military age—the backbone of the South's white workforce—died during the war, leaving countless families destitute.&lt;ref name="mcpherson2"/&gt; Per capita income for white southerners declined from $125 in 1857 to a low of $80 in 1879. By the end of the 19th century and well into the 20th century, the South was locked into a system of poverty. How much of this failure was caused by the war and by previous reliance on agriculture remains the subject of debate among economists and historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ransom |first=Roger L. |title=The Economics of the Civil War |url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/ransom.civil.war.us |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213062917/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/ransom.civil.war.us |archivedate=December 13, 2011 |df= }} Direct costs for the Confederacy are based on the value of the dollar in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoring the South to the Union==
[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln, 1865, entitled "The Rail Splitter At Work Repairing the Union." The caption reads (Johnson): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.'' (Lincoln): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.'']]

During the Civil War, the Radical Republican leaders argued that slavery and the [[Slave Power]] had to be permanently destroyed. Moderates said this could be easily accomplished as soon as [[Confederate States Army|Confederate armies]] surrendered and the Southern states repealed secession and accepted the 13th Amendment – most of which happened by December 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Lincoln was the leader of the moderate Republicans and wanted to speed up Reconstruction and reunite the nation painlessly and quickly. Lincoln formally began Reconstruction in late 1863 with his [[Ten percent plan]], which went into operation in several states but which Radical Republicans opposed. Lincoln [[pocket veto]]ed the Radical plan, the [[Wade–Davis Bill]] of 1864, which was much more strict than the Ten-Percent Plan.&lt;ref name="Foner 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson (2009); William C. Harris, ''With Charity for All: Lincoln and the Restoration of the Union'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1866, the opposing faction of [[Radical Republicans]] was skeptical of Southern intentions. White reactions included outbreaks of mob violence against blacks, such as the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]]. Radical Republicans demanded a prompt and strong federal response to protect freed-people and curb southern racism. Congressman [[Thaddeus Stevens]] of [[Pennsylvania]] and Senator [[Charles Sumner]] of [[Massachusetts]] led the Radicals. Sumner argued that secession had destroyed statehood but the Constitution still extended its authority and its protection over individuals, as in [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|existing U.S. territories]]. Stevens and his followers viewed secession as having left the states in a status like new territories. The Republicans sought to prevent Southern politicians from "restoring the historic subordination of Negroes". Since slavery was abolished, the [[three-fifths compromise]] no longer applied to counting the population of blacks. After the 1870 census, the South would gain numerous additional representatives in Congress, based on the population of freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;All blacks would be counted in 1870, whether or not they were citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; One Illinois Republican expressed a common fear that if the South were allowed to simply restore its previous established powers, that the "reward of treason will be an increased representation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Upon [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln's assassination]] in April 1865, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, who had been elected with Lincoln in 1864 as vice president, became president. Johnson rejected the Radical program of Reconstruction and instead appointed his own governors and tried to finish reconstruction by the end of 1865. [[Thaddeus Stevens]] vehemently opposed President Johnson's plans for an abrupt end to Reconstruction, insisting that Reconstruction must "revolutionize Southern institutions, habits, and manners&amp;nbsp;... The foundations of their institutions&amp;nbsp;... must be broken up and relaid, or all our blood and treasure have been spent in vain."&lt;ref name="mcpherson3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=McPherson, James M | year=1992 | page=6 | isbn=978-0-19-507606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson broke decisively with the Republicans in Congress when he vetoed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Act]] in early 1865.

Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress rejected Johnson's argument that he had the war power to decide what to do, since the war was over. Congress decided it had the primary authority to decide how Reconstruction should proceed, because the Constitution stated the United States had to guarantee each state a [[Republicanism in the United States|republican form of government]]. The Radicals insisted that meant Congress decided how Reconstruction should be achieved. The issues were multiple: who should decide, Congress or the president? How should republicanism operate in the South? What was the status of the former Confederate states? What was the citizenship status of the leaders of the Confederacy? What was the citizenship and suffrage status of freedmen?&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of 1866 decisively changed the balance of power, giving the Republicans two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, and enough votes to overcome Johnson's vetoes. They moved to [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeach Johnson]] because of his constant attempts to thwart Radical Reconstruction measures, by using the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]]. Johnson was acquitted by one vote, but he lost the influence to shape Reconstruction policy.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Congress established [[Military district#U.S. mainland military administration districts, departments, divisions|military districts]] in the South and used [[United States Army|Army]] personnel to administer the region until new governments loyal to the Union—that accepted the 14th Amendment and the right of freedmen to vote—could be established. Congress temporarily suspended the ability to vote of approximately 10,000 to 15,000 former Confederate officials and senior officers, while constitutional amendments gave full citizenship to all African Americans, and suffrage to the adult men.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the power to vote, freedmen started participating in politics. While many slaves were illiterate, educated blacks (including escaped slaves) moved down from the North to aid them, and natural leaders also stepped forward. They elected white and black men to represent them in constitutional conventions. A Republican coalition of freedmen, southerners supportive of the Union (derisively called scalawags by white Democrats), and northerners who had migrated to the South (derisively called carpetbaggers)—some of whom were returning natives, but were mostly Union veterans – organized to create constitutional conventions. They created new state constitutions to set new directions for southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyalty===
The issue of loyalty emerged in the debates over the [[Wade–Davis Bill]] of 1864. The bill required voters to take the "[[ironclad oath]]", swearing they had never supported the Confederacy or been one of its soldiers. Pursuing a policy of "malice toward none" announced in his second inaugural address,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99sep/9909lincaddress.htm|title=The Second Inaugural Address|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln asked voters only to support the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''With Charity for All'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The Radicals lost support following Lincoln's veto of the Wade–Davis Bill but regained strength after Lincoln's assassination in April 1865.

===Suffrage===
[[File:Grand Army of the Republic by Swatjester.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Monument in honor of the Grand Army of the Republic, organized after the war]]
Congress had to consider how to restore to full status and representation within the Union those southern states that had declared their independence from the United States and had withdrawn their representation. [[Suffrage]] for former Confederates was one of two main concerns. A decision needed to be made whether to allow just some or all former Confederates to vote (and to hold office). The moderates in Congress wanted virtually all of them to vote, but the Radicals resisted. They repeatedly imposed the ironclad oath, which would effectively have allowed no former Confederates to vote. Historian Harold Hyman says that in 1866 Congressmen "described the oath as the last bulwark against the return of ex-rebels to power, the barrier behind which Southern Unionists and Negroes protected themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Hyman, ''To try men's souls: loyalty tests in American history''  (1959)  p 93&lt;/ref&gt; Radical Republican leader [[Thaddeus Stevens]] proposed, unsuccessfully, that all former Confederates lose the right to vote for five years. The compromise that was reached disenfranchised many Confederate civil and military leaders. No one knows how many temporarily lost the vote, but one estimate was that it was as high as 10,000 to 15,000 out of a total white population of roughly eight million.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, pp. 273–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, and closely related, was the issue of whether the roughly four million freedmen should be allowed to vote. The issue was how to receive the four million Freedmen as citizens. If they were to be fully counted as citizens, some sort of representation for apportionment of seats in Congress had to be determined. Before the war, the population of slaves had been counted as three-fifths of a corresponding number of free whites. By having four million freedmen counted as full citizens, the South would gain additional seats in Congress. If blacks were denied the vote and the right to hold office, then only whites would represent them. Many conservatives, including most white southerners, northern Democrats, and some northern Republicans, opposed black voting. Some northern states that had referenda on the subject limited the ability of their own small populations of blacks to vote.

Lincoln had supported a middle position to allow some black men to vote, especially army veterans. Johnson also believed that such service should be rewarded with citizenship. Lincoln proposed giving the vote to "the very intelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks."&lt;ref&gt;William Gienapp, ''Abraham Lincoln and Civil War America'' (2002), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Governor Johnson said, "The better class of them will go to work and sustain themselves, and that class ought to be allowed to vote, on the ground that a loyal negro is more worthy than a disloyal white man."&lt;ref&gt;Patton, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; As President in 1865, Johnson wrote to the man he appointed as governor of Mississippi, recommending, "If you could extend the elective franchise to all persons of color who can read the Constitution in English and write their names, and to all persons of color who own real estate valued at least two hundred and fifty dollars, and pay taxes thereon, you would completely disarm the adversary [Radicals in Congress], and set an example the other states will follow."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson to Gov. William L. Sharkey, August 1865 quoted in Franklin (1961), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FreedmenVotingInNewOrleans1867.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.15|Freedmen voting in New Orleans, 1867]]

Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens, leaders of the Radical Republicans, were initially hesitant to enfranchise the largely illiterate Freedmen. Sumner preferred at first impartial requirements that would have imposed literacy restrictions on blacks and whites. He believed that he would not succeed in passing legislation to disfranchise illiterate whites who already had the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Charles Sumner'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South, many poor whites were illiterate as there was almost no [[public education]] before the war. In 1880, for example, the white illiteracy rate was about 25% in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia; and as high as 33% in North Carolina. This compares with the 9% national rate, and a black rate of [[illiteracy]] that was over 70% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, ''The Promise of the New South'' p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, however, with emphasis within the black community on education, the majority of blacks had achieved literacy.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Anderson, ''[[The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935]]'', pp. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumner soon concluded that "there was no substantial protection for the freedman except in the franchise." This was necessary, he stated, "(1) For his own protection; (2) For the protection of the white Unionist; and (3) For the peace of the country. We put the musket in his hands because it was necessary; for the same reason we must give him the franchise." The support for voting rights was a compromise between moderate and Radical Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Randall and Donald, p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republicans believed that the best way for men to get political experience was to be able to vote and to participate in the political system. They passed laws allowing all male freedmen to vote. In 1867, black men voted for the first time. Over the course of Reconstruction, more than 1,500 African Americans held public office in the South; some of them were men who had escaped to the North and gained educations, and returned to the South. They did not hold office in numbers representative of their proportion in the population, but often elected whites to represent them.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Freedom's lawmakers: a directory of Black officeholders during Reconstruction'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The question of [[women's suffrage]] was also debated but was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen DuBois, ''Feminism and suffrage: The emergence of an independent women's movement in America'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1890 to 1908, southern states passed new constitutions and laws that disfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites with new voter registration and electoral rules. When establishing new requirements such as subjectively administered [[literacy tests]], in some states, they used "[[grandfather clauses]]" to enable illiterate whites to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'' (2004), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Treaty Commission===
The [[Five Civilized Tribes]] that had been relocated to [[Indian Territory]] (now part of [[Oklahoma]]) held black slaves and signed treaties supporting the Confederacy. During the war, a war among pro- and anti-Union Indians had raged. Congress passed a statute that gave the President the authority to suspend the appropriations of any tribe if the tribe is "in a state of actual hostility to the government of the United States&amp;nbsp;... and, by proclamation, to declare all treaties with such tribe to be abrogated by such tribe"(25 USC Sec. 72).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/25C3.txt |title=Act of Congress, R.S.

As a component of Reconstruction, the Interior Department ordered a meeting of representatives from all Indian tribes which had affiliated with the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p022.html | author= Perry, Dan W.| title= "Oklahoma, A Foreordained Commonwealth" |work= Chronicles of Oklahoma, Volume 14, No. 1|date= March 1936|page=30 |publisher= Oklahoma Historical Society| accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council, the [[Reconstruction Treaties|Southern Treaty Commission]], was first held in [[Ft. Smith, Arkansas]] in September 1865, was attended by hundreds of Indians representing dozens of tribes. Over the next several years the commission negotiated treaties with tribes that resulted in additional relocations to [[Indian Territory]] and the de facto creation (initially by treaty) of an unorganized [[Oklahoma Territory]].

==Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction==

===Preliminary events===
[[File:AbrahamLincolnOilPainting1869Restored.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Lincoln]], 16th [[President of the United States]], 1861–1865]]

President Lincoln signed two [[Confiscation Acts]] into law, the first on August 6, 1861, and the second on July 17, 1862, safeguarding fugitive slaves from the Confederacy that came over into Union lines and giving them indirect emancipation if their masters continued insurrection against the United States. The laws allowed the confiscation of lands for colonization from those who aided and supported the rebellion. However, these laws had limited effect as they were poorly funded by Congress and poorly enforced by Attorney General [[Edward Bates]].&lt;ref&gt;Cimbala, Miller, and Syrette (2002), ''An uncommon time: the Civil War and the northern home front'', pp. 285, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Gallagher, and McPherson, ''The Library of Congress Civil War Desk Reference'', pp.&amp;nbsp;735–736.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams 2006 pp. 54–59"&gt;Williams (2006), ''"Doing Less" and "Doing More"'', pp. 54–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1861, Maj. Gen. [[John C. Frémont]], Union commander of the Western Department, declared martial law in [[Missouri]], confiscated Confederate property, and emancipated their slaves. President Lincoln immediately ordered Frémont to rescind his emancipation declaration stating, "I think there is great danger that&amp;nbsp;... the liberating slaves of traitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends, and turn them against us – perhaps ruin our fair prospect for Kentucky." After Frémont refused to rescind the emancipation order, President Lincoln terminated him from active duty on November 2, 1861. Lincoln was concerned that the border states would secede from the Union if slaves were given their freedom. On May 26, 1862, Union Maj. Gen. [[David Hunter]] emancipated slaves in South Carolina, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and Florida stated all "persons&amp;nbsp;... heretofore held as slaves&amp;nbsp;... forever free." Lincoln, embarrassed by the order, rescinded Hunter's declaration and canceled the emancipations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

On April 16, 1862 Lincoln signed a bill into law outlawing slavery in Washington D.C. and freeing the estimated 3,500 slaves in the city and on June 19, 1862 he signed legislation outlawing slavery in all U.S. territories. On July 17, 1862 under the authority of the Confiscation Acts and an amended Force Bill of 1795, he authorized the recruitment of freed slaves into the Union army and seizure of any Confederate property for military purposes.&lt;ref name="Williams 2006 pp. 54–59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse (1991), ''Historical dictionary of reconstruction'', p. viiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abraham Lincoln

===Gradual emancipation and compensation===
In an effort to keep border states in the Union, President Lincoln as early as 1861 designed gradual compensated emancipation programs paid for by government bonds. Lincoln desired [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Missouri]] to "adopt a system of gradual emancipation which should work the extinction of slavery in twenty years." On March 26, 1862 Lincoln met with Senator Charles Sumner and recommended that a special joint session of Congress be convened to discuss giving financial aid to any border states who initiated a gradual emancipation plan. In April 1862, the joint session of Congress met, however, the border states were not interested and did not make any response to Lincoln or any Congressional emancipation proposal.&lt;ref name="Guelzo 1999"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Guelzo |first=Allen C. |title=Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President |pages=333–335 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln advocated compensated emancipation during the [[River Queen (steamboat)#Civil War service|1865 River Queen steamer conference]].

===Colonization===
In August 1862, President Lincoln met with African-American leaders and urged them to colonize some place in Central America. Lincoln planned to free the Southern slaves in the Emancipation Proclamation and he was concerned that freedmen would not be well treated in the United States by whites in both the North and South. Although Lincoln gave assurances that the United States government would support and protect any colonies, the leaders declined the offer of colonization. Many free blacks had been opposed to colonization plans in the past and wanted to remain in the United States. President Lincoln persisted in his colonization plan believing that emancipation and colonization were part of the same program. Lincoln was successful by April 1863 at sending black colonists to [[Haiti]] and 453 to [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriqui]] in Central America; however, none of the colonies were able to remain self-sufficient. [[Frederick Douglass]], a prominent 19th-century American civil rights activist, criticized that Lincoln was "showing all his inconsistencies, his pride of race and blood, his contempt for Negroes and his canting hypocrisy." African Americans, according to Douglass, wanted citizen rights rather than to be colonized. Historians debate if Lincoln gave up on African-American colonization at the end of 1863 or if he actually planned to continue this policy up until 1865.&lt;ref name="Williams 2006 pp. 54–59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guelzo 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Catton 1963 pp. 365–367"&gt;Catton (1963), ''Terrible Swift Sword'', pp. 365–367, 461–468.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military governors installed===
Starting in March 1862, in an effort to forestall Reconstruction by the Radicals in Congress, President Lincoln installed military governors in certain rebellious states under Union military control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

|title=Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President
|page=390
|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the states would not be recognized by the Radicals until an undetermined time, installation of military governors kept the administration of Reconstruction under Presidential control, rather than that of the increasingly unsympathetic Radical Congress. On March 3, 1862, Lincoln installed a loyalist Democrat, Senator Andrew Johnson, as Military Governor with the rank of Brigadier General in his home state of Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Andrew Johnson: military governor of Tennessee

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1862, Lincoln appointed [[Edward Stanly]] Military Governor of the coastal region of [[North Carolina]] with the rank of Brigadier General. Stanly resigned almost a year later when he angered Lincoln by closing two schools for black children in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]]. After Lincoln installed Brigadier General [[George Foster Shepley (Maine and Louisiana)|George F. Sheply]] as Military Governor of Louisiana in May 1862, Sheply sent two anti-slavery representatives, [[Benjamin Flanders]] and [[Michael Hahn]], elected in December 1862, to the House which capitulated and voted to seat them. In July 1862, Lincoln installed Colonel [[John S. Phelps]] as Military Governor of Arkansas, though he resigned soon after due to poor health.

===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{Main|Emancipation Proclamation}}
[[File:EmancipationPhoto.jpg|thumb|Celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation in Massachusetts, 1862]]
In July 1862, President Lincoln became convinced that "a military necessity" was needed to strike at slavery in order to win the Civil War for the Union. The Confiscation Acts were only having a minimal effect to end slavery. On July 22, he wrote a first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves in states in rebellion. After he showed his cabinet the document, slight alterations were made in the wording. Lincoln decided that the defeat of the Confederate invasion of the North at [[Battle of Antietam|Sharpsburg]] was enough of a battlefield victory to enable him to release the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation that gave the rebels 100 days to return to the Union or the actual Proclamation would be issued.

On January 1, 1863, the actual Emancipation Proclamation was issued, specifically naming ten states in which slaves would be "forever free". The proclamation did not name the states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware, and specifically excluded numerous counties in some other states. Eventually, as the Union Armies advanced into the Confederacy millions of slaves were set free. Many of these freedmen joined the Union army and fought in battles against the Confederate forces.&lt;ref name="Williams 2006 pp. 54–59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Catton 1963 pp. 365–367"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (2004), ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet hundreds of thousands of freed slaves died during emancipation from illness that devastated army regiments. Freed slaves suffered from smallpox, yellow fever, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;''Sick from Freedom'', First Edition, New York, Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana 10% electorate plan===
{{Main|Wade–Davis Bill|Ten percent plan}}
President Abraham Lincoln was concerned to effect a speedy restoration of the Confederate states to the Union after the Civil War. In 1863, President Lincoln proposed a moderate plan for the Reconstruction of the captured Confederate State of Louisiana. The plan granted amnesty to Rebels who took an oath of loyalty to the Union. Black Freedmen workers were tied to labor on plantations for one year at $10 a month pay.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 10% of the state's electorate had to take the loyalty oath in order for the state to be readmitted into U.S. Congress. The state was required to abolish slavery in its new constitution. Identical Reconstruction plans would be adopted in Arkansas and Tennessee. By December 1864, the Lincoln plan of Reconstruction had been enacted in Louisiana and the legislature sent two Senators and five Representatives to take their seats in Washington. However, Congress refused to count any of the votes from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, in essence rejecting Lincoln's moderate Reconstruction plan. Congress, at this time controlled by the Radicals, proposed the Wade–Davis Bill that required a majority of the state electorates to take the oath of loyalty to be admitted to Congress. Lincoln [[Pocket veto|pocket-vetoed]] the bill and the rift widened between the moderates, who wanted to save the Union and win the war, and the Radicals, who wanted to effect a more complete change within Southern society.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1995 pp. 38–41"&gt;Peterson (1995) ''Lincoln in American Memory'', pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarthy 1901 p. 76"&gt;McCarthy (1901), ''Lincoln's plan of Reconstruction'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Douglass denounced Lincoln's 10% electorate plan as undemocratic since state admission and loyalty only depended on a minority vote.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalization of slave marriages===
Before 1864, slave marriages had not been recognized legally; emancipation did not affect them.&lt;ref name="Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow" /&gt; When freed, many made official marriages. Before emancipation, slaves could not enter into contracts, including the marriage contract.  Not all free people formalized their unions. Some continued to have common-law marriages or community-recognized relationships.&lt;ref name="The Making of the American South"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=J. William|title=The Making of the American South: a Short History 1500–1977|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acknowledgement of marriage by the state increased the state's recognition of freedpeople as legal actors and eventually helped make the case for parental rights for freedpeople against the practice of apprenticeship of black children.&lt;ref name="Gendered Strife and Confusion p53"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Laura F. |title=Gendered Strife and Confusion: The Political Culture of Reconstruction |year=1997 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-252-02297-1 |page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These children were legally taken away from their families under the guise of "providing them with guardianship and 'good' homes until they reached the age of consent at twenty-one" under acts such as the Georgia 1866 Apprentice Act.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, "To 'Joy My Freedom", p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Such children were generally used as sources of unpaid labor.

===Freedmen's Bureau===
{{Main|Freedmen's Bureau}}
[[File:Freedmen richmond sewing women.jpg|thumb|Northern teachers traveled into the South to provide education and training for the newly freed population.]]
On March 3, 1865 the [[Freedmen's Bureau Bill]] became law, sponsored by the Republicans to aid freedmen and white refugees. A federal Bureau was created to provide food, clothing, fuel, and advice on negotiating labor contracts. It attempted to oversee new relations between freedmen and their former masters in a free labor market. The Act, without deference to a person's color, authorized the Bureau to lease confiscated land for a period of three years and to sell it in portions of up to {{convert|40|acres|0|abbr=on}} per buyer. The Bureau was to expire one year after the termination of the War. Lincoln was assassinated before he could appoint a commissioner of the Bureau. A popular myth was that the Act offered [[40 acres and a mule]], or that slaves had been promised this.

With the help of the Bureau, the recently freed slaves began voting, forming political parties, and assuming the control of labor in many areas. The Bureau helped to start a change of power in the South that drew national attention from the Republicans in the North to the conservative Democrats in the South. This is especially evident in the [[United States presidential election, 1868|election]] between Grant and Seymour (Johnson did not get the Democratic nomination), where almost 700,000 black voters voted and swayed the election 300,000 votes in Grant's favor.

Even with the benefits that it gave to the freedmen, the Freedmen's Bureau was unable to operate effectively in certain areas. Terrorizing freedmen for trying to vote, hold a political office, or own land, the Ku Klux Klan was the antithesis to the Freedmen's Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/taxes/blacktax.asp|title='Black Tax' Credit|first=David|last=Mikkelson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedmen's Bureau|url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=517|author=Kathleen Zebley|year=1998|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belz (1998), ''Abraham Lincoln, constitutionalism, and equal rights in the Civil War era'', pp. 138, 141, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bans color discrimination===
Other legislation was signed that broadened equality and rights for African Americans. Lincoln outlawed discrimination on account of color, in carrying U.S. mail, in riding on public street cars in Washington D.C., and in pay for soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Rawley (2003), ''Abraham Lincoln and a nation worth fighting for''. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 1865 peace conference===
Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] met with three southern representatives to discuss the peaceful reconstruction of the Union and the Confederacy on February 3, 1865 in [[Hampton Roads, Virginia|Hampton Roads]], Virginia. The southern delegation included Confederate vice-president, [[Alexander H. Stephens]], [[John Archibald Campbell|John A. Campbell]], and [[Robert M. T. Hunter]]. The southerners proposed the Union recognition of the Confederacy, a joint Union-Confederate attack on Mexico to oust dictator [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximillian]], and an alternative subordinate status of servitude for blacks rather than slavery. Lincoln flatly rejected recognition of the Confederacy, and said that the slaves covered by his Emancipation Proclamation would not be re-enslaved. He said that the Union States were about to pass the Thirteenth Amendment outlawing slavery. Lincoln urged the governor of Georgia to remove Confederate troops and "ratify this Constitutional Amendment ''prospectively'', so as to take effect—say in five years&amp;nbsp;... Slavery is doomed." Lincoln also urged compensated emancipation for the slaves as he thought the North should be willing to share the costs of freedom. Although the meeting was cordial, the parties did not settle on agreements.&lt;ref&gt;McFeely (2002), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 198–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical legacy debated===
Lincoln continued to advocate his Louisiana Plan as a model for all states up until his assassination on April 14, 1865. The plan successfully started the Reconstruction process of ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment in all states. Lincoln is typically portrayed as taking the moderate position and fighting the Radical positions. There is considerable debate on how well Lincoln, had he lived, would have handled Congress during the Reconstruction process that took place after the Civil War ended. One historical camp argues that Lincoln's flexibility, pragmatism, and superior political skills with Congress would have solved Reconstruction with far less difficulty. The other camp believes the Radicals would have attempted to impeach Lincoln, just as they did to his successor, Andrew Johnson, in 1868.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1995 pp. 38–41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Harris, ''With Charity for All: Lincoln and the Restoration of the Union'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Johnson's presidential Reconstruction==
{{Main|Presidency of Andrew Johnson}}
[[File:Aj17.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Andrew Johnson, 17th President of the United States&lt;br /&gt;1865–1869]]
Northern anger over the assassination of Lincoln and the immense human cost of the war led to demands for punitive policies. Vice President [[Andrew Johnson]] had taken a hard line and spoke of hanging rebel Confederates, but when he succeeded Lincoln as President, Johnson took a much softer position, pardoning many Confederate leaders and former Confederates.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse c.1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jefferson Davis]] was held in prison for two years, but other Confederate leaders were not. There were no treason trials. Only one person—Captain [[Henry Wirz]], the commandant of the [[Andersonville prison|prison camp]] in [[Andersonville, Georgia]]—was executed for war crimes. Andrew Johnson's conservative view of Reconstruction did not include blacks or former slaves involvement in government and he refused to heed Northern concerns when southern state legislatures implemented [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] that set the status of the freedmen much lower than that of citizens.&lt;ref name="Foner 2009"/&gt;

Smith argues that, "Johnson attempted to carry forward what he considered to be Lincoln's plans for Reconstruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=John David|title=A Just and Lasting Peace: A Documentary History of Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TpInTOhPf1sC&amp;pg=PT17|year=2013|publisher=Penguin |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKitrick says that in 1865 Johnson had strong support in the Republican Party, "It was naturally from the great moderate sector of Unionist opinion in the North that Johnson could draw his greatest comfort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric L. McKitrick|title=Andrew Johnson and Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MqL8lmT74HEC&amp;pg=PA172|year=1988|publisher=Oxford UP|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billington says, " One faction, the Moderate Republicans under the leadership of Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, favored a mild policy toward the South."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Billington|first1=Ray Allen|last2=Ridge|first2=Martin|author-link2= Martin Ridge (historian) | title=American History After 1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9FWZLCfi4gC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1981|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln biographers Randall and Current argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C&amp;pg=PA80|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historians agree that President Johnson was an inept politician who lost all his advantages by his clumsy moves. He broke with Congress in early 1866 and then became defiant and tried to block enforcement of Reconstruction laws passed by the U.S. Congress. He was in constant conflict constitutionally with the Radicals in Congress over the status of freedmen and whites in the defeated South.&lt;ref name="McFeely-Woodward"&gt;[[#McFeely-Woodward|McFeely-Woodward]] (1974), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Although resigned to the abolition of slavery, many former Confederates were unwilling to accept both social changes and political domination by former slaves. In the words of [[Benjamin Franklin Perry|Benjamin F. Perry]], President Johnson's choice as the provisional governor of South Carolina: "First, the Negro is to be invested with all political power, and then the antagonism of interest between capital and labor is to work out the result.'&lt;ref&gt;Barney, William L., ''The Passage of the Republic: An Interdisciplinary History of Nineteenth-Century America'' (1987), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fears of the mostly conservative planter elite and other leading white citizens were partly assuaged by the actions of President Johnson, who ensured that a wholesale land redistribution from the planters to the freedman did not occur. President Johnson ordered that confiscated or abandoned lands administered by the Freedmen's Bureau would not be redistributed to the freedmen but be returned to pardoned owners. Land was returned that would have been forfeited under the Confiscation Acts passed by Congress in 1861 and 1862.

===Freedmen and the enactment of Black Codes===
{{Main|Black Codes (United States)}}
[[File:The Union as It Was.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|An October 24th, 1874 [[Harper's Magazine]] editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] denouncing KKK and White League murders of innocent blacks]]

Southern state governments quickly enacted the restrictive "[[Black Codes (United States)|black codes]]". However, they were abolished in 1866 and seldom had effect, because the Freedmen's Bureau (not the local courts) handled the legal affairs of freedmen.

The Black Codes indicated the plans of the southern whites for the former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedmen would have more rights than did free blacks before the war, but they would still have only a limited set of second-class civil rights, no voting rights and no citizenship. They could not own firearms, serve on a jury in a lawsuit involving whites or move about without employment.&lt;ref&gt;Oberholtzer 1:128–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Codes outraged northern opinion. They were overthrown by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] that gave the freedmen full legal equality (except for the right to vote).&lt;ref&gt;Donald (2001), p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

The freedmen, with the strong backing of the Freedmen's Bureau, rejected [[Gang system|gang-labor]] work patterns that had been used in slavery. Instead of gang labor, freedpeople preferred family-based labor groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; They forced planters to bargain for their labor. Such bargaining soon led to the establishment of the system of sharecropping, which gave the freedmen greater economic independence and social autonomy than gang labor. However, because they lacked capital and the planters continued to own the means of production (tools, draft animals and land), the freedmen were forced into producing cash crops (mainly cotton) for the land-owners and merchants, and they entered into a [[crop-lien system]]. Widespread poverty, disruption to an agricultural economy too dependent on cotton, and the falling price of cotton, led within decades to the routine indebtedness of the majority of the freedmen, and poverty by many planters.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, ''The Passage of the Republic'', p. 251, pp. 284–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern officials gave varying reports on conditions for the freedmen in the South. One harsh assessment came from [[Carl Schurz]], who reported on the situation in the states along the Gulf Coast. His report documented dozens of [[extra-judicial killing]]s and claimed that hundreds or thousands more African Americans were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext05/cnsth10.htm Report on the Condition of the South / Schurz, Carl, 1829–1906] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014083500/http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext05/cnsth10.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}:&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The number of murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative estimate of what is going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives.

The report included sworn testimony from soldiers and officials of the Freedmen's Bureau. In [[Selma, Alabama]], Major J.P.

Much of the violence that was perpetrated against African Americans was shaped by gendered prejudices regarding African Americans. Black women were in a particularly vulnerable situation. To convict a white man of sexually assaulting black women in this period was exceedingly difficult.&lt;ref name="To 'Joy My Freedom"/&gt; The South's judicial system had been wholly refigured to make one of its primary purposes the coercion of African Americans to comply with the social customs and labor demands of whites. Trials were discouraged and attorneys for black misdemeanor defendants were difficult to find. The goal of county courts was a fast, uncomplicated trial with a resulting conviction. Most blacks were unable to pay their fines or bail, and "the most common penalty was nine months to a year in a slave mine or lumber camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackmon|first1=Douglas A.|title=Slavery by Another Name: the Re-enslavement of Black Americans from  the Civil War to World War II|date=2009|publisher=Anchor Books, a division of Random House, Inc.|location=New York|page=16|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South's judicial system was rigged to generate fees and claim bounties, not to ensure public protection.

===Moderate responses===
During fall 1865, out of response to the Black codes and worrisome signs of Southern recalcitrance, the Radical Republicans blocked the readmission of the former rebellious states to the Congress. Johnson, however, was content with allowing former Confederate states into the Union as long as their state governments adopted the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. By December 6, 1865, the amendment was ratified and Johnson considered Reconstruction over. Johnson was following the moderate Lincoln Presidential Reconstruction policy to get the states readmitted as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="Schouler 1913 43–57"/&gt;

Congress, however, controlled by the Radicals, had other plans. The Radicals were led by [[Charles Sumner]] in the Senate and [[Thaddeus Stevens]] in the House of Representatives. Congress, on December 4, 1865, rejected Johnson's moderate Presidential Reconstruction, and organized the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], a 15-member panel to devise reconstruction requirements for the Southern states to be restored to the Union.&lt;ref name="Schouler 1913 43–57"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schouler|first=James|title=History of the United States of America under the Constitution, Volume 7 The Reconstruction Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3scAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Freedman's+bureau+bill&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Freedman's%20bureau%20bill&amp;f=false|pages=43–57|year=1913|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1866, Congress renewed the Freedmen's Bureau; however, Johnson vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau Bill in February 1866. Although Johnson had sympathies for the plights of the freedmen, he was against federal assistance. An attempt to override the veto failed on February 20, 1866. This veto shocked the Congressional Radicals. In response, both the Senate and House passed a joint resolution not to allow any Senator or Representative seat admittance until Congress decided when Reconstruction was finished.&lt;ref name="Schouler 1913 43–57"/&gt;

Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of [[Illinois]], leader of the moderate Republicans, took affront at the black codes. He proposed the first [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Law]], because the abolition of slavery was empty if

{{quote|laws are to be enacted and enforced depriving persons of African descent of privileges which are essential to freemen&amp;nbsp;... A law that does not allow a colored person to go from one county to another, and one that does not allow him to hold property, to teach, to preach, are certainly laws in violation of the rights of a freeman&amp;nbsp;... The purpose of this bill is to destroy all these discriminations.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, ''History'' 6:65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The key to the bill was the opening section:

{{quote|All persons born in the United States&amp;nbsp;... are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States; and such citizens of every race and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery&amp;nbsp;... shall have the same right in every State&amp;nbsp;... to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom to the Contrary notwithstanding.}}

The bill did not give Freedmen the right to vote. Congress quickly passed the Civil Rights bill; the Senate on February 2 voted 33–12; the House on March 13 voted 111–38.

===Johnson's vetoes===

Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the Civil Rights bill, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27, 1866. His veto message objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when eleven out of thirty-six states were unrepresented and attempted to fix by Federal law "a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union." Johnson said it was an invasion by Federal authority of the rights of the States; it had no warrant in the Constitution and was contrary to all precedents. It was a "stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government."&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, ''History'' 6:68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic Party, proclaiming itself the party of white men, north and south, supported Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto (the Senate by the close vote of 33:15, the House by 122:41) and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights bill]] became law. Congress also passed a toned-down Freedmen's Bureau Bill; Johnson quickly vetoed as he had done to the previous bill. Once again, however, Congress had enough support and overrode Johnson's veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&amp;pg=PA699|year= 2010|page=699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last moderate proposal was the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], whose principal drafter was Representative [[John Bingham]]. It was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but it went much further. It extended citizenship to everyone born in the United States (except visitors and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It guaranteed the Federal war debt would be paid (and promised the Confederate debt would never be paid). Johnson used his influence to block the amendment in the states since three-fourths of the states were required for ratification (the amendment was later ratified.). The moderate effort to compromise with Johnson had failed, and a political fight broke out between the Republicans (both Radical and moderate) on one side, and on the other side, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party in the North, and the conservative groupings (which used different names) in each southern state.

==Radical Reconstruction==
[[File:Seymour US Reconstruction antidem poster.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|1868 Republican cartoon identifies Democratic candidates Seymour and Blair (right) with KKK violence and with Confederate soldiers (left).]]
Concerned that President Johnson viewed Congress as an "illegal body" and wanted to overthrow the government, Republicans in Congress took control of Reconstruction policies after the election of 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Badeau (1887) ''Grant in Peace'', pp. 46, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson ignored the policy mandate, and he openly encouraged southern states to deny ratification of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (except for Tennessee, all former Confederate states did refuse to ratify, as did the border states of Delaware, Maryland and Kentucky). Radical Republicans in Congress, led by Stevens and Sumner, opened the way to suffrage for male freedmen. They were generally in control, although they had to compromise with the moderate Republicans (the Democrats in Congress had almost no power). Historians refer to this period as "Radical Reconstruction" or "Congressional Reconstruction."&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book|author1=Paul E. Teed   |author2=Melissa Ladd Teed  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Reconstruction: A Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpMeCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|year=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=51, 174ff}}. Foner (1988) entitles his chapter 6, "The Making of Radical Reconstruction." Benedict argues the Radical Republicans were conservative on many other issues in Michael Les Benedict, "Preserving the Constitution: The Conservative Basis of Radical Reconstruction." ''Journal of American History'' (1974): 65–90 {{JSTOR|1918254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South's white leaders, who held power in the immediate postwar era before the vote was granted to the freedmen, renounced secession and slavery, but not white supremacy. People who had previously held power were angered in 1867 when new elections were held. New Republican lawmakers were elected by a coalition of white Unionists, freedmen and northerners who had settled in the South. Some leaders in the South tried to accommodate to new conditions.

===Constitutional amendments===
Three Constitutional amendments, known as the Reconstruction Amendments, were adopted. The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery was ratified in 1865. The 14th Amendment was proposed in 1866 and ratified in 1868, guaranteeing [[United States citizenship]] to all persons born or naturalized in the United States and granting them federal [[civil rights]]. The 15th Amendment, proposed in late February 1869 and passed in early February 1870, decreed that the right to vote could not be denied because of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". The amendment did not declare the vote an unconditional right; it prohibited these types of discrimination. States would still determine voter registration and electoral laws. The amendments were directed at ending slavery and providing full citizenship to freedmen. Northern Congressmen believed that providing black men with the right to vote would be the most rapid means of political education and training.

Many blacks took an active part in voting and political life, and rapidly continued to build churches and community organizations. Following Reconstruction, white Democrats and insurgent groups used force to regain power in the state legislatures, and pass laws that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites in the South. From 1890 to 1910, southern states passed new constitutions that completed disfranchisement of blacks. U.S. Supreme Court rulings on these provisions upheld many of these new southern constitutions and laws, and most blacks were prevented from voting in the South until the 1960s. Full federal enforcement of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments did not reoccur until after passage of legislation in the mid-1960s as a result of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

===Statutes===
The [[Reconstruction Acts]] as originally passed, were initially called [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=014/llsl014.db&amp;recNum=459 "An act to provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States"] the legislation was enacted by the 39th Congress, on March 2, 1867. It was vetoed by President Johnson, and the veto overridden by two-thirds majority, in both the House and the Senate, the same day. Congress also clarified the scope of the federal writ of [[habeas corpus]] to allow federal courts to vacate unlawful state court convictions or sentences in 1867 (28 U.S.C. §2254).

With the Radicals in control, Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Act]]s on July 19, 1867. The first Reconstruction Act, authored by Oregon Sen. [[George Henry Williams|George H. Williams]], a [[Radical Republican]], placed 10 of the former Confederate states—all but Tennessee—under military control, grouping them into five military districts:&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First Military District]]: Virginia, under General [[John Schofield]]
* [[Second Military District]]: North Carolina and South Carolina, under General [[Daniel Sickles]]
* [[Third Military District]]: Georgia, Alabama and Florida, under Generals [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] and [[George Meade]]
* [[Fourth Military District]]: Arkansas and Mississippi, under General [[Edward Ord]]
* [[Fifth Military District]]: Texas and Louisiana, under Generals [[Philip Sheridan]] and [[Winfield Scott Hancock]]

20,000 U.S. troops were deployed to enforce the Act.

The four [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] that had not joined the Confederacy were not subject to military Reconstruction. West Virginia, which had [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|seceded]] from Virginia in 1863, and Tennessee, which had already been re-admitted in 1866, were not included in the military districts.

The ten Southern state governments were re-constituted under the direct control of the United States Army. One major purpose was to recognize and protect the right of African Americans to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=589301 |title=Gabriel J.

Randolph Campbell describes what happened in Texas:&lt;ref&gt;Randolph Campbell, ''Gone to Texas'' 2003, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The first critical step&amp;nbsp;... was the registration of voters according to guidelines established by Congress and interpreted by Generals Sheridan and Charles Griffin. The Reconstruction Acts called for registering all adult males, white and black, except those who had ever sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then engaged in rebellion&amp;nbsp;... Sheridan interpreted these restrictions stringently, barring from registration not only all pre-1861 officials of state and local governments who had supported the Confederacy but also all city officeholders and even minor functionaries such as sextons of cemeteries.

In every county where practicable a freedman served as one of the three registrars&amp;nbsp;... Final registration amounted to approximately 59,633 whites and 49,479 blacks. It is impossible to say how many whites were rejected or refused to register (estimates vary from 7,500 to 12,000), but blacks, who constituted only about 30 percent of the state's population, were significantly overrepresented at 45 percent of all voters.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes (1920) v 6, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Until 1872, most former Confederate or prewar Southern office holders were disqualified from voting or holding office; all but 500 top Confederate leaders were pardoned by the [[Amnesty Act of 1872]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William J., Jr. |last=Cooper |first2=Thomas E. |last2=Terrill |title=The American South: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foGTgJkUOTEC&amp;pg=PA436 |year=2009 |page=436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Proscription" was the policy of disqualifying as many ex-Confederates as possible. It appealed to the Scalawag element. For example, in 1865 Tennessee had disfranchised 80,000 ex-Confederates.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Zuczek, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the Reconstruction Era'' (2006) 2:635.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prescription was soundly rejected by the black element, which insisted on universal suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perman, ''The road to redemption: Southern politics, 1869–1879'' (1985) pp 36–37; Foner, ''Reconstruction'', p 324.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue would come up repeatedly in several states, especially in Texas and Virginia. In Virginia, an effort was made to disqualify for public office every man who had served in the Confederate Army even as a private, and any civilian farmer who sold food to the Confederate army.&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, ''Retreat from Reconstruction, 1869–1879'' (1982), p 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuczek, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the Reconstruction Era'' (2006) 1:323, 2:645, 698.&lt;/ref&gt; Disfranchising Southern whites was also opposed by moderate Republicans in the North, who felt that ending proscription would bring the South closer to a republican form of government based on the [[consent of the governed]], as called for by the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Strong measures that were called for in order to forestall a return to the defunct Confederacy increasingly seemed out of place, and the role of the United States Army and controlling politics in the state was troublesome. Increasingly, historian Mark Summers states, "the disfranchisers had to fall back on the contention that denial of the vote was meant as punishment, and a lifelong punishment at that&amp;nbsp;... Month by month, the unrepublican character of the regime looked more glaring."&lt;ref&gt;Summers, ''The Ordeal of the Reunion '' pp 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grant: the Radical President===
{{Main|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}
[[File:President Ulysses S. Grant seated portrait Brady.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ulysses S. Grant]], 18th President of the United States (1869–1877), photograph by [[Mathew Brady]]]]

During the Civil War, many in the North believed that fighting for the Union was a noble cause – for the preservation of the Union and the end of slavery. After the war ended, with the North victorious, the fear among Radicals was that President Johnson too quickly assumed that slavery and Confederate nationalism were dead and that the southern states could return. The Radicals sought out a candidate for President who represented their viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Smith ''Grant'' (2001), pp. 455–457.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, the Republicans unanimously chose Ulysses S. Grant as their Presidential candidate. Grant won favor with the Radicals after he allowed [[Edwin Stanton]], a Radical, to be reinstated as Secretary of War. As early as 1862, during the Civil War, Grant had appointed the Ohio military chaplain [[John Eaton (General)|John Eaton]] to protect and gradually incorporate refugee slaves in west Tennessee and northern Mississippi into the Union War effort and pay them for their labor. It was the beginning of his vision for the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Brooks D. "Ulysses S. Grant and the Freedmen's Bureau", in ''The Freedmen's Bureau and Reconstruction: Reconsiderations'', edited by Paul A. Cimbala and Randall M. Miller.

Immediately upon Inauguration in 1869, Grant bolstered Reconstruction by prodding Congress to readmit [[Virginia]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]] into the Union, while ensuring their constitutions protected every citizen's voting rights.&lt;ref name=Spxiii&gt;Simon (1967), ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', Vol. 19, pp. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant met with prominent black leaders for consultation, and signed a bill into law that guaranteed equal rights to both blacks and whites in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name=Spxiii/&gt;

''Fordham Urban Law Journal'' 23 (1995): 155+ [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1591&amp;context=ulj online].&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with Congress to create the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and Office of [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]], led by Attorney General [[Amos Akerman]] and the first Solicitor General [[Benjamin Bristow]]. Congress passed three powerful [[Enforcement Acts]] in 1870–71. These were criminal codes which protected the Freedmen's right to vote, to hold office, to serve on juries, and receive equal protection of laws. Most important, they authorized the federal government to intervene when states did not act. Grant's new Justice Department prosecuted thousands of Klansmen under the tough new laws. Grant sent federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to suppress Klan violence in 1871. Grant supported passage of the Fifteenth Amendment stating that no state could deny a man the right to vote on the basis of race. Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] giving people access to public facilities regardless of race.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Wyatt-Brown, "The Civil Rights Act of 1875." ''Western Political Quarterly'' (1965): 763–775. {{JSTOR|445883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter vote fraud in the Democratic stronghold of [[New York City]], Grant sent in tens of thousands of armed, uniformed federal marshals and other election officials to regulate the 1870 and subsequent elections. Democrats across the North then mobilized to defend their base and attacked Grant's entire set of policies.&lt;ref&gt;David Quigley, "Constitutional Revision and the City: The Enforcement Acts and Urban America, 1870–1894," ''Journal of Policy History'', January 2008, Vol. 20, Issue 1, pp. 64–75.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, 1876 President Grant deployed troops to protect black and white Republican voters in Petersburg, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blair|Blair]] (2005), p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's support from Congress and the nation declined due to scandals within his administration and the political resurgence of the Democrats in the North and South. By 1870, most Republicans felt the war goals had been achieved, and they turned their attention to other issues such as economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001), ''Grant'', p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional investigation (1871–1872)===
On April 20, 1871, the U.S. Congress launched a 21-member investigation committee on the status of the Southern Reconstruction states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Congressional members on the committee included Rep. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], Sen. [[Zachariah Chandler]], and Sen. [[Francis P. Blair]]. Subcommittee members traveled into the South to interview the people living in their respective states. Those interviewed included top-ranking officials, such as [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], former South Carolina Gov. [[James L. Orr]], and [[Nathan Bedford Forrest|Nathan B. Forrest]], a former Confederate general and (alleged) prominent Ku Klux Klan leader (Forrest denied in his Congressional testimony being a member). Other southerners interviewed included farmers, doctors, merchants, teachers, and clergymen. The committee heard numerous reports of white violence against blacks, while many whites denied Klan membership or knowledge of violent activities. The majority report by Republicans concluded that the government would not tolerate any Southern "conspiracy" to resist violently the Congressional Reconstruction. The committee completed its 13-volume report in February 1872. While Grant had been able to suppress the KKK through the Enforcement Acts, other [[paramilitary]] [[insurgents]] organized, including the [[White League]] in 1874, active in Louisiana; and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], with chapters active in Mississippi and the Carolinas. They used intimidation and outright attacks to run Republicans out of office and repress voting by blacks, leading to white Democrats regaining power by the elections of the mid-to-late 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Franklin|Franklin]] (1961), pp. 168–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===African-American officeholders===
Republicans took control of all Southern state governorships and state legislatures, except for Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia had a Republican governor and legislature, but the Republican hegemony was tenuous at best, and Democrats continued to win presidential elections there. See [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/tdgh-mar/mar28.htm 1834 March 28 article in ''This Day in Georgia History''] compiled by Ed Jackson and Charles Pou; ''cf.'' [[Rufus Bullock]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican coalition elected [[List of African-American officeholders during the Reconstruction|numerous African Americans]] to local, state, and national offices; though they did not dominate any electoral offices, black men as representatives voting in state and federal legislatures marked a drastic social change. At the beginning of 1867, no African American in the South held political office, but within three or four years "about 15 percent of the officeholders in the South were black—a larger proportion than in 1990." Most of those offices were at the local level.&lt;ref name="mcpherson1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=McPherson, James M.| year=1992 | page=19 | isbn=978-0-19-507606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 blacks constituted the majority of the population in Mississippi and South Carolina, 47% in Louisiana, 45% in Alabama, and 44% in Georgia and Florida,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/willis/Civil_War/tables/dateSecession.html "Date of Secession Compared To 1860 Black Population"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816055749/http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/willis/Civil_War/tables/dateSecession.html |date=August 16, 2014 }}, America's Civil War website, accessed 9 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; so their political influence was still far less than their percentage of the population.

About 137 black officeholders had lived outside the South before the Civil War. Some who had escaped from slavery to the North and had become educated returned to help the South advance in the postwar era. Others were [[Free people of color|free blacks]] before the war, who had achieved education and positions of leadership elsewhere. Other African-American men elected to office were already leaders in their communities, including a number of preachers. As happened in white communities, not all leadership depended upon wealth and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, ch. 7; Foner, ''Freedom's Lawmakers'', introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Hahn, ''A Nation under Our Feet''&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few African Americans elected or appointed to national office. African Americans voted for both white and black candidates. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guaranteed only that voting could not be restricted on the basis of race, color or previous condition of servitude. From 1868 on, campaigns and elections were surrounded by violence as white insurgents and paramilitary tried to suppress the black vote, and fraud was rampant. Many Congressional elections in the South were contested. Even states with majority African-American population often elected only one or two African-American representatives to Congress. Exceptions included South Carolina; at the end of Reconstruction, four of its five Congressmen were African American.{{Citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph lacks reference to anything verifiable|date=May 2014}}

==Social and economic factors==

===Organized religion===
[[File:Eastman Johnson, The Lord is My Shepherd.jpg|thumb|[[Eastman Johnson]]'s 1863 painting ''The Lord is My Shepherd'', of a man reading the Bible]]
Freedmen were very active in forming their own churches, mostly Baptist or Methodist, and giving their ministers both moral and political leadership roles. In a process of self-segregation, practically all blacks left white churches so that few racially integrated congregations remained (apart from some Catholic churches in Louisiana). They started many new black Baptist churches and soon, new black state associations.

Four main groups competed with each other across the South to form new Methodist churches composed of freedmen. They were the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]; the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], both independent black denominations founded in Philadelphia and New York, respectively; the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church|Colored Methodist Episcopal Church]] (which was sponsored by the white [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]]) and the well-funded [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] (Northern white Methodists). The Methodist Church had split before the war due to disagreements about slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel W. Stowell|title=Rebuilding Zion: The Religious Reconstruction of the South, 1863–1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQphbo640wAC&amp;pg=PA84|year=1998|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Earl Walker, ''A Rock in a Weary Land: The African Methodist Episcopal Church During the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1871 the Northern Methodists had 88,000 black members in the South, and had opened numerous schools for them.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Sweet, "The Methodist Episcopal Church and Reconstruction," ''Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society'' (1914) 7#3 pp. 147–165 {{JSTOR|40194198}} at p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Blacks in the South made up a core element of the Republican Party. Their ministers had powerful political roles that were distinctive since they did not depend on white support, in contrast to teachers, politicians, businessmen, and tenant farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lee Grant|title=The Way It Was in the South: The Black Experience in Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpmjRm4cdswC&amp;pg=PA264|year=1993|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting on the principle as stated by [[Charles H. Pearce]], an AME minister in Florida: "A man in this State cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people," more than 100 black ministers were elected to state legislatures during Reconstruction, as well as several to Congress and one, [[Hiram Rhodes Revels|Hiram Revels]], to the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''Reconstruction'', (1988) p 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In a highly controversial action during the war, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Northern Methodists]] used the Army to seize control of Methodist churches in large cities, over the vehement protests of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Southern Methodists]]. Historian Ralph Morrow reports:

{{quote|A War Department order of November, 1863, applicable to the Southwestern states of the Confederacy, authorized the Northern Methodists to occupy "all houses of worship belonging to the Methodist Episcopal Church South in which a loyal minister, appointed by a loyal bishop of said church, does not officiate."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph E. Morrow, "Northern Methodism in the South during Reconstruction," ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1954) 41#2 pp. 197–218, quote on p 202 {{JSTOR|1895802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph E. Morrow, ''Northern Methodism and Reconstruction'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stowell, ''Rebuilding Zion: The Religious Reconstruction of the South, 1863–1877'', pp 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Across the North most evangelical denominations, especially the Methodists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians, as well as the Quakers, strongly supported Radical policies. The focus on social problems paved the way for the [[Social Gospel]] movement. [[Matthew Simpson]], a Methodist bishop, played a leading role in mobilizing the Northern Methodists for the cause. His biographer calls him the "High Priest of the Radical Republicans."&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Clark, ''The Life of Matthew Simpson'' (1956) pp 245–67&lt;/ref&gt; The Methodist Ministers Association of Boston, meeting two weeks after Lincoln's assassination, called for a hard line against the Confederate leadership:

{{quote|Resolved, That no terms should be made with traitors, no compromise with rebels&amp;nbsp;... That we hold the National authority bound by the most solemn obligation to God and man to bring all the civil and military leaders of the rebellion to trial by due course of law, and when they are clearly convicted, to execute them.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick A. Norwood, ed., ''Sourcebook of American Methodism'' (1982), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William W. Sweet, "The Methodist Episcopal Church and Reconstruction," ''Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society'' (1914) 7#3 pp. 147–165, quote on p 161 {{JSTOR|40194198}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The denominations all sent missionaries, teachers and activists to the South to help the freedmen. Only the Methodists made many converts, however.&lt;ref&gt;Victor B. Howard, ''Religion and the Radical Republican Movement, 1860–1870'' (1990) pp 212–13&lt;/ref&gt; Activists sponsored by Northern Methodist Church played a major role in the Freedmen's Bureau, notably in such key educational roles as the Bureau's state superintendent or assistant superintendent of education for Virginia, Florida, Alabama, and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow (1954) p 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Americans interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black Baptist sermons in Alabama. White Baptists expressed the view that:

{{quote|God had chastised them and given them a special mission – to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.}}

In sharp contrast, Black Baptists interpreted the Civil War, emancipation and Reconstruction as:

{{quote|God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Fallin Jr., ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Public schools===
Historian James D. Anderson argues that the freed slaves were the first Southerners "to campaign for universal, state-supported public education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James D. |last=Anderson|title=[[The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935]]|year=1988|publisher=U of North Carolina Press|page=4 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks in the Republican coalition played a critical role in establishing the principle in state constitutions for the first time during congressional Reconstruction. Some slaves had learned to read from white playmates or colleagues before formal education was allowed by law; African Americans started "native schools" before the end of the war; Sabbath schools were another widespread means that freedmen developed to teach literacy.{{sfn|Anderson|1988|pp=6–15}} When they gained suffrage, black politicians took this commitment to public education to state constitutional conventions.

The Republicans created a system of public schools, which were segregated by race everywhere except New Orleans. Generally, elementary and a few secondary schools were built in most cities, and occasionally in the countryside, but the South had few cities.&lt;ref&gt;Tyack and Lowe. "The constitutional moment: Reconstruction and Black education in the South." (1986):&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Preston Vaughn, ''Schools for All: The Blacks and Public Education in the South, 1865—1877'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural areas faced many difficulties opening and maintaining public schools. In the country, the public school was often a one-room affair that attracted about half the younger children. The teachers were poorly paid, and their pay was often in arrears.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 365–8&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives contended the rural schools were too expensive and unnecessary for a region where the vast majority of people were cotton or tobacco farmers. They had no vision of a better future for their residents. One historian found that the schools were less effective than they might have been because "poverty, the inability of the states to collect taxes, and inefficiency and corruption in many places prevented successful operation of the schools."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin 139&lt;/ref&gt; After Reconstruction ended and the whites [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised the blacks]] and imposed [[Jim Crow]], they consistently underfunded black institutions, including the schools.

After the war, northern missionaries founded numerous private academies and colleges for freedmen across the South. In addition, every state founded state colleges for freedmen, such as [[Alcorn State University]] in Mississippi. The normal schools and state colleges produced generations of teachers who were integral to the education of African-American children under the segregated system. By the end of the century, the majority of African Americans were literate.

In the late 19th century, the federal government established land grant legislation to provide funding for higher education across the United States. Learning that blacks were excluded from land grant colleges in the South, in 1890 the federal government insisted that southern states establish black state institutions as [[land grant colleges]] to provide for black higher education, in order to continue to receive funds for their already established white schools. Some states classified their black state colleges as land grant institutions. Former Congressman [[John Roy Lynch]] wrote, "there are very many liberal, fair-minded and influential Democrats in the State [Mississippi] who are strongly in favor of having the State provide for the liberal education of both races."&lt;ref name="Lynch 1913"&gt;Lynch 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. D. Mayberry, ''A Century of Agriculture in the 1890 Land Grant Institutions and Tuskegee University, 1890–1990'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railroad subsidies and payoffs===
[[File:Atlanta roundhouse ruin3.jpg|thumb|Atlanta's [[rail yard]] and [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] in ruins shortly after the end of the Civil War]]

Every Southern state subsidized railroads, which modernizers believed could haul the South out of isolation and poverty. Millions of dollars in bonds and subsidies were fraudulently pocketed. One ring in North Carolina spent $200,000 in bribing the legislature and obtained millions in state money for its railroads. Instead of building new track, however, it used the funds to speculate in bonds, reward friends with extravagant fees, and enjoy lavish trips to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes were quadrupled across the South to pay off the railroad bonds and the school costs.

There were complaints among taxpayers because taxes had historically been low, as the planter elite was not committed to public infrastructure or public education. Taxes historically had been much lower in the South than in the North, reflecting the lack of government investment by the communities.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin pp&amp;nbsp;141–48; Summers 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, thousands of miles of lines were built as the Southern system expanded from 11,000 miles (17,700&amp;nbsp;km) in 1870 to 29,000 miles (46,700&amp;nbsp;km) in 1890. The lines were owned and directed overwhelmingly by Northerners. Railroads helped create a mechanically skilled group of craftsmen and broke the isolation of much of the region. Passengers were few, however, and apart from hauling the cotton crop when it was harvested, there was little freight traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Stover 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; As Franklin explains, "numerous railroads fed at the public trough by bribing legislators&amp;nbsp;... and through the use and misuse of state funds." The effect, according to one businessman, "was to drive capital from the State, paralyze industry, and demoralize labor."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin pp. 147–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation during Reconstruction===
Reconstruction changed the means of taxation in the South. In the U.S. from the earliest days until today, a major source of state revenue was the [[property tax]]. In the South, wealthy landowners were allowed to self-assess the value of their own land. These fraudulent assessments were almost valueless, and pre-war property tax collections were lacking due to property value misrepresentation. State revenues came from fees and from sales taxes on slave auctions.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states assessed property owners by a combination of [[land value tax|land value]] and a capitation tax, a tax on each worker employed. This tax was often assessed in a way to discourage a free labor market, where a slave was assessed at 75 cents, while a free white was assessed at a dollar or more, and a free African American at $3 or more. Some revenue also came from [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]. These taxes were more than poor people could pay, with the designed and inevitable consequence that they did not vote.

During Reconstruction, the state legislature mobilized to provide for public need more than had previous governments: establishing public schools and investing in infrastructure, as well as charitable institutions such as hospitals and asylums. The needed to increase taxes which were abnormally low. The planters had provided privately for their own needs. There was some fraudulent spending in the postwar years; a collapse in state credit because of huge deficits, forced the states to increase property tax rates. In places, the rate went up to ten times higher—despite the poverty of the region. The planters had not invested in infrastructure and much had been destroyed during the war. In part, the new tax system was designed to force owners of large plantations with huge tracts of uncultivated land either to sell or to have it confiscated for failure to pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The taxes would serve as a market-based system for redistributing the land to the landless freedmen and white poor. Mississippi, for instance, was mostly frontier, with 90% of the bottomlands in the interior undeveloped.

The following table shows property tax rates for South Carolina and Mississippi. Note that many local town and county assessments effectively doubled the tax rates reported in the table. These taxes were still levied upon the landowners' own sworn testimony as to the value of their land, which remained the dubious and exploitable system used by wealthy landholders in the South well into the 20th century.

Called upon to pay taxes on their property, essentially for the first time, angry plantation owners revolted. The conservatives shifted their focus away from race to taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 415–16&lt;/ref&gt; Former Congressman [[John R. Lynch]], a black Republican leader from Mississippi, later wrote,

{{quote|The argument made by the taxpayers, however, was plausible and it may be conceded that, upon the whole, they were about right; for no doubt it would have been much easier upon the taxpayers to have increased at that time the interest-bearing debt of the State than to have increased the tax rate. The latter course, however, had been adopted and could not then be changed unless of course they wanted to change them.&lt;ref name="Lynch 1913" /&gt;}}

==Ending Reconstruction==

===Southern Democrats===
[[File:A Visit from the Old Mistress.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Winslow Homer]]'s 1876 painting ''A Visit from the Old Mistress'']]
While the "Scalawag" element of Republican whites supported measures for black civil rights, the conservative whites typically opposed these measures. Some supported armed attacks to suppress black power. They self-consciously defended their own actions within the framework of an Anglo-American discourse of resistance against tyrannical government, and they broadly succeeded in convincing many fellow white citizens says Steedman.&lt;ref&gt;Marek D. Steedman, "Resistance, Rebirth, and Redemption: The Rhetoric of White Supremacy in Post-Civil War Louisiana," ''Historical Reflections'', Spring 2009, Vol. 35#1, pp. 97–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opponents of Reconstruction formed state political parties, affiliated with the national Democratic party and often named the "Conservative party." They supported or tolerated violent [[paramilitary]] groups, such as the [[White League]] in Louisiana and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in Mississippi and the Carolinas, that assassinated and intimidated both black and white Republican leaders at election time. Historian George C. Rable called such groups the "military arm of the Democratic Party." By the mid-1870s, the Conservatives and Democrats had aligned with the national Democratic Party, which enthusiastically supported their cause even as the national Republican Party was losing interest in Southern affairs.

Historian [[Walter Lynwood Fleming]], associated with the early 20th-century [[Dunning School]], describes the mounting anger of Southern whites:

{{quote|The Negro troops, even at their best, were everywhere considered offensive by the native whites&amp;nbsp;... The Negro soldier, impudent by reason of his new freedom, his new uniform, and his new gun, was more than Southern temper could tranquilly bear, and race conflicts were frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Often, these white Southerners identified as the "Conservative Party" or the "Democratic and Conservative Party" in order to distinguish themselves from the national Democratic Party and to obtain support from former Whigs. These parties sent delegates to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]] and abandoned their separate names by 1873 or 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Perman 1984, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [white] members of both the planter/business class and common farmer class of the South opposed black power, carpetbaggers and military rule, and sought [[white supremacy]]. Democrats nominated some blacks for political office and tried to steal other blacks from the Republican side. When these attempts to combine with the blacks failed, the planters joined the common farmers in simply trying to displace the Republican governments. The planters and their business allies dominated the self-styled "conservative" coalition that finally took control in the South. They were paternalistic toward the blacks but feared they would use power to raise taxes and slow business development.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. Harry Williams]], ''An Analysis of Some Reconstruction Attitudes," ''Journal of Southern History'' Vol. 12, No. 4 (November 1946), pp. 469–486 {{JSTOR|2197687}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming described the first results of the insurgent movement as "good," and the later ones as "both good and bad." According to Fleming (1907), the KKK "quieted the Negroes, made life and property safer, gave protection to women, stopped burnings, forced the Radical leaders to be more moderate, made the Negroes work better, drove the worst of the Radical leaders from the country and started the whites on the way to gain political supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;Walter L. Fleming, ''Documentary History of the Reconstruction'' (1907), II, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; The evil result, Fleming said, was that lawless elements "made use of the organization as a cloak to cover their misdeeds&amp;nbsp;... the lynching habits of today [1907] are largely due to conditions, social and legal, growing out of Reconstruction."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, ''Documentary History of the Reconstruction (1907), II, pp. 328–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have noted that the peak of [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] took place near the turn of the century, decades after Reconstruction ended, as whites were imposing Jim Crow laws and passing new state constitutions that disenfranchised the blacks. The lynchings were used for intimidation and social control, with a frequency associated with economic stresses and the settlement of sharecropper accounts at the end of the season, than for any other reason.

[[Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer]] (a northern scholar) in 1917 explained:

{{quote|Outrages upon the former slaves in the South there were in plenty. Their sufferings were many. But white men, too, were victims of lawless violence, and in all portions of the North and the late "rebel" states. Not a political campaign passed without the exchange of bullets, the breaking of skulls with sticks and stones, the firing of rival club-houses. Republican clubs marched the streets of Philadelphia, amid revolver shots and brickbats, to save the negroes from the "rebel" savages in Alabama&amp;nbsp;... The project to make voters out of black men was not so much for their social elevation as for the further punishment of the Southern white people—for the capture of offices for Radical scamps and the entrenchment of the Radical party in power for a long time to come in the South and in the country at large.&lt;ref&gt;Oberholtzer, vol. 1, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Reconstruction continued, whites accompanied elections with increased violence in an attempt to run Republicans out of office and suppress black voting. The victims of this violence were overwhelmingly African American, as in the [[Colfax Massacre]] of 1873. After federal suppression of the Klan in the early 1870s, white insurgent groups tried to avoid open conflict with federal forces. In 1874 in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]], the [[White League]] entered New Orleans with 5,000 members and defeated the police and militia, to occupy federal offices for three days in an attempt to overturn the disputed government of [[William Pitt Kellogg|William Kellogg]], but retreated before federal troops reached the city. None were prosecuted. Their election-time tactics included violent intimidation of African-American and Republican voters prior to elections, while avoiding conflict with the U.S. Army or the state militias, and then withdrawing completely on election day. Conservative reaction continued in both the north and south; the "white liners" movement to elect candidates dedicated to white supremacy reached as far as [[Ohio]] in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease, ''White Terror''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFeely (2002), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 420–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redemption 1873–77===
{{Main|Redeemers}}

====Republicans split nationally: Election of 1872====
As early as 1868 Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]], a leading Radical during the war, concluded that:

{{quote|Congress was right in not limiting, by its reconstruction acts, the right of suffrage to whites; but wrong in the exclusion from suffrage of certain classes of citizens and all unable to take its prescribed retrospective oath, and wrong also in the establishment of despotic military governments for the States and in authorizing military commissions for the trial of civilians in time of peace. There should have been as little military government as possible; no military commissions; no classes excluded from suffrage; and no oath except one of faithful obedience and support to the Constitution and laws, and of sincere attachment to the constitutional Government of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Schuckers, ''The Life and Public Services of Salmon Portland Chase'', (1874), p. 585; letter of May 30, 1868 to August Belmont.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant had alienated large numbers of leading Republicans, including many Radicals, by the corruption of his administration and his use of federal soldiers to prop up Radical state regimes in the South. The opponents, called [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|"Liberal Republicans"]], included founders of the party who expressed dismay that the party had succumbed to corruption. They were further wearied by the continued insurgent violence of whites against blacks in the South, especially around every election cycle, which demonstrated the war was not over and changes were fragile. Leaders included editors of some of the nation's most powerful newspapers. Charles Sumner, embittered by the corruption of the Grant administration, joined the new party, which nominated editor [[Horace Greeley]]. The badly organized Democratic party also supported Greeley.

Grant made up for the defections by new gains among Union veterans and by strong support from the "[[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]]" faction of his party (which depended on his patronage), and the Southern Republican parties. Grant won with 55.6% of the vote to Greeley's 43.8%. The Liberal Republican party vanished and many former supporters—even former abolitionists—abandoned the cause of Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Republican coalition splinters in South====
In the South, political–racial tensions built up inside the Republican party as they were attacked by the Democrats. In 1868, Georgia Democrats, with support from some Republicans, expelled all 28 black Republican members from the state house, arguing blacks were eligible to vote but not to hold office. In most states, the more conservative scalawags fought for control with the more radical carpetbaggers and their black allies. Most of the 430 Republican newspapers in the South were edited by scalawags – only 20 percent were edited by carpetbaggers. White businessmen generally boycotted Republican papers, which survived through government patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Vaughn, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American journalism'' (2007) p 441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Abbott, ''For Free Press and Equal Rights: Republican Newspapers in the Reconstruction South'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in the increasingly bitter battles inside the Republican Party, the scalawags usually lost; many of the disgruntled losers switched over to the conservative or Democratic side. In Mississippi, the conservative faction led by scalawag [[James Lusk Alcorn]] was decisively defeated by the radical faction led by carpetbagger [[Adelbert Ames]]. The party lost support steadily as many scalawags left it; few recruits were acquired. The most bitter contest took place inside the Republican Party in Arkansas, where the two sides armed their forces and confronted each other in the streets; no actual combat took place in the [[Brooks–Baxter War]]. The carpetbagger faction led by [[Elisha Baxter]] finally prevailed when the White House intervened, but both sides were badly weakened, and the Democrats soon came to power.&lt;ref&gt;Earl F. Woodward, "The Brooks and Baxter War in Arkansas, 1872–1874," ''Arkansas Historical Quarterly'' (1971) 30#4 pp. 315–336 {{JSTOR|40038083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in state after state the freedmen were demanding a bigger share of the offices and patronage, squeezing out carpetbagger allies but never commanding the numbers equivalent to their population proportion. By the mid-1870s, "The hard realities of Southern political life had taught the lesson that black constituents needed to be represented by black officials."&lt;ref&gt;Foner 537–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial depression increased the pressure on Reconstruction governments, dissolving progress.

Finally, some of the more prosperous freedmen were joining the Democrats, as they were angered at the failure of the Republicans to help them acquire land. The South was "sparsely settled"; only ten percent of Louisiana was cultivated, and ninety percent of Mississippi bottomland were undeveloped in areas away from the riverfronts, but freedmen often did not have the stake to get started. They hoped government would help them acquire land which they would work. Only South Carolina created any land redistribution, establishing a land commission and resettling about 14,000 freedmen families and some poor whites on land purchased by the state.&lt;ref name="Foner 374–5"&gt;Foner 374–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historians such as W. E. B. Du Bois celebrated a cross-racial coalition of poor whites and blacks, such coalitions rarely formed in these years. Writing in 1915, former Congressman Lynch, recalling his experience as a black leader in Mississippi, explained that,

{{quote|While the colored men did not look with favor upon a political alliance with the poor whites, it must be admitted that, with very few exceptions, that class of whites did not seek, and did not seem to desire such an alliance.&lt;ref name="Lynch 1915"&gt;Lynch 1915&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lynch reported that poor whites resented the job competition from freedmen. Furthermore, the poor whites

{{quote|with a few exceptions, were less efficient, less capable, and knew less about matters of state and governmental administration than many of the former slaves&amp;nbsp;... As a rule, therefore, the whites that came into the leadership of the Republican party between 1872 and 1875 were representatives of the most substantial families of the land.&lt;ref name="Lynch 1915"/&gt;}}

===Democrats try a "New Departure"===
{{Main|New Departure (Democrats)}}
[[File:A republican form of government and no domestic violence.jpg|thumb|upright|''A Republican Form of Government and No Domestic Violence'', by [[Thomas Nast]], a political cartoon about the (Wheeler) Compromise in Louisiana, published in [[Harper's Weekly]], March 6, 1875]]

By 1870, the Democratic–Conservative leadership across the South decided it had to end its opposition to Reconstruction and black suffrage to survive and move on to new issues. The Grant administration had proven by its crackdown on the Ku Klux Klan that it would use as much federal power as necessary to suppress open anti-black violence. Democrats in the North concurred with these Southern Democrats. They wanted to fight the Republican Party on economic grounds rather than race. The [[New Departure (Democrats)|New Departure]] offered the chance for a clean slate without having to re-fight the Civil War every election. Furthermore, many wealthy Southern landowners thought they could control part of the newly enfranchised black electorate to their own advantage.

Not all Democrats agreed; an insurgent element continued to resist Reconstruction no matter what. Eventually, a group called "Redeemers" took control of the party in the Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Perman 1984, ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; They formed coalitions with conservative Republicans, including scalawags and carpetbaggers, emphasizing the need for economic modernization. Railroad building was seen as a panacea since northern capital was needed. The new tactics were a success in [[History of Virginia|Virginia]] where [[William Mahone]] built a winning coalition. In Tennessee, the Redeemers formed a coalition with Republican governor [[Dewitt Clinton Senter|DeWitt Senter]]. Across the South, some Democrats switched from the race issue to taxes and corruption, charging that Republican governments were corrupt and inefficient. With continuing decrease in cotton prices, taxes squeezed cash-poor farmers who rarely saw $20 in currency a year but had to pay taxes in currency or lose their farm. But major planters, who had never paid taxes before, often recovered their property even after confiscation.&lt;ref name="Foner 374–5"/&gt;

In North Carolina, Republican Governor [[William Woods Holden]] used state troops against the Klan, but the prisoners were released by federal judges. Holden became the first governor in American history to be impeached and removed from office. Republican political disputes in Georgia split the party and enabled the Redeemers to take over.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North, a live-and-let-live attitude made elections more like a sporting contest. But in the Deep South, many white citizens had not reconciled with the defeat of the war or the granting of citizenship to freedmen. As an Alabama scalawag explained, "Our contest here is for life, for the right to earn our bread&amp;nbsp;... for a decent and respectful consideration as human beings and members of society".&lt;ref&gt;Foner p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panic of 1873===
{{Main|Panic of 1873}}
The Panic of 1873 (a [[Long Depression|depression]]) hit the Southern economy hard and disillusioned many Republicans who had gambled that railroads would pull the South out of its poverty. The price of cotton fell by half; many small landowners, local merchants and cotton factors (wholesalers) went bankrupt. Sharecropping for black and white farmers became more common as a way to spread the risk of owning land. The old abolitionist element in the North was aging away, or had lost interest, and was not replenished. Many carpetbaggers returned to the North or joined the Redeemers. Blacks had an increased voice in the Republican Party, but across the South it was divided by internal bickering and was rapidly losing its cohesion. Many local black leaders started emphasizing individual economic progress in cooperation with white elites, rather than racial political progress in opposition to them, a conservative attitude that foreshadowed [[Booker T. Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Foner pp. 545–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationally, President Grant was blamed for the depression; the Republican Party lost 96 seats in all parts of the country in the [[United States House election, 1874|1874 elections]]. The [[Bourbon Democrats]] took control of the House and were confident of electing [[Samuel J. Tilden]] president in 1876. President Grant was not running for re-election and seemed to be losing interest in the South. States fell to the Redeemers, with only four in Republican hands in 1873, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina; Arkansas then fell after the violent [[Brooks–Baxter War]] in 1874 ripped apart the Republican party there.

===Violence===
In the lower South, violence increased as new insurgent groups arose, including the Red Shirts in Mississippi and the Carolinas, and the White League in Louisiana. The disputed election in Louisiana in 1872 found both Republican and Democratic candidates holding inaugural balls while returns were reviewed. Both certified their own slates for local parish offices in many places, causing local tensions to rise. Finally, Federal support helped certify the Republican as governor.

Slates for local offices were certified by each candidate. In rural [[Grant Parish]] in [[Red River of the South|Red River Valley]], freedmen fearing a Democratic attempt to take over the parish government reinforced defenses at the small Colfax courthouse in late March. White militias gathered from the area a few miles outside the settlement. Rumors and fears abounded on both sides. William Ward, an African-American Union veteran and militia captain, mustered his company in [[Colfax, Louisiana|Colfax]] and went to the courthouse. On Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, the whites attacked the defenders at the courthouse. There was confusion about who shot one of the white leaders after an offer by the defenders to surrender. It was a catalyst to mayhem. In the end, three whites died and 120–150 blacks were killed, some 50 that evening while being held as prisoners. The disproportionate numbers of black to white fatalities and documentation of brutalized bodies are why contemporary historians call it the [[Colfax Massacre]] rather than the Colfax Riot, as it was known locally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, Pbk. 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

This marked the beginning of heightened insurgency and attacks on Republican officeholders and freedmen in Louisiana and other Deep South states. In Louisiana, Judge T. S. Crawford and District Attorney P. H. Harris of the 12th Judicial District were shot off their horses and killed from ambush October 8, 1873, while going to court. One widow wrote to the Department of Justice that her husband was killed because he was a Union man and "...&amp;nbsp;of the efforts made to screen those who committed a crime&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;US Senate Journal January 13, 1875, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political violence was endemic in Louisiana. In 1874 the white militias coalesced into [[paramilitary organizations]] such as the [[White League]], first in parishes of the Red River Valley. The new organization operated openly and had political goals: the violent overthrow of Republican rule and suppression of black voting. White League chapters soon rose in many rural parishes, receiving financing for advanced weaponry from wealthy men. In the [[Coushatta Massacre]] in 1874, the White League assassinated six white Republican officeholders and five to twenty black witnesses outside [[Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]]. Four of the white men were related to the Republican representative of the parish, who was married to a local woman; three were native to the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2004-01/reconstruction.html Danielle Alexander, "Forty Acres and a Mule: The Ruined Hope of Reconstruction", ''Humanities'', January/February 2004, vol. 25/No. 1]. Retrieved 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harpers1874LouisianaOutrage.jpg|right|thumb|White Leaguers attacking the New Orleans integrated police force and state militia, Battle of Liberty Place, 1874]]
Later in 1874 the White League mounted a serious attempt to unseat the Republican governor of Louisiana, in a dispute that had simmered since the 1872 election. It brought 5000 troops to New Orleans to engage and overwhelm forces of the Metropolitan Police and state militia to turn Republican Governor [[William P. Kellogg]] out of office and seat [[John McEnery]]. The White League took over and held the state house and city hall, but they retreated before the arrival of reinforcing Federal troops. Kellogg had asked for reinforcements before, and Grant finally responded, sending additional troops to try to quell violence throughout plantation areas of the Red River Valley, although 2,000 troops were already in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 555–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], another paramilitary group, arose in 1875 in Mississippi and the Carolinas. Like the White League and White Liner rifle clubs, to which 20,000 men belonged in North Carolina alone, these groups operated as a "military arm of the Democratic Party", to restore white supremacy.&lt;ref name="George C. Rable 1984, p.132"&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Democrats and many northern Republicans agreed that Confederate nationalism and slavery were dead—the war goals were achieved—and further federal military interference was an undemocratic violation of historic Republican values. The victory of [[Rutherford Hayes]] in the hotly contested Ohio gubernatorial election of 1875 indicated his "let alone" policy toward the South would become Republican policy, as happened when he won the 1876 Republican nomination for president.

An explosion of violence accompanied the campaign for the [[Mississippi Plan|Mississippi's 1875 election]], in which Red Shirts and Democratic rifle clubs, operating in the open, threatened or shot enough Republicans to decide the election for the Democrats. Hundreds of black men were killed. Republican Governor Adelbert Ames asked Grant for federal troops to fight back; Grant initially refused, saying public opinion was "tired out" of the perpetual troubles in the South. Ames fled the state as the Democrats took over Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Foner ch. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaigns and elections of 1876 were marked by additional murders and attacks on Republicans in Louisiana, North and South Carolina, and Florida. In South Carolina the campaign season of 1876 was marked by murderous outbreaks and fraud against freedmen. Red Shirts paraded with arms behind Democratic candidates; they killed blacks in the [[Hamburg Massacre|Hamburg]] and [[Ellenton, South Carolina|Ellenton]] SC massacres; and one historian estimated 150 blacks were killed in the weeks before the 1876 election across South Carolina. Red Shirts prevented almost all black voting in two majority-black counties.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, paperback, 2007, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Shirts were also active in North Carolina.

===Election of 1876===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1876}}
Reconstruction continued in South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida until 1877. The elections of 1876 were accompanied by heightened violence across the Deep South. A combination of [[ballot stuffing]] and intimidating blacks suppressed their vote even in majority black counties. The White League was active in Louisiana. After Republican Rutherford Hayes won the disputed [[U.S. presidential election, 1876|1876 presidential election]], the national [[Compromise of 1877]] was reached.

The white Democrats in the South agreed to accept Hayes' victory if he withdrew the last Federal troops. By this point, the North was weary of insurgency. White Democrats controlled most of the Southern legislatures and armed militias controlled small towns and rural areas. Blacks considered Reconstruction a failure because the Federal government withdrew from enforcing their ability to exercise their rights as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 604.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hayes ends Reconstruction===
{{Main|Electoral Commission (United States)|Compromise of 1877}}
[[File:Rhayes.png|thumb|upright=0.8|right|[[Rutherford B. Hayes]]&lt;br /&gt;19th President of the United States&lt;br /&gt;1877–1881]] On January 29, 1877 President Grant signed the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission Act]], which set up a 15-member commission of 8 Republicans and 7 Democrats to settle the disputed 1876 election. The Electoral Commission awarded Rutherford B. Hayes the electoral votes he needed; Congress certified he had won by one electoral vote. The Democrats had little leverage—they could delay Hayes' election, but they could not put their man ([[Samuel J. Tilden|Tilden]]) in the White House. However, they agreed not to block Hayes' inauguration based on a "back room" deal. Key to this deal was the understanding that federal troops would no longer interfere in southern politics despite substantial election-associated violence against blacks. The Southern states indicated that they would protect the lives of African Americans although this obviously turned out to be far from reliable. Hayes' friends also let it be known that he would promote Federal aid for [[internal improvements]], including help for a railroad in Texas (this never happened) and name a Southerner to his cabinet (this did happen). With the end to the political role of Northern troops, the President had no method to enforce Reconstruction, thus this "back room" deal signaled the end of American Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''Reunion and reaction: the compromise of 1877 and the end of reconstruction'' (1956), pp. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;

After assuming office on March 4, 1877, President Hayes removed troops from the capitals of the remaining Reconstruction states, Louisiana and South Carolina, allowing the Redeemers to have full control of these states. President Grant had already removed troops from Florida, before Hayes was inaugurated, and troops from the other Reconstruction states had long since been withdrawn. Hayes appointed [[David M. Key]] from Tennessee, a Southern Democrat, to the position of [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]]. By 1879, thousands of African-American "[[Exodusters]]" packed up and headed to new opportunities in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nell Irvin Painter]], ''Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrats gained control of the Senate, and had complete control of Congress, having taken over the House in 1875. Hayes vetoed bills from the Democrats that outlawed the Republican Enforcement Acts; however, with the military underfunded, Hayes could not adequately enforce these laws. Blacks remained involved in Southern politics, particularly in Virginia, which was run by the biracial [[Readjuster Party]].&lt;ref&gt;James T. Moore, "Black Militancy in Readjuster Virginia, 1879–1883," ''Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 41, No. 2 (May 1975), pp. 167–186 {{JSTOR|2206012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous blacks were elected to local office through the 1880s, and in the 1890s in some states, biracial coalitions of Populists and Republicans briefly held control of state legislatures. In the last decade of the 19th century, southern states elected five black U.S. Congressmen before disfranchising constitutions were passed throughout the former Confederacy.

==Legacy and historiography==
The interpretation of Reconstruction has been a topic of controversy.  Nearly all historians hold that Reconstruction ended in failure but for very different reasons.

The first generation of Northern historians believed that the former Confederates were traitors and Johnson was their ally who threatened to undo the Union's constitutional achievements. By the 1880s, however, Northern historians argued that Johnson and his allies were not traitors but had blundered badly in rejecting the 14th Amendment and setting the stage for Radical Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher M. Green, "Walter Lynwood Fleming: Historian of Reconstruction," ''The Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 2, No. 4 (November 1936), pp. 497–521.&lt;/ref&gt;

The black leader [[Booker T. Washington]], who grew up in [[West Virginia]] during Reconstruction, concluded later that, "the Reconstruction experiment in racial democracy failed because it began at the wrong end, emphasizing political means and civil rights acts rather than economic means and self-determination."&lt;ref&gt;Louis R. Harlan, ''Booker T. Washington in Perspective'' (1988), p. 164; A. A. Taylor, 'Historians of the Reconstruction,' ''The Journal of Negro History'', Vol. 23, No. 1 (January 1938), pp. 16–34.&lt;/ref&gt; His solution was to concentrate on building the economic infrastructure of the black community, in part by his leadership and the southern [[Tuskegee Institute]].

===Dunning School: 1900 to 1920s===
The [[Dunning School]] of scholars were trained at the history department of [[Columbia University]] under Professor [[William A. Dunning]] analyzed Reconstruction as a failure after 1866 for different reasons. They claimed that Congress took freedoms and rights from qualified whites and gave them to unqualified blacks who were being duped by corrupt "carpetbaggers and scalawags." As [[T. Harry Williams]] (who was a sharp critic of the Dunning school) notes, the Dunningites portrayed the era in stark terms:

{{quote|Reconstruction was a battle between two extremes: the Democrats, as the group which included the vast majority of the whites, standing for decent government and racial supremacy, versus the Republicans, the Negroes, alien carpetbaggers, and renegade scalawags, standing for dishonest government and alien ideals. These historians wrote literally in terms of white and black.&lt;ref&gt;T. Harry Williams, 'An Analysis of Some Reconstruction Attitudes,' ''Journal of Southern History'' Vol. 12, No. 4 (November 1946), pp. 469–486 {{JSTOR|2197687}} quote at p. 473&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Revisionists and Beardians, 1930s–1940s===
In the 1930s, ''[[historical revisionism]]'' became popular among scholars. As disciples of [[Charles A. Beard]], revisionists focused on economics, downplaying politics and constitutional issues. The central figure was a young scholar at the University Wisconsin, [[Howard K. Beale]], who in his PhD dissertation, finished in 1924, developed a complex new interpretation of Reconstruction. The Dunning School portrayed Freedmen as mere pawns in the hands of the Carpetbaggers. Beale argued that the Carpetbaggers themselves were pawns in the hands of northern industrialists, who were the real villains of Reconstruction. These industrialists had taken control of the nation during the Civil War, and set up high tariffs to protect their profits, as well as a lucrative national banking system and a railroad network fueled by government subsidies and secret payoffs. The return to power of the southern whites would seriously threaten all their gains, and so the ex-Confederates had to be kept out of power. The tool used by the industrialists was the combination of the Northern Republican Party and sufficient Southern support using Carpetbaggers and black voters. The rhetoric of civil rights for blacks, and the dream of equality, was rhetoric designed to fool idealistic voters. Beale called it "claptrap," arguing, "Constitutional discussions of the rights of the negro, the status of Southern states, the legal position of ex-rebels, and the powers of Congress and the president determined nothing. They were pure sham."&lt;ref&gt;Beale, ''The Critical Year'', p 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Tulloch|title=The Debate On the American Civil War Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVD1-qcknywC&amp;pg=PA226|year=1999|publisher=Manchester UP|page=226|isbn=9780719049385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Andrew Johnson had tried, and failed, to stop the juggernaut of the industrialists. The Dunning school had praised Johnson for upholding the rights of the white men in the South and endorsing white supremacy. Beale was not a racist, and indeed was one of the most vigorous historians working for black civil rights in the 1930s and 1940s. In his view, Johnson was not a hero for his racism, but rather for his forlorn battle against the industrialists. [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary Beard had already published ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) three years before Beale, and had given very wide publicity to a similar theme. The Beard-Beale interpretation of Reconstruction became known as "revisionism," and replaced the Dunning school for most historians, until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Allan D. Charles, 'Howard K Beale,'  in Clyde N. Wilson, ed. ''Twentieth-century American Historians'' (Gale Research Company, 1983) pp 32–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Harry Williams, 'An Analysis of Some Reconstruction Attitudes,' ''Journal of Southern History'' (1946) 12#4 pp: 469–486 {{JSTOR|2197687}}; Williams was a Northerner trained at Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beardian interpretation of the causes of the Civil War downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. It ignored constitutional issues of states rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict, as the Beards explained in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), the Civil War was really a:

{{quote|social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Beards were especially interested in the Reconstruction era, as the industrialists of the Northeast and the farmers of the West cashed in on their great victory over the southern aristocracy. Historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] paraphrases the Beards as arguing that in victory:

{{quote|the Northern capitalists were able to impose their economic program, quickly passing a series of measures on tariffs, banking, homesteads, and immigration that guaranteed the success of their plans for economic development. Solicitude for the Freedman had little to do with northern policies. The Fourteenth Amendment, which gave the Negro his citizenship, Beard found significant primarily as a result of a conspiracy of a few legislative draftsman friendly to corporations to use the supposed elevation of the blacks as a cover for a fundamental law giving strong the protection to business corporations against regulation by state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Progressive Historians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLdMzbv2IDQC&amp;pg=PT458|origyear=1968|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=303|isbn=9780307809605}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wisconsin historian William Hesseltine added the point that the Northeastern businessmen wanted to control the Southern economy directly, which they did through ownership of the railroads.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Hesseltine, 'Economic Factors in the Abandonment of Reconstruction.' ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1935) 22#2 pp: 191–210 {{JSTOR|1898466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beard-Beale interpretation of the monolithic Northern industrialists fell apart in the 1950s when it was closely examined by numerous historians, including Robert P. Sharkey, Irwin Unger, and Stanley Coben.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Coben, 'Northeastern Business and Radical Reconstruction: A Re-Examination.' ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1959): 67–90.

Some wanted high tariffs and some low. Some wanted Greenbacks and others wanted gold. There was no conspiracy to use Reconstruction to impose any such unified economic policy on the nation. Northern businessmen were widely divergent on monetary or tariff policy, and seldom paid attention to Reconstruction issues. Furthermore, the rhetoric on behalf of the rights of the Freedman was not claptrap but deeply held and very serious political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Stampp and Leon F. Litwack, eds., ''Reconstruction: An Anthology of Revisionist Writings'' (1969) pp 85–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1982; Montgomery, pp vii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black historians===
The black scholar [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], in his ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nt5mglDCNHEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=du+bois&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q-PrUuvSMIu0sQT55oGwDg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=du%20bois&amp;f=false Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880]'', published in 1935, compared results across the states to show achievements by the Reconstruction legislatures and to refute claims about wholesale African-American control of governments. He showed black contributions, as in the establishment of universal public education, charitable and social institutions and [[universal suffrage]] as important results, and he noted their collaboration with whites. He also pointed out that whites benefited most by the financial deals made, and he put excesses in the perspective of the war's aftermath. He noted that despite complaints, several states kept their Reconstruction constitutions for nearly a quarter of a century. Despite receiving favorable reviews, his work was largely ignored by white historians of his time.

===Neo-Abolitionists===
In the 1960s [[neoabolitionist]] historians emerged, led by [[John Hope Franklin]], [[Kenneth Stampp]], [[Leon Litwack]], and [[Eric Foner]]. Influenced by the [[Civil Rights Movement]], they rejected the Dunning school and found a great deal to praise in Radical Reconstruction. Foner, the primary advocate of this view, argued that it was never truly completed, and that a "Second Reconstruction" was needed in the late 20th century to complete the goal of full equality for African Americans. The neo-abolitionists followed the revisionists in minimizing the corruption and waste created by Republican state governments, saying it was no worse than [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed]]'s ring in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 469; Foner p. ''xxii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, they emphasized that suppression of the rights of African Americans was a worse scandal and a grave corruption of America's republican ideals. They argued that the tragedy of Reconstruction was not that it failed because blacks were incapable of governing, especially as they did not dominate any state government, but that it failed because whites raised an insurgent movement to restore [[white supremacy]]. White elite-dominated state legislatures passed disfranchising constitutions from 1890 to 1908 that effectively barred most blacks and many poor whites from voting. This disfranchisement affected millions of people for decades into the 20th century, and closed African Americans and poor whites out of the political process in the South.&lt;ref name="Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135–136"&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p. 27]. Retrieved 2008-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-establishment of white supremacy meant that within a decade African Americans were excluded from virtually all local, state, and federal governance in all states of the South.  Lack of representation meant that they were treated as second-class citizens, with schools and services consistently underfunded in segregated societies, no [[jury service|representation on juries]] or in [[law enforcement]], and [[bias]] in other legislation. It was not until the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 that segregation was outlawed and suffrage restored, under what is sometimes{{when|date=February 2018}} referred to as the "Second Reconstruction."

In 1990 [[Eric Foner]] concluded that from the black point of view, "Reconstruction must be judged a failure."&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990), p. 255. Foner adds, "What remains certain is that Reconstruction failed, and that for blacks its failure was a disaster whose magnitude cannot be obscured by the accomplishments that endured." p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; Foner stated Reconstruction was "a noble if flawed experiment, the first attempt to introduce a genuine inter-racial democracy in the United States".&lt;ref name="Foner 2009"/&gt; According to him, the many factors contributing to the failure included: lack of a permanent federal agency ''specifically'' designed for the enforcement of civil rights; the [[Morrison R. Waite]] Supreme Court decisions that dismantled previous congressional civil rights legislation; and the economic reestablishment of conservative white planters in the South by 1877. Historian [[William McFeely]] explained that although the constitutional amendments and civil rights legislation on their own merit were remarkable achievements, no permanent government agency whose specific purpose was civil rights enforcement had been created.&lt;ref&gt;Although Grant and Attorney General Amos T. Akerman set up a strong legal system to protect African Americans, the Department of Justice did not set up a permanent Civil Rights Division until the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]]. McFeely (2002), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 372–373; 424, 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work by Nina Silber, [[David W. Blight]], Cecelia O'Leary, Laura Edwards, LeeAnn Whites, and Edward J. Blum, has encouraged greater attention to race, religion, and issues of gender while at the same time pushing the ''end'' of Reconstruction to the end of the 19th century, while monographs by Charles Reagan Wilson, Gaines Foster, W. Scott Poole, and Bruce Baker have offered new views of the Southern "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Baker, ''What Reconstruction Meant: Historical Memory in the American South'' (2007); Thomas J. Brown, ed. ''Reconstructions: New Perspectives on the Postbellum United States'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating the end of the Reconstruction Era===
While 1877 is the usual date given for the end of Reconstruction, some historians{{who|date=September 2017}} extend the era to the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Orville Vernon Burton, ''The Age of Lincoln'' (2007), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|date=September 2017}}

===Economic role of race===
Economists and economic historians have different interpretations of the economic impact of race on the postwar Southern economy. In 1995, Robert Whaples took a random survey of 178 members of the [[Economic History Association]], who studied American history in all time periods. He asked whether they wholly or partly accepted, or rejected, 40 propositions in the scholarly literature about American economic history.  The greatest difference between economics PhDs and history PhDs came with questions on competition and race. For example, the proposition originally put forward by [[Robert Higgs]], "in the postbellum South economic competition among whites played an important part in protecting blacks from racial coercion" was accepted in whole or part by 66% of the economists, but by only  22% of the historians. Whaples says this highlights, "A recurring difference dividing historians and economists.  The economists have more faith in the power of the competitive market.  For example, they see the competitive market as protecting disfranchised blacks and are less likely to accept the idea that there was exploitation by merchant monopolists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=142, 148|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

===The "failure" issue===
Reconstruction is widely considered a failure, though the reason for this is a matter of controversy.
* The [[Dunning School]] considered failure inevitable because it felt that taking the right to vote or hold office away from Southern whites was a violation of republicanism.
* A second school sees the reason for failure as northern Republicans' lack of effectiveness in guaranteeing political rights to blacks.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
* A third school blames the failure on not giving land to the freedmen so they could have their own economic base of power.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
* A fourth school sees the major reason for the failure of Reconstruction as the states' inability to suppress the violence of Southern whites when they sought reversal for blacks' gains. Etcheson (2009) points to the "violence that crushed black aspirations and the abandonment by Northern whites of Southern Republicans."&lt;ref&gt;See Vernon Burton, 'Civil War and Reconstruction,' in William L. Barney (ed.), ''A Companion to 19th-century America'' (2006), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Etcheson wrote that it is hard to see Reconstruction "as concluding in anything but failure." &lt;ref&gt;Nicole Etcheson, "Reconstruction and the Making of a Free-Labor South," ''Reviews in American History'', Vol. 37, No. 2, June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Etcheson adds:

{{quote|W. E. B. DuBois captured that failure well when he wrote in ''Black Reconstruction in America'' (1935): "The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery."}}

* Other historians emphasize the failure to fully incorporate Southern Unionists into the Republican coalition. Derek W. Frisby points to "Reconstruction's failure to appreciate the challenges of [[Southern Unionism]] and incorporate these loyal Southerners into a strategy that would positively affect the character of the peace."&lt;ref&gt;Frisby, 'A Victory Spoiled: West Tennessee Unionists during Reconstruction,' in Paul Cimballa, ed., ''The Great Task Remaining Before Us: Reconstruction as America's Continuing Civil War '' (2010), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Donald R. Shaffer maintained that the gains during Reconstruction for African Americans were not entirely extinguished. The legalization of African-American marriages and families and the independence of black churches from white denominations were a source of strength during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era. Reconstruction was never forgotten within the black community and it remained a source of inspiration. The system of [[sharecropping]] granted blacks a considerable amount of freedom as compared to slavery.&lt;ref name=Zuczek_EOTRE_A-L&gt;Zuczek (2006), Encyclopedia of the Reconstruction Era, A-L, pp. 20, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2014 historian Mark Summers argues that the "failure" question should be looked at from the viewpoint of the war goals; in that case, he argues:

{{quote|If we see Reconstruction's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be fulfilled, of a Union held together forever, of a North and South able to work together, of slavery extirpated, and sectional rivalries confined, of the permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty, backed by armed force, then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was, a lasting and unappreciated success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Wahlgren Summers|title=The Ordeal of the Reunion: A New History of Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-1wBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=2014|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In popular culture===
[[File:Gone With The Wind 1967 re-release.jpg|thumb|right]]
The journalist [[Joel Chandler Harris]], writing as "Joe Harris" for the ''Atlanta Constitution'' (mostly after Reconstruction), tried to advance racial and sectional reconciliation in the late 19th century. He supported [[Henry W. Grady|Henry Grady]]'s vision of a [[New South]] during Grady's time as editor from 1880 to 1889. Harris wrote many editorials encouraging southern acceptance of the changed conditions and some Northern influence, although he also asserted his belief that it should proceed under white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Mixon, 'Joel Chandler Harris, the Yeoman Tradition, and the New South Movement.' ''Georgia Historical Quarterly'' 61#4 (1977): 308–317. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40580412 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular literature, two early 20th-century novels by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.|Thomas Dixon]]—''[[The Clansman]]'' (1905) and ''[[The Leopard's Spots|The Leopard's Spots: A Romance of the White Man's Burden – 1865–1900]]'' (1902)—romanticized white resistance to Northern/black coercion, hailing vigilante action by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell Bloomfield, 'Dixon's "The Leopard's Spots": A Study in Popular Racism.' ''American Quarterly'' 16.3 (1964): 387–401. [http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1864&amp;context=scholar online]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[D. W. Griffith]] adapted Dixon's ''The Clansman'' for the screen in his anti-Republican movie ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915); it stimulated the formation of the 20th-century version of the KKK. Many other authors romanticized the benevolence of slavery and the élite world of the antebellum plantations in memoirs and histories published in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] promoted influential works by women in these genres.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=-xG7Dfsxya8C&amp;dq=Sara+Pryor&amp;q=Sara+Rice+Pryor#v=onepage&amp;q=Sara%20Pryor&amp;f=false Sarah E. Gardner, ''Blood And Irony: Southern White Women's Narratives of the Civil War, 1861–1937''], University of North Carolina Press, 2006, pp. 128–130.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Of much more lasting impact was the story "Gone with the Wind" in the form of a best-selling novel [[Gone with the Wind (novel)|''Gone with the Wind'' (1936)]], winner of the Pulitzer Prize for its author  [[Margaret Mitchell]], and an award-winning Hollywood blockbuster, [[Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'' (1939)]]. In each case the second half focuses on Reconstruction in Atlanta. The book sold millions of copies nationwide; the film is regularly rebroadcast on television.  In 2018 it remains at the top of [[List of highest-grossing films]] adjusted for inflation. The ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'' argues:
:Politically, the film offers a conservative view of Georgia and the South. In her novel, despite her southern prejudices, Mitchell showed clear awareness of the shortcomings of her characters and their region. The film is less analytical. It portrays the story from a clearly Old South point of view: the South is presented as a great civilization, the practice of slavery is never questioned, and the plight of the freedmen after the Civil War is implicitly blamed on their emancipation. A series of scenes whose racism rivals that of D. W. Griffith's film The Birth of a Nation (1915) show Reconstruction mainly as a time when southern whites were victimized by freed slaves, who themselves were exploited by northern carpetbaggers.&lt;ref&gt;Gone With the Wind (Film)

The '''Renault Sport Trophy''' was a [[One-Design|one-make racing]] series created and managed by [[Renault Sport]]. The series has raced with the [[Renault Sport R.S. 01]] in 2015 and 2016 as part of the [[Renault Sport Series]] (formerly World Series by Renault), but was folded after just two seasons.

==Development==
In 2014, Renault announced its intention to create a new one-make sports car championship. The company unveiled the racecar for the series, called Renault Sport RS 01, at the 2014 [[Moscow International Automobile Salon|Moscow Motor Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://group.renault.com/en/news/blog-renault/revealed-meet-race-car-renault-sport-r-s-01-unveiled-at-the-moscow-international-automobile-salon/ |title=Revealed: meet race car Renault Sport R.S. 01, unveiled at the Moscow International Automobile Salon |work=Renault Live blog |publisher=Renault |date=27 August 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RS 01, developed by [[Renault Sport]], has a [[Zytek|Gibson Technology]]-tuned 3.8-litre V6 twin-turbo engine supplied by Renault Sport's Japanese partner [[Nismo]] and a chassis built by [[Dallara]].&lt;ref name=EXP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/renault/88358/renault-reveals-renaultsport-rs-01-racer-in-official-pics |title=Renault reveals Renaultsport R.S. 01 racer in official pics |author=Madden, Luke |publisher=AutoExpress |date=27 August 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/moscow-motor-show/renault-previews-new-renaultsport-trophy-racer-latest-picture |title=Renault previews new Renaultsport Trophy racer - latest picture |author=Moss, Darren |publisher=Autocar |date=18 June 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that the championship would use a [[List of professional driver types|professional]]-[[pay driver|gentleman driver]]s combination.&lt;ref name=EXP/&gt;  The first season was held in 2015. The second and the last season was held in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/gt/news/renault-cancels-renault-sport-trophy-after-two-seasons-839816/|title=Renault cancels Renault Sport Trophy after two seasons|last=Elizade|first=Pablo|date=17 October 2016|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a support event for [[2016 European Le Mans Series]].

==Drivers and race format==
[[File:Renault Sport RS 01 cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Renault Sport R.S. 01]], the car used in the series]]
The car is driven by a professional-gentleman driver combination. Professional drivers compete for the Elite (or PRO) class championship and gentlemen for the Prestige (or AM) class. {{As of|2016}}, the race weekend consists of one 60-minute/90-minute (plus one lap) race called "endurance", where the two drivers of each car participate, and two 25-minute races (one for the Elite-class driver and other for the Prestige-class driver). There are separate qualifying sessions for Elite and Prestige to determine the grid order in the short races, and the endurance grid order is determined by a system that uses a mix of Elite and Prestige qualifying results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renaultsport.com/All-about-the-Renault-Sport-Trophy.html |title=Inside Renault Sport Trophy #1 |work=Renault Sport Series |publisher=Renault Sport |date=29 May 2015 |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
{{As of|2016}} the Renault Sport Trophy Elite-class champion is given a development programme and the chance to participate at a Nismo's [[Super GT]] test. If he is not chosen to compete in Super GT, he receives a {{euro|200,000}} award. The Prestige-class driver can opt between a {{euro|140,000}} award to step up into the Elite class or a [[LMP2]] entry at the [[Le Mans 24 Hours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renaultsport.com/The-Renault-Sport-Trophy-Year-Two.html |title=The Renault Sport Trophy Year Two |work=Renault Sport Series |publisher=Renault Sport |date=12 April 2016 |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rogaland Teater''' is a theatre in [[Stavanger]], Norway.

==Background==
The theatre building was built in 1883, on a parcel of [[Kannik]] prestegård. It was designed by architect [[Hartvig Sverdrup Eckhoff]], and had initially almost 500 seats. The building housed Stavanger Faste Scene from 1914 to 1921, and [[Stavanger Teater]] from 1921 to 1926. Several changes have been made to the building over the years, including enlargements and modifications in 1951, 1974, 1980 and 2001.&lt;ref name=s-byleksikon&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Rogaland Teater |pages=403–404 |encyclopedia=Stavanger byleksikon |publisher=Wigestrand |location=Stavanger |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogaland Teater opened 9 September 1947. A working committee had been established in 1946, and after subscription for shares and financial support from [[Rogaland]] county administration and several of the municipalities in Rogaland, the theatre was established 6 June 1947.&lt;ref name=s-byleksikon/&gt; Its first theatre director was [[Øistein Børke]], being its leader from 1947 to 1949. Later directors were [[Jens Bolling]] from 1949 to 1951 and [[Kjell Stormoen]] from 1951 to 1952.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Rogaland Teater |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |first=Svend Erik Løken |last=Larsen |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo  |url=http://www.snl.no/Rogaland_Teater |language=Norwegian | accessdate=15 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claes Gill]] was theatre director from 1952 to 1956, and during his period the theatre got a new profile, with lower ticket prices and a new marketing strategy.&lt;ref name=lyche/&gt; His interpretation of the role figure "Jeppe" in [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg's]] ''Jeppe på Bjerget'' became part of Norwegian theatre history.&lt;ref name=lyche/&gt;

The '''Rohtak sisters viral video controversy''' involves a video that went [[viral video|viral]] on the [[social media]] in [[India]] in late November 2014 and the events that followed.&lt;ref name=HarassedinPublic/&gt; The first video showed two sisters (referred to as the ''Rohtak sisters'' or the ''Sonepat sisters'')&lt;ref name=FreshVid&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonepat sisters’ case: Fresh video by sisters questions SIT probe|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sonepat-sisters-case-fresh-video-by-girls-questions-sit-probe/article1-1313685.aspx|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BraveheartsToBullies/&gt; beating three young men with a belt alleging that the men had harassed them. Soon, the video was being broadcast by television channels. The girls were praised by the media and given the nickname "[[braveheart]]s". After a second video emerged within a few days, which showed them kicking another boy, the opinions began to shift towards negative.&lt;ref name=BraveheartsToBullies&gt;{{cite news|title=Have the Combative Rohtak Sisters Gone From ‘Bravehearts’ to Bullies in India?|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/12/04/have-the-combative-rohtak-sisters-went-from-bravehearts-to-bullies-in-india/|accessdate=23 January 2015|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six women claiming to be passengers on the bus had testified in front of the police. They said it was not an issue of harassment, but a dispute over seats as the girls had been occupying a seat allotted to a sick woman. A longer unedited video had been found on the internet, in which the girls asked a third girl, who had filmed the incident on their phone, to return it. Later another man came forward and claimed that he had been similarly accused of molestation by the girls and he had to pay {{currency|20000|INR}} to have the charges dropped.&lt;ref name=SpinningFalse&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh allegations against Rohtak sisters, another man accuses girls of spinning false tales|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/fresh-allegations-against-rohtak-sisters-another-man-accuses-girls-of-spinning-false-tales/517034-3-240.html|accessdate=18 February 2015|work=[[IBNLive]]|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December, the girls offered to undergo a [[Truth serum|narcoanalysis]] test to prove that their version of the events were true.&lt;ref name=Narco/&gt; The girls had failed the [[polygraph test]] conducted on them, while the accused had passed it.&lt;ref name=PolygraphFail&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohtak sisters fail polygraph test; their `molesters` pass: Report|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/haryana/rohtak-sisters-fail-polygraph-test-their-molesters-pass-report_1549037.html|accessdate=18 February 2015|work=[[Zee News]]|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January, 2015, the girls made a complaint to Suman Dahiya, vice-chairperson of the Haryana State Commission for Women, saying that they were being pressured to withdraw the case by authorities and that they were asked obscene questions during the polygraph test.&lt;ref name=WomensPanel/&gt; In May 2015, the sisters complained to the police that someone was posting morphed pictures of them on social media.&lt;ref name=Morph/&gt;

===First video===
In late November 2014, a video went viral on the internet in India.&lt;ref name=HarassedinPublic/&gt; It showed two sisters, Pooja and Aarti from Kharkhauda,&lt;ref name=FloggingTheTape/&gt; fighting three men on a moving Haryana Roadways bus near [[Rohtak]], [[Haryana]]. According to initial reports, the sisters, final year students of Bachelor of Computer Application&lt;ref name=FloggingTheTape/&gt; in IC Women’s Government College, were waiting for the bus to return home, when two young men from a nearby village allegedly began harassing them. They also followed them on to their bus and called a third man who joined them en route.&lt;ref name=FloggingTheTape/&gt; One of the men allegedly wrote his phone number on a paper and threw it at them and asked them to pick it up. The girls changed buses, the youth allegedly followed them and continued harassing despite a female co-passenger's objections. When one of the men grabbed Aarti's neck, her sister Pooja used her belt to assault the men. The bus slowed at a speed breaker and the three men ejected the girls.&lt;ref name=FloggingTheTape/&gt; One of the girls threw a brick at the men which hit one of them. The bus continued to move and passengers did not interfere. The girls called the women's helpline but got no response. They returned home, told about the events to their parents and they filed a case at the Rohtak Sadar police station. The video was allegedly taken by a co-passenger on a cellphone camera. The event took place on 28 November 2014.&lt;ref name=HarassedinPublic/&gt;&lt;ref name=RohtakSistersBeatUp&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohtak sisters beat up three men who tried to molest them on a public bus...as their fellow passengers sat by and watched|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2855354/Rohtak-sisters-beat-three-men-tried-molest-public-bus-fellow-passengers-sat-watched.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
On 30 November, the very day of the incident, the local police arrested the three accused and charged them under Section 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage woman's modesty) and Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the [[Indian Penal Code]].&lt;ref name=HarassedinPublic&gt;{{cite news|title=Harassed in Public Bus, Rohtak Sisters Thrash Men|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/harassed-in-public-bus-rohtak-sisters-thrash-men-627846|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[NDTV]]|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BraveHaryana&gt;{{cite news|title=Brave Haryana sisters thrash 3 eve teasers with belt inside Rohtak bus as no one comes to help them|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/haryana-sisters-rohtak-police-arrests-thrash-molesters-on-bus-rohtak/1/404512.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions in support of the girls and expressive of disgust and contempt for the boys came thick and fast, beginning the same day:  Haryana Women's Commission vice-chairperson Suman Dahiya said that she would visit the locality.&lt;ref name=RohtakSistersBeatUp/&gt; Annie Raja, the general secretary of the [[National Federation of Indian Women]], praised the girls and said it was the responsibility of the bystanders to help them.&lt;ref name=AnnieRaja&gt;{{cite news|title=Annie Raja lauds Rohtak sisters for fighting back against eve-teasers|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-annie-raja-lauds-rohtak-sisters-for-fighting-back-against-eve-teasers-2039807|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[DNA India]]|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, 1 December 2014, [[Haryana]] Chief Minister [[Manohar Lal Khattar]] praised the bravery of the girls and announced a cash prize of {{currency|51,000|INR}} to be given to each of the girls at a function on [[Republic Day of India|Republic Day]]. Union minister [[Uma Bharati]] said that the all girls should respond like these girls did to harassment. Union Minister [[Nirmala Sitharaman]] praised the girls and said that the viral video showed the risk women face even in public spaces. [[Lalitha Kumaramangalam]], chairperson to the [[National Commission for Women]], praised the bravery of the girls brave and called upon the government to take appropriate action.&lt;ref name=Uma&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohtak eve teasing: Society has to change its mindset, sad that none came to their help, says Uma|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/brave-sisters-who-thrashed-alleged-molesters-to-be-honoured-by-haryana-govt/99/|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SlamsDoor/&gt;

On the same day, and hardly 24 hours after the incident, the [[Indian Army]] sources said that two of the men, who had been selected in the army physical test, will not longer be allowed to appear in the written exam. Defence Minister [[Manohar Parrikar]] said that such men had no place in the Indian Army. A local court suspended the bus driver and conductor, and sent the three men to judiciary custody.&lt;ref name=SlamsDoor&gt;{{cite news |title= Army slams door on Rohtak molesters |url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-sisters-who-thrashed-molesters-to-be-honoured-on-republic-day/article1-1292093.aspx |accessdate= 18 January 2015 |work= [[Hindustan Times]] |date= 2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2 December, TV channels had picked up the story and were visiting the girls' home to interview them.&lt;ref name=FloggingTheTape&gt;{{cite news|title=After Rohtak sisters beat up ‘harrasers’ on bus, everyone starts flogging the tape|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/after-rohtak-sisters-thrash-harassers-on-bus-everyone-starts-flogging-the-tape/99/|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IsThereMore&gt;{{cite news|title=Is there more to Rohtak sisters' story than they claim?|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/rohtak-sisters-sexual-harassment-molestation/1/404839.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls had claimed that the video was taken by a pregnant woman, who was the only co-passenger who had tried to help them. But, the woman could not be traced.&lt;ref name=FloggingTheTape/&gt; The police also said that not a single eye-witness had come forward.&lt;ref name=Uma/&gt;

On being interviewed, the father of one of accused said that all three were 19 years old and were pursuing Bachelor of Arts from the Jat College in Rohtak. Two of the boys, Kuldeep and Mohit, were returning after appearing in an army recruitment exam. One of the boys was asked by a sick old woman to buy her a ticket at the bus stop. On boarding the bus, they found the two girl occupying the seats allotted to the old woman. Upon asking them to vacate the seat, an argument began and girls started to hit them. When the boys retaliated, the girls began to capture it on video. The third accused, Deepak boarded the bus later and got caught in the fight.&lt;ref name=FloggingTheTape/&gt; Four women of Asan village, from which the accused hail, said that the boys had not harassed the girls and it was a dispute over seats.&lt;ref name=AnotherVideo&gt;{{cite news|title=Another video showing Rohtak sisters beating teaser goes viral|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/445203/another-video-showing-rohtak-sisters.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[Deccan Herald]]|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second video===
On 2 December, a second video went viral on the internet, which showed the girls hitting another boy in Rohtak. The girls claimed that the video was a month older, it was taken in HUDA park, Rohtak. The girls claimed that they were teased by some boys sitting on a bench and after one of the girls started hitting them, they fled. The girls denied that they had released the second video for publicity and said that they had not filed a case for that incident because the accuseds had fled.&lt;ref name=AnotherRohtak&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Rohtak sisters fightback video goes viral|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/another-rohtak-sisters-fightback-video-goes-viral/20141202.htm|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[Rediff]]|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls said the video was probably taken by a bystander and as they always respond to harassers in the same manner, there were probably more videos of them out there.&lt;ref name=SecondVideoEmerges&gt;{{cite news|title=Questions raised about ‘braveheart’ sisters after second video emerges|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/questions-raised-about-braveheart-sisters-after-second-video-emerges/story-fnixwvgh-1227143434743|work=[[News.com.au]]|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 5 December, six women claiming to be passengers on the bus had testified in front of the police. They said it was not an issue of harassment, but a dispute over seats as the girls had been occupying a seat allotted to a sick woman. The government put the prize on hold after the development.&lt;ref name=PutonHold&gt;{{cite news|title=Award for Rohtak sisters put on hold|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Passengers-question-Rohtak-sisters-version/articleshow/45360411.cms|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December, [[Kiron Kher]], a [[Indian Parliament|Member of the Parliament]], said that she trusted the girl's version of the story.&lt;ref name=KirronKher&gt;{{cite news|title=MP Kirron Kher backs Rohtak girls|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mp-kirron-kher-backs-rohtak-girls/article1-1293945.aspx|accessdate=7 March 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December, the girls offered to undergo a [[narcoanalysis]] test to prove that their version of the events were true.&lt;ref name=Narco&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohtak sisters demand narco test for probe|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rohtak-sisters-demand-narco-test-for-probe/articleshow/45424708.cms|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls were later given police security, after they claimed that they were being pressured by the accused to withdraw the case.&lt;ref name=SeekPolice&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohtak eveteasing: Sisters allege threat, seek police protection|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/chandigarh/rohtak-eveteasing-case-sisters-allege-threat-seek-police-protection/article1-1294050.aspx|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=7 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208072251/http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/chandigarh/rohtak-eveteasing-case-sisters-allege-threat-seek-police-protection/article1-1294050.aspx|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GetPolice&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohtak 'brave-heart' sisters get police security|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/rohtak-brave-heart-sisters-get-police-security-114121001196_1.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[Business Standard]]|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By now the accused had been released on bails.&lt;ref name=Narco/&gt; By this time, a third video had emerged which showed one of the accused being beaten by his father in a police station and being asked to apologise to the girls.&lt;ref name=GetPolice/&gt; By now another man came forward and claimed that he had been similarly accused of molestation. He had to pay {{currency|20000|INR}} to have the charges dropped.&lt;ref name="SpinningFalse"/&gt;

On 11 December, various non-Jat groups gave their support to the girls, who belong to an [[Other Backward Castes|OBC caste]], and said the government should reinstate the cash prize.&lt;ref name=CasteDivide&gt;{{cite news|title=Haryana's caste divide shows up in Rohtak sisters controversy|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/haryana/no-witness-in-favour-girls-get-non-jat-prop/article1-1295382.aspx|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accused were revealed to be of [[Jat]] caste.&lt;ref name=Defamation/&gt; By this time, a longer unedited video had been found on the internet, in which the girls asked a third girl, who had filmed the incident on their phone, to return it. A witness also came forward claiming that she saw the girls ask a third girl to make the video.&lt;ref name=CasteDivide/&gt;&lt;ref name=ManyVersions&gt;{{cite news|title=Many versions cloud Rohtak episode|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/many-versions-cloud-rohtak-episode/15462.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[The Tribune (India)]]|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December, the girls told the reporters that they had considered committing suicide due to the pressure and endless scrutiny from the society. They also said that they would pursue a [[defamation]] suit against those, who had given false testimony, to malign their image.&lt;ref name=Defamation&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonepat sisters to file defamation suit, reject claims of extortion|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sonepat-sisters-to-file-defamation-suit-reject-claims-of-extortion/17834.html|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[The Tribune (India)]]|date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RohtakAppeal&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohtak sisters appeal for justice|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rohtak-sisters-appeal-for-justice/article6689621.ece|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and investigation===
On 15 December 2014, the local court gave permission to the police to run [[polygraph test]]s on the two girls and the witnesses.&lt;ref name=Polygraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Local Haryana court allows polygraph test on Rohtak sisters|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-local-haryana-court-allows-polygraph-test-on-rohtak-sisters-2044217|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[DNA India]]|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 January, one of accused, Kuldeep, was not allotted a roll number to appear in the written exams for the army recruitment. An official of the Army Recruitment Office said that they cannot allow him to appear the exam, as the case was still under trial. Kuldeep had already cleared the physical and medical tests.&lt;ref name=AccusedDenied&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonepat sisters’ case: Accused denied permission to sit in army written exam|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sonepat-sisters-case-accused-denied-permission-to-sit-in-army-written-exam/article1-1304450.aspx|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January, the girls made a complaint to Suman Dahiya, vice-chairperson of the Haryana State Commission for Women, saying that they were being pressured to withdraw the case by authorities and that they were asked obscene questions during the polygraph test.&lt;ref name=WomensPanel&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohtak sisters say govt harassing them, approach women's panel|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Rohtak-sisters-say-govt-harassing-them-approach-womens-panel/articleshow/45935333.cms|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 19 February 2015, a local daily reported that the girls had failed the polygraph test, while the accused had passed it.&lt;ref name="PolygraphFail"/&gt;

On 4 March in reply to an [[Right to Information Act|RTI request]], the Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU) said that the sisters had sought a transfer from Kanya Mahavidyalaya, Kharkhauda to the Women’s Government College, Rohtak, by claiming that they were getting married in Rohtak. As proof they had submitted a marriage invitation which gave the date of marriage as 4 February 2014. But, while applying for classes they stated themselves as unmarried. The RTI request was filed by the one of the [[legal counsel]]s of the accused, Pardeep Malik. Sandeep Rathee, another counsel for the accused, demanded charges of fraud to filed. The counsel for the sister, A. S. Pawar, said he was unaware of this and that had no relations with the molestation case.&lt;ref name=RTIReply&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonepat sisters sought migration to Rohtak for marriage: RTI reply|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sonepat-sisters-sought-migration-to-rohtak-for-marriage-rti-reply/49783.html|accessdate=7 March 2015|work=[[The Tribune (India)]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the sisters complained to the police that someone has posted morphed pictures of them on the social media. According to the sisters, the police arrested one Nitin Kumar, a resident of Darotha village, on 17 May 2015 after much delay and reluctance.&lt;ref name=Morph&gt;{{cite news|title=One arrested for posting morphed photos of Rohtak sisters|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/One-arrested-for-posting-morphed-photos-of-Rohtak-sisters/articleshow/47322534.cms|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 May 2015, the girls met with [[Inspector General of Police]] Shrikant Jadhav to complain that the police investigation had not yet be completed, and they requested that both the original and new morphed image case be transferred to the [[Crime Investigation Department (India)#Crime Branch CID|Crime Branch]] for quicker conclusion.&lt;ref name=CrimeBranch&gt;{{cite news|title=Molestation in moving bus: Rohtak sisters demand probe by crime branch|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Molestation-in-moving-bus-Rohtak-sisters-demand-probe-by-crime-branch/articleshow/47335829.cms|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in May 2015, the sisters said in an interview with Geetanjali Gayatri of ''[[The Tribune (India)|The Tribune]]'', that they had been they attracting undue attention where ever they go. They said that their college was receiving large numbers of [[Right to Information Act|RTI applications]] regarding their attendance and grades. One of the sisters, Aarti, told the reporter that they would have been better off dead like the Moga girl, referring to the then incident in which a girl died after being thrown off of a bus in the [[Moga district]].&lt;ref name=BetterOffDead&gt;{{cite news|title=Would’ve been better off dead like Moga girl, say Sonepat sisters|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/would-ve-been-better-off-dead-like-moga-girl-say-sonepat-sisters/80208.html|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[The Tribune (India)]]|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Divya Arya of ''[[BBC News|BBC Hindi]]'' travelled to the town. Pooja told the reporter that they had no intention of fighting back in the future if they are harassed. They also said that they were asked embarrassing questions during the polygraph test.&lt;ref name=FightGoneOut&gt;{{cite news|title=India 'fightback' sisters: Has the fight gone out of them?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32579895|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, it was reported that newer morphed images of the sisters continued to appear on [[Facebook]] and [[WhatsApp]]. The police said they were investigating the case. The sisters also said that they do not trust the polygraph test results as they were leaked. The [[Superintendent of police (India)|Superintendent of Police]] of Rohtak, Shashank Anand, said that he will present the test report in court when the court asks for it.&lt;ref name=FIRMorphed&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonepat sister's case: FIR lodged against unknown persons for uploading morphed pictures of girls|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/haryana/sonepat-sister-s-case-fir-lodged-against-unknown-persons-for-uploading-morphed-pictures-of-girls/article1-1355406.aspx|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the police completed its investigation and filed the [[chargesheet]]. The 200-page chargesheet contained statements of 50 witnesses, and included the report of the lie-detector test.&lt;ref name=AllegesBias&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonepat sisters: Girls' counsel alleges bias in investigation|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/haryana/sonepat-sisters-girls-counsel-alleges-bias-in-investigation/article1-1381564.aspx|accessdate=18 August 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media reports said that the statement of the woman who shot the video was also included. She had allegedly said that no molestation had taken place and mobile phone was given to her by one of the girls. The police said the polygraph test of the accused boys was found to be credible.&lt;ref name=FilesChallan&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonepat sisters’ case: 'Allegations not reliable', police files challan in court|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/news/NAT-TOP-sonepat-sisters-thrash-boys-in-moving-bus-police-files-challan-in-court-5087013-PHO.html|accessdate=18 August 2015|work=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal counsel of the girls, Attar Singh Panwar speaking to ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', accused the police of bias in the investigation. He said the polygraph test might be fabricated by the police and suggested that the case should be handed over to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI).&lt;ref name=AllegesBias/&gt;

A '''romería'''  ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or '''romaria''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is a type of yearly, short distance [[Roman Catholic]] religious [[pilgrimage]] practiced in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and countries formerly colonized by [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. The term comes from ''romero''/''romeiro'', meaning a person travelling to [[Rome]]{{citationneeded|date=September 2017}}. The travelling can be done in cars, floats, on horseback or on foot, and its destination is a [[sanctuary]] or [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] consecrated to a religious figure honored in that day's feast. Besides attending religious services and [[procession]]s, the pilgrims may also engage in social events like singing, feasting and dancing.

==Background==
{{NPOV|date=September 2017}}
One of the most famous examples of a pilgrimage is that of [[Romería de El Rocío|Nuestra Señora del Rocío]], in which the faithful move to the Sanctuary of the Virgen del Rocío in the village of the Rocío, in [[Almonte, Spain|Almonte]], [[Huelva (province)|Huelva]]. The [[Romeria of Sant John of the Mountain]], celebrated in [[Miranda de Ebro]], is the second most important romeria in [[Spain]] behind El Rocío with more than 25,000 ''romeros''.

Another one of the most representative examples is the ''Romería de la Virgen de la Cabeza'' ([[Andújar]], [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]]), which is considered the oldest pilgrimages of Spain, and consists of the displacement of the travellers coming from all over the country to the Sanctuary of the Virgen de la Cabeza, through 33 km of Andújar, in the heart of Sierra de Andujar natural park. This celebration is held the last Sunday of April and is considered of national tourist interest.

The ''Romería de la Virgin de Navahonda'', celebrated in spring in the [[Madrid|Madrilenian]] municipality of [[List of municipalities in Madrid|Robledo de Chavela]] is representative of this tradition.

There are also pilgrimages in the Canary Islands. An example is ''La Romería de Santiago Apostol'', in [[Gáldar]].
Instead of focusing on Jesus, the floats usually praise the Virgin Mary with pictures and statues.

==The New World==
[[File:Plaza de Armas, Guadalajara, Jalisco, México.jpg|thumb|Neo-classical Guadalajara Cathedral]]

In [[Mexico]], pilgrims walk to the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan|Our Lady of Zapopan]], which this considered the third most important peregrination in the country, after the one of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgin of Guadalupe]], and the Virgin of San Juan de los Lagos. The Pilgrimage of the Virgin of Zapopan consists of a route 8 km in length, from the [[Guadalajara Cathedral]] to the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]]. It is made every 12 October, and figure of the virgin goes accompanied by more than 3,000,000 people.

In [[Costa Rica]], it is traditional to make a pilgrimage to [[Cartago,_Costa_Rica|Cartago]] on 2 August to make requests and give thanks to the ''Virgen de los Ángeles'' (the Lady of the Angels), nicknamed ''la Negrita'' due to the dark green color of the statue representing her; the statue  located inside the [[Basilica_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Angels,_Cartago|Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels]]. People all over the country and even other [[Central America]]n countries participate on foot or horseback. In 2009, due to [[AH1N1]] spreading risks, it was officially cancelled, but the statue was taken on a tour to cities instead.

'''The Starwood Festival''' is a seven-day [[Neopaganism|Neo-Pagan]], [[New Age]], [[multi-cultural]] and [[world music]] festival, taking place every July in the United States of America. The Starwood Festival is a camping event which holds workshops on a variety of subjects.&lt;ref name="Circle of Ash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosencomet.com/starwood/CircleofAsh/CircleofAsh.htm |title='&amp;#39;Circle of Ash'&amp;#39; feature article by Michael Gill in '&amp;#39;Cleveland Free Times'&amp;#39;, July 7th, 2005 |publisher=Rosencomet.com |date=2005-07-07 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[naturism|clothing optional]] event, and [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]] attendance is common.&lt;ref name="krassner"&gt;[[Paul Krassner|Krassner, Paul]] (2005).

== History ==
The Starwood Festival was founded in 1981 by the Chameleon Club, a recognized student organization at [[Case Western Reserve University]], which later founded the [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]] (ACE). It has been operated by ACE since 1983 under its co-directors, Jeff Rosenbaum and Joe Rothenberg.&lt;ref name="krassner"/&gt; It featured entertainment, public ceremonies, and classes on subjects such as [[sensory deprivation|sensory isolation]], [[Kirlian photography]], Neopaganism, [[shamanism]], [[Wicca]], [[holistic health]], [[tarot divination]], [[Thelema]], and [[past life regression]]. Among the first guest speakers and entertainers were Jim Alan and [[Selena Fox]] (founders of [[Circle Sanctuary]]), [[Raymond Buckland]], Lee Bryan Grotte (Foundation for Research in Medical Botany), and music by Chameleon and The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria.&lt;ref name="Changeling Times issue #3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosencomet.com/changelingtimes/archives/changeling%20times%2000003.pdf |title=Changeling Times issue #3 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Starwood was held July 24–26, 1981 at Coopers Lake Campground, the same site as the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]]'s [[Pennsic War]], in [[Slippery Rock, PA]]. From 1982 through 1985 it was held at Devil's Den Park in [[New Philadelphia, OH]], a former state park run by Whispering Winds Nudist Camp. In 1986 and 1987 it was held at Bear Creek Amphitheatre (part of Bear Creek Resort Ranch [[Kampgrounds of America|KOA]]) in [[East Sparta, OH]], and at Echo Hills Ski Resort in [[Logan, OH]] (on the [[Buckeye Trail]]) in 1988 and 1989. The event moved to Brushwood Folklore Center, a private campground in [[Sherman (town), New York|Sherman, New York]]&lt;ref name="Encyc of Mod Witchcraft"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft &amp; Neo-Paganism'' by James Lewis &amp; Shelley Rabinovitch (2003) Citadel Press&lt;/ref&gt; from 1990 through 2009. Since 2010, Starwood has been held at Wisteria Campground in [[Pomeroy, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Meigs"&gt;[http://www.athensnews.com/ohio/article-37306-pagan_magickal-festi.html ''Pagan/Magickal Festival Returns to Meigs This Week'' by David DeWitt, The Athens News. July 11, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The event began as a weekend festival, and grew over the years to a seven-day event. Attendance has grown from 185 in the first year to peak at around 1800 people in 2002, and has stayed between 1400 and 1600 since then.&lt;ref name="Encyc of Mod Witchcraft"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft &amp; Neo-Paganism'' by James Lewis &amp; Shelley Rabinovitch (2003) Citadel Press&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1982, Starwood has been a [[naturism|clothing optional]] event, and [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]] attendance is common.&lt;ref name="krassner"/&gt;

== Activities ==
Starwood offers approximately 150 [[workshop]]s, on topics including [[alternative lifestyle]]s, [[politics|political]] &amp; [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[activism]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[traditions]],  [[Altered state of consciousness|consciousness-altering]] technologies and substances (such as [[biofeedback]], [[Isolation tank|sensory-isolation]], [[mind machine]]s, and entheogenic [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|substances]]), [[martial arts]] &amp; movement systems, [[history]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[folklore]], [[art]] &amp; [[music]], [[metaphysics]] and [[environmentalism|environmental]] issues.&lt;ref name="Researchpubs.com"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosencomet.com/starwood/CircleofAsh/CircleofAsh.htm |title='&amp;#39;Circle of Ash'&amp;#39; feature article by Michael Gill in '&amp;#39;Cleveland Free Times'&amp;#39;, July 7th, 2005 |publisher=Rosencomet.com |date=2005-07-07 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are classes on the [[drummer|drumming]] and [[dance|dancing]] styles of [[Africa]], [[South America]], [[Ireland]], the [[Middle East]] and elsewhere. All-night drummers’ bonfires are held each night of the event in at least two locations: the "Paw Paw Patch" for larger drums such as [[djembe]]s, and the "DidgeDome" for smaller drums such as [[bongos]] and [[tabla]]s, accompanied by [[didgeridoo]]s and quieter instruments. There are concerts held every lunchtime, dinnertime, and evening, and all-night multi-media enhanced parties in an inflatable structure called the "PufferDome" and in an adjacent area called the "G-Spot". Starwood provides [[child care]] and children's classes and programs in a playground area called "Kids' Village",&lt;ref name="krassner"/&gt; and a schedule of classes and activities for teenagers. There are several areas devoted to multi-cultural ceremonies and rituals, and a non-Native [[sweat lodge]]. Friday night features a multi-media presentation, (often including [[fireworks]], [[laser]]s, [[fire dancing]], and synchronized music), and on the final night a torchlight procession leads to a huge bonfire.

== People ==
Starwood is attended by people of all ages. Followers of diverse beliefs attend Starwood, including [[Wicca]]ns, [[neo-druid]]s, [[chaos magic]]ians, [[Ásatrú in the United States|Ásatrú]]ar, [[ceremonial magic]]ians, [[Buddhists]], and those representing a variety of [[New Age]] spiritualities. According to the event organizers, the festival is designed for members of all spiritual paths to share their customs and beliefs. Some specific groups whose members regularly appear at and attend Starwood include the [[Church of All Worlds]] (CAW),&lt;ref name="krassner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Earthly Bodies"&gt;''Earthly Bodies, Magical Selves: Contemporary Pagans and the Search for Community'' by Sarah Pike (2001) University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of the SubGenius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Invented Religions: Faith, Fiction, Imagination'' by Carole M.

'''''The Guardian''''' is a Belizean [[newspaper]] and the official print organ of the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]]. It is published on Thursdays and sells for [[Belize dollar|BZ$]]1.

== UDP newspaper history before ''The Guardian'' ==
The UDP's history in the newspaper business starts with the ''Beacon'', owned by [[Dean Lindo]], which began printing in 1969 and was the main UDP newspaper (replacing ''[[The Reporter (Belize)|The Reporter]]''). The ''Beacon'' survived until 1994, but the last years of the newspaper saw it become slowly eclipsed by the new ''People's Pulse'', headed first by Zelma Jex and later by William Ysaguirre and Ann-Marie Williams. The ''Pulse'' was the main newspaper for much of the 1990s but shut down like its predecessor after a UDP election loss in 1998.

== Formation ==
With the defunct ''People's Pulse'' scheduled for shutdown after the 1998 general elections, in which the UDP lost, it was thought that the party needed a new image. ''The Guardian'' was expected to be part of that new image. With this in mind, the first issue of the newspaper rolled off the press in October 1998, even as the ''Pulse'' faced unpaid bills.

* Marketing and Sales Manager: Ann Smith

* Contributors (partial listing): Yasmine Andrews, Carlos Perdomo, Dr. George Gough, Michael Peyrefitte, Jamil Matar
** Columns w/out byline: "Bits and Pieces" (periodically), "The Searchlight", "Women Today", "Politics Today", sports section.

== Editorial stance ==
As the official print organ of the United Democratic Party, ''The Guardian'' consistently criticizes the policies of the opposition [[People's United Party]], whether in or out of government, similar to its PUP counterpart ''[[The Belize Times]]'' with regard to the UDP. 

In March 2003, after the UDP lost elections called on the 5th of the month, editor Panton claimed the election was the worst managed in Belizean history and listed a number of instances he thought were proof of the [[Elections and Boundaries Department]]'s perfidy toward the UDP. However, Panton was at the time a member of the EBD's parent body, the [[Elections and Boundaries Commission]], and was seen to have embarrassed the Commission by his action. A similar incident occurred prior to the 2003 [[by-election]] in October contested by the March loser John Saldivar. Panton editorialized in the Guardian again about alleged abuses by the EBD and earned himself its ire once more, though Saldivar won the election anyway. Both cases went into the EBD's report of events in 2003, and Panton would eventually be replaced by John Avery.

'''The Theatre''' was an [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan playhouse]] in [[Shoreditch]] (in Curtain Road, part of the modern [[London Borough of Hackney]]), just outside the [[City of London]]. It was the second permanent theatre ever built in [[England]], after the [[Red Lion (theatre)|Red Lion]], and the first successful one. Built by actor-manager [[James Burbage]], near the family home in Holywell Street, The Theatre is considered the first theatre built in London for the sole purpose of theatrical productions. The Theatre's history includes a number of important acting troupes including the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], which employed [[Shakespeare]] as actor and playwright. After a dispute with the landlord, the theatre was dismantled and the timbers used in the construction of the [[Globe Theatre]] on [[Bankside]].

==History==
The Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], not wanting to attract crowds of strangers. In 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city.&lt;ref name=Ordish&gt;{{citation |title= Early London Theatres: In the Fields | year=1899 | first= Thomas | last=Fairman Ordish | publisher = Elliot Stock | location=London | page=30 | url=https://archive.org/details/earlylondonthea02ordigoog }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later [[Liberty of the Clink|the Clink]], and at [[Newington Butts]] near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey.&lt;ref name=Ordish /&gt; The Theatre was constructed in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law, one [[John Brayne]], (the owner of the Red Lion)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowsher|first1=Julian|last2=Miller|first2=Pat|title=The Rose and the Globe—Playhouses of Shakespeare's Bankside, Southwark|year=2010|publisher=Museum of London|isbn=978-1-901992-85-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on property that had originally been the grounds of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] [[Halliwell Priory]] (or Holywell). Brayne had advanced Burbage the money needed to build The Theatre, and in return, Brayne received a portion of the profits and owned some of the property (Burbage married Brayne's daughter Ellen in 1575).&lt;ref name="Stephen 1973"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Burbage, James|volume=7|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatre was in Shoreditch, beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside the jurisdiction of civil authorities, who were often opposed to the [[theatre]]. This area in the "suburbs of sin" was notorious for licentious behaviour, brothels and gaming houses. A year later the [[Curtain Theatre]] was built nearby, making the area London's first theatrical and entertainment district.&lt;ref&gt;Mullaney, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; "When Burbage and Brayne mortgaged The Theatre, Brayne had just recently resolved another fight with one of his brothers-in-law over a different mortgage" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berry|first=Herbert|title=Brayne and his other brother-in-law|url=http://galegroup.com|work=Shakespeare Studies|publisher=Literature Resource Center|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brayne and Burbage had never written a contract, which eventually led to many quarrels concerning who spent what on getting The Theatre started.&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"&gt;Berry, Herbert. English Professional Theatre, 1530–1660. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout the building of The Theatre, Burbage and Brayne continually became indebted to each other. To fix this they constructed schemes to keep the building of The Theatre going. John Hind was one of the creditors for the construction of The Theatre, however, almost nothing else is known about him except that there was also a contract between him and Burbage/Brayne which entailed that he arrange players for them. One of their schemes was to put on plays in The Theatre while it was still being built, to raise money for further construction.&lt;ref&gt;Mateer, David. "New Light on the Early History of the Theatre in Shoreditch [With Texts]." ''English Literary Renaissance'' 36.3 (2006): 335–375. Academic Search Complete. Web. 11 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Burbage's son later claimed the Theatre as the first permanent playhouse in the London conurbation, it may not have been the first permanent theatre to serve Londoners.  The [[Newington Butts]] playhouse may have been built as early as 1575,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= English professional theatre, 1530–1660 | first1=Glynne William | last1=Gladstone Wickham| first2=Herbert | last2=Berry | first3=William | last3=Ingram | publisher= Cambridge University Press | year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-23012-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y82YJ1P5gksC&amp;pg=PA320 | page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; certainly actor Jerome Savage renewed a lease on the site on 25 March 1576, three weeks before Burbage's lease in Shoreditch.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= The business of playing: the beginnings of the adult professional theater in Elizabethan London | first=William | last=Ingram | publisher = Cornell University Press | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-8014-2671-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0PqSqgTWVEC&amp;pg=PA164 | page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newington Butts was clearly established by Lady Day 1577,&lt;ref name=Ingram170&gt;Ingram (1992) p170&lt;/ref&gt; and Wickham ''et al.'' interpret the available documents as saying that Savage was adapting an existing building constructed by Richard Hicks rather than building from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham ''et al'' (2000) p321&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of The Theatre was possibly adapted from the inn-yards that had served as playing spaces for actors and/or [[bear baiting]] pits. The building was a [[polygon]]al wooden building with three [[auditorium|galleries]] surrounding an open yard. From one side of the polygon extended a [[thrust stage]]. The Theatre is said to have cost £700 to construct, which is a considerable sum for the age.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The open yard in front of the stage was cobbled and provided standing room for those who paid a [[history of the English penny|penny]]. For another penny, the attendees were allowed into the galleries where they could either stand or, for a third penny, procure a stool. One of the galleries, though sources do not state which, was divided into small compartments that could be used by the wealthy and aristocrats. The playhouse was a timber building with a tile roof; other materials used to construct the Theatre were brick, sand, lime, lead, and iron.  Owing to a lack of paperwork not much is truly known about the Theatre’s appearance, but it has been described as an "amphitheater".&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"/&gt;

The Theatre opened in the autumn of 1576, possibly as a venue for [[Leicester's Men]], the acting company of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] of which James Burbage was a member. In the 1580s the [[Admiral's Men]], of which James Burbage's son, [[Richard Burbage|Richard]] was a member, took up residence. After a disagreement between the company and young Burbage, most of the company left for the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] which was under the management of [[Philip Henslowe]].

In 1594, Richard Burbage became the leading actor of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] which performed at The Theatre until 1597. Poet, playwright and actor William Shakespeare was also in the employ of the company and some of his  early plays had their première at The Theatre.  "At Christmas 1594 [Richard] was summoned with two other members of his company, William Kempe and William Shakespeare, to act before the queen at Greenwich Palace... Numerous performances before Queen Elizabeth followed, and Shakespeare doubtless often accompanied Burbage on many subsequent professional visits to one or other of the royal palaces."&lt;ref name="Stephen 1973"/&gt; Richard's most noted role is—which holds close to his namesake — his part as Richard in Shakespeare's [[Richard III]]. After the Burbages stripped The Theatre of its materials to erect The Globe, many of Shakespeare's plays were performed at the famous theatre in the summer and the Blackfriars house, another of the Burbage's theatres, was used as a winter playhouse.&lt;ref name="Stephen 1973"/&gt;

Towards the end of 1596, problems arose with the property's landlord, Giles Allen. Consequently, in 1597, the Lord Chamberlain's Men were forced to stop playing at The Theatre and moved to the nearby [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]]. The lease had been granted to [[Richard Burbage]] and his brother [[Cuthbert Burbage]] upon the death of their father. The lease that the late James Burbage had obtained from Allen in 1576 was to last only twenty years, but when that day did come, in 1596, Allen "stipulated that the playhouse should only be applied to theatrical purposes for another five years. This stipulation was contested by Burbage, and he and his sons began a harassing lawsuit with Allen. But before the dispute had gone very far Burbage died (in the spring of 1597) and the suit was continued by his sons Richard and Cuthbert."&lt;ref name="Stephen 1973"/&gt; The sight of the deserted Theatre prompted these lines from a minor satirist of the day:
&lt;poem&gt;...But see yonder,
One like the unfrequented Theatre
Walks in dark silence and vast solitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Skialetheia,'' [[Edward Guilpin]], 1598&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Brayne's widow, [[Margaret Brayne]], and former business partner, Robert Myles, filed a lawsuit against the Burbages after Brayne's death in 1586. When Brayne passed the Burbages halted their payments to Margaret for their debt. When they filed lawsuit, Margaret and Robert showed up at The Theatre demanding half of everything inside of it—in disagreement, Richard Burbage physically assaulted Robert Myles, and Robert and Margaret left empty handed. However, this was not the end as Myles attempted to bring down the Burbages in another two lawsuits, which both ended in failure. "The old disputes of the Theatre were overtaken by the new litigation of the Alleyns-the original owners, when the Burbages dismantled the Theatre and rebuilt it as the Globe." &lt;ref&gt;Capp, Bernard. "The Burbages At Law (Again)." Notes &amp; Queries 47.4 (2000): 433. Academic Search Complete. Web. 11 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Margaret Brayne's death there were still lawsuits that had not been settled, and in her last will and testament she left all of her prospective winnings to Robert Myles.&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"/&gt;

Though Giles Allen was the landlord John Hyde legally owned the lease to the Theatre and would return the lease to Richard and Cuthbert Burbage and Margaret Brayne for the sum of £30.  Cuthbert then went to Walter Cope, a trusted business man, and had Cope ask Hyde if Cuthbert could outright pay for the lease and own it himself.  Cuthbert paid and outright owned the lease now, ultimately squeezing Margaret Brayne out of the business.  They justified this by stating that now that the lease was in Cuthbert’s name and no longer in James’ name John Brayne had no dealings with the Theatre and therefore neither did Margaret Brayne.&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"/&gt;

This state of affairs forced the Burbage brothers to take drastic action to save their investment. In defiance of the landlord and with the help of their friend and financial backer William Smith, chief carpenter [[Peter Street (carpenter)|Peter Street]] and ten or twelve workmen, they dismantled the theatre on the night of 28 December 1598 and moved the structure piecemeal to Street's yard near to [[Bridewell]]. With the onset of more favourable weather in the following spring, the material was ferried over the [[River Thames|Thames]] to reconstruct it as [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shapiro |first=James |authorlink=James S. Shapiro|coauthors= |title=1599—a year in the life of William Shakespeare |year=2005 |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-21480-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum 1987: 206–209&lt;/ref&gt;  Giles Allen then sued Peter Street in January 1599 for trespassing on the property of the Theatre, stating that Street had no right to dismantle the Theatre and move the supplies.  He also attempted to sue Cuthbert and Richard Burbage for trespassing.&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"/&gt;

===Archaeological investigation===
In August 2008 archaeologists from the [[Museum of London]] excavating in New Inn Broadway, Shoreditch, announced they had found the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] of a polygonal structure they believed to be the remains of the north-eastern corner of The Theatre.&lt;ref name="timesonline-fiona"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article4466781.ece|title=Dig reveals The Theatre – Shakespeare's first playhouse|last=Hamilton|first=Fiona|date=2008-08-06|work=[[Times Online]]|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7544616.stm|title=The Bard's 'first theatre' found|date=2008-08-06|work=BBC News|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="first-found"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7931823.stm|title=Shakespeare's first theatre found |date=2009-03-09|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatre and Shakespeare's involvement with it are commemorated by two plaques on 86–90 Curtain Road,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Theatre and Holywell Priory | url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-the-theatre.htm | date=28 Feb 2007 | publisher=London Borough of Hackney | accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the building at the corner with New Inn Yard currently occupied by a [[Foxtons]] office. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shakespeare's ghost|last=Dunthorne|first=Joe|date=10 July 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|page=R5|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Variola Vera''''' is a 1982 [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] film directed by [[Goran Marković (film director)|Goran Marković]]. The subject of the film is the [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia]], more specifically the events related to the [[epidemic]] and the subsequent [[quarantine]] at [[Belgrade|Belgrade's]] ''General Hospital''. Although inspired by the real events, the movie features elements of [[Horror film|horror]].

The film follows the journey of a [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovar]] [[pilgrim]]  on his way back to Belgrade from the [[Middle East]]. While at a [[bazaar]], the pilgrim buys a [[flute]] from a man who is visibly ill. Upon his return to Belgrade, the pilgrim starts to show signs of illness and is transported to the city's ''General Hospital''. His disease is initially misdiagnosed and the [[smallpox]] virus starts spreading through the hospital very quickly. Once the disease is correctly identified, the authorities attempt to subdue the outbreak by declaring [[martial law]], enforcing quarantine and enlisting the help of the [[World Health Organization]]. Eventually, these measures prove to be effective in subduing the epidemic.

The '''Éden-Théâtre''' was a large theatre (4,000 seats) in the rue Boudreau, Paris, built at the beginning of the 1880s by the architects William Klein and Albert Duclos (1842–1896) in a style influenced by [[orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=French|last=Decléty |first=Lorraine |title= L'architecte orientaliste |journal=Livraisons d'histoire de l'architecture |issue=5 |year= 2003 |pages=55–65 |doi=10.3406/lha.2003.931 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lha_1627-4970_2003_num_5_1_931 |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://parisenconstruction.blogspot.com/2008/03/lettre-b-de-rue-bonaparte-rue-du.html |title=PARIS 1876-1939 : LES PERMIS DE CONSTRUIRE |publisher=parisenconstruction.blogspot.com |date=12 March 2008 |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1895.&lt;ref name=Wild/&gt;

== History ==

=== Éden-Théâtre ===
Inspired by [[Moghol]] architecture, it was inaugurated on 7 January 1883 with the ballet ''Excelsior!'' with music by [[Romualdo Marenco|Marenco]],&lt;ref&gt;Noel &amp; Stoullig, vol. 9 (année 1883), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101076201498?urlappend=%3Bseq=331 p. 299].&lt;/ref&gt;
and this was followed in subsequent years by other spectacular ballets. The theatre witnessed the single performance of the first Paris production of Wagner's ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', on 3 May 1887 (in French) with [[Ernest van Dyck|Van Dyck]] and [[Devriès family|Fidès Devriès]], conducted by [[Charles Lamoureux|Lamoureux]], which aroused enormous opposition among the Parisian public.&lt;ref&gt;Noel &amp; Stoullig, vol. 13 (année 1887), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826286?urlappend=%3Bseq=519 p. 465]; Langham-Smith 1992, p. 873.&lt;/ref&gt;
This was followed in 1888 by ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' with [[Anna Judic|Judic]] and [[Jeanne Granier|Granier]] and ''[[Le petit duc]]'' with [[José Dupuis|Dupuis]] and Granier.&lt;ref&gt;Noel &amp; Stoullig, vol. 14 (année 1888), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826278?urlappend=%3Bseq=412 p. 372] (''La fille de Madame Angot''), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826278?urlappend=%3Bseq=419 p. 379] (''Le petit duc'').&lt;/ref&gt;
The four-act version of ''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'' with [[Christian (French actor)|Christian]] and Granier, a revival of ''Excelsior!'', and the Paris premiere of [[Charles Lecocq]]'s ''Ali-Baba'' were presented in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Noel &amp; Stoullig, vol. 15 (année 1889), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826260?urlappend=%3Bseq=419 p. 385] (''Orphée aux enfers''), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826260?urlappend=%3Bseq=423 p. 389] (''Excelsior!''), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826260?urlappend=%3Bseq=426 p. 392] (''Ali-Baba).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Théâtre Lyrique===
After a ballet and a grand revue, the theatre was renamed Théâtre Lyrique in October 1890, and the first Paris performance of ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'' with [[Jean-Alexandre Talazac|Talazac]] and [[Rosine Bloch|Bloch]] and ''[[La jolie fille de Perth]]'' with [[Pierre-Émile Engel|Émile Engel]] and [[Cécile Mézeray]] were presented, but the theatre closed before the end of the year due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name=Wild/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noel &amp; Stoullig, vol. 16 (année 1890), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826559?urlappend=%3Bseq=541 pp. 509–522].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grand Théâtre ===

[[File:S.A. de l'Eden-Theatre 500 ff 1881.jpg|thumb|share of S.A. de l'Eden-Theatre from the  15. December 1881]]
On 12 November 1892 the theatre became the Grand Théâtre, opening with [[Daudet]]'s play ''[[Sapho (play)|Sapho]]'' (with incidental music by [[Mendelssohn]], [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]] and [[Massenet]]), followed by a production of ''[[The Imaginary Invalid|Le Malade imaginaire]]'' with [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]]'s music arranged by [[Saint-Saëns]].&lt;ref&gt;Noel &amp; Stoullig, vol. 18 (année 1892), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826534?urlappend=%3Bseq=307 p. 281].&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1893 saw a production of ''[[L'Arlésienne (play)|L'Arlésienne]]'' (music director [[Jean Gabriel Marie (1852–1928)|Gabriel Marie]]), ''Pêcheur d'Islande'' by [[Pierre Loti|Loti]] with [[Lucien Guitry|Guitry]] and music by [[Ropartz]], and in November that year the Société des Grand Concerts of Colonne gave ''[[Marie-Magdeleine]]'' (with [[Gabrielle Krauss]]) and ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'' (with Engel).&lt;ref&gt;Noel &amp; Stoullig, vol. 19 (année 1893), [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014826526?urlappend=%3Bseq=365 pp. 335–342].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 a foyer of the Grand Théâtre was converted into a much smaller theatre called the Comédie-Parisienne (the present [[Athénée Théâtre Louis-Jouvet]]). The colossal theatre suffered continual financial difficulties, closed in 1894, and was demolished in May 1895.&lt;ref name=Wild/&gt;
