'''Abram Aronovich Slutsky''' ({{lang-ru|Абра́м Аро́нович Слу́цкий}}) (July 1898 - 17 February 1938, [[Moscow]]) headed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] foreign intelligence service (INO), then part of the [[NKVD]], from May 1935 to February 1938.

==Biography==
Slutsky was born in 1898 into the family of a [[Jewish]] railroad worker in a Ukrainian village, [[Ichnia Raion|Parafievka]], in the [[Chernihiv]] region. As a youth he worked as an apprentice to a metal craftsman, then as clerk at a cotton plant. In the [[First World War]] he served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] as a volunteer in the 7th Siberian rifle regiment. In 1917, he joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)]].  During the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] he fought for the [[Red Army]] and afterward, in 1920, moved to the organs of the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]]/[[OGPU]], where by dint of his affable personality he rose rapidly through the ranks.

Originally, Slutsky worked in the OGPU's Economic Department engaged in industrial espionage. He received the first of two [[Order of the Red Banner|Orders of the Red Banner]] for his role in directing the apparatus which stole the process for making ball-bearings from the Swedes. In another clandestine operation, he extorted $300,000 from [[Ivar Kreuger]], the Swedish Match King, by threatening to flood world markets with cheap matches made in the Soviet Union.  In 1929, he was appointed as the assistant to [[Artur Artuzov]], head of the Foreign Department. In May 1935, [[Genrikh Yagoda]], chief of the secret police, replaced Artuzov with Slutsky.

During Slutsky's tenure, the Foreign Department was principally engaged in tracking down and eliminating the opponents of Stalin's regime, essentially emigre [[White emigre|White Russians]] and [[Trotskyists]]. Major operations included the kidnapping of General [[Evgenii Miller]], the burglary of the Trotsky archive in Paris, the assassination of [[Ignace Reiss]], and the liquidation of numerous Trotskyists and anti-Stalinists in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. Slutsky's illegals in Great Britain, [[Arnold Deutsch]] and [[Theodore Maly]], were responsible for recruiting and developing the infamous [[Cambridge Five]]. In August 1936, he participated in concocting the evidence used in the first [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]], the so-called "Trotskyite-Zinovievite Terrorist Centre." The task of extracting false confessions from [[Sergei Mrachkovsky]] and [[Ivan Nikitich Smirnov|Ivan Smirnov]] fell to him. The voluble Slutsky described his methods for "breaking-down" these [[Old Bolsheviks]] to his subordinates, [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and [[Walter Krivitsky]], who subsequently recounted these episodes in their memoirs.

In character, the defector Orlov, who worked directly under him and knew him well, thought Slutsky was "distinguished by laziness, a propensity for window dressing and by subservience to his chiefs. He was gentle by nature, cowardly and double-faced." 
Elizabeth Poretsky, who met with him frequently in 1936, thought he "was a person of many contradictions ... he would weep while telling of the interrogation of some of the defendants at the trials and bemoan the fates of their families; in the same breath he would denounce them as 'Trotskyite fascists.'" But, as she noted, he might have been stage-acting, hoping that others "would betray themselves when he feigned sympathy for the victims of the trials." Poretsky adds that he courageously interceded with his superiors to save the families of condemned bolsheviks. 

When [[Nikolai Yezhov]] assumed control of the NKVD in 1937, he began to arrest and liquidate the department heads whom he knew were close to his deposed predecessor, Yagoda. Slutsky was spared, even though he was implicated in confessions as a "participant in Yagoda's conspiracy," because Yezhov feared that Slutky's arrest would cause Soviet agents who were operating abroad to defect. Nevertheless, Slutsky's days were numbered, and his end came on 17 February 1938.

==Death==
There are two unofficial accounts of Slutsky's death. The first appeared in Orlov's ''Secret History of Stalin's Crimes'' (1953) and presumably is based on gossip Orlov heard in France or Spain in 1938. In Orlov's version, Slutsky was invited to a meeting in the office of [[Mikhail Frinovsky]], head of the [[GUGB]], in the [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]]. Shortly afterward, his deputy, [[Sergey Spigelglas|Sergei Shpigelglas]], was called into the office and he observed Slutsky slumped in a chair with tea and cakes at the table beside him. Frinovsky said Slutsky had died suddenly of a heart attack. The chief of the NKVD, Nikolai Yezhov, ordered Slutsky's body put in the main hall of the NKVD club and surrounded by an honor guard of NKVD officers. However, the embalmers neglected to cover the tell-tale spots on Slutsky's face which indicated to the mourners that he had been poisoned with [[hydrocyanic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Orlov. ''Secret History of Stalin's Crimes'', p. 231-232, 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The second account comes from Frinovsky's confession, obtained before his execution, in which he claims Yezhov ordered him to "remove Slutsky without noise." Accordingly, Frinovsky invited Slutsky to his office for a conference, and while they were talking another deputy slipped into the room and covered Slutsky's nose with a chloroform mask. Once Slutsky passed out, a second deputy, who was hiding in an adjacent office, entered the room and "injected poison into the muscle of his right arm." Frinovsky summoned a doctor who confirmed that Slutsky had died of a heart attack, which ''Pravda'' repeated in its 18 February obituary.&lt;ref&gt;Kotkin. ''Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941'', p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the witnesses to this crime survived the [[Great Purge]].

Two months after his death, Slutsky was posthumously stripped of his [[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] membership and declared an enemy of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Kotkin. ''Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941'', p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he has been rehabilitated, the Russian government's official position is that Slutsky died while working in his office.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Andrea Rocchelli''' (27 September 1983 – 24 May 2014) was an Italian freelance photojournalist. He founded the independent photographers collective ''Cesura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cesura.it/contributorsDettaglio.php?pagineCod=11544463 |title=Cesura - Andy Rocchelli |publisher=Cesura.it |date= |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Rocchelli graduated in 2009 at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] where he was awarded a master's degree in Communications Design. Subsequently, he was trained by [[Magnum Photos]] photographer [[Alex Majoli]]. In 2008, with other four photographers, he founded Cesura, a photographic collective aiming to produce independent projects.

He worked as a freelance photojournalist with a diversified curriculum. He documented the Arab Spring in Libya and Tunisia, the violation of human rights in Kyrgyzstan and Ingushetia, the conditions of migrants in Southern Italy and organized crime. His principal interest had been eastern Europe and Russia. His photos have been published by a number of journals and magazines such as ''Le Monde'', ''Newsweek'', the ''Wall Street Journal'', and ''Novaya Gazeta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cesura.it/contributorsDettaglio.php?pagineCod=11544463|title=CESURA - ANDY ROCCHELLI|website=www.cesura.it|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rocchelli died, his first book, ''Russian Interiors'', was about to be completed. The work was published posthumously by Cesura.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cesura.it/progettoDettaglio.php?pagineCod=11371930|title=CESURA - Russian Interiors|website=www.cesura.it|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Rocchelli was killed in Andreyevka near [[Sloviansk]] on 24 May 2014 while reporting on the [[war in Donbass]]. He was travelling with the human rights activist and interpreter [[Andrei Nikolaevich Mironov|Andrei Mironov]] (also died in the attack), the French photo reporter William Roguelon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.williamroguelon.com/|title=William Roguelon|last=Roguelon|first=William|website=www.williamroguelon.com|language=en|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a local driver. When they stopped to take some pictures near a railway line, the group  was hit by mortar shells from the Ukrainian front.&lt;ref&gt;Roguelon's direct testimony can be heard in this video in French: {{Citation|last=International Journalism Festival|title=The talent and courage of a photojournalist: in memory of Andy Rocchelli|date=9 April 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSVParc9HFs&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian authorities described the attack that killed both Mironov and Rocchelli as murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/07/25/who-killed-andrea-rocchelli|title=Who killed Andrea Rocchelli?|date=25 July 2017|work=euronews|access-date=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==

Rocchelli's death was investigated by the Italian authorities. An international [[Rogatory letter|rogatory]] to their Ukrainan counterpart was requested, but this action did not achieve any significant result. Nevertheless, further inquiries were carried out by the Italian prosecutor in collaboration with the investigative unit of the [[Carabinieri]] Special Operations Group. In July 2017 these inquiries led the Italian authorities to arrest [[Vitalii Markiv]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/596f4bf66.html|title=Refworld {{!}} Italian police arrest Ukrainian man accused of killing photojournalist|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=Refworld|access-date=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian citizen from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/trial-arrested-national-guard-member-vitaliy-markiv-resumed-september.html|title=Trial of arrested Vitaliy Markiv to be resumed in September - Jul. 18, 2017|date=18 July 2017|work=KyivPost|access-date=15 May 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last pictures ==
The last pictures Rocchelli took before his death precisely document the attack that killed him and Mironov and permanently injured Roguelon. These photographs testify to the duration of the shootings, the morphology of the area, and the civilian clothing worn by the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/visioni/cultura/2016/10/06/news/andrea-rocchelli-1.285200|title=Gli ultimi scatti di Andrea Rocchelli prima di essere ucciso|last=|first=|date=10 October 2016|work=l'Espresso|access-date=15 May 2018|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

An employee of the [[Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development|EU agricultural directorate]], he headed the financial administration of the [[European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund]].&lt;ref name="QuatraroMyst2" /&gt;

In 1981 he was appointed head of the Tobacco Division,&lt;ref name="QuatraroMyst2" /&gt; putting him in charge of tobacco subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].

A 1991 administrative enquiry report provided ground for suspecting him of malpractice, and disciplinary proceedings were initiated,&lt;ref name="Meijer"&gt;{{cite journal

while the case was subjected to an internal investigation by the European Commission (UCLAF). The investigation was abandoned following his death in 1993.&lt;ref name="Meijer" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33205">'''Archaeological looting in Iraq''' took place on the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-led invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The chaos following war has provided the opportunity to pillage everything that is not nailed down.  The period between April 8, 2003 when the staff vacated [[National Museum of Iraq]] and April 16, 2003 when US forces arrived in sufficient numbers to “restore some semblance of order.” Some 15,000 cultural artifacts disappeared in that time.

==History==
Looting of ancient artifacts has a long tradition. As early as 1884, laws passed in Mesopotamia about moving and destroying antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of WW1, British-occupied Mesopotamia had created protections for archeological sites where looting was beginning to become a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They established an absolute prohibition on exporting antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Museum was responsible for the sites and museums across Iraq during this time period. [[Gertrude Bell]], well known for drawing the Iraq borders, excavated many sites around Iraq and created what is now the [[National Museum of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By the mid 1920s the black market for antiquities was growing and looting began in all sites where antiquities could be found. After Iraq was independent of Britain the absolute ban on antiquity exports was lifted. Until the mid 1970s Iraq was one of very few countries to not prohibit external trade in antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Iraq attractive to looters and black market collectors from around the globe. The result of the first [[Gulf War]] was that at least 4000 artifacts were looted from Iraq sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Uprisings that followed the war also resulted in 9 of 13 regional museums being looted and burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just a preview for what would once again happen after the 2003 war. Since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], archaeological looting has become an even greater problem. Though some sites, such as [[Ur]] and [[Nippur]], were officially protected by US and Coalition forces, most were not. 

[[Saddam Hussein]] treasured his national heritage immensely and acted to defend these sites and the artifacts within them. Hussein came into power in 1979 as the fifth president of Iraq. He believed that the past of Iraq was important to his national campaign and his regime actually doubled the national budget for archeology and heritage creating museums and protecting sites all over Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn’t until his party the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Ba'ath Party]] was under pressure in the 1990s that looting become a large problem once again for Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 looting had become so rampant that the workers of the sites were even looting their own workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of Saddam's government on 9 April 2003, archaeological sites were left completely open to looting.

==Failure to protect before the 2003 Invasion ==

Before the 2003 invasion by US and Coalition forces, the US government created a post-war plan for Iraq. The US has been heavily criticized in the media and academic writings for not adequately planning protections for culture and antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lawrence Rothfield, former director of the Cultural Policy Center at the [[University of Chicago]] and associate professor of English and comparative literature, this looting of the National Museum of Iraq and of hundreds of archaeological sites around the country was not prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of war planning it was Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] who decided on a fast invasion with fewer troops, resulting in inadequate protection of buildings and cultural sites.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

American troops and commanders did not prioritize security for cultural sites around Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peacekeeping was seen as a lesser job than physically fighting in combat and President Bush’s suspension of former president Clinton’s policies for peacekeeping not only backed up this thought but also made the US’s duties to restore public order unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; American troops in Iraq didn’t trust Iraqi power of any kind meaning that instead of using and training Iraqi police, the US military took matters of security and policing into their own hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the US would act as peacekeepers to train a national army and police force. Special Forces teams would work with regional warlords to keep control of their territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing warlords to police their own areas has been credited with being a disastrous plan for the archaeological sites in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arthur Houghton had an interest and some expertise in cultural heritage and was one of the first to wonder what the pre-war plan was for Iraqi culture. He had worked in the State Department as a Foreign Service officer, as an international policy analyst for the White house and also served at an acting curator for the Getty Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late spring 2002, Houghton was approached by Ashton Hawkins, former Executive Vice President and Counsel to the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, and was asked to find out what was being done by officials to secure heritage sites in the upcoming war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houghton could find no one designated with the task of protection and preservation of culture in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There had been a secret Future of Iraq Project since October 2001, with clearance from the Pentagon. However, even under this Project no specific person had taken up responsibility of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even archaeological organizations in the US hadn’t noticed the issue until late 2002. Likewise when the US Agency for Cultural Development (USAID) met with estimated 150 NGO’s not one brought up protection of cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] had in fact, after the Gulf War in 1991, attempted to go into Iraq and assess the damage to cultural sites but they were not allowed to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO then focused, for the next decade, on reconstruction after the fact rather than prevention measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the US military, Civil Affairs (CA) forces were important to the protection of culture and, as they were mostly reservists, included experts in a variety of areas including archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to spread the expertise among fighting forces in order to warn them of cultural sites in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CA was left out of  pre-war planning until January 2003, when it was too late to be of any real significant help. The CA had to prioritize the small amount of CA troops to what they thought was necessary, which inevitably wasn’t culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CA did, however, pull the only two archaeologists in Civil Affairs to be on a culture team, Maj. Chris Varhola and Capt. William Sumner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two men, however, in the end were sent to other places when the conflict began. Varhola was needed to prepare for the refugee crises that never arrived and Sumner was reassigned to guard a zoo after pushing his advisor too hard on antiquities issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any protection of culture, sites or buildings was stopped due to the priorities of other matters. Essentially no one who had archaeological expertise was senior enough to get anything done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another branch of the US government that had interest in culture was the Foreign Area Offices (FAO). Unfortunately though, they were focused on customs and attitudes rather than archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something that was accomplished was the creation of a no-strike list created by Maj. Varhola just like two archaeologists before him had done during the 1991 Gulf War which had a great outcome of saving antiquities from bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One piece of international law that is important for this conflict is the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, this Convention states that parties in conflict must “under take to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any act of vandalism directed against, cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This provision was constructed for the parties actually in combat within the war and not civilians within their own state. As the upcoming years would prove, there are exceptions to this Convention and they would result in Americans firing on the Iraq National Museum. 

By fall 2002, post-war planning was sporadic and improvised. The cultural planning aspect needed to have leadership that it never got.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Assistant under the Security of Defense, Joseph Collins, recalls some forces spent more time working on projects that ended up not being needed like a refugee crises plan. He says he can’t remember if there was even an organizational plans to solve specific issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first known effort by cultural interests to contact US officials was October 2002. After a meeting of powerful players in culture, Houghton sent a letter asking for departments to tell forces to avoid damaging monuments, soldiers were to respect the integrity of sites, and lastly to work quickly to get the antiquities services in Iraq up and running again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] (AIA) also sent a similar letter to the Pentagon in December 2002 asking for governments to take action to prevent looting in the aftermath of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; As 2002 came to an end the media and government were only broadcasting the good done by the troops in not destroying cultural heritage themselves but not on the looting done by people in Iraq and the Americans duty to protect the antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Large scale looting ==

When the looting of the National Iraq Museum became known, experts from around the globe started planning to remedy the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuire Gibson, one of the leading archaeologists and experts on Mesopotamia explained to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) that the looted museum artifacts were only a small part of what archaeological digs around the country held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps 25 thousand of an estimated half million sites were registered. ORHA had no resources to address this problem. Gibson had suggested helicopter surveys to determine the scale of looted sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 24, 2003, looting had taken place in [[Umma]], Umm al-Hafriyat, Umm al-Aqarib, Bismaya, Larsa, and Bad-tibira, most of were unguarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most looting was by workers once employed by the now disbanded State Board of Antiquities and Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local tribe was guarding the World Heritage Site of Hatra although others were unsupervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By May 2003, international work began on the already looted museum but not on other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US military conducted a raid in May on Umma where they found hundreds of trenches with many looters all over the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, the Bush Administration replaced Gen. Jay Garner with L. Paul Bremer who was given more power and banned high-ranking Ba’ath Party members from government jobs and disbanded the remains of the Iraqi army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any guards at archeological sites were unpaid for months and they were not allowed to carry guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, instead of dealing with civilian looters, these unarmed guards were dealing with large mobs of armed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the end of May 2003, it finally became clear how badly the sites were looted when a trip sponsored by National Geographic went out to assess the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a northern and southern team to assess the post-conflict damage by land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found the famous sites such as Babylon, Hatra, Nimrud and Ur were under US military control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser known sites were completely unguarded and the responsible Civil Affairs teams didn’t even know where they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every place the National Geographic team saw, except one that was guarded by barbed wire, had been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gibson was part of the northern National Geographic team and he sent  a report to the White House science advisor John Marburger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archeological experts in both the US and Britain were waiting for invitations to go to Iraq and help. After Gibson’s report they were given invitations to create a team in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early July 2003, UNESCO revealed that looting was still happening at sites across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other military services such as Japanese and Dutch troops offered assistance but were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 8, a new security guard force known as the Iraqi Facility Protection Service (FPS) was established to protect sites all around the country in co-operation with the US military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, the State Department announced it was forming a group to assist in the rebuilding of Iraq’s cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

These announcements had no effect on the looting and illegal export of artifacts. McGuire Gibson on September 11, 2003 wrote  to a military geographer, "The continuing destruction of sites all over southern Iraq and the theft of thousands of artifacts every week, with no visible effort on part of the US authorities, makes the question of ethical behaviour by museums pointless. Your unit of the Pentagon is capable of demonstrating the location and expansion of illegal digging. Are you at least doing that much?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

[[File:Hrs 081225 sod hia.jpg|left|thumb|Recovered artifacts on display in late 2008]]

It is impossible to discover exactly how much destruction to archeological sites has happened since the 2003 invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2004, US military maps still did not show archeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologist Elizabeth Stone purchased satellite images of the seven thousand square kilometers in Iraq that contain many known sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; She counted 1,837 new holes by comparing 2001-2002 with 2003 images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looters concentrated on sites that had the most marketable artifacts. Estimates of the number of looted artifacts from 2003-2005 are from 400,000 to 600,000 items. This number is 30-40 times greater than the number of artifacts stolen from the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain alone between 2004-2006 seized 3-4 tons of plundered artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some artifacts have been recovered by accident. An archeologist was watching a home decorating show when he saw a second century stone head from Hatra sitting on the decorator’s mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illegal black market for goods became so saturated that prices in the market were  going down after 2003 according to an antiquities researcher specializing in illicit dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Revenue from looted antiquities is estimated by the Archeological Institute of America to amount to between $10 to $20 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist and rebel groups have a long history of using stolen artifacts to finance their operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of 2003, 1,900 Iraqi antiquities had been confiscated from bordering countries: 1,450 in Jordan, 36 in Syria, 38 in Kuwait and 18 in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marine Corps reservist Matthew Boulay witnessed illicit trading even on U.S. military bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flea markets authorized by the camp commanders included a booth with antiquities for $20, $40 or $100 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulay asked Gibson and was told that these artifacts were real. Gibson asked Boulay to ask the base commander to stop these sales. When Boulay informed his platoon commander he got a “cease and desist” order forbidding any more emails about the issue to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other institutes from America and around the world have contributed to protect sites in Iraq but this is still not enough. The US started teaching military personnel headed for Iraq the importance of cultural heritage and site preservation, but not how to stop civilian looting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donny George who was an employee at the Iraq National Museum was appointed to Director of Museums in 2004, and by summer 2006, a force of 1,400 guards were situated at sites around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites affected==

*[[Adab (city)|Adab]] – an ancient city plagued by hundreds of looters.
* [[Babylon]] – saw the construction of "a 150-hectare camp for 2,000 troops. In the process the 2,500-year-old brick pavement to the [[Ishtar Gate]] was smashed by tanks and the gate itself damaged. The archaeology-rich subsoil was bulldozed to fill sandbags, and large areas covered in compacted gravel for helipads and car parks. Babylon is being rendered archaeologically barren".&lt;ref&gt;([[Simon Jenkins]] in [[The Guardian]], 8 June 2007).[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hatra]] – looters with stonecutters have stolen elements of friezes and reliefs straight off the ancient architecture here.
* [[Isin]] – over two hundred looters' pits are organized around the former site of the Temple of [[Nintinugga|Gula]]; countless artifacts have been removed from the site here, including innumerable [[cuneiform]] tablets, [[cylinder seal]]s, and [[Votive deposit|votive tablets]], some of which could sell for as much as $30,000.
* [[Nimrud]] – home of the palace of [[Assurnasirpal II]] and described by the [[Old Testament]] as the "principal city" of [[Assyria]], Nimrud is one of the few sites that is militarily protected. However, weeks before the arrival of the site's US guards, looters attacked the friezes and statues with stonecutting tools, stealing images distinctly belonging to Nimrud, and thus unmistakenly known to any potential buyers to be stolen; the items have been sold, presumably, nevertheless. Those few looters that managed to break into this site despite its protection have given every indication that they know precisely what they are looking for, where to find it, and how to get at it. Like many looters throughout Iraq and across the world, they have presumably been hired to obtain specific images; this separates them from the looters who dig up and sell whatever they can find.
* [[Nineveh]] – one of the more thoroughly researched sites, experts have little difficulty identifying objects stolen from Nineveh. The site was severely looted and damaged nevertheless after the first Gulf War, and chunks of its unique and ancient friezes have appeared on the European and American art markets.
* [[Nippur]] – the great [[ziggurat]] here has only three major looters' pits cut into it, which are the first in over forty years of valuable research and excavation.
* [[Umma]] – looters descended upon the site as soon as Coalition bombing began; the site is now pockmarked with hundreds of ditches and pits. When archaeologists "tried to remove vulnerable carvings from the ancient city of Umma to Baghdad, they found gangs of looters already in place with bulldozers, dump trucks and AK47s".[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]
* [[Ur]] – one of the few sites protected by a US military presence. According to [[Simon Jenkins]], "its walls are pockmarked with wartime shrapnel and a blockhouse is being built over an adjacent archaeological site".[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]

{{confused|Bees algorithm}}
In [[computer science]] and [[operations research]], the '''artificial bee colony algorithm''' ('''ABC''') is an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behaviour of honey bee swarm, proposed by Karaboga in 2005.&lt;ref name=Karaboga2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karaboga|first1=Dervis|title=An Idea Based on Honey Bee Swarm For Numerical Optimization|date=2005|url=http://mf.erciyes.edu.tr/abc/pub/tr06_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algorithm ==
In the ABC model, the colony consists of three groups of bees: employed bees, onlookers and scouts. It is assumed that there is only one artificial employed bee for each food source. In other words, the number of employed bees in the colony is equal to the number of food sources around the hive. Employed bees go to their food source and come back to hive and dance on this area. The employed bee whose food source has been abandoned becomes a scout and starts to search for finding a new food source. Onlookers watch the dances of employed bees and choose food sources depending on dances. The main steps of the algorithm are given below.:&lt;ref name=Karaboga2005/&gt;

* Initial food sources are produced for all employed bees
* REPEAT
** Each employed bee goes to a food source in her memory and determines a closest source, then evaluates its nectar amount and dances in the hive
** Each onlooker watches the dance of employed bees and chooses one of their sources depending on the dances, and then goes to that source. After choosing a neighbour around that, she evaluates its nectar amount.
** Abandoned food sources are determined and are replaced with the new food sources discovered by scouts.
** The best food source found so far is registered.
* UNTIL (requirements are met)

In ABC, a population based algorithm, the position of a food source represents a possible solution to the optimization problem and the nectar amount of a food source corresponds to the quality (fitness) of the associated solution. The number of the employed bees is equal to the number of solutions in the population. At the first step, a randomly distributed initial population (food source positions) is generated. After initialization, the population is subjected to repeat the cycles of the search processes of the employed, onlooker, and scout bees, respectively. An employed bee produces a modification on the source position in her memory and discovers a new food source position. Provided that the nectar amount of the new one is higher than that of the previous source, the bee memorizes the new source position and forgets the old one. Otherwise she keeps the position of the one in her memory. After all employed bees complete the search process, they share the position information of the sources with the onlookers on the dance area. Each onlooker evaluates the nectar information taken from all employed bees and then chooses a food source depending on the nectar amounts of sources. As in the case of the employed bee, she produces a modification on the source position in her memory and checks its nectar amount. Providing that its nectar is higher than that of the previous one, the bee memorizes the new position and forgets the old one. The sources abandoned are determined and new sources are randomly produced to be replaced with the abandoned ones by artificial scouts.

== Artificial bee colony algorithm ==

Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is an optimization technique that simulates the foraging behavior of honey bees, and has been successfully applied to various practical problems. ABC belongs to the group of swarm intelligence algorithms and was proposed by Karaboga in 2005.

A set of honey bees, called swarm, can successfully accomplish tasks through social cooperation. In the ABC algorithm, there are three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The employed bees search food around the food source in their memory; meanwhile they share the information of these food sources to the onlooker bees. The onlooker bees tend to select good food sources from those found by the employed bees. The food source that has higher quality (fitness) will have a large chance to be selected by the onlooker bees than the one of lower quality. The scout bees are translated from a few employed bees, which abandon their food sources and search new ones.

In the ABC algorithm, the first half of the swarm consists of employed bees, and the second half constitutes the onlooker bees.

The number of employed bees or the onlooker bees is equal to the number of solutions in the swarm. The ABC generates a randomly distributed initial population of SN solutions (food sources), where SN denotes the swarm size.

Let &lt;math&gt;X_i=\{x_{i,1},x_{i,2},\ldots,x_{i,n}\}&lt;/math&gt; represent the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; solution in the swarm, Where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension size.
Each employed bee &lt;math&gt;X_{i}&lt;/math&gt; generates a new candidate solution &lt;math&gt;V_{i}&lt;/math&gt; in the neighborhood of its present position as equation below:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_{i_{k}} = X_{i_{k}}+\Phi_{i_{k}}\times (X_{i_k}-X_{j_k})  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;X_{j}&lt;/math&gt;  is a randomly selected candidate solution (&lt;math&gt;i\neq j&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a random dimension index selected from the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; , and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{i_{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is a random number within &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Once the new candidate solution &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is generated, a greedy selection is used. If the fitness value of &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is better than that of its parent &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, then update &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise keep &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; unchanged. After all employed bees complete the search process; they share the information of their food sources with the onlooker bees through waggle dances. An onlooker bee evaluates the nectar information taken from all employed bees and chooses a food source with a probability related to its nectar amount. This probabilistic selection is really a roulette wheel selection mechanism which is described as equation below:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_i=\frac{fit_i}{\sum_j{fit_j}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;fit_i&lt;/math&gt; is the fitness value of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; solution in the swarm. As seen, the better the solution &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the higher the probability of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt;food source selected. If a position cannot be improved over a predefined number (called limit) of cycles, then the food source is abandoned. Assume that the abandoned source is &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, and then the scout bee discovers a new food source to be replaced with &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; as equation below:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;X_{i_{k}}=lb_{j}+rand(0,1)\times(ub_{j}-lb_{j})   &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;rand(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; is a random number within&lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; based on a normal distribution and &lt;math&gt;lb,ub&lt;/math&gt;, are lower and upper boundaries of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; dimension, respectively.

'''Bastiaan Johan Christiaan "Bas Jan" Ader''' (19 April 1942&amp;nbsp;– disappeared 1975) was a Dutch conceptual- and performance artist, photograper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wolfs|editor1-first=Rein|editor1-link=Biography|title=Please don't leave me|date=2006|publisher=Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen|location=Rotterdam|isbn=90-6918-216-5|page=172|edition=1st - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was in many instances presented as photographs and film of his performances. He made performative installations, including ''Please Don't Leave Me'' (1969).

Ader was lost at sea in 1975, attempting to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the American coast to England sailing in a thirteen-foot sailboat. His deserted vessel was found off the coast of Ireland on 18 April  1976, offering few clues as to his fate.&lt;ref name="Here"&gt;Rene Daalder. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqJTellOG3I “Here is Always Somewhere Else: The Disappearance of Bas Jan Ader”] (2007 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born on 19 April 1942, Ader grew up in Drieborg, a small village in the Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. His parents were both [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] ministers. His father was executed in 1944 by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] for his large scale endeavors to help Jewish compatriots to escape [[the Holocaust]].

During adolescence, Ader took art classes at the [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie|Gerrit Rietveld Academy]] in [[Amsterdam]], and later in the United States during a study abroad program. Ader graduated from the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] in 1965 with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]], and from the [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1967. After graduating, he taught at various institutions, including [[Mt. San Antonio College]], [[Immaculate Heart College]], and the [[University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bas Jan Ader- Brad Spence, et al.-UCI University Art Gallery|url=http://uag.arts.uci.edu/catalogue/bas-jan-ader-brad-spence-et-al-uci-university-art-gallery|website=UCI Claire Trevor School of the Arts|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Ader created a handful of photographs as well as several short black-and-white films in which he is the sole performer.&lt;ref name="TelegraphReview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3652223/The-artist-who-sailed-to-oblivion.html|title=The artist who sailed to oblivion - Telegraph|last=Richard Dorment|date=9 May 2006|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his most famous works, ''[[I'm too sad to tell you]]'', consists of a 3-minute silent black-and-white movie of him crying, several photographs (long hair and short hair versions) and a post card mailed to his friends with the inscription "I'm too sad to tell you".&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Loehr.[http://www.collectiveexperience.org/cindy/ader.html “Bas Jan Ader: Retrospective”], New Art Examiner, March 2000; accessed 8 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;Jennifer Doyle.[https://books.google.com/books?id=j-8DAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%27m%20too%20sad%20to%20tell%20you%22 ''Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art''], Duke University Press, 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heiser&gt;Jörg Heiser. [http://www.artandresearch.org.uk/v2n1/heiser.html "All of a Sudden: Things that Matter in Contemporary Art"], artandresearch.org.uk (Summer 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Other films include him sitting on a chair on a pitched roof until he falls, one where he is hanging on a branch until his grip gives out and he falls into a stream, and a film in which he rides his bike into a canal.&lt;ref name="TelegraphReview"/&gt;

In 1969–70 he anonymously published the satirical conceptual art magazine ''Landslide'' with his friend [[William Leavitt (artist)|William Leavitt]].  The magazine featured “interviews” with nonexistent artists, such as “Brian Shitart”, and pranks such as “expandable sculpture” which was five [[Foam peanut|packing peanuts]] in an envelope. Although satirical of conceptual art, the magazine itself is considered a work of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OZhNRP-wfkAC&amp;pg=PA272 Gwen Allen “Artists' Magazines: An Alternative Space for Art”], MIT Press at books.google.com; accessed 8 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margoleavingallery.com/assets/uploaded/articles/leavitt_artus.pdf Erik Bluhm, “Minimalism's Rubble: On William Leavitt's and Bas Jan Ader's Landslide (1969-70), ''ArtUS''], November 2005, pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 he made the work 'In search of the miraculous (One night in Los Angeles)', a series of photographs showing a lonely figure wandering through the night in L.A, searching everywhere with a torchlight. It was the first part of a [[triptych]]. The second part would be the record of his Atlantic crossing (see below), the third part a similar night time search somewhere in the Netherlands, again to be recorded in a series of photographs.
He had arranged for a choir to sing [[sea shanties]] at a gallery in [[Los Angeles]] before his departure from [[Cape Cod]]. A similar performance was planned upon his arrival in a museum in [[Groningen]], Netherlands.
Due to his loss at sea, the triptych was never completed.&lt;ref name="TelegraphReview"/&gt;  The title “In Search of the Miraculous” was a reference to [[P.D. Ouspensky]]'s mystical book ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Constance Lewallen and Phong Bui.

==Disappearance==
On 9 July 1975, Ader set off in a {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} modified “Guppy 13” [[pocket cruiser]] named ''Ocean Wave'', to make his [[Single-handed sailing|single-handed]] west–east crossing of the [[North Atlantic]]. He estimated that the voyage should take him some two and a half months. His unmanned boat was found nine months after he had set sail, floating nearly vertically in the water, bow down, 200 [[nautical mile]]s (360&amp;nbsp;km) due west of [[Land's End]], 100 nautical miles SW of [[Ireland]]. ''Ocean Wave'' was found by Spanish fishermen who took her to [[A Coruña]] from where she was stolen somewhere between 18 May and 7 June 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hyperallergic.com/336146/in-search-of-bas-jan-ader-the-artist-who-disappeared-at-sea/ |title=In Search of Bas Jan Ader, the Artist Who Disappeared at Sea}} Hyperallergic, 30 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown how Ader met his death. It is the source of much speculation. Sightings of him and his boat off the American East Coast and the [[Azores]] are unconfirmed. Ader was an accomplished sailor, having been one of a two-handed crew, sailing a yacht from [[Morocco]] to [[California]] in 1962-63. His brother Erik, an experienced ocean sailor, thinks that the fixed point on the boat to which his [[Sailing|life line]] was attached was ripped out when he fell overboard in heavy weather. His conclusion is based on interviews with people in [[Spain]] who saw his retrieved boat before it was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://new-documents.org/books/bas-jan-ader-discovery-file|title=Bas Jan Ader: Discovery File 143/76|author=Koos Dalstra, Marion van Wijk|publisher=New Documents|isbn=978-1-927354-10-0|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ader's mother, Johanna Adriana Ader-Appels, wrote the poem "From the Deep Waters of Sleep" on 12 October 1975, after having what she described as a [[premonition]] of his death:{{quote|"From the deep waters of sleep I wake up to consciousness.&lt;br&gt;In the distance I hear a train rumbling in the early morning.&lt;br&gt;It is going East and passes the border. Then it will stop."

"I feel my heart beating too. It will go on beating for some time.&lt;br&gt;Then it will stop.&lt;br&gt;I wonder if the little heart that has beaten with mine, has stopped.&lt;br&gt;When he passed the border of birth, I laid him at my breast,&lt;br&gt;Rocked him in my arms.&lt;br&gt;He was very small then."

"A white body of a man, rocked in the arms of the waves,&lt;br&gt;Is very small too."

"What are we in the infinity of ocean and sky?&lt;br&gt;A small baby at the breast of eternity."

"Have you heard of happiness&lt;br&gt;Springing from a deep well of sorrow?&lt;br&gt;Of love, springing from pain and despondency, agony and death?&lt;br&gt;Such is mine."

Psalm 30:2}}&lt;ref&gt;http://talesofla.tumblr.com/post/50257102086/from-the-deep-waters-of-sleep-a-poem-written&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions, reception and impact==
In 1961, Ader exhibited his works at three galleries in Washington DC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erik Beenker|authorlink1=The man who wanted to look beyond the horizon|editor1-last=Wolfs|editor1-first=Rein|title=Please don't leave me|date=2006|publisher=Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen|location=Rotterdam|isbn=90-6918-216-5|page=14|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a positive review in ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfs ed. 2006 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He became a minor sensation, being interviewed by ''The Voice of America'' and by the press in his native Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfs ed. 2006, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he gained his Master of Fine Arts with his project ''Implosion'' at Claremont Graduate School.&lt;ref name="Wolfs ed. 2006, p. 159"&gt;Wolfs ed. 2006, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime, Ader had solo exhibitions at the Chouinard Art School, Los Angeles (1970), the Pomona College Museum of Art (1972), and the galleries [[Art &amp; Project]], Amsterdam (1972), [[:de:Kabinett für Aktuelle Kunst|Kabinett für Aktuelle Kunst]], Bremerhaven, Germany (1972, 1974) and the [http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/locations/claire-s-copley-gallery/ Claire S. Copley Gallery], blogs.getty.edu; accessed 8 April 2015.&lt;ref name="Wolfs ed. 2006, p. 159"/&gt;

Ader held a two-person exhibition with [[William Leavitt (artist)|William Leavitt]] at the Nova Scotia School of Art and Design (1972), a conceptual hotbed at the time, as well as a number of group exhibitions in Europe and the US with such artists as Leavitt, [[Ger van Elk]], [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Jack Goldstein]], [[Allen Ruppersberg]], [[John Baldessari]], and [[Marcel Broodthaers]] among others. His work was also included in the important international survey exhibitions ''Prospekt ’71: Projektion'' at the [[Kunsthalle Düsseldorf]] (1971), and ''Sonsbeek ’71'', Groningen, Holland. (1971).&lt;ref name="Wolfs ed. 2006 p.160"&gt;Wolfs ed. 2006, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his disappearance, Ader's work has been exhibited in solo exhibitions at institutions worldwide including the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]] (1988), the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], Rotterdam (1993, 2006), [[Kunstverein München]], Munich (1994, 2000), [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] (1994), [[:de:Kunstverein Braunschweig|Kunstverein Braunschweig]], Germany (2000), [[Portikus]], Frankfurt (2003), and the [[Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo]], Mexico City (2004).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Ader's first retrospective in the United States took place in 1999 at the University of California, Irvine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hainley|first1=Bruce|title=Legend of the Fall|journal=Artforum|date=March 1999|volume=XXXVII|issue=7|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and travelled to two other venues; the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery, University of California, Santa Cruz, and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside.  It was curated by Brad Spence&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140314134319/http://sweeney.ucr.edu/exhibitions/ader/index.html Sweeney Art Gallery Ader announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; with a catalogue including contributions by [[Thomas E. Crow|Thomas Crow]], Jan Tumlir, and Spence. In 2006, [[Camden Arts Centre]], London held a European retrospective of his works which travelled to the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], Rotterdam and the [http://www.kunsthallebasel.ch/en Kunsthalle, Basel, Switzerland].&lt;ref name="Wolfs ed. 2006 p.160"/&gt;

More recent solo exhibitions include ''[http://cgac.xunta.es/EN/exposicion-detalle/9/in-search-of-the-miraculous-thirty-years-later#ad-image-0 In Search of the Miraculous: 30 Years Later],'' [[:es:Centro Gallego de Arte Contemporáneo|Centro Gallego de Arte Contemporáneo]], Santiago de Compostela, Spain (2010), ''Suspended Between Laughter and Tears,'' Pitzer Art Galleries, [[Pitzer College]], Claremont CA (2010), which travelled to the Museo de Arte Zapopan, Mexico, and the artist's first Italian retrospective ''[http://www.mambo-bologna.org/files/documenti/archiviocomunicatiENG/PK_Bas%20Jan%20Ader_ENG.pdf Tra Due Mondi],'' [[Bologna Museum of Modern Art|MAMbo, Museo d'Arte Moderna di Bologna]], Bologna, Italy (2013).  Metro Pictures, NYC, had a mini - survey of his work during summer, 2016. So did Simon Lee Gallery in London.

Erika Yeomans' conceptual documentary ''In Search of Bas Jan's Miraculous'' (1998, 40 minutes, mixed media) on Ader's life and art was featured on ''[[This American Life]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/20/from-a-distance "From a Distance"], ''This American Life'', 27 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Ader, digital movie pioneer [[Rene Daalder]] proposed a new genre of art called “Gravity Art” in 2008.  Gravity Art is based on the idea of gravity as a medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2003-2008.telic.info/gravity-in-art.yeah.html “Gravity Art”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616154752/http://2003-2008.telic.info/gravity-in-art.yeah.html |date=June 16, 2013 }}, Telic Arts Exchange, 26 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ader is seen as the founder of this genre for the themes in his work of falling and letting go.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.castor-und-pollux.de/2009/07/bas-jan-ader-und-die-schwerkraft/&amp;usg=ALkJrhhyBwDellx3NjBZ66ZULJ6_dyjjGA Matthias Planitzer, “Bas Jan Ader and gravity on the art of letting go”, Castor &amp; Pollux, 26 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Here Is Always Somewhere Else]]'' is a 2007 documentary film about the life and work of Bas Jan Ader. As seen through the eyes of fellow emigrant filmmaker [[Rene Daalder]], the picture becomes an overview of contemporary art films, featuring work from artists [[Tacita Dean]], [[Rodney Graham]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Ger van Elk]], [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]], [[Wim T. Schippers]], [[Chris Burden]], [[Fiona Tan]], [[Pipilotti Rist]] and many others.

Ader was one of the invited artists of the 2017 57th [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/exhibition/artists/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121129/http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/exhibition/artists/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Borg''' are a [[Fictional race|fictional alien group]] that appear as recurring [[antagonist]]s in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. The Borg are [[Cyborg|cybernetic organisms]], linked in a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] called "the Collective". The Borg co-opt the technology and knowledge of [[List of Star Trek races|other alien species]] to the Collective through the process of "[[#Assimilation|assimilation]]": forcibly transforming individual beings into "drones" by injecting [[nanomachine|nanoprobes]] into their bodies and surgically augmenting them with cybernetic components. The Borg's ultimate goal is "achieving perfection".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Star Trek: First Contact&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/star-trek-borg-biggest-plot-holes-make-no-sense/&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from being recurring antagonists in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' television series, they are depicted as the main threat in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. In addition, they played major roles in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' series and serve as the way home to the [[Alpha Quadrant]] for the isolated Federation [[starship]] [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']]. The first encounter between humans and the Borg is depicted in the 2nd season of the series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' in the episode "Regeneration" in which the phrase "you will be assimilated; resistance is futile" is heard by the crew of the [[Enterprise (NX-01)|''Enterprise'']] for the first time.

The Borg have become a symbol in [[popular culture]] for any [[juggernaut]] against which "resistance is futile".

==Depiction==

The Borg are cyborgs, having outward appearances showing both mechanical and biological body parts. Individual Borg are referred to as drones and move in a robotic, purposeful style ignoring most of their environment, including beings not deemed a threat. Borg commonly have one eye replaced with a sophisticated ocular implant. Borg usually have one arm replaced with a prosthetic one, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have different roles, the arm may be specialized for a myriad of purposes such as medical devices, scanners, and weapons. Borg have flat, white skin, giving them an almost [[zombie]]-like appearance.

Some Borg have been shown to be far stronger than humans; able to easily overpower most humans and similar species. Typical Borg have never been seen to run. Borg are resistant to phaser fire, many having personal shielding which adapts to phaser fire. In various episodes, phasers tend to become ineffective after time as the Borg is able to adapt to the phaser frequency. Later attempts to [[modulation|modulate]] phaser frequencies have limited success. Borg shields have not been seen to protect against non-energy weapons such as projectile or melee weapons. 

Borg possess a "cortical node" which controls other implanted cybernetic devices within a Borg's body, and is most often implanted in the forehead above the retained organic eye. If the cortical node fails, the Borg eventually dies. Successful replacement of the node can be carried out on a Borg vessel.

===Borg Collective===
[[File:Borg dockingstation.jpg|thumb|An occupied Borg "alcove" prop on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum]]
Borg civilization is based on a hive or [[Group mind (science fiction)|group mind]] known as the Collective. Each Borg drone is linked to the collective by a sophisticated [[Subspace (Star Trek)#Subspace|subspace]] network that ensures each member is given constant supervision and guidance. The mental energy of the group consciousness can help an injured or damaged drone heal or regenerate damaged body parts or technology. The collective consciousness not only gives them the ability to "share the same thoughts", but also to adapt with great speed to tactics used against them.&lt;ref&gt;"The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II" (''TNG'')&lt;/ref&gt; Drones in the Collective are never seen speaking, but a collective "voice" is sometimes transmitted to ships.

==="Resistance is futile"===
Individual Borg rarely speak, though they do send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that "resistance is futile", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be [[#Assimilation|assimilated]] and its "biological and technological distinctiveness" will be added to their own. The exact phrasing varies and evolves over the various series episodes and film. 

The complete phrase used in ''Star Trek: First Contact'' is:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 Star Trek - First Contact (1996)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929181255/http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 |date=September 29, 2013 }} Moviesoundclips.net. Rikeromega3 Productions 1999-2013. Retrieved September 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nanoprobes===
Nanoprobes are microscopic machines that inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes perform the function of maintaining the Borg cybernetic systems, as well as repairing damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed, as well as protecting them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each about the size of a human [[red blood cell]], travel through the victim's bloodstream and latch on to individual [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular [[DNA]], altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body such as electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin. In "[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]", Seven of Nine states that the Borg assimilated the nanoprobe technology from "Species 149". In addition, the nanoprobes work to maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, allowing regenerative capabilities.

Though used by the Borg to exert control over another being, reprogrammed nanoprobes were used by the crew of the starship ''Voyager'' in many instances as medical aids. In one instance, the probes were used to revive crewman [[Neelix]] 18 hours, 49 minutes, and 13 seconds after death by repairing his body.

The capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the ''Voyager'' episode "[[Drone (Star Trek: Voyager)|Drone]]", where [[Seven of Nine]]'s nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter which uses technology from the 29th century, creating a 29th-century drone existing outside the Collective, with capabilities far surpassing that of the 24th-century drones.

The Borg do not try to immediately assimilate any being with which it comes to contact; in fact, Borg drones tend to completely ignore beings that are identified as too weak to be a threat and too inferior to be worth assimilating. Captain Picard and his team walk safely past a group of Borg drones in a scene from the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' because they are unarmed, while the drones fulfill a programmed mission. In the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode "[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]",  Seven of Nine told Neelix that the Kazon were "unworthy" of assimilation and would only detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection.

===Travel===
The Borg are a [[spacefaring]] race, and their primary interstellar transport is known as a "Borg Cube" due to its shape. A cube was first seen in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Q Who? (TNG episode)|Q Who?]]" in 2365. Common capabilities of cubes include high speed [[Warp drive|warp]] and [[Warp drive#transwarp|transwarp]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|drives]], self-regeneration and multiple-redundant systems, [[adaptation|adaptability]] in combat, and various [[directed-energy weapon|energy]] weapons as well as [[tractor beam]]s and cutting beams. Additionally, different types and size of Cubes have been observed as well as Borg Spheres and some smaller craft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startrek.com/database_article/borg-cube&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most other ''Star Trek'' races, the Borg also have [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] capability.

===Assimilation===
'''Assimilation''' is the process by which the Borg integrate beings, cultures, and technology into the Collective. "You will be assimilated" is one of the few on-screen phrases employed by the Borg when communicating with other species. The Borg are portrayed as having found and assimilated thousands of species and billions to trillions of individual life-forms throughout the [[galaxy]]. The Borg designate each species with a number assigned to them upon [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]]; humanity being 'Species 5618'.

When first introduced, the Borg are said to be more interested in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders that have assimilated starships, planets, and entire societies to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the [[Kazon]], to be technologically inferior and not worthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard a Borg Cube in "Q Who?" shows that the Borg will even assimilate children. The Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones.

[[File:Picard as Locutus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patrick Stewart]] as Locutus, the assimilated [[Jean-Luc Picard]]]]
In their second appearance, "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]", they capture and assimilate Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] into the Collective, creating Locutus of Borg (meaning "he who speaks", in Latin).

The method of assimilating individual life-forms into the Collective has been represented differently over time. When we see the Borg in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', assimilation is through abduction and then surgical procedure. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' and ''Star Trek: Voyager'', assimilation is through injection of [[Nanorobotics|nanoprobes]] into an individual's [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] via a pair of tubules that spring forth from a drone's hand. Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact. After assimilation, a drone's race and gender become "irrelevant". After initial assimilation through injection, Borg are surgically fitted with cybernetic devices. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' an assimilated crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.

The Borg also assimilate, interface, and reconfigure technology using these tubules and nanoprobes. However, in ''Q Who?'' we see a Borg apparently trying to assimilate, probe or reconfigure a control panel in engineering using an energy interface instead of nanoprobes. 

Some species, for various stated reasons, are able to resist assimilation by nanoprobe. [[Species 8472]] is the only race shown to be capable of completely rejecting assimilation attempts. Other species, such as the [[Hirogen]], have demonstrated resistance to assimilation as well as [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr Phlox]] who was able to partially resist the assimilation process in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Star Trek: Voyager'', season 3 episode 26 and Season 4 Episode 1 (Scorpion Parts 1 &amp; 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy that was lacking during the first season of ''TNG''; the [[Klingon]]s were allies and the [[Romulan]]s mostly absent. The [[Ferengi]] were originally intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance and devotion to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] accumulation by [[free enterprise]] failed to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the ''TNG'' and ''Voyager'' eras of ''Star Trek''. In ''Voyager'' episode "[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]", even Q tells his son "don't provoke the Borg."

In the text commentary to the [[Special edition|collector's edition]] of ''Star Trek: First Contact'', Michael Okuda revealed that ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' (''TNG'') writers began to develop the idea of the Borg as early as the Season 1 episode, "[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]", which introduced a coercive, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] life form that took over key Federation personnel. Plans to feature the Borg as an increasingly menacing threat were subsequently scrapped in favor of a more subtle introduction, beginning with the mystery of missing colonies on both sides of the Neutral Zone in "[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]" and culminating in the encounter between Borg and the ''Enterprise'' crew in "[[Q Who?]]".

==Borg Queen==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Data (Star Trek)]] --&gt;
[[File:Borg Queen 2372.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Krige]] as the Borg Queen in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'']]
Before the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996), the Borg exhibited no hierarchical command structure. ''First Contact'' introduced the Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film (referring to herself as “I am the Borg. I am the Collective.") but is named Borg Queen in the closing credits. The Queen is played by [[Alice Krige]] in this film and in the 2001 finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', "[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part episodes "[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]" (1999) and "[[Unimatrix Zero (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unimatrix Zero]]" (2000), but was portrayed by [[Susanna Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.trektoday.com/news/150500_03.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not all of these appearances represent exactly the same Queen is never confirmed. In ''First Contact'', the Borg Queen is heard during a flashback of Picard's former assimilation, implying that she was present during the events of "Best of Both Worlds".

The Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the Collective, who brings "order to chaos", referring to herself as "we" and "I" interchangeably. In ''First Contact'', the Queen's dialogue suggests she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence, not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an individual. This sentiment is contradicted by ''Star Trek: Voyager'', where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one instance even overriding the Collective. The introduction of the Queen radically changed the canonical understanding of the Borg function, with the authors of ''The Computers of Star Trek'' noting "It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members."&lt;ref&gt;Lois H. Gresh &amp; Robert Weinberg, ''The Computers of Star Trek''. New York: Basic Books (1999): 147. "It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members."&lt;/ref&gt;  ''First Contact'' writers [[Brannon Braga]] and [[Ronald D. Moore]] have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had initially written the film with drones, but then found that it was essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with beyond mindless drones.

==Borg appearances==

===''The Next Generation''===
The Borg first appear in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' second-season episode "[[Q Who?]]", when the omnipotent life-form [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] hurls the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] across the galaxy to challenge [[Jean-Luc Picard]]'s assertion that his crew is ready to face the galaxy's dangers and mysteries. The ''Enterprise'' crew is overwhelmed by the Borg, and Picard begs for and receives Q's help in returning the ship to its previous coordinates. 

The Borg next appear in ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s third-season finale and fourth-season premiere, "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]". Picard is abducted and assimilated by the Borg and transformed into [[Jean-Luc Picard|Locutus]], the Latin for "he who speaks". Picard's knowledge of Starfleet's strengths and strategies is gained by the Collective, and the single cube destroys the entire Starfleet armada at [[Battle of Wolf 359|Wolf 359]]. The ''Enterprise'' crew manages to capture Locutus, gain information through him which allows them to destroy the cube, and then reverse the assimilation process.

In the fifth-season episode "[[I, Borg]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew rescues an adolescent Borg they name "[[List of Star Trek characters (G–M)#H|Hugh]]". The crew faces the moral decision of whether or not to use Hugh (who begins to develop a sense of independence as a result of a severed link to the Collective) as a means of delivering a devastating computer virus to the Borg, or return to the Borg with his individuality intact.&lt;ref name="TNGcompanion"&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|author=Nemeck, Larry|isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They decide to return him without the virus, but in the sixth-season episode "[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]", a group of rogue Borg who had "assimilated" individuality through Hugh fall under the control of the android [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]], the "older brother" of Data. Lore also corrupts Data through the use of an "emotion chip", but in the end, Data's ethical subroutines are restored and he manages to deactivate Lore. Data recovers the emotion chip and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh.

===''First Contact''===
The Borg return as the antagonists in the ''Next Generation'' film, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. After again failing to assimilate Earth by a direct assault in the year 2373, the Borg travel back in time to the year 2063 to try to stop [[Zefram Cochrane]]'s first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], change the timeline, and erase Starfleet from existence. The [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] crew follows the Borg back in time and restores the original timeline. ''First Contact'' introduces the [[#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]].

===''Deep Space Nine''===
The only screen appearance made on this series was in the premiere episode ''[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]''. [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) was an officer on the USS ''Saratoga'', one of the ships in the Starfleet armada dispatched to confront the Borg at Wolf 359. The ''Saratoga'' is destroyed by the Borg, killing Sisko's wife, Jennifer. During that episode, Sisko's meeting with Picard is tense as he blames Picard for the actions of Locutus. Throughout the remainder of the series, references to the Borg are made occasionally, including the design of their ship, [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']], and the battle from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' being used as a plot point in Season 5 when Starfleet is spread too thin to deal with a Dominion incursion.

===''Voyager''===
The Borg make frequent appearances in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', which takes place in the Delta Quadrant. The Borg are first seen by ''Voyager'' in the third-season episode "[[Blood Fever (Star Trek: Voyager)|Blood Fever]]" in which [[Chakotay]] discovers the body of what the local humanoids refer to as "the Invaders"; which turns out to be the Borg. In "[[Scorpion (Star Trek: Voyager)|Scorpion]]", the Borg are engaged in a war of attrition against [[Species 8472]], whose biological defences are a match for the Borg's nanoprobes. In one of the few instances of the Borg negotiating, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space, the ''Voyager'' crew devises a way to destroy the otherwise invulnerable Species 8472. A Borg drone, [[Seven of Nine]], is dispatched to ''Voyager'' to facilitate this arrangement. After successfully driving Species 8472 back into their fluidic space, Seven of Nine is severed from the Collective and becomes a member of ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series. 

In the fifth season, we see the Borg in "[[Drone (Star Trek: Voyager)|Drone]]", where an advanced Borg drone is created when Seven of Nine's nanoprobes are fused with [[Doctor (Star Trek)|the Doctor]]'s mobile emitter in a transporter accident, "[[Infinite Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)|Infinite Regress]]", and "[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]", where ''Voyager'' steals and uses a transwarp coil to travel 20,000 [[light-year]]s before it burns out.

In the sixth season episode, "[[Collective (Star Trek: Voyager)|Collective]]", the crew of ''Voyager'' encounter a damaged cube that is holding Tom Paris, Neelix, Harry Kim and Chakotay hostage. With all the adult drones dead, the ship is run by five Borg children who are saved by ''Voyager'' and deassimilated.

In the seventh season we see the Borg in "[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]", where Q's son brings Borg onto ''Voyager'' and in the series finale, "[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]", where Admiral Janeway from the future tries to bring ''Voyager'' back to Earth using a Borg transwarp hub. During this episode, Janeway infects the Borg with a [[Cordotomy|neurolytic]] pathogen which infects the collective and kills the Queen.

===''Enterprise''===
In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]", the remnants of the destroyed sphere from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' are discovered in the [[Arctic]] along with two frozen drones. The Borg steal a research ship and send a transmission toward the Delta Quadrant before they are destroyed.

==Origin==
The origin of the Borg is never made clear, though they are portrayed as having existed for hundreds of thousands of years (as attested by [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] and the Borg Queen). In ''Star Trek: First Contact'', the Borg Queen merely states that the Borg were once much like humanity, "flawed and weak", but gradually developed into a partially synthetic species in an ongoing attempt to evolve and perfect themselves.

In ''TNG'''s "Q Who?", Guinan mentions that the Borg are "made up of organic and artificial life [...] which has been developing for [...] thousands of centuries." In the later episode of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', "[[Dragon's Teeth (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dragon's Teeth]]", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before he and his people were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier (1482), the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed to see that the Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. [[Seven of Nine]] comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is.

===[[Star Trek canon|Non-canon origin stories]]===
''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'' speculates that a connection could exist between the Borg and ''[[V'ger]]'', the vessel encountered in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. This idea of a connection is advanced in [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''The Return''. The connection was also suggested in a letter included in ''[[Starlog]]'' no. 160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called "the Preservers", which [[Spock]] had suggested in the [[Star Trek Original Series|original series]] episode "[[The Paradise Syndrome]]" might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. It was confirmed in the ''TNG'' episode "[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]" that an ancient species seeded hundreds, if not thousands of planets with their DNA, creating the Humans, Vulcans, Klingons, Romulans, [[Cardassian]]s, and many more.

The extra section of the game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'' contains the supposed "Origin of the Borg", which tells the story of ''V'ger'' being sucked into a [[black hole]]. ''V'ger'' was found by a race of living machines which gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all [[carbon-based life]] an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of ''V'ger'''s purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective [[consciousness]]. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. With thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve ''V'ger''.

In the graphic novel ''Star Trek: The Manga'', the Borg resulted from an experiment in medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository [[satellite]] containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and [[DNA]] of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the [[Theory of Relativity|relativistic]] state of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting them as part of the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' under the command of [[James T. Kirk]]. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the ''Enterprise'' with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion similar to assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt nanomachine programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the [[manga]] Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen, stating, "Resistance is futile."

In the novel ''Lost Souls'' (the third book in the ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'' trilogy), the Borg are revealed to be the survivors of the Caeliar city Mantilis. Thrown across the galaxy in the [[Galactic quadrant#Delta Quadrant|Delta Quadrant]] and back in time to about 4500 BC by the destruction of Erigol at the climax of ''Gods of Night'', the first book in the trilogy, a group of human survivors from the starship ''Columbia'' [[Home (Star Trek: Enterprise)|(NX-02)]] and Caeliar scientists try to survive in a harsh arctic climate. Most of the human survivors die of exposure, while several Caeliar are absorbed into their race's gestalt to give life to the others in their group mind. The Caeliar offer the remaining humans a merging of human and Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results in the creation of the first Borg. The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were–albeit accidentally–involved in the creation of the Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.

==Other Non-canon media appearances==
In the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Probe'', which takes place following the events of ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', the Borg are mentioned obliquely in communication with the whale-probe as spacefaring "mites" (the whale-probe's term for humanoid races) who traveled in cubical and spherical spacefaring vessels; the Borg apparently attacked the whale-probe and damaged its memory in some fashion before the events of the film.

In the ''Star Trek'' Game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'', the Borg are featured prominently throughout the ''Enterprise'' and ''TOS'' era's before becoming a major threat in the ''TNG'' era. In unlockable motion-comics that are unlocked after completing each era, it is revealed that the Vulcan T'Uerell experimented on Borg corpses left behind from the ''Enterprise'' episode "Regeneration", and became assimilated. It wasn't until the end of the ''TOS'' era that she made contact with the main Borg force and became a queen before she was finally killed in a fleet of Starfleet, Romulan, and Klingon ships led by Picard.

The [[Peter David]] novel ''Vendetta'' reveals that the planet killer weapon from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode "[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Doomsday Machine]]" is a prototype for a weapon against the Borg. David revisited this concept in a 2007 sequel novel, ''Before Dishonor'', which features the ''Enterprise''-E working with Spock and Seven of Nine to reactivate the original planet killer to stop the Borg.

In [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''[[The Return (Shatner novel)|The Return]]'', [[Spock]] is nearly assimilated by the Borg, but is saved because he mind-melded with [[V'ger]], an earlier form of the Borg, and they assume that he is already a Borg. Using the information he subconsciously acquired in the meld, Spock is able to lead a crew of ''Enterprise'' officers (consisting of the ''Enterprise''-D crew, himself, Admiral McCoy, and the resurrected Kirk) in a ''Defiant''-class ship to destroy the Borg central node, severing all branches of the Collective from each other and limiting their future threat.

In David Mack's novel trilogy ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'', set over a year after ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'', the Borg stage a massive invasion of local space. Due to Kathryn Janeway crippling their infrastructure in "[[Endgame (Star Trek)|Endgame]]", the Borg fear for their survival and attempt to exterminate the Federation and its neighbors. They destroy the populations of numerous Federation worlds before being dismantled by the Caeliar, the advanced species that spawned them. The crews of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]], the ''[[Star Trek: Titan|Titan]]'', and the ''Aventine'' had made contact with the Caeliar, learned of their role in the creation of the Borg, and convinced them to end the Borg once and for all.

In the ''[[Doctor Who]]''/''Star Trek'' crossover comic, [[Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2|''Assimilation2'']], the Borg join forces with the [[Cybermen]]. When the Cybermen subvert the Collective, the ''Enterprise''-D crew work with the [[Eleventh Doctor|Eleventh]] [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] and the Borg, restoring the Borg to full strength and erasing the Borg/Cyberman alliance from existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/|title=Doctor Who, Star Trek crossover comic revealed • Doctor Who News • WhovianNet|work=whoviannet.co.uk|access-date=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408180000/http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/|archive-date=April 8, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] developed an unproduced idea for an episode which would have featured [[Alice Krige]] as a [[Starfleet]] medical technician who encounters the Borg and is assimilated – thereby becoming the Borg Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://trekmovie.com/2007/09/22/interview-gar-judy-reeves-stevens-talk-mars-and-enterprise/ | title=Interview: Reeves-Stevenses Talk Mars and Enterprise | work=Trekmovie.com | date=September 22, 2007 | accessdate=21 August 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113121646/http://trekmovie.com/2007/09/22/interview-gar-judy-reeves-stevens-talk-mars-and-enterprise/ | archive-date=January 13, 2010 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video game [[Star Trek: Armada]], the Borg invades a [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] cloning facility to create a clone of [[Jean-Luc Picard]] to create a new [[Locutus of Borg|Locutus]].

==Critical reception and popular culture==
The depiction of the Borg cube in "Q Who" garnered the episode an [[Emmy Award]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemecek|title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion:|edition=Revised|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7434-7657-7|first=Larry|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Borg uttered the phrase in several'' Star Trek'' episodes and the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' (which used the phrase as the [[tagline]] for the 1996 film). [[Patrick Stewart]]'s delivery of the line, as [[Jean-Luc Picard|Locutus]], in "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]" was ranked no. 93 in [[TV Land]]'s list of "The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/44609139.html |title=The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases |publisher=[[TV Land]] |accessdate=January 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306081425/http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/44609139.html |archivedate=March 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as the title for [[Resistance Is Futile (Dexter)|an episode of the TV series ''Dexter'']].

Cornélie Caroline "Cox" van Asch van Wijck was the daughter of Jonkheer (Lord) [[:nl:Hubert Willem van Asch van Wijck]] (1867–1935) and Gravin (Countess) "Wim" Wilhelmina Philippina van Limburg Stirum. (1873–1941).&lt;ref&gt;Nederland's Adelsboek 1987 (van Asch van Wijck) XIId&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nederland's Adelsboek 1956 (van Limburg Stirum) 4&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the fourth of five children: Constance "Conny", Maurits "Maus", Cecilius "Cecil", Cornélie "Cox" and Wilhelmina Adolphina "Dolph".&lt;ref&gt;''Nods and Becks, Yearbook of the Anna Head School, Berkeley, CA - Volume XI'' "1919's Horoscope", May 1919, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cox was named for her Aunt the Christian evangelist, Countess Cornelia van Limburg Stirum, founder of the Christian School for Girls in Arnhem (''Christelijke Meisjesschool'') later renamed the ''Limburg Stirumschool''.&lt;ref&gt;Biografisch woordenboek Gelderland. Deel 8. Bekende en onbekende mannen en vrouwen uit de Gelderse geschiedenis pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegasusarchive.org/arnhem/Photos3/Pic_School.htm |title=Arnhem Bridge |publisher=Pegasusarchive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1914, the family travelled to Suriname. Cox and her two brothers Maus and Cecil were sent to San Francisco for their studies. Cox attended the ''[[Head-Royce|Anna Head School for Girls]]'' in [[Berkeley, California]]. She was the Art Editor of the yearbook and had the ambition to become an artist.&lt;ref&gt;''Nods and Becks, Yearbook of the Anna Head School, Berkeley, CA - Volume XI'', May 1919, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925 Cox created a bas-relief for her former headmistress Mary Elizabeth Wilson.

On 2 February 1919, Miss Cornelia van Asch van Wyck appears with Dutch Consul van Coenen Torchiana in the ''San Francisco Chronicle, Society Section''.  The occasion is a reception for Dutch Naval Officers.&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Chronicle'', Society Page, 2 February 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year Cox returned to the Netherlands in company of her father.  In 1921 Cox was in England where she nearly got engaged to her cousin Graaf (Count) Constantijn Willem Limburg Stirum (1900–1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneagraphie.com/getperson.php?personID=I659294&amp;tree=1 |title=Graaf Constantijn Willem van Limburg-Stirum b. 8 Sep 1900 Oosterbeek d. 13 Oct 1976 Leidschendam: Geneagraphie - Families all over the world |publisher=Geneagraphie |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the family intervened.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil John van Limburg Stirum, ''Oh Moppie van Stirum'', 1996. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Back in the Netherlands Cox pursued her schooling in the arts with the sculptor [[:nl:Toon Dupuis|Toon Dupuis]], the docent at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in the Hague ([[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague|Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten]]).

[[File:Cornélie by Gustave Brigand.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pastel of C.C. van Asch van Wijck by [[:fr:Gustave Brisgand|Gustave Brisgand]]]]
C.C. van Asch van Wijck became an active member of the 1920s Hague (Den Haag) artist community both as a model and as a sculptor.  Cox modeled for the artists of her day such as the French painter and pastelist {{Interlanguage link multi|Gustave Brisgand|fr|3=Gustave Brisgand}}, the sculptor and her Professor [[Toon Dupuis]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Piet van der Hem|nl|3=Piet van der Hem}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

On 7 August 1930, Cox married Hendrik Gerard Johan "Henri" Völcker, Heer van Soelen en den Aldenhaag (Zutphen 16 October 1891, Utrecht 18 December 1955), Henri was the Lord Protector (''heer beschermer'') of the village of [[Zoelen]] a rural community in the [[Betuwe]] only accessible by river ferries.&lt;ref&gt;Groot, Marjan.  "Vrouwen in de vormgeving in Nederland, 1880-1940" Uitgeverij 010, Rotterdam, 2007.  p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither the remoteness of her new home nor her married status stopped Cox from making regular trips to The Hague, to the beach at Scheveningen, to Leerdam, to Gouda etc. either with Henri or by herself.  At Soelen she set up her atelier in the gatehouse.

On 18 September 1932 C.C. van Asch van Wijck gave birth to  a son, Johan Adolph "Dolph" Völcker, Heer van Soelen en den Aldenhaag, Oud and Niew Hinklenoord whom she named for her youngest sister. She did not survive the birth.  She was laid to rest in the Church cemetery of the Reformed Church (''Hervormde kerk'') of Zoelen in presence of the whole village and all its notables, as well as many friends and relatives, two carriages were needed for the wreaths alone.  After the benediction "The Lord Völcker van Soelen thanked all present for the extraordinary large turnout and, turning to the grave, he said the words: 'Farewell, darling treasure, who was my everything'". ("''De Heer Völcker van Soelen dankte al de aanwezigen voor de buitengewoon groote belangstelling en richtte zich tot het graf met de woorden: Vaarwel, dierbare schat, die alles voor mij was.''"&lt;ref&gt;''Tielse Courant'', 22 September 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

As a sculptor, C.C. van Ash van Wijk's most widely known work is connected with the Glassworks at [[Leerdam]] (''Leerdam Glasfabriek'').  In 1929 she proposed her sculpture of a Woman's Mask&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaalglasmuseum.nl/index.php?option=com_memorixbeeld&amp;view=record&amp;Itemid=25&amp;id=gla:col1:dat9433&amp;tstart= |title=Vrouwenmasker |publisher=Nationaalglasmuseum.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[:nl:Petrus Marinus Cochius|Petrus Marinus Cochius]] director of the Glassworks.  The design was approved and went into production.  It came in two versions; clear and frosted, some of the glass masks were completed with a wooden  base.

It was groundbreaking for the Glassworks, they were adding pure art to their line of functional items, in addition to C. C. van Asch van Wijck, the Glassworks had engaged [[Lucienne Bloch]] - later well known for her Murals -  who created her glass animals (a lioness, a duck etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaalglasmuseum.nl/index.php?option=com_memorixbeeld&amp;view=record&amp;Itemid=25&amp;id=gla:col1:dat73860&amp;tstart= |title=Cataloguspagina |publisher=Nationaalglasmuseum.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groot, Marjan.  "Vrouwen in de vormgeving in Nederland, 1880-1940" Uitgeverij 010, Rotterdam, 2007.  p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work inspired by earlier Glassworks contributor [[:nl:Steph Uiterwaal|Steph Uiterwaal]]'s ''Madonna with Child''(1928).  There was a bit of a buzz in the Dutch art world over creating and in glass and with industrial means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Elsevier's Geïllustreerd Maandschrift |title=Autosymbolen van Leerdamsch Kristal |pages=239–240 |url=http://www.elseviermaandschrift.nl/EGM/1931/01/19310101/EGM-19310101-0302/story.pdf |format=PDF |language=Dutch |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C. C. van Asch van Wijck's mask was part of an exposition in "de Olde Munte" in Arnhem and was well received in de Arnhemsche Courant.&lt;ref&gt;''Arnhemsche Courant'', "Stadsniews" 3 August 1929&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1930 it won a gold medal at the Wereldtentoonstelling voor Kolonien, Zeevaart en Vlaamse Kunst in Antwerpen (Belgium) (World Fair for Colonies, Navigation, and Flemish Art).&lt;ref&gt;F. Leidelmeijer &amp; D. Van der Cingel, Art Nouveau en Art Deco in Nederland, Amsterdam 1983, p. 178, ill. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

C.C. van Ash van Wijk pursued her forray in combining art and industry by partnering with ''Koninklijk Goedewaagen''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goedewaagen.nl/en/about_royal_goedewaagen.htm |title=Royal Goedewaagen |publisher=Goedewaagen.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Gouda Holland, a manufacturer of earthenware in operation since 1610.  She created a flying maiden, "Anunciata", standing in a large round tassa in satinated cream.  She signed it with her new monogram adding to her initials the V S of Völcker van Soelen.

'''Clayface''' is an alias used by several fictional [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Most incarnations of the character possess [[clay]]-like bodies and [[shape-shifting]] abilities, and all of them have been depicted as [[List of Batman Family adversaries|adversaries]] of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. In 2009, Clayface was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 73rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/73.html Clayface is number 73 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306053434/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/73.html |date=2010-03-06 }}, [[IGN]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]], the original Clayface (Basil Karlo) appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #40 (June 1940) as a [[B movie|B-list]] actor who began a life of crime using the identity of a villain that he had portrayed in a [[horror film]] that he had starred in.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Clayface I-IV | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 85 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, [[Batman]] began facing a series of [[science fiction]]-inspired foes, including Matt Hagen, a treasure hunter given vast shapeshifting powers and resiliency by exposure to a pool of radioactive [[protoplasm]], who became the second Clayface. He retained the title for the next several decades of [[comic book]] history.

In the late 1970s, Preston Payne became the third Clayface. A scientist suffering from hyperpituitarism, Preston Payne used the second Clayface's blood to create a cure for his condition, but instead became a clay-like creature that needed to pass his new condition on to others to survive.

Sondra Fuller of Strike Force [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]] used the terrorist group's technology to become the fourth Clayface, also known as Lady Clay. She formed the Mud Pack with the original and third Clayfaces. During this era, the original Clayface used the [[DNA]] of Payne and Fuller to become the Ultimate Clayface (as he now called himself).

Sometime after the Mud Pack event, Payne and Fuller had a son named Cassius "Clay" Payne, who, as the fifth Clayface, also had [[metahuman]] shapeshifting powers.

In a 1998 storyline, Dr. Peter Malloy later used a sample of Cassus Payne's skin to become a Claything when he was introduced in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #550 (January 1998).

In 2002, the Todd Russell version of Clayface was introduced in ''[[Catwoman]]'' vol. 3, #4 (May 2002), and in 2005, the Johnny Williams version of Clayface was introduced in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'' #60 (February 2005).

==Fictional character biography==
===Basil Karlo===
The original version of Clayface, '''Basil Karlo''', first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #40 (June 1940). He is a B-list actor who is driven insane when he hears that a remake of the classic [[horror film]] he had starred in, ''Dread Castle'', would be shot without him acting in the film, even though he is to be one of the advising staff. Donning the costume of Clayface, a villain he once played in a different movie, he begins killing the actors playing characters he killed in the order and way they die in the film, along with someone who knew his identity. Last, he plans to murder the actor playing the Clayface killer. He is foiled by [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger|Finger, Bill]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane|Kane, Bob]]|inker=[[Jerry Robinson|Robinson, Jerry]]|letterer=[[Jerry Robinson|Robinson, Jerry]]|editor=[[Whitney Ellsworth|Ellsworth, Whitney]]|story=The Murders of Clayface|title=[[Detective Comics]]|volume=1|issue=40|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York City|date=June 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He reappears after the prison ambulance he is riding in plunges off a cliff. He once again dons the mask of Clayface and targets Bruce Wayne's fiancée, [[Julie Madison]]. Once again, the Dynamic Duo foil his plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger|Finger, Bill]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane|Kane, Bob]]|inker=[[Bob Kane|Kane, Bob]]|letterer=[[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|editor=[[Whitney Ellsworth|Ellsworth]]|story=Clayface Walks Again|title=[[Detective Comics]]|volume=1|issue=49|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York City|date=March 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; A movie buff, Batman co-creator [[Bob Kane]] states that the character was partially inspired by the 1925 [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] version of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and that the name of the character came from a combination of [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Basil Rathbone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bob|last=Kane|authorlink=Bob Kane|title=Batman and Me|publisher=[[Eclipse Books]]|location=Foestfille, California|date=1990|page=111|ISBN=978-1560600176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karlo returns twice more in the [[Silver Age of Comics]] to battle Batman, in ''Batman'' #208 and ''Detective Comics'' #496.

In the [[Post-Crisis]] continuity, Karlo languishes in a prison hospital, when the current Clayface Sondra Fuller visits him out of curiosity. Karlo proposes an alliance between all living Clayfaces to kill Batman. He even arranges for a small piece of the remains of Matt Hagen to be gathered to make him a post-mortem member of the "Mud Pack", as the group called itself. Even though the "Mud Pack" is defeated, Karlo injects himself with blood samples from Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller, gaining the abilities to shapeshift and melt with a touch; he becomes the self-declared "Ultimate" Clayface. He is defeated by the combined efforts of Batman and [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] by overloading his abilities, making him melt into the ground. He literally sinks into the Earth's crust when he loses control of his powers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Mike W.

Karlo escapes his underground prison when [[Gotham City]] is struck by a great [[Batman: Cataclysm|cataclysm]]. He captures Batman and is about to kill him, but he gets into a feud with [[Mr. Freeze]] about who has a right to kill the Caped Crusader. Using that distraction, Batman soundly defeats both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Alan Grant (writer)|Grant, Alan]]|penciller=[[Mark Buckingham|Buckingham, Mark]]|inker=[[Wayne Faucher|Faucher, Wayne]]|colorist=[[Pamela Rambo|Rambo, Pamela]]|letterer=[[Bill Oakley|Oakley, Bill]]|editor=[[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]|story=By Fire...

During the "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" storyline, Karlo holds [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], who is in charge of producing fresh vegetables for the remaining people in the city, prisoner in Robinson Park. After she is freed from her prison by Batman, Poison Ivy battles and defeats Karlo, sinking him deep into the ground.

[[File:Clayface Batman The Dark Knight Vol 2 23-3.png|thumb|Basil Karlo as Clayface on the cover of ''Batman: The Dark Knight'' Vol. 2 #23.3 (November 2013). Art by Cliff Richards.]]
While he is successful in absorbing some of the heroine's powers, causing her to regress to a teenage appearance resembling [[Donna Troy]], he is ultimately returned to normal when Wonder Woman and Donna were able to trick Clayface into entering a train carriage with Wonder Woman while she was disguised as Donna, Donna subsequently using the [[Lasso of Truth]] to swing the carriage around and turn it into a mystical [[centrifuge]], causing the clay Clayface had taken from Wonder Woman to split away from him and re-merge with Wonder Woman due to the differences between the two types of clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Brian K.

Basil Karlo is among the members of the [[Injustice League]] and is among the villains seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. He can also be seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra's]] Secret Society of Super Villains.

In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), as a part of the "[[Death of the Family]]" storyline, Poison Ivy breaks Basil Karlo out of Arkham, claiming she wants to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; This turns out to be a ruse, however; Ivy is using him as part of a larger scheme. Upon realizing this, he seeks revenge.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #15&lt;/ref&gt;

Karlo later returns with a new plan: to use his [[DNA]]-duplication abilities to impersonate Bruce Wayne and take control of [[Wayne Enterprises]]. He even guesses that Wayne is Batman's true identity. However, Batman plants false evidence to suggest that he anticipated Karlo's attempt to take his DNA and tricked him into taking a fake sample. Batman eventually stops Karlo by trapping him in a security system that can only be deactivated with Karlo's original DNA, reasoning that he has changed too much for his original DNA to be present in his system.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #20 (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Detective Comics Annual'' 2018, Basil is re-imaged as a handsome young actor who was disfigured in a car accident. In a desperate bid to salvage his career, he began abusing an industrial make-up chemical known as "Re-Nu" which, when combined with clay and putty, warps flesh into new shapes and forms; a secret he discovered from his father Vincent Karlo, a former special effects artist. However, the chemical is long out of production, and Karlo is forced to steal more and more of it to preserve his handsome appearance. Batman apprehends him during one such robbery, which reveals his secret to the world. Karlo's career is ruined and his girlfriend Glory Griffin dumps him. Batman attempts to get Karlo to testify against the creator of Re-Nu, [[Roland Daggett]], but he refuses. Instead, he attempts to break into the warehouse where the police are holding his stolen stash of Re-Nu. When police open fire on the vials, Karlo is doused in the chemical and transformed into Clayface. He then attacks the set of the film he was fired from. Batman attempts to evacuate the set, but Clayface flings him off into the distance and begins massacring everyone in sight. As an added bit of revenge, Clayface disfigures Glory, who is working on the film as a production assistant, before Batman apprehends him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[James Tynion IV|Tynion, James IV]]|penciller=[[Eddy Barrows|Barrows, Eddy]]|inker=[[Eber Ferreira|Ferreira, Eber]]|colorist=[[Adriano Lucas|Lucas, Adriano]]|letterer=[[Sal Cipriano|Cipriano, Sal]]|editor=[[Jamie S.

===Matt Hagen===
[[File:Dc298.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Matt Hagen as Clayface on the cover of ''Detective Comics'' #298 (December 1961)]]
The second version of Clayface, '''Matt Hagen''', first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #298. A treasure hunter, Hagen finds a mysterious radioactive pool of protoplasm in a cave. Immersing himself in it by accident, he is transformed into a malleable [[clay]]-like form which could be shaped into almost anything he desires. This is only a temporary effect, however, requiring him to return to the pool periodically in order to maintain use of his powers. His criminal activities attracted the attention of Batman and Robin. Batman discovered his weakness and defeated him.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #298&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Hagen later escaped from prison and decided to investigate the protoplasmic substance that turned him into Clayface so that he can find a way to prolong his powers. Clayface posed as wealthy civilians of Gotham City in order to learn more about his criminal activities. Batman and Robin later confronted Clayface at his hideout where they used a combination of a freeze gun and the protoplasmic substance to defeat Clayface and return him to prison.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #304&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Hagen eventually breaks out of prison and uses the protoplasmic pool to become Clayface again. This time, Batman defeats Clayface by immersing himself in the protoplasm, with the resulting battle causing Batman to destroy the cave that contained the protoplasmic pool.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #312&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface later competes with [[Joker (character)|Joker]] causing Batman, Robin, [[Batwoman#Kathy Kane (1956-1979, 2011-present)|Batwoman]] and [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]] to work together to defeat both villains.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #159&lt;/ref&gt;

After escaping from Green Wells Maximum Security Prison upon having stashed some chemicals there, Clayface eventually copies the pool's protoplasmic jelly by chemistry studies, although the artificial proptoplasm only allows him five hours of his power compared to the full two days of the pool's. Clayface resumes his crime spree by stealing the priceless stamp collection of millionaire K.A. King and stealing the trophy that was to be given to Batman. Clayface's activities also attract the attention of Superman. Assuming the form of Superman, Clayface is evenly matched with him until Clayface smashes some bleachers to provide a diversion to get away. During Clayface's robbery, Batman used Kryptonite on Clayface's Superman form, only for Clayface to get away by shapeshifting into a rocket. When Batman uses Red Kryptonite on him, it causes Clayface to go crazy. Clayface uses the X-Ray Vision in his Superman form to see who Batman is. Before he can reveal who Batman is, Clayface's powers wear off, causing him to regress back to Matt Hagen. Superman manages to save Clayface from the fall. Matt Hagen had lost the memory of Batman's secret identity as he is handed over to the Gotham City Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;''World's Finest'' #140&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] returns to Earth to plan his revenge on Superman, he goes on a rampage and blasts the walls to a prison where Matt Hagen was imprisoned. This gives Matt Hagen the opportunity to escape and head to one of his secret laboratories in order to regain his powers. He makes more of the synthetic formula that gives him his shapeshifting powers for five hours. With [[Jimmy Olsen]] by his side, Batman works to track down Clayface while Robin works with Superman to catch Brainiac. This leads to a team-up between Clayface and Brainiac. While Superman and Robin managed to apprehend Brainiac, Clayface tries to escape, only for his formula to wear off which enables Batman and Jimmy Olsen to apprehend him.&lt;ref&gt;''World's Finest'' #144&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface later appears as a member of [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]]'s [[Anti-Justice League]] in order to capture the [[Justice League]]. They are defeated by the Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #443&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Hagen's blood was later obtained by Preston Payne.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics #478"&gt;''Detective Comics'' #478&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface later breaks out of prison and restores his powers. He kidnaps Lois Lane as part of a plot to destroy Batman and Superman. Both superheroes managed to rescue Lois Lane and defeat Clayface.&lt;ref&gt;''World's Finest'' #264&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface is among the villains that fight Batman and [[Jason Todd|Robin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #526&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline, Matt Hagen is ultimately killed by one of the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s Shadow Demons, together with the [[Bug-Eyed Bandit]].&lt;ref&gt;''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface appeared in Limbo alongside other dead supervillains as part of a plan to return to the living, only to be defeated by [[Hawk and Dove]], the [[Teen Titans]] and Jeb Stuart's [[Haunted Tank]]. The imposter [[Etrigan the Demon]] offered them a way out through another portal, but he was merely toying with the dead supervillains. When he sent them through the portal, it turned out to be an entrance to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawk and Dove Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''Mud Pack'' storyline, Basil Karlo gathers a small piece of Hagen's remains and makes him a post-mortem member of the group. He was unable to bring Matt Hagen back to life.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #604&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preston Payne===
[[File:cf3.jpg|thumb|Preston Payne as Clayface on the cover of ''Detective Comics'' #479 (October 1978)]]
The third version of Clayface, '''Preston Payne''', first appeared at the end of ''Detective Comics'' #477 before making his first full appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #478-479. Suffering from hyperpituitarism, Payne works at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] searching for a cure. He obtains a sample of Matt Hagen's blood, and isolates an [[enzyme]] which he introduces into his own bloodstream. Although he is briefly able to shape his own appearance, this effect is short-lived: while on a date, his flesh begins to melt, and when he grabs his horrified girlfriend's arm, she completely dissolves into a shapeless pile of protoplasm. Payne builds an anti-dissolving exoskeleton suit to support his clay-like flesh and contain his contagion, but he soon learns that he needs to transmit this dissolving contagion onto others to survive by touching them (he feels excruciating pain before this happens, which only stops when he touches someone). During this time his mental health starts to slip as he falls in love with a wax mannequin he names "Helena", thinking that she is the only woman who is immune to his touch. After another breakdown, he thinks Helena enjoys watching men "fighting over her" when he battles Batman yet again in front of the wax doll.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Annual'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; Although he does not give her up, he keeps her in [[Arkham Asylum]], saying "we're both too polite to admit divorce, but she can't live forever".&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Origins'' (vol. 2) #44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

When [[Swamp Thing]] visits Arkham Asylum, he witnesses Payne in an "argument" with Helena.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #52&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. R. Hutton takes a night shift at Arkham Asylum in order to do research for his new book detailing superhuman psychology. He keeps a close watch on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. During this time, he sees Clayface spending intimate time with Helena.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #66&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events of the ''Mud Pack'' storyline, Sondra Fuller, the fourth Clayface, begins masquerading as the superheroine [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] and visits Payne at Arkham. That same night, he gets into an argument with Helena and unintentionally knocks her head off. Believing that he has killed her, Payne goes on a rampage until subdued in a nearby swamp by the asylum guards. Fuller, who is still using Looker's appearance and powers, rescues him and influences him to follow Basil Karlo's commands. Karlo ultimately betrays Fuller and takes samples of her and Payne's blood to inject into himself. Payne finally breaks free of Fuller's control and is about to kill her when she admits how sorry she is for using him. The two, after escaping, fall in love and go on to live together while on the run, leading to Fuller becoming [[pregnant]] with their child, Cassius.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Origins'' (vol. 2) #44, ''Detective Comics'' #604-607 and ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Preston acquires medicine to control his pain and now feels it only in his mind. It is also revealed that he was abused by his parents.

A stunted, emaciated Preston Payne appears in the graphic novel ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Dave McKean]]. He is used to metaphorically represent sexually transmitted diseases.

Payne next appears in the ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'' miniseries, having been coerced into working for [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]], who had threatened the life of his son. Prometheus had further mutated Payne, giving him back his old shapeshifting abilities and curing him of his contagion, and had him act as a decoy for the [[Justice League]]. When the ruse was discovered, an explosive device planted inside Payne's body detonated. It is unknown if he survived the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sondra Fuller===
The fourth version of Clayface, '''Sondra Fuller''' (also known as '''Lady Clay'''), first appeared in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (vol. 1) #21. She is a member of Strike Force Kobra who is transformed into a shape-changer by her employer [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]]'s technologies. She agreed to going through with the process because she hates her own face. The process works and she becomes a member of [[Strike Force Kobra]].&lt;ref&gt;''Outsiders'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;

She possesses identical abilities to those of Matt Hagen, but they are permanent, without the requirement for exposure to a source of protoplasm. She can additionally copy any special powers of the being she is mimicking. She is defeated by the Outsiders.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

Later, after the Mud Pack forms and battles Batman, Fuller falls in love with Preston Payne. After Clayface-Prime (Karlo) is defeated, Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller escape and get married while on the run, and they have a child named Cassius "Clay" Payne, a play on boxer [[Muhammad Ali]]'s birth name. After [[Abattoir (comics)|Abbatoir]] kidnaps the child, the couple get into a fight involving [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael/Batman]]. Batman eventually defeated them both, and Fuller was put into custody.&lt;ref name="Batman Shadow of the Bat #26-27"&gt;''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' version of Sondra Fuller appeared in the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'' where she claims that Kobra was not the person who gave her the powers of shapeshifting after all. Instead, she claims that her powers were the result of a government conspiracy to create superpowered beings. Her proclamation further adds to the global scandal known as "The Superman Hypothesis" which suggests that the United States has been secretly creating superheroes and supervillains for an unknown/unstated purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #3, DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Mud Pack''===
Before the debut appearances of the fifth and sixth Clayfaces, Clayface III and IV team up, breaking Clayface I out of prison. Clayface I also futilely tries to revive Clayface II. Together, the trio form the "Mud Pack". Clayface I later copies the others' powers by injecting himself with extracts of blood samples of Clayface III and IV, becoming the "Ultimate Clayface". Clayface I is defeated by Batman and [[Looker]] and Clayface III and IV escape.&lt;ref name="Secret Origins v2 #44 and Detective Comics #604-607"&gt;''Secret Origins'' (vol. 2) #44 and ''Detective Comics'' #604-607&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassius "Clay" Payne===
[[File:Clayface.jpg|right|thumb|Cassius "Clay" Payne as Clayface]]
After the Mud Pack incident, Payne and Fuller escape and fall in love while on the run. They eventually have a child together named '''Cassius "Clay" Payne''',&lt;ref name="Batman Shadow of the Bat #26-27" /&gt; who becomes the fifth version of Clayface and debuted in ''Batman'' #550.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #550&lt;/ref&gt; The boy is separated from his parents and held in a government laboratory. The name "Cassius" is a pun on "Cassius Clay", the birth name of boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].

If a piece of him is separated from his body, it can grow a mind of its own, but it mostly thinks in an unstable form of what Cassius wants. If bonded with another human, it becomes a '''Claything'''; the piece can give that human Clayface-like abilities, such as becoming soft and malleable, being able to withstand bullets and other forms of harm, and could also manifest Payne's ability to melt objects; all this person would have to do to perform such an action is to think about it. Cassius finds it very painful and distressing to have pieces of himself taken, and will go to crazed lengths to recover them.

In an issue of ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'', Cassius is depicted as having the clay-like appearance of his mother and father, but can only stay in this form while awake (a similar trait shared by [[Plasmus]] in the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]] (2003-2006)).&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Gotham After Midnight'' #3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, Cassius attacks the National Guard on the roadblock, but when he was approached by [[General Immortus]]' team, he is able to recognize one of the team, [[Human Flame]]. Cassius attacks and blames him for [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] enslaving Earth. The Justice League arrives to end the fight as Human Flame and General Immortus' team teleport away, leaving Cassius to be captured. After the League interrogates him, he is taken to some FBI vehicles, but the measures to contain him prove to be useless; Cassius breaks loose, escaping into the desert.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dr. Peter "Claything" Malley===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] --&gt;
The sixth version of Clayface, also known as the '''Claything''', also debuted in ''Batman'' #550. Claything is created when a skin sample from Cassius Payne comes to life and merges with a DEO ([[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) scientist, '''Dr. Peter Malley'''. He has the ability to melt objects simply by looking at them. Claything is destroyed when [[Chase (comics)|Cameron Chase]] psychokinetically turns his own powers against him, and his remains are stored at the DEO Headquarters.

===Todd Russell===
The seventh version of Clayface, '''Todd Russell''', debuted in ''Catwoman'' (vol. 3) #1 (January 2002), but is not actually shown until ''Catwoman'' (vol. 3) #4 (May 2002). This version of Clayface is not named until ''Catwoman'' (vol. 3) #44. Having the power to change into virtually any shape and size, he preys upon prostitutes in Gotham's East End until [[Catwoman]] is able to contain his decapitated head inside of a freezer. There are very few background details given about the seventh Clayface's past. He was in the Army, suffered injuries, and was subsequently experimented on (possibly by the DEO) before losing most of his memory and discovering his new powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://therealbatmanchronoproject.blogspot.com/2009/11/modern-age-year-eighteen.html |title=The Real Batman Chronology Project: Modern Age (Year Eighteen) Part One |publisher=Therealbatmanchronoproject.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his capture, he is held captive and further experimented upon for almost two years at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] in Gotham before being freed by Catwoman.&lt;ref&gt;''Catwoman'' (vol. 3) #42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnny Williams===
[[File:Gothamknights69.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Johnny Williams as Clayface on the cover of ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'' #69 (November 2005) Art by [[Claudio Castellini]]]]
The eighth version of Clayface, '''Johnny Williams''', debuted in ''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #60 (February 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://therealbatmanchronoproject.blogspot.com/2010/03/modern-age-year-eighteen-part-three.html |title=The Real Batman Chronology Project: Modern Age (Year Eighteen) Part Three |publisher=Therealbatmanchronoproject.blogspot.com |date=2006-09-02 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams is introduced as a former firefighter in Gotham who is transformed into a clay-based creature by an explosion in a chemical plant. He first discovers his transformation after he accidentally kills a prostitute; horrified and stricken with guilt, he plans to commit suicide. Just then, he is approached by [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] and the [[Riddler]], who tell him that the chemicals turned him into the latest Clayface. They begin to manipulate Williams, holding out the promise of a cure and making him do their bidding, including pretending to be Tommy Elliot (Hush's true identity) and an adult [[Jason Todd]], to hurt and confuse Bruce Wayne.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #617-618&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot also takes some samples from Williams to try and determine how he can duplicate the shapeshifting aspects of Clayface without losing his original form, also using these samples to infect Batman's ally [[Alfred Pennyworth]] with a virus that allows Hush to exert some degree of control over Alfred, forcing him to commit murder. Eventually, Williams realizes he is being manipulated and Hush will never help him after Hush tries to steal a sample of Cassius in the hopes that analysis of the 'pure' Clayface will help him crack the sample. Knowing that he is going to die, Williams offers Batman assistance against Hush in exchange for protecting his family. He redeems himself in his death by providing Batman with a sample of himself so that Batman can find a cure for the virus infecting Alfred, also ensuring that Alfred is cleared of the murder charges by ensuring that his final appearance after death includes fingerprints that are so similar to Alfred's that the detectives conclude that they simply made a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Gotham Knight'' #69-71&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Clayface of Japan===
The ninth version of Clayface, the '''Clayface of Japan''', debuted in ''Batman Incorporated'' (vol. 1) #6 (June 2011) as part of ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.therealbatmanchronologyproject.com/the-modern-age/post-year-one-era-20-23/year-twenty-three-p-1/ |title=The Real Batman Chronology Project: Modern Age (Year Twenty-Three Part One) |publisher=therealbatmanchronologyproject.com |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman tasks Batman Japan (Jiro Osamu) to fight the Clayface of Japan about two-and-a-half months into his [[Batman Incorporated]] venture.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Incorporated'' (vol. 1) #6&lt;/ref&gt; Not much is known about this Clayface, except that he resembles all of the previous Clayfaces and seems to have their same set of powers. Presumably, this Clayface, as a rival to Osamu, is a native of Japan. Batman states that this Clayface is a newcomer, a samurai, and operates in or around [[Hokkaido]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Incorporated'' (vol. 2) #0&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Clayface clones===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), a villain named Jeffrey Bode makes several short-lived clones of Clayface.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathstroke'' vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Each of the Clayfaces has different powers, but they all share the ability to shapeshift.

* In earlier appearances, Basil Karlo had no powers, but wore a clay mask based on one of his movie roles. In recent comics, Basil Karlo's body is made out of mud upon taking the DNA of Clayface III and IV, enabling him to gain the combined powers of both. In ''The New 52'', these are improved to a level in which he can even mimic the DNA of others.
* Matt Hagen had temporary shapeshifting, voiceshifting, and a body constituted of living mud which he can divide or change shape at will. Hagen had to reimmerse himself in a pool of protoplasm that gave him his powers to recharge them every 48 hours or else he would regress back to his human form. Later he duplicated the protoplasm by scientific means, but it would only give him his powers for five hours before needing to be renewed.
* Preston Payne originally had shapeshifting powers, yet ended up gaining the ability to dissolve people with his touch. He has super-strength from his exoskeleton and anti-dissolving suit. Preston's shapeshifting ability was later restored by Prometheus.
* Sondra Fuller has shapeshifting powers and power duplication.
* Cassius "Clay" Payne has the combined powers of both his parents. If a piece of him is separated from his mass, it can develop some consciousness of its own and even "bond" with a human to transform them into a "Claything".
* Dr. Peter Malley had the same powers as Cassius, but could also melt people just by looking at them.
* Todd Russell had shapeshifting powers.
* Johnny Williams had shapeshifting powers.

==Other versions==
===Earth-9===
The [[Earth-9]] version of Clayface is featured in [[Tangent Comics]]' ''Tangent: Superman's Reign'' miniseries. This version is a shapeshifter like the mainstream versions, but his base form is that of a hulking, misshapen human with melted skin.&lt;ref&gt;''Tangent: Superman's Reign'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Flashpoint''===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, a version of Clayface is a member of [[Deathstroke]]'s pirates after being broken out of a floating prison by Deathstroke.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #2 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; During attacks by [[Aquaman]] and [[Ocean Master]], Clayface is pushed by Aquaman into the water, apparently killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===
The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Year Two of the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic.

===''Batman: Arkham Knight''===
In the ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' prequel comic series, samples of Basil Karlo's mud were acquired by various parties including [[Simon Stagg]], who created "Project: Meta", and [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] which he used for his face to hide his cosmetic surgery scars. Karlo also appeared during one of Joker's fantasies, and briefly during one of Batman's simulations for Robin. It was also revealed that Karlo is still alive within the mud collected by GCPD, but is unable to take form again because of the Lazarus Particles mixed with his mud and the explosion from the generator.

===''Batman: White Knight''===
In the 2017 miniseries ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', an unnamed Clayface appears as a chief character. Criminal Jack Napier (a [[Joker (character)|Joker]] who was temporarily cured of his insanity after being force-fed pills by Batman), uses [[Mad Hatter (comics)|the Mad Hatter]]'s mind control technology to control Clayface, while slipping small particles from his body into the drinks of many of Batman’s other villains. This allows Napier to control a small army of villains via this Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him.

===''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''===
====''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures''====

==In other media==
===Television===
====Live action====
* A character that resembles the Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears among the attacking criminals in the animated [[opening credits]] of the sixties ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, but the villain never actually appeared on the show itself and was instead replaced with the lesser known but similar-sounding masked master of disguise called '''[[List of minor DC Comics characters#False Face|False Face]]'''.
* Clayface made an appearance in the 12th episode of the short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' TV series, portrayed by [[Kirk Baltz]]. This version of Clayface is a sculptor who is inspired by other people's pain. Like other versions, he is a shapeshifter but his powers are explained to come from taking a special formula specifically tailored by a crooked scientist to work with his [[DNA]]. In this series, he is hired by the Joker to kill [[Catwoman]]. His son '''Chris Cassius''' (portrayed by [[Ian Reed Kesler]]) can turn people into clay after stealing and taking his father's formula, making his powers similar to the Preston Payne version of Clayface and his own son Cassius "Clay" Payne. Chris is eventually defeated by [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle]].

====Animation====
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface made his first animated appearance in [[Filmation]]'s 1970s TV series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'', voiced by [[Lou Scheimer]] and later by [[Lennie Weinrib]]. This version must apply his special potion daily to keep his Clayface powers. In this show, he often took on the forms of animals. In "Dead Ringers", Clayface, in his true form of Matt Hagen, forces former criminal-turned-acrobat Kit Martin to help him in exchange for not telling his boss of his criminal record. The plot involves posing as Batman in order to kidnap the Arabian Oil Minister Basil Oram. They disguise themselves as Batman and Robin, capture Oram and escape in a special shapeshifting vehicle. Clayface later calls [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], stating that he will return Oram and the blueprints for an oil-finding device in exchange for $10,000.000 by the end of the first hour. Clayface then orchestrates a car accident that knocks out [[Batman]] and then stows away in the [[Batmobile]] in order to infiltrate the [[Batcave]]. Clayface then discovers that Batman has amnesia and uses this advantage to find out Batman's secret identity, but his plan is foiled when [[Bat-Mite]] distracts him long enough for the Bat-Computer to create an antidote for Batman's amnesia. Clayface sneaks out of the Batcave disguised as a rabbit with Bat-Mite in pursuit while [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] learn why Kit is involved with Clayface's kidnapping plot. Batman used the Bat-Boat to pursue Clayface when he escapes into the water in the form of a dolphin. After Kit returns the blueprints to Commissioner Gordon, Robin and Batgirl learn from Kit that he was to deliver a 'medicine' to Clayface before midnight. When Clayface's shapeshifting wears off, he reverts to Matt Hagen and begins to drown as Hagen cannot swim, until Batman saves him and hands him over to the police. In "Curses! Oiled Again", Clayface collaborates with [[Catwoman]] to steal a shipment of oil bound for [[Gotham City]] during a cold snap. They also plan to steal the country's oil supply. When Batman and Robin scout out each of the storage tanks in the south side and the waterfront, Batman finds Catwoman and Clayface at the oil storage tanks on the waterfront and is led into a trap where Clayface attacks Batman in the form of a snake. Catwoman appears and shows Batman how she and Clayface have been draining the oil from Gotham City. Batman breaks free from Clayface when Robin, Batgirl and Bat-Mite arrive. Clayface turns into an eagle to get Catwoman away from Batman. Catwoman and Clayface manage to lose Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Bat-Mite in a car chase when the Kitty Car jumps over Batgirl. Catwoman and Clayface intercept a call between Batman and Commissioner Gordon revolving around the oil supertanker arriving in Gotham City. Catwoman and Clayface manage to steal some of the oil and escape in their submarine as Catwoman flees in her plane. Clayface turns into a whale in order to attack Batman and Robin. Batman and Robin net Clayface, who turns into a flying fish to get out, only to be caught in a smaller net by Robin. In the two-part episode "Have an Evil Day", Zarbor enlists the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], Catwoman and Clayface to keep the Dynamic Duo busy while he steals America's nuclear power plants.

** Matt Hagen is introduced in the critically acclaimed 1990s series ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. In the episode "Feat of Clay" (written by veteran comic book writer [[Marv Wolfman]]), Hagen is an actor who was disfigured in a car accident. While Hagen was recovering in a hospital, corrupt businessman [[Roland Daggett]] offered to make him as a test subject for the beauty cream 'Renuyu', promising that it would immediately restore his youthful good looks; in exchange, Daggett forced Hagen to commit crimes for him. After Hagen botches an attack on [[Lucius Fox]] while disguised as Bruce Wayne, Daggett cuts off his supply. Hagen attempts to steal a large quantity of Renuyu from Daggett's compound, but Daggett's men catch him and pour an entire canister of Renuyu down his throat, leaving him for dead. The overdose saturates every [[cell (biology)|cell]] in Hagen's body, turning him into the bulky and misshapen clay-like form of Clayface. For short periods of time, he can shapeshift into anything or anybody he wishes. Clayface tries to get revenge on Daggett, but Batman stops him by overwhelming his powers with images of his past movie roles. When caught, Clayface fakes his death (with the body in the morgue turning out to be a hollow shell which dries up and breaks apart) and sneaks away in the form of a woman. The episode "Mudslide" shows Clayface reappearing and revealing that his body is beginning to deteriorate. He is restored to a semblance of health by Dr. Stella Bates (voiced by [[Pat Musick]]), a former medical adviser on one of Hagen's films who fell in love with him. Batman tracks him down and prevents Clayface's treatment. Clayface and Batman then fight on a cliff during a rainstorm above an ocean. They both fall, and hang onto the cliff. Batman attempts to save Clayface, but Clayface's body absorbs too much rain to hold itself up and he falls into the ocean, where he dissolves.
** Clayface returns in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. Clayface makes a brief appearance in the pilot episode "[[Holiday Knights]]", where he takes the form of several little boys to steal items during a [[Christmas Eve]] rush. Upon being caught, he reverts to his natural form and attacks Detectives [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] and [[Renee Montoya]], but is defeated by [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]. The episode "Growing Pains" reveals that, after falling into the ocean during the events of "Mudslide", Clayface's remains drift near a pipe leaking strange chemicals into the ocean, restoring his strength. Still weakened, Clayface sends a portion of himself which takes the form of a little girl named Annie (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith) to see if it safe for him to resurface. Annie unexpectedly develops an individual personality, wandering around Gotham with no memory of who she is, and encounters [[Tim Drake|Robin]]. As Robin develops an affection for Annie, Clayface poses as the girl's abusive father, committing various robberies in order to make a living in Gotham's sewers. Eventually, Clayface recovers, cornering Robin and Annie; the latter allows herself to be reabsorbed - effectively killing her - in order to save Robin. Enraged by Annie's 'death', Robin almost kills Clayface with gallons of [[solvent]], but Batman intervenes and stops him. Clayface is then arrested and imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. When [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] lists the charges Clayface is accused of, Robin quietly adds murder as one of them.
** Clayface is also featured in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. The episode "Secret Society" revealed he had been captured, separated and sealed into several biohazard canisters by [[Morgan Edge]]. The [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] free Clayface and offer him membership. Now less aggressive and psychopathic than before, Clayface is reluctant at first, but [[Gorilla Grodd]] promises to find a way to help Hagen return to his human form while keeping his powers. However, Clayface is defeated along with the rest of the group after [[Wally West|The Flash]] and [[Hawkgirl]] stuff him with fireworks and set them off.

* There are two versions of Clayface that appear on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' cartoon series: original character '''Ethan Bennett''' (voiced by [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]]), and the Basil Karlo incarnation's animated debut, voiced by [[Wallace Langham]] (in "Clayfaces") and by [[Lex Lang]] (in "The Batman/Superman Story"). The first incarnation (introduced in season one) is a detective in the [[Gotham City Police Department]] and Bruce Wayne's best friend. The second incarnation (introduced in season four) is a talentless actor. After a session of brainwashing, Ethan is rescued by Batman and Detective [[Ellen Yin]], however, turns into Clayface when he inhales a dose of the Joker's 'Joker Putty'. After publicly denouncing Chief Angel Rojas' claims about Batman and getting suspended, Bennett mutates into a featureless gray clay-like figure and tries to look for help, scaring away the locals, though Ethan manages to change back into his original form with practice. While trying to murder Rojas, Clayface confronts Yin and Batman. In season two, Bennett appears primarily as Clayface. In the episode "Meltdown", Clayface is captured and put on trial for his crimes. Despite being released on probation, criminal temptations are too severe for Bennett. In the episode "Grundy's Night", Clayface impersonates [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] (voiced by [[Kevin Grevioux]]) in order to loot Gotham on [[Halloween]], but is ultimately stopped by Batman. In season four, Bennett has a change of heart while Karlo appears as Clayface. In the episode "Clayfaces", Bennett seems to have finally reformed by tracking down and capturing the Joker, disguising himself as Joker's henchmen Punch and Judy. He hands the Joker over to the police without using excessive force and turns himself in to the authorities. Now in [[Arkham Asylum]], Bennett wants to return working as a police officer, even as Clayface. However, Karlo breaks into [[Wayne Enterprises]] and drinks a refined, purified sample of the same [[mutagen]] that Bennett was exposed to. This successfully turns Karlo into a new version of Clayface and he gives him a more conventional appearance. After being rejected once again, Karlo snaps and uses his new powers to attack the people who rejected him. Karlo initially believes this would be the death of his career, but then he sees that being a [[supervillain]] has made him a celebrity covered on nearly every channel, as well as show his previous movie ''The Revenge of The Atomic Clone''. As Karlo was wreaking havoc, Bennett resorts to escaping from Arkham. Bennett tracks down and battles Karlo with the aid of Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. Bennett then restrains Karlo down while Batman administers the successful antidote, thus both Bennett and Karlo are cured and returned to Arkham. Ethan planned to finish his sentence and visited by Bruce, stating that they should play basketball again. Since the antidote finally cured all of his mutated cells, Ethan will eventually be free. He is also glad that his powers are gone, removing his criminal temptations so that he can focus on reformation after witnessing Karlo's actions. However, the episode's final scene shows that Karlo has retained his powers. The episode "Artifacts" (which takes place 20 years in the future) has Bennett reinstated into the GCPD as Chief of Police. In season five's "The Batman/Superman Story", Karlo reappears as Clayface when he and [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] are hired by [[Lex Luthor]] to kidnap [[Lois Lane]] as bait for a trap to lure [[Superman]] so that [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Mr. Freeze]] can attack Superman at once. Superman defeats the villains with Batman and Robin's help, but Clayface escapes. Clayface later fights Batman and Robin in [[LexCorp]]'s Gotham headquarters and ends up defeated.
* The Preston Payne version of Clayface is featured in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''. In the episode "Joker: The Vile and the Villainous!", a portrait of Clayface is seen in the villain bar where Batman's Rogues Gallery hangs out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formspring.me/IdiotStyle/q/186901759489244181 |title=Formspring forum thread |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Nolan North]]. In "Downtime", he is seen at the beginning where he overpowers the entire team and is about to kill [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]] until Batman intervenes and quickly subdues him with a taser, which causes Clayface to dissolve into a puddle. He was later taken to Arkham Asylum. In "Happy New Year", Clayface encounters [[Miss Martian]] and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] in the sewers, where he attacks Superboy with the same tactics he used before. By this point he has become immune to the tasers [[Tim Drake|Robin]] uses, but Superboy uses a special pill to freeze Clayface. He is then returned to Arkham.
* A female version of character named '''Mrs Clayface''' appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. She is the wife of the as-yet-unidentified Clayface.

===Film===
* The Flashpoint version of Clayface appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]''. He is part of [[Deathstroke]]'s pirate crew that fights [[Aquaman]]'s army until he is killed by [[Ocean Master]].
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Batman Unlimited: Monster Mayhem]]'', voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]. Clayface has joined the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s gang of monsters to wreak mayhem on Gotham City.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Batman Unlimited: Mech vs. Mutants]]'', voiced again by Dave B. Mitchell. Clayface, [[Killer Croc]], [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]], and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] are freed from Arkham by [[Mr. Freeze]] and the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]. Freeze uses a serum to turn Chemo and Croc into giant monsters. Meanwhile, the treacherous Penguin enlists Clayface and Bane to help with a coup against Freeze. Penguin injects them with the serum and Bane throws Freeze across Gotham. Clayface goes after Batman and [[Damien Wayne|Robin]], but the serum turns Clayface into a lava monster. Using a freeze ray developed by Freeze, Robin, the Flash, [[Man-Bat]], and Nightwing  freeze Clayface solid. However, Clayface is accidentally freed by some children and, back to his original form, escapes into the sewer.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', voiced by [[Kate Micucci]]. He is among the villains that assist Joker in his takeover of Gotham City. During the ceremony where Barbara Gordon is being sworn in as the new police commissioner, Joker assigns Mr. Freeze and Clayface to capture her. Barbara tricks Mr. Freeze into freezing Clayface. During the fight against the Phantom Zone inmates, Mr. Freeze and Clayface defeat the [[Kraken]] from ''[[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|Clash of the Titans]]''.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Scooby-Doo! &amp; Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].

===Video games===
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears as the final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the [[Sega CD]] version of ''[[The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin]]'', although he takes on the appearance of [[Rupert Thorne]] (voiced by [[John Vernon]]) throughout the game's majority, having hired other villains such as the Joker, [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] and the [[Riddler]] to stall Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. He is fought in an aerial battle while fleeing in a helicopter from the [[Batplane|Batwing]]. In the end, Batman damages the helicopter and it crashes into a bridge. Clayface falls into the river below and dissolves. The game's cutscenes have since come to be known as the infamous "Lost Episode" of ''Batman: The Animated Series'', though it is not considered canonical to the DC Animated Universe.
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears on the final level of [[SNES]] version of ''[[The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin]]'', as one of several villains trying to take down Batman.
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface is the second boss of ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]'', again voiced by Ron Perlman. Along with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], he is manipulated by Sin Tzu into escaping Arkham Asylum and challenging Batman. Clayface takes over a chemical factory, intending to mutate Gotham's citizens into clay like himself, hoping that this will leave them more likely to search for a cure.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Benjamin Jansen]]. He attacks Gotham S.C.U. until the players activate a containment unit to trap Clayface. In the villain campaign, the players free Clayface from his containment unit. The players also confront Clayface again in the Old Gotham Subway duo instance, where he first appears taking the shape of Two-Face. After defeating him, Two-Face tells the player through communicator that "the Penguin must have promised him a cure for his unfortunate condition. He has not yet learned that the cure is worse than the disease".
* Although he does not make an appearance as Clayface, Basil Karlo is referenced in ''[[Gotham City Impostors]]''. There are posters on both sides of the theatre that depict a masked man, above of which are the words "Basil Karlo in..."
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface is mentioned in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' during [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]'s fight dialogue with her own doppelganger who is mistaken for being Clayface's disguise.

====''Lego''====
{{main|Lego Batman}}
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He is a lieutenant of the [[Riddler]] and the first [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of Chapter 1 "The Riddler's Revenge". The Riddler assigns him to steal a key from Gotham Bank, and the two of them blow up the bank vault containing the key. In the villain campaign, he gives the key to the Riddler, and then he notices the gold bars, and plays around with them, even building a house out of them - which appears as a minikit. In the hero campaign, he is looking at a silver bar, then he prepares to battle [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. However, the Dynamic Duo defeats him by blowing up the silver Lego objects he stands by, and using a batarang to spray gas and make him fall into the cage that contained the key, where Robin apprehends him. When Batman chases the Riddler, he makes Batman trip, but the Riddler leaves without him. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in [[Arkham Asylum]] making cups out of clay. His two abilities are super strength and double jump, and he is the only one of the Riddler's followers (excluding the Riddler himself) that is not immune to toxins. His look and structure is that of the Matt Hagen version from the DC Animated Universe (though his biography says differently).&lt;ref&gt;''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; His actions and mannerisms suggest a low level of intelligence, e.g. when he steals the key in the villain campaign, he tries to cram the key horizontally through the opening of the cage until the Riddler rotates it vertically. In the DS version, he is Hagen instead of Karlo, despite having the same design as Karlo.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface makes an appearance in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appears as a boss fight and unlockable character, found in an alley behind Gotham Bank. Before the fight, he says, "My mom told me I could be anything I wanted. Anything!" (which is true after gaining his powers).
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''. He appears in ''The Lego Batman Movie'' adventure pack as the third boss.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears as one of the main characters in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Fred Tatasciore reprising his role from ''Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes''. In comparison to the first two games where he was a mini-figure, Clayface is redesigned with a transformation ability to become a big figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsbeat.com/sdcc18-lego-dc-super-villains-cast-and-devs-dish-on-funever-evil/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Batman: Arkham''====
The Basil Karlo iteration of Clayface can be seen in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game franchise, primarily voiced by [[Rick D. Wasserman]]. 
* Clayface can be seen in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''. Never seen in his true form, he is shown changing into the various likenesses of Commissioner Gordon and [[Quincy Sharp]] (both voiced by [[Tom Kane]]) as well as Aaron Cash (voiced by Duane R. Shepard Sr.) while asking to be let out of his cell (behind a strong glass wall smeared in clay). His biography states he is Basil Karlo, although the presence of a mannequin in the cell hints at Preston Payne's relationship with "Helena". His profile is obtained by scanning him (revealing that he has no visible skeleton unlike all other characters who are scanned), solving the Riddler's riddle: "A case of mistaken identity?". After he is revealed, he stays in Gordon's form for the remainder of the game, and only laughs when the player tries talking to him. When the player returns to the Penitentiary section and finds Warden Sharp gone with the final Arkham Chronicles inscribed on the floor, Clayface as Gordon states that the warden left in a hurry. He is also one of the villains who is listed on the party list.
* Clayface appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. He is seen present throughout the game, posing as a healthy version of [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]) to draw attention away from the dying Clown Prince of Crime. Scanning a poster of ''The Terror'' (a reference to Karlo's first appearance) outside the Monarch Theatre reveals that Clayface had escaped Arkham Island after the events of the previous game by posing as Quincy Sharp, and had been on the run from [[Hugo Strange]] ever since. The plot is revealed after Clayface as Joker is impaled and supposedly killed by [[Talia al Ghul]]. Batman then realizes what has happened, only for Talia to be shot and killed by the real Joker. Finally Clayface reveals himself and takes the cure for the Titan toxin, causing Batman to be highly shocked, as Karlo was not even an inmate of Arkham City. He is the game's [[Boss (video gaming)#Final boss|final boss]], where he reverts to his true form for the fight. Clayface says that he joined up with Joker for the chance to play "the role of a lifetime" before brutally attacking Batman with a series of shapeshifting attacks and spawning miniature Clayfaces. Joker destroys the floor of the Monarch Theatre, sending the combatants into the Lazarus Chamber. There, Batman defeats Clayface and retrieves the cure using freezing grenades and Talia's sword.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', posters for a Basil Karlo comedy are seen next to a theater.
* Although Basil Karlo does not appear in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', he is referenced in posters that say ''Basil Karlo is The Terror'' that can be found in Panessa Studios.
** Several other versions are referenced in ''Batman: Arkham Knight'' via a poster of a movie named "Dark Interlude" starring Matt Hagen and Stella Bates (a reference to the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "Mudslide"), found in the clock tower, as well as other co-stars Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller.

===Miscellaneous===
* In ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #9, Clayface makes a cameo in a flashback sequence along other [[Batman]] rogues.&lt;ref&gt;''The Batman Adventures'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; He finally returns in issue #14, revealing that he survived the fireworks explosion in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Secret Society" and decides to finish off Batman and [[Beware the Gray Ghost|the Gray Ghost]]. However, at the end, he gets mixed with concrete and ends up becoming an statue of the Gray Ghost, ending his threat once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Batman Adventures'' #14&lt;/ref&gt;
* Issue #12 of the comic book tie-in to ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' (which serves as a prequel to the episode "Downtime") reveals Matt Hagen/Clayface's back story as a mediocre member of the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]] who romances [[Talia al Ghul]]. After her father [[Ra's al Ghul]] reluctantly gives the couple his blessing, Hagen reveals that he has cancer and uses her to heal himself in the [[Lazarus Pit]]. After he is submerged, Talia takes revenge on him by locking him there for months. After [[Ra's al Ghul]] uses the Pit, Hagen emerges mutated and insane and attacks Talia, only to be subdued by Ra's al Ghul and Sensei. After convincing Clayface to sleep, Ra's al Ghul uses him against Batman in Gotham upon having Sensei dropping Clayface off in Gotham while demanding an explanation from Talia about how Clayface came to be. Clayface's attack leads up to the team's battle with him in the sewers. In issue #13, Clayface secretly studies [[Young Justice|the team]] and takes down [[Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Kid Flash]], and Robin in each trap. Before Clayface can finish off [[Aqualad]], Batman intervenes and quickly subdues him with a stronger taser, which causes Clayface to dissolve into a puddle.
* In ''[[Batman '66]]'' (which is based off the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s TV series]]), the Basil Karlo name was used for the true identity of '''[[False Face (comics)|False Face]]'''. In issue #23, False Face gets his hands on a shapeshifting formula that transforms him into Clayface.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman '66'' #23&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cryptic pregnancy''' or '''delayed pregnancy''' is a lack of subjective awareness of [[pregnancy]] until the end of [[gestation]] in pregnant women. This condition has an [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of 1:475. Causes are not clear; it is thought to be either psychological&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spielvogel AM, Hohener HC | title = Denial of pregnancy: a review and case reports | journal = Birth | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 220–6 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8573237 | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-536x.1995.tb00262.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; or caused by low concentrations of the pregnancy hormone [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Giudice M | title = The evolutionary biology of cryptic pregnancy: A re-appraisal of the "denied pregnancy" phenomenon | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 250–8 | pmid = 16997498 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.05.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following subset of questions regarding symptoms can help determine "whether a person is pregnant or not?" Of which would be confirmed with a pregnancy test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/am-i-pregnant-or/|title=Am I Pregnant, Or...? - American Pregnancy Association|date=2018-06-09|work=American Pregnancy Association|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Are these symptoms (e.g. nausea, abdominal pain, etc.) ovulation symptoms or symptoms of pregnancy? 
* Visible weight gain is generally noticed around the second trimester, so if the question of pregnancy is derived from weight gain determine if there has been any changes in eating habits or have you missed your last few period

Some people believe cryptic pregnancy is a pregnancy where urine and blood tests are negative because of low hCG and that even [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasounds]] don't show the fetus because it grows much more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crypticpregnancysupportgroup.com/what-is-a-cryptic-pregnancy-and-what-causes-it.html|title=What is a Cryptic Pregnancy and What Causes it?|website=Cryptic Pregnancy Support Group &amp; The Gilmour Foundation|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no medical literature to support their case. While some believe that cryptic pregnancy is due to failure to recognize the active biological role of the fetus in determining the course of pregnancy, some believe that cryptic pregnancy could due to elevated psychosocial stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Giudice M | title = The evolutionary biology of cryptic pregnancy: A re-appraisal of the "denied pregnancy" phenomenon | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 250–8 | date = 2007 | pmid = 16997498 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.05.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequences associated with cryptic pregnancy include antepartum deaths, intrapartum deaths, and neonatal  deaths.&lt;ref name = "Gunnarsson_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gunnarsson B, Fasting S, Skogvoll E, Smárason AK, Salvesen KÅ | title = Why babies die in unplanned out-of-institution births: an enquiry into perinatal deaths in Norway 1999-2013 | journal = Acta Obstetricia Et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 326–333 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 27886371 | pmc = 5347971 | doi = 10.1111/aogs.13067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common main cause of death was infection, neonatal and placental.&lt;ref name = "Gunnarsson_2017" /&gt; Some people believe that cryptic pregnancy can often lead to poor outcome and deaths due to postpartum emotional disturbance,  preterm births, small for gestational age babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenkins A, Millar S, Robins J | title = Denial of pregnancy: a literature review and discussion of ethical and legal issues | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 104 | issue = 7 | pages = 286–91 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21725094 | pmc = 3128877 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2011.100376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptic pregnancy could possibly contribute to increased incidence of fetal abuse, child neglect or even neonaticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller LJ | title = Psychotic denial of pregnancy: phenomenology and clinical management | journal = Hospital &amp; Community Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 11 | pages = 1233–7 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2249803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyborg''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]] . The character was created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George Pérez]] and first appears in a [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #26 (October 1980). Originally known as a member of the [[Teen Titans]],&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Greenberger |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Greenberger |contribution=Cyborg |editor-last=Dougall|editor-first=Alastair|title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page=91|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2008 |isbn=0-7566-4119-5| oclc=213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg was established as a founding member of the [[Justice League]] in DC's [[The New 52|2011 reboot]] of its comic book titles and subsequently in the [[DC Rebirth|2016 relaunch]] of its continuity. However, he has since been re-established as a past member of the Teen Titans again.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Flash]]'' Annual #1 (January 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The character appears in the [[DC Extended Universe]], where he is played by actor [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]]. This adaptation of Cyborg had a cameo appearance in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' and a main role in the 2017 film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'', and is set to appear in a standalone ''Cyborg'' film in 2020. Cyborg is portrayed as a mechanical cyborg, hence the name. Cyborg will be part of the main cast of the upcoming ''[[Doom Patrol (TV series)|Doom Patrol]]'' television series on the DC streaming service played by [[Joivan Wade]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Victor Stone''' is the son of [[Silas Stone]] and Elinore Stone, scientists who use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects. While these treatments are ultimately successful and Victor's [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] subsequently grows to genius levels, he grows to resent his treatment. 

Victor strikes up a friendship with Ron Evers, a young miscreant who leads him into trouble with the law. This is the beginning of a struggle in which Victor strives for independence, engaging in pursuits of which his parents disapprove, such as [[sport|athletics]] and abandoning his studies. Victor's association with underage criminals leads him down a dark path in which he is often injured, but he still lives a "normal" life in which he is able to make his own decisions. However, this rebellious path does not bury Victor's conscience considering that he refuses to participate in Evers' grandiose plans of racially motivated terrorism.

Victor' situation changes radically when he visits his parents' lab where experiments in inter-dimensional access are done. At that moment of his entry, an aggressive gelatinous creature was accidentally pulled through and Victor's mother is killed by it. It then turned on Victor and he was severely injured by its attack before his father was able to send it back to its native dimension. 

With his wife dead and his son mutilated, unconscious and near death from the incident, Silas is driven to taken advantage of prototype medical prosthetic research he has access to treat Victor. Unfortunately, Victor only regains consciousness after the extensive artificial limbs and implants were installed in his body without his consent. Victor was horrified at the discovery of the metallic components, which involve most of the left side of his head and face, and raged that he would rather have died than be such a victim of his father's manipulations.   

Although his bitterness remained for some time, Victor eventually calmed down enough to successfully adjust to his implants physically. He found himself found himself rejected by the public because of his implants, including his girlfriend, who would later thoughtlessly blurt out that she would prefer he had died instead of being in that state. However, Victor's conscience was unbowed, as evidenced by the fact that when Evers tried to manipulate him into participating in a terrorist attack on the [[United Nations]], Victor decided to equip himself with his weaponized attachments and stop him on the top of [[United Nations Headquarters]].

===Teen Titans===
When [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] assembles the [[Teen Titans]],  Victor joins initially for the benefit of a support group of kindred spirits and freaks, and has remained with that group ever since.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;  Fortunately, Victor eventually finds additional new civilian friends of better character such as a group of juveniles who are adjusting to their own prosthetics and idolize him because of his fancy parts and his exciting adventures. It also turns out that their beautiful teacher [[Sarah Simms]], who has often assisted Cyborg and the Titans, admires him as well.

Another person who sees past the cybernetic shell is Dr. Sarah Charles, a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] scientist who helps him to recuperate after having his cybernetic parts replaced. Cyborg and Dr. Charles date for some time and she, along with [[Beast Boy|Changeling]], keeps trying to reach him when he is seemingly mindless following the severe injuries he incurs during the "Titans Hunt" storyline.

===Deaths and rebirths===
[[File:Cyberion2.png|right|thumb|Victor Stone – as Cyberion – is reunited with Sarah Charles.]]
Although Cyborg's body was repaired by a team of Russian scientists after the missile crash he had been in, albeit with more mechanical parts than previously, his mind was not. Eventually, his mind was restored by an alien race of computer intelligences called the [[List of alien races in DC Comics#T|Technis]], created from the sexual union of [[Swamp Thing]] and a machine-planet when Swamp Thing was travelling through space. Cyborg, however, had to remain with the Technis both to maintain his mind and because, in return for restoring him, he had to teach them about humanity. He took the name '''Cyberion''', and gradually started becoming less human in outlook, connecting entirely to the Technis planet.

Eventually, Cyberion returned to Earth, establishing a Technis construct on the moon and a smaller base on Earth. With Vic's consciousness dormant, but his desire for companionship controlling the actions of the Technis' planet, it began kidnapping former Titans members, his conscious mind so suppressed that he was not only searching for deceased Titans, but even sent one probe looking for himself as Cyborg. He ended up plugging them into virtual reality scenarios, representing what he believed to be their "perfect worlds"; for example, Beast Boy was back with the [[Doom Patrol]], [[Damage (DC comics)|Damage]] was spending time being congratulated by the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] as a true hero, and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] was confronted by a [[Batman]] who actually smiled and offered to talk about their relationship. Although the Titans were freed, there was a strong disagreement between them and the [[Justice League]] over what action to take; the League believed that there was nothing left of Victor to save, whereas the Titans were willing to try, culminating in a brief battle, where the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and [[Catwoman]] (who had followed the Justice League to investigate) sided with the League while the [[Wally West|Flash]] fought with the Titans. While Vic was distracted trying to aid his friends, a Titans team consisting of Changeling and the original five Titans were sent by Raven to try making contact with Vic's human side, while [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Power Girl]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Mary Marvel]] moved the moon back to its proper place. Eventually, thanks primarily to Changeling's encouragement, and [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] holding Vic together long enough to come up with a plan, Vic's consciousness was restored, and "downloaded" into the Omegadrome, a morphing war-suit belonging to former Titan [[Minion (comics)|Minion]]. In the wake of this event, the Titans reformed and Vic was part of the new group.&lt;ref name="dc-ency" /&gt; However, he felt less human than ever before.

Shortly after this, [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] revealed he had cloned Vic's body, and by flowing the Omegadrome through the clone, Vic regained his human form, but still had the abilities of the Omegadrome. He often used the Omegadrome to recreate his original look in battle. With his newfound humanity, Vic took a leave of absence, moving first to [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] with [[Beast Boy]] and then to [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. While in Central City, Vic was involved in one of the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]'s schemes, helping Wally hack the Thinker's attempt to plug himself into the minds of Central City's population so that Wally could outthink his opponent, though Vic lost the abilities of the Omegadrome in the process.

===Mentor===
Vic mentored the new incarnation of the Teen Titans, consisting mainly of sidekicks, most of whom have taken over the identities of former members (i.e. [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], the third [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], instead of [[Dick Grayson]], the original Robin and Titans leader), as well as stalwarts such as [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], and [[Beast Boy]], where they have fought enemies such as [[Deathstroke]], [[Brother Blood]], [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], The [[Titans Tomorrow]], and a brainwashed [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] during a team up with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] in the ''Insiders'' storyline. In the end, Cyborg was the only one capable of standing up to Dr. Light, thanks to his solar shields, although he makes it clear that he only won the fight because the rest of the Titans had softened Light up first.

==="Infinite Crisis" and beyond===
During the 2005–2006 storyline "[[Infinite Crisis]]", Cyborg joined [[Donna Troy|Donna]]'s New Cronus team that went to investigate a hole in the universe that was found during the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''. He left [[Beast Boy]] in charge of the [[Teen Titans|Titans]] while he was gone. They arrived at the reset center of the universe and with the help of assorted heroes aided in the defeat of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]], who was attempting to recreate the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] and build a perfect Earth from it.

According to ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 5, Cyborg was fused together with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] after returning to Earth. This was caused by the energy ripples caused by Alexander Luthor Jr. which altered the Zeta Ray Beams the heroes were going to use to return home.

After being severely damaged during the events of "Infinite Crisis", Cyborg was rebuilt over time in thanks to Tower caretakers [[Wendy and Marvin]]. He awoke [[One Year Later|a year later]] to find a wholly different [[Teen Titans#One Year Later: The new Teen Titans|Teen Titans]] being led by Robin, the only member from the team he formed prior to going into space. He is still a member of the team, but feels that [[Kid Devil]] and [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]] are hardly worthy Titans, and thus is attempting to find a way to reform "the real Titans".

After the team along with the Doom Patrol defeated the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], Cyborg asked Beast Boy to rejoin the Titans, but Gar refused, saying that his skills were needed with the Doom Patrol. After returning to Titans Tower, Cyborg began reviewing the security tapes during the last year, in which it appears that he was looked to by all the Titans of the past year for a shoulder to lean on, despite being in a coma-like state.

It appears that although Cyborg has returned to the team, the role of leader is now in the hands of Robin. He does however retain the position of statesman amongst the team and occasionally plays second-in-command.

In ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #3, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman agree that Cyborg should be offered membership in the new Justice League. However, following a battle against [[Amazo]], Green Lantern and [[Black Canary]] take over the formation of the JLA, and Cyborg is not amongst the roster.

In the ''[[Titans East|Teen Titans East]]'' one-shot, Cyborg gathered together a new team of Titans. During a training exercise, the group was attacked by [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]], and Cyborg was blasted by a giant energy beam. He was last seen in a crater, with only his head and torso remaining.

===Titans===
In the aftermath of Trigon's assault in the ''Titans East'' one shot, Cyborg has been placed into a special hoverchair while he recuperates. Cyborg's body is completely repaired in ''Titans'' #5. Soon after, the resurrected and unbalanced [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] enters Cyborg's body, using him to manipulate the defenses at Titans Tower to kill the Teen Titans. Jericho's plans are foiled when [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], the newest Teen Titan, uses his electrical powers to overload the Tower's systems, causing feedback that knocks Jericho out of Cyborg.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering, Cyborg pretends to still have Jericho inside of him, in order to draw out [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]], who was currently targeting Jericho. The plot works too well when Vigilante appears and shoots Cyborg in the head.&lt;ref&gt;''Titans'' vol. 2, #12&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 miniseries===
In an unspecified time during the ''Teen Titans'' comics, a man with enhancements similar to Cyborg's attacks Dr. Sarah Charles on the day of her wedding to Deshaun, a young scientist. Cyborg rushes in for the save, discovering how Deshaun, connected to [[Creature Commandos|Project M]], has sold the technology used to turn Stone into Cyborg to the military. He also finds that the enhanced man was Ron Evers, once Vic's best friend now turned terrorist, who was seeking vengeance for the soldiers used as [[human subject research|test subjects]]. After Cyborg manages to calm down his friend and discovers the truth: Mr. Orr, revealed as the mastermind behind Project M's cyborg research, brings his Stone-derived best subjects: the current [[Equus (comics)|Equus]], an armored form of the Wildebeest, and a cyberized man sporting enhancements even more powerful than Stone's current ones called '''[[Titans East#Titans Tomorrow|Cyborg 2.0]]'''.

Cyborg 2.0 turns out to be the [[Titans Tomorrow]] Cyborg 2.0, snatched from his proper timeline and cajoled by Orr into fighting his younger self for the possession of their shared technology and Orr's permission to use it in the battlefield. Cyborg is soon forced to fight simultaneously against the '''Phantom Limbs''', an elite force of soldiers crippled in the [[Middle East]] and restored by his tech, and the '''Cyborg Revenge Squad''', a broader formation composed of the [[Fearsome Five]], [[Magenta (comics)|Magenta]], [[Girder (comics)|Girder]], the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], and [[Cyborgirl]]. Although the Cyborg Revenge Squad soon gains the upper hand, with the help of his fellow Titans Cyborg is able to hold his own in combat, [[reverse engineer]] on the fly some of the future technology used by Cyborg 2.0, and enhance his own body enough to win against Mr. Orr. He later decides to get a new lease in life, forgiving Deshaun and Sarah Charles on their wedding day for abusing his technology, resuming dating [[Sarah Simms]] and having the Phantom Limbs fitted with new, non-military, prosthetics. It is however implied the Phantom Limbs, unwilling to see Stone's offer as a sign of good will, are trying to get back their weaponized prosthetics and wait for a rematch.

===Blackest Night and JLA===
During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Cyborg joins with Starfire, Beast Boy, and several other heroes to form an emergency team to fight off the army of dead Titans who have been reanimated as [[Black Lanterns]]. He later joins in the final battle at [[Coast City]].

Following the dissolution of the current JLA after ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'', Cyborg is invited by Donna to join [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]]'s new Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #40 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; He befriends [[Red Tornado]], and claims that he has come up with a plan to make him indestructible.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #41 (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

After a battle with [[Doctor Impossible]]'s gang, Cyborg is forced to take a leave of absence from the team in order to not only help rebuild Red Tornado, but also help [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]], who had his arm severed by [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #43&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Victor leads Superboy and Kid Flash to the city of Dakota to rescue the Teen Titans, who had been defeated and captured by [[Holocaust (DC Comics)|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #81&lt;/ref&gt; The Titans emerge victorious from the battle after Kid Flash uses his powers to send Holocaust plummeting into the Earth's [[inner core]].&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #82&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite apparently being written off the team, writer [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] explained that Cyborg will continue to have a presence on the JLA, and will even be given a co-feature in the back of the book for ''Justice League of America'' #48–50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=25804 | title=C2E2: DC Universe Panel | last=Manning | first=Shaun | date=April 17, 2010 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the co-feature, Cyborg battles Red Tornado after he has been driven insane by the power of the [[Alan Scott|Starheart]]. In the midst of the battle, a flashback reveals that Victor had rebuilt Red Tornado using self-replicating nanites similar to the ones that Prometheus infected Roy with after cutting off his arm, thus making the android indestructible.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #46&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg manages to free Red Tornado his power matrix.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #48&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyborg briefly appears in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', where he is shown helping [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] search for [[Maxwell Lord]] after his resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an adventure in another dimension, Static is left powerless, and [[Miss Martian]] is rendered comatose. Cyborg stops the powerless Static from returning to Dakota, and instead tells him that he and a scientist named Rochelle Barnes will be taking him to [[Cadmus Labs]] to find a way to get his powers back and awaken Miss Martian. As Static packs up his belongings, Cyborg and Rochelle have a conversation which reveals that they are lying to Static, and have an ulterior motive for taking the two Titans to Cadmus.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #87&lt;/ref&gt;

He later appears in the final two issues of ''[[The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'', where he helps his former teammate [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] in his attempt to stop [[Bruce Wayne]] from inadvertently unleashing an apocalyptic explosion of [[Omega Sanction|Omega Energy]].

Cyborg and Red Tornado later travel to the moon alongside Doctor Light, [[Animal Man]], [[Congorilla]], [[Zauriel]], [[Tasmanian Devil (comics)|Tasmanian Devil]] and [[Bulleteer]] as part of an emergency group of heroes gathered to assist the Justice League in their battle against [[Eclipso]]. Shortly into the battle, Cyborg and the others are taken over by Eclipso and are turned against their JLA comrades.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #56&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve JLA members are all freed after Eclipso is defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #57 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
{{long plot|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Cyborg JLA.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The redesigned Cyborg as a member of the original [[Justice League]]. Art by [[Ivan Reis]].]]
As of August 2011, Cyborg is featured as one of the main characters in a new Justice League ongoing series written by [[Geoff Johns]] and drawn by [[Jim Lee]] as part of DC's [[The New 52]] relaunch. Johns has said of Cyborg, "He represents all of us in a lot of ways. If we have a cellphone and we're texting on it, we are a cyborg—that's what a cyborg is, using technology as an extension of ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Lucas|title=One Year Ago: DC UNIVERSE Reboots in September|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/DC-Universe-Reboot-Announcement-110531.html|publisher=Newsarama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first storyline takes place five years in the past and details the revised origin of the original Justice League. Victor Stone appears as a high school football star who is heavily sought after by a number of college scouts, but apparently has a distant relationship with his father, Silas. After winning a big game, Victor is shown calling his father and angrily telling him that he broke his promise and missed yet another one of his son's games.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2, #1 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Later Victor appears at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] where his father works. The scientists appear to be working on the [[Mother Box]] that Superman came in contact with from the [[Parademon]]. Victor engages in another argument with his father and tells him that the scouts were there to give him full scholarships to college. When asking if his father will ever appear at any of his games, his father replies "No." Just then the Mother Box explodes, killing the other scientists and destroying most of Victor's body while Victor's father looks on in horror.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2, #2 (October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Silas does everything he can for Victor's survival. He along with Sarah Charles, and [[T. O. Morrow]] go in "The Red Room" in S.T.A.R. labs which contains every piece of technology from around the world. Silas attempts to treat Victor with something that has never been attempted before and he is seen injecting Victor with some type of nanites and having Dr. Morrow put the robotic pieces on Victor (devices such as: a Promethean skin graft, Doctor William Magnus' responsometer, [[Anthony Ivo]]'s [[Amazo|A-maze operating system]], The classified and prototypical B-maze operating system and Ryan Choi's White Dwarf Stabilizer). Vic's life is saved and the energies from the motherbox are incorporated into his new form as Cyborg. This allows Victor to access the vast [[New Gods]] data library and discover [[Darkseid]]'s true invasion plans.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2, #3 (November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following issue we see Victor as Cyborg. As the issue opens Victor cannot feel his hands or legs. He sees himself for the first time with his robotic parts and is panicked by his new body. Suddenly, Parademons burst into the red room and leap toward Sarah Charles. However, Cyborg's defense systems react, automatically weaponizing his arm into a sound cannon from which he fires his powerful white noise cannon, disintegrating the two Parademons and blasting a gigantic hole in the Star Labs building. After saving Sarah's life Victor asks his father what has happened to him, his father tells him that he couldn't let him die. Cyborg obviously distraught exclaims, "You did this to me." and flees, despite Silas' plea for him to wait. Later in the street Cyborg sees a woman being set upon by a group of Parademons. He leaps to the woman's aid, punching the parademon. However, in ensuing scuffle Cyborg inadvertently absorbs some of the Parademon's components giving him access to [[Boom Tube]] technology. This new ability automatically transports or teleports Victor to where [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], and [[Aquaman]] are fighting the Parademons, moments before Darkseid arrives. Cyborg fights alongside the other heroes against Darkseid and his Parademons, but despite their best efforts Darkseid proves to be too strong. Cyborg is able to reverse engineer the alien boom tube technology and with a considerable amount of stress on his systems he is able to teleport all the invading aliens including Darkseid off the planet, saving the Earth. After sending Darkseid back where he came from, Cyborg helps to found the Justice League.

Victor has not begun any process of reconciliation with his father, who is primarily concerned with Victor's mechanics rather than his humanity. Cyborg primarily focuses on his super-heroics, aiding Batman and others when he can and monitoring crime through his cybernetics. After the villain [[David Graves (comics)|David Graves]] makes an attack against the Justice League, Cyborg and his teammates travel to the Valley of Souls. There he learns that he walks the line between life and death. He sees a false apparition of his human self that tries to convince him that Victor Stone is dead and Cyborg is just an imitation. Victor quickly sees past this ruse, and he and the rest of the Justice League defeat Graves. We learn through a conversation with Flash, that Cyborg questions his humanity now that he is part machine and that he lives on the Watch Tower, the Justice League's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Vol.2 #13''&lt;/ref&gt; Flash cracks a joke in an attempt to lighten the mood and assure Cyborg he is still human. During the [[Throne of Atlantis]] storyline, Cyborg at first rejects an upgrade his father has that would allow him to operate underwater at the price of his remaining lung which to him would mean sacrificing more of his humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Justice League Vol. 2 #15&lt;/ref&gt; However following the capture of the rest of the Justice League by [[Ocean Master|Orm]] who sentenced them to the bottom of the ocean, Cyborg—as he calls in reserves to hold off Orm's forces—reluctantly accepts the upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;Justice League Vol. 2 #16&lt;/ref&gt; This allows him and [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] to rescue the others.&lt;ref&gt;Aquaman vol 7 #16&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline, Cyborg gets a visual of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] heading to [[Kahndaq]], to which Batman assembles the Justice League with the help from [[Zatanna]] to meet in Kahndaq to stop Shazam.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #22&lt;/ref&gt; Following the supposed death of [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] in Kahndaq, Batman tells Superman that Cyborg and Martian Manhunter are doing an autopsy to prove his death was not Superman's fault.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #6&lt;/ref&gt; As Wonder Woman leads the [[Justice League Dark]] to go look for Pandora, Cyborg is among the superheroes that remain at A.R.G.U.S. while Batman, Flash, Aquaman, Shazam, [[Steve Trevor]], the Justice League of America, Zatanna, and [[Phantom Stranger]] go to stop Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Dark'' #22&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg was present when [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] tells him, Superman, [[Element Woman]] and Firestorm the true purpose of the creation of the Justice League of America and that she was spying on the Justice League which is how the Justice League of America ended up in Kahndaq.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #7&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Crime Syndicate]] arrives on Prime Earth, Cyborg's old prosthetic parts combine to form a robot called Grid (who is operated by a sentient computer virus).&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #23&lt;/ref&gt; During the Forever Evil event, after Batman and Catwoman drop Cyborg off to his father in Detroit,&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; he makes the choice to willingly receive a new cybernetic body and helps his father and Dr. Morrow create one that is slimmer in appearance so Cyborg could look more human.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #27&lt;/ref&gt; Working together with the Metal Men created by Doc Magus, Cyborg succeeds in shutting down Grid.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #29&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Afterwards Cyborg helped newcomer to the group [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] fit in with the league as the rest set out to find Power ring's missing accessory which flew off after the death of the former wearer.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil #4''&lt;/ref&gt; While on monitor duty he and Shazam experiment with some of his magical powers to aid in finding the ring after joking of having an Xbox in his left shoulder; only for the young ward to conjure up a ping pong table, which they play while having spare time on their hands.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #31&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the call goes out and everyone in the league mobilizes to secure the new rampaging Power Ring before the Doom Patrol does.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #32&lt;/ref&gt; After coaxing Billy into action against Jessica Cruis, Victor moves in to interface with the ring itself, finding out a great deal about the ring of Volthoom and his current host, only to be forcefully thrown out after the ring entity rejects him by causing his systems to short circuit, removing him from the battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #33&lt;/ref&gt; He is last seen recovering at S.T.A.R. Labs, after Shazam rushed him to the med bay, following the power ring crisis. Cyborg wondered what he saw within the ring, after his dad warned him interfacing with it again could trap him in it forever.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #34&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident involving Batman's son, Damian Wayne, during the "Robin Rises Alpha &amp; Omega" story arc in Batman, led up to most of the justice League battling against [[Glorious Godfrey]] and a Parademon horde from Apokolips when they captured the chaos shard and the sarcophagus of Damian, before retreating back home.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin Rises: Omega #1''&lt;/ref&gt; All the league members present, Cyborg included, state to an adamant Bruce Wayne that running headlong into unmarked X-factor territory for a suicide mission was less than ideal, considering the consequences that could befall earth. This eventually culminates with Batman hijacking Cyborg's teleportation systems, to zip up to the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]] in an attempt to retrieve an experimental and highly dangerous combat suit, in order to mete out his agenda; But Cyborg manages to block his administrative access so that he, Shazam, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Lex and Cold could physically restrain him, causing Batman to begrudgingly give up and retire to the batcave.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Robin'' Vol 2 #34&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Bat left, the rest of the Bat Family turned up asking Victor for help with some digitized doppelgangers of baddies that Bruce initially set up in order to distract the League, destabilize watchtower security to secure the Hellbat, and eventually use a personal [[Mother Box]] (secured from a Parademon kept in cold storage) to vacate to [[Apokolips]].&lt;ref name="Batman and Robin Vol 2 #35"&gt;''Batman and Robin'' Vol 2 #35&lt;/ref&gt; After making his way to the [[Batcave]] to meet with them, he's directed over to a console which enabled him to directly access the [[Batcomputer]]'s more sophisticated systems. However, it was all a ruse utilizing a preemptive countermeasure devised by Batman tailored to Cyborg's specific weaknesses. Cyborg was temporarily incapacitated and was set into a VR simulation where he relived his more peaceful days in college, while [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] went to work on '''his''' Motherbox in order to secure a path towards Apokolips and chase after their father. But Victor eventually snapped out of his dream haze and followed them through, angered that they used him in such a way.&lt;ref name="Batman and Robin Vol 2 #35"/&gt; Cyborg traveled along with [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Titus]], who hitched a ride on his leg, to catch up with the rest of the [[Batman Family]]. They all then have a run in with the scavengers of Armegeddo who quickly vacate after some Apokoliptian Hunger Dogs make their way onto the scene. They eventually catch up with the armor-clad Dark Knight ripping his way through a sizable chunk of Apokolips's forces singlehandedly. Jason Tim and Barbara show Batman the Robin Medals Alfred gave them in order to remind him of his purpose, causing him to snap out of his berserker rage and note that Cyborg had reluctantly accompanied them to Hell itself. Having made their way into [[Darkseid]]'s citadel where [[Kalibak]] was readying his Chaos Cannon to fire again, the caped crusaders kept Darkseid's forces occupied while Cyborg made short work of the massive war engine, literally tearing it in half. But when he went to set a timed self-destruct sequence within the Apokoliptian computers, Vic suffered a catastrophic feedback that fried most of his internal systems leaving him inoperable just as Darkseid himself made his appearance.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Robin'' Vol 2 #36&lt;/ref&gt;

While Batman fought and held Darkseid off, Cyborg ran Batgirl through a crash course on how to hot wire his own Motherbox. Since Darkseid smashed Batman's Boom Tube generator, Cyborg was their only chance off Apokolips. After successfully jury-rigging his internal systems, Cyborg and the rest of the Bat rogues made a hasty exit stage left as Bruce powered his recovered fragment of the Chaos Shard with Darkseid's Omega Effect, blasting Darkseid against a wall to cover their escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Robin Vol 2 #37''&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, Cyborg, who is still unable to facilitate himself, wonders what is going on as Damian Wayne is successfully revived, however a second anomaly cranks out of the Boom Tube that was opened and Kalibak comes charging through it. With Kalibak occupied by the rest of the gang, Vic tries his best to reestablish his downed systems. He is successful and gains control over the still-open tube as Batman readies the Batplane. As Batman rams his jet into the evil New God sending him careening back to Apokolips, Cyborg closes the portal banishing Darksied's first born for good. With the threat over, Cyborg heads back topside to inform the rest of the league of what all transpired and stating he has JL business to attend to.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin Rises: Alpha'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

An eponymous ongoing series, by writer David F. Walker and artist [[Ivan Reis]], debuted in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dccomics.com/comics/cyborg-2015/cyborg-1|title= Cyborg #1|last1=|first1=|date=|website= DC Comics|publisher=|access-date= August 1, 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DC Rebirth/DC Universe===
{{Update|date=August 2017}}As of Rebirth, he is a part of the relaunched Justice League bi-monthly series as well as his own solo monthly series. It is unclear whether he has the ability of flight in Rebirth.

During ''Dark Nights: Metal'', he is captured by the alternate Batmen of the Dark Multiverse, who attempt to hack him in order to learn the secrets of his teammates. As the crisis escalates, Cyborg is confronted by the controlling consciousness of other Mother Boxes, who claim that he will only gain the power to overcome the Dark Batmen if he fully surrenders to the Mother Box that powers his body at the cost of the transformation deleting his old personality. He is nearly tempted to give in to this transformation, but the appearance of [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'s soul-self convinces him to hold on to himself while partially succumbing to the transformation. This allows him to free his teammates and 'hack' the multiverse as they travel to find new allies in the battle against the Dark Batmen.

Following this and the Justice League: No Justice miniseries, the Justice League series was cancelled after 43 issues and was relaunched into a new monthly series and Cyborg will also be featured as part of a separate Justice League faction that is part of the new Justice League Odyssey series. In addition, Cyborg's own solo monthly series was also cancelled and ended in June 2018 with the release of Issue 23.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newsarama.com/40498-cyborg-re-cancelled-with-july-august-s-issues-nixed.html CYBORG Re-Cancelled, With JULY &amp; AUGUST's Issues Nixed] -Newsarama&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abilities==
Large portions of Victor Stone's body have been replaced by advanced mechanical parts (hence the name Cyborg), granting him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and flight. His mechanically-enhanced body, much of which is metallic, is far more durable than a normal human body. Cyborg's internal computer system can interface with external computers. Other features include an electronic 'eye' which replicates vision, but at a superhuman level. His mechanical parts contain a wide variety of tools and weapons, such as a grappling hook/line and a finger-mounted [[laser]]. Perhaps his most frequently-used weapon is his sound amplifier (often referred to as his "white sound blaster" in the comic books; the ''Teen Titans'' animated series calls it a "sonic cannon"), which can be employed at various settings either to stun the ears of his foes or to deliver concentrated blasts of [[sound]] potent enough to shatter rock or deform steel.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' #5 (July 1985), pg. 31 The entry on Cyborg mentions both a "sound amplifier" and a "sonic disruptor", and the illustration depicts him using his sonic weapon to shatter a rock. He can also leap great distances.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his mechanical enhancements, Stone possesses an "exceptionally gifted" level of intelligence; his [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] has been measured at 170.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of the New Teen Titans'' #1 (June 1982); ''DC Special: Cyborg'' #1 (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyborg has tinkered over time with his cybernetic parts, enhancing his functions and abilities to levels beyond those set by his father. One feature that sets him apart from the "mass production" version built by Project M is a self-repair system, able to flawlessly repair the mechanical parts of his body, no matter how worn out they are, and even improve the health of the still biological parts to an unknown degree.

'''Cyborg's New 52 (DCnU) functions'''
{{prose|date=November 2014}}
Cyborg possesses cybernetic enhancements that provide superhuman strength, endurance and durability. Cyborg can also interface with computers. Built into his body-armor are an infrared eye with HUD, a bionic ear that allows him to hear sounds from long distance, computer generator, sound amplifier (similar to a sonic cannon), and special programming adapters that allow him to interface with other body extensions. This enhances his durability, strength, speed, and endurance. He also has multiple sensors, and can fly via rocket boosters. While he can use Boom Tubes, he usually use Jump Jets to help him leap great distances. His body can also absorb technology at will, as well as control technology and shift his body. He can also emit an EMP blast to disable any electrical devices within a fifty-meter radius, codenamed the "Heart Attack". His body uses the Grid, a program Vic and Batman created to help him better manage the constant flow of uploading and downloading data he receives on a constant basis; it acts as his solipisistic engram into the Cyberverse/Digitalverse where he can better prioritize and interface with the worldwide networking system, focusing on high-priority items and filter out other received data. As part of the events of the Throne of Atlantis [[Aquaman]] crossover, Cyborg's lungs were replaced by cybernetic lungs that allow him to breathe underwater. His body can also regenerate from damage, and he can enhance his strength.

After he lost his original cybernetic enhancements which became Grid at the end of the Trinity War arc,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; during the Forever Evil event, he has his father Silas Stone and Dr. Morrow help create a new cybernetic body. As explained in that issue, by cutting down on strength, speed, and stamina, Cyborg's new cybernetic body looks slimmer in appearance as Victor describes looking more human compared to looking like a tank. It is unknown whether or not Cyborg had re-integrated the technology stripped from him after Grid's defeat. After a run in with alternate universe invaders calling themselves the "Techbreakers", Cyborg's systems had undergone a complete systems overhaul causing a new operating system to come online restoring him to life and healing his damaged circuitry as well as reintegrating his ruined flesh into it, turning him into a full on techno-organic being.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Sneak Peak: Cyborg''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===Flashpoint===
In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, the timeline is greatly altered. In this alternate version of events, Cyborg is America's greatest superhero (occupying the role held by [[Superman]] in DC's standard timeline). He attempts to put together a group to stop the war between [[Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]'s forces. However, the heroes he approaches all refuse, after [[Thomas Wayne|Batman]] declines.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg connects the resistance member [[Lois Lane]] to spy on the Amazons for any information.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg rescues people in the subway station from arsonist [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abin Sur]] crashes on Earth; he is subsequently taken into custody by Cyborg and the US government to be questioned about his reasons for being on Earth. When Abin Sur is recovering, he is on a mission to retrieve the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]], however Cyborg convinces him to join with Earth's heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''Flastpoint: Abin Sur – The Green Lantern'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Cyborg is seen talking with the President in his headquarters in Detroit. The President states that [[Steve Trevor]] sent a signal to the resistance but was intercepted by a traitor among the heroes that Cyborg tried to recruit and suspicion leads to the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsider]]. For Cyborg's failure, he is relieved of duty as the [[Element Girl|Element Woman]] sneaks into the headquarters. Later, Cyborg is called by Batman and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] for help in tracking down "Project: Superman", the government branch responsible for 'raising' Kal-El after his rocket destroyed Metropolis upon its arrival. Cyborg and them agree to join the cause to stop Wonder Woman and Aquaman, but only if Batman gets to choose who to recruit, and Cyborg agrees as long as he comes with them. The three sneak into the government underground bunkers, and the group comes across a giant vault door bearing the Superman logo. Cyborg opens the door and sees a weakened Kal-El, with the arrival of guards. Forced to escape, Kal-El's powers begin to manifest and flies off leaving them at the hands of the guards.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #3 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; While they are fending off the guards, they are rescued by [[Element Girl|Element Woman]]. Later, Cyborg and other heroes arrive at the [[Marvel Family]]'s place helping the Flash from drastically forgetting his memories. After the Flash is recovering, he asked to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war from casualty, although Cyborg and the heroes are not willing unless Batman wants to join them, because Cyborg explains to him that they believe Batman was invincible. However, the Flash convinces him that no one is invincible and the group of heroes are agreeing to join the Flash. The heroes arrive at New Themyscira to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, and the Flash tells Cyborg to find Aquaman's ultimate bomb to dispose of it.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titans Tomorrow===
In the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' storyline, a future version of Victor Stone called '''Cyborg 2.0''' is a member of Titans East. He is shown having similar plating as the animated Cyborg from the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #17–19 (December 2004 – February 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth-23===
An alternate version of Cyborg appears as part of the Justice League of Earth-23 in the [[DC Multiverse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom Come===
Cyborg appears as the third Robotman as part of Superman's Justice League. Robotman is now completely liquid metal. He is petrified by the nuclear blast.

===''Injustice'' series===
====''Injustice: Gods Among Us''====
Cyborg appears as a character in the prequel comic to [[Injustice: Gods Among Us|the game]], where he joins Superman's Regime to force peace on the world. He serves as Superman's eyes and ears over the world, offering insight on any activity deemed disruptive. At the end of Year Two he discovers someone is trying to hack into the Regime's system during a war with the Green Lantern Corps (Oracle) and goes to the Watchtower to locate her. Jim Gordon follows and corners him, managing to rip Cyborg's metallic face plate off and knock him unconscious, stopping the locating sequence. Cyborg spends most of the next year a prisoner of the Insurgency until he is released when the two groups collide in a battle that nearly destroys them when Trigon and Mr. Mxyzptlk get involved. In Year Four he and the Regime are confronted by the Greek Gods, who want Superman to step down as ruler. While the Regime is forced to go underground, they come together to defeat the gods once and for all. During Year Five tension grows among the Regime because of Superman's growing hostility and controversial decisions, such as enlisting the aid of villains to help the Regime. Cyborg is especially disgusted when he discovers that during a rally with supporters of the Joker who reject Superman, the Man of Steel killed over two hundred defenseless protesters in anger. Batman and Batwoman later go to the Hall of Justice to kidnap Cyborg because he is the only one aware of this and has the information stored in his data. He is incapacitated and taken underground to the ruins of Metropolis where Batgirl works to find the data and reveal to the world. While they succeed in finding it, Raven casts a massive black out over the world to prevent the video from being seen, and the Insurgency is forced to retreat before Flash comes to get Cyborg. Superman has Cyborg erase any data containing information on his killings so the incident will not repeat itself.

====''Injustice 2''====
Cyborg appears in a prequel comic to the [[Injustice 2|sequel game]]. He remained in prison with Superman, even after the League of Assassins and impostor Batman's [[Suicide Squad]] raid the Ryker's Island to free only Damian Wayne/the current Nightwing.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animation====
* Cyborg appeared in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (the final incarnation of ''[[Super Friends]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animatedsuperheroes.com/2008/05/super-powers-team-galactic-guardians.html The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians] animatedsuperheroes.com&lt;/ref&gt; voiced by [[Ernie Hudson]]. Cyborg's origin was told via a medical journal read by Dr. Martin Stein saying Cyborg was a promising decathlon athlete until an accident destroyed most of his body and his father replaced part of his body with machine parts. Also, he is not a [[Teen Titans|Titan]]. He becomes fast friends with teammate [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. He is an affiliate of the [[Justice League of America]] under [[Superman]]. In the introductory episode to Cyborg, "The Seeds of Doom", Cyborg's abilities save Earth from Darkseid's seeds, but as Superman warns, make Darkseid a dangerous enemy to Cyborg, so Cyborg joins the team and proves a valuable asset.
* When ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' was pitched to the [[Kids' WB]] network, the lineup originally included three young members as protégés for the Justice League. The members would have been [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Bart Allen|Impulse]], and an original character described as a '''teenage female version of Cyborg''' '''([[Villainy Inc.|Cyborgirl]])''' or '''[[Natasha Irons]]'''). The promo is viewable on the fourth disc of the ''Justice League'' Season One boxset.
[[File:CyborgTTgo!.png|250px|right|thumb|Cyborg using his Sonic Cannon in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.]]
* Cyborg appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Khary Payton]]. This version of Cyborg is very similar to his comic book counterpart. His nickname is 'Cy' and, like most of his teammates, is never referred to by his given name. However, he does take the alias 'Stone' (based on his real last name) in the Season 3 episode "Deception". The two main differences are his design and that he is more easygoing than his comics counterpart. His head is considerably more rounded and bald (based on his ''Titans Hunt'' counterpart), and his mechanical parts are bulkier. His primary weapon is a sonic cannon housed in his forearm; initially he uses only his right arm to fire, but later episodes reveal that his left arm has an identical cannon built into it as well. Other onboard weapons and tools, such as an [[acetylene]] torch, a remote-operated [[video camera]], and several [[missile launchers]], can be deployed as needed, and his arms and legs are detachable. He is also capable of shooting the same blasts from his cannon out of the bottom of his foot (shown in the episodes "Winner Take All" and "Titans East"). Cyborg is the Titans' chief technician and gadgeteer. He is responsible for the construction of Titans Tower's electronic and security systems and the team's main vehicles (the T-Car and T-Sub, later converted into the T-Ship). His most dominant personality faults featured in the series are his enormous appetite and a tendency to be overly vain about his work ("Deep Six", "Car Trouble" and "Wavelength"); as a result, he fosters a special dislike for those who abuse his devices irresponsibly, especially [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] and [[Brother Blood]]. On occasion, Cyborg acts as the team's second-in-command, but he tends to [[wikt:butt heads|butt heads]] with [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] on rather trivial matters. He also is good friends with [[Beast Boy]]. In "Deception" it is revealed that he never had a chance to finish high school due to the circumstances that made him what he is. The only time Cyborg's personal history has been discussed is in "Deception" in which he discusses his involuntary cyborg status with [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], and in "The End" when [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] creates duplicates that reflect the dark side of each character. During the fight between Cyborg and his duplicate, Cyborg's dark duplicate says "Go ahead! Run cryin' home to Mommy! Oh that's right. You don't ''have'' a mommy.". Despite his easy going nature he has shown to be very serious. In "Go!" which revealed how the Teen Titans met, and the spin-off comic book series ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' revealed that his mother died, and he was injured to the extent he required his cybernetic implants in a car accident.
* Cyborg appears in ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]''. In episode 44, Cyborg (voiced by [[Hugh Davidson (actor)|Hugh Davidson]]) is seen competing in a half-machine competition against [[Winter (dolphin)|Winter the Dolphin]] and [[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|Hiccup and Toothless]]. In episode 45, a segment that parodies [[Teen Titans]] with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' has Cyborg (voiced by [[Gary Anthony Williams]]) disappointed that his ship was taken down by an iceberg and fires on it. In episode 46, Cyborg joins the other superheroes in a musical number that asks Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman on why they are called "Super Friends". On his part, Cyborg was seen paying Wonder Woman when the chorus sings about the "union dues". In here, Cyborg's mechanical eye is on the wrong side.
* Cyborg returns in the ''[[DC Nation Shorts|New Teen Titans]]'' series of shorts with Khary Payton reprising his role except for "Lightning Round" where he is instead played by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].
* Cyborg returns in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' with Khary Payton reprising his role. He is Beast Boy's best friend and his favorite food is burgers. In this show, Cyborg is half and half on the fact that he's part robot as while he misses some things he had as a human (the sweet feeling of knee skin), he also enjoys the cool things half robots do. When not fighting crime, he is depicted as being a lazy slob, which has made him very knowledgeable of 80s culture. He also has a relationship with [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]], which the Titans disapprove of due to Jinx being a member of the H.I.V.E. Five.
* Cyborg appears as part of the Justice League in the television special ''[[Lego DC Comics: Batman Be-Leaguered]]'', with Khary Payton reprising his role.
* Cyborg appears in the animated web series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced again by Khary Payton.
* Cyborg appears in the animated series ''[[Justice League Action]]'', once again voiced by Khary Payton.

====Live-action====
* Cyborg appeared in the 15th episode of ''[[Smallville|Smallville']]''s [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth season]], which was also titled "Cyborg". In this version, Victor ([[Lee Thompson Young]]), is a former Metropolis High School football star. He is involved in a car accident that kills him, supposedly, and the rest of his family. However, he is secretly rebuilt by Cyntechnics scientists including Dr. Alistair Krieg ([[Mackenzie Gray]]), who experimented on a group of test subjects. Victor was the only test subject to survive the experiments. Cyntechnics was bought up by LuthorCorp shortly before Victor's escape. [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex]] denies any knowledge of Cyntechnics' secretive activities. Although Victor's cybernetic enhancements are entirely [[endoskeleton|endoskeletal]] instead of [[exoskeleton|exoskeletal]] as they are in the comics and other media, a shot of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]'s [[X-ray vision]] reveals that Victor's cranial armor covers the same-shaped area as it does in the comics. He also bleeds a dark fluid as he does in the comics. ''Smallville'' never uses the name "Cyborg" in his first appearance. Instead, Victor refers to his enhancements as "[[bionics|bionic]]", and the episode explicitly references the 1970s [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' which also featured a cybernetically-enhanced "bionic" man. Lee Thompson Young reprised his role in "Justice", a [[Smallville (season 6)|Season 6]] episode about [[Green Arrow]] gathering together a group of individuals to combat Lex Luthor and his experiments. In this episode, Victor has finally taken the name "Cyborg", as Green Arrow's team uses [[code name]]s. Also on the team are [[Aquaman]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]. While Victor was last seen with a girlfriend named Katherine, he explains that his mechanical parts put a strain on the relationship. After their eventual break up, Victor states that it was Green Arrow who kept him from committing [[suicide]]. The episode also shows Cyborg wearing something of a costume (a stylized silver vest), and utilizing further enhancements Green Arrow gave him. One of his new functions allows him to hack into and disable security systems. While connecting to machines, Cyborg's left eye glows red, another nod to his comic book incarnation. Cyborg gets mentioned by codename in the season 9 episode "Checkmate" by Amanda Waller, demanding to know the names and faces of everyone who ever worked for Watchtower (aka Clark and Chloe). Young again reprised his role as Victor Stone in the season 9 finale titled "Salvation". He reported in to Watchtower of the battle against the Kandorians. Cyborg is a main character in the online animated ''Smallville'' spin-off ''Smallville Legends: Justice &amp; Doom'' along with the other Justice Leaguers. In episode three, he displays additional abilities such as offensive sound wave projection.
* In 2018, it was announced that Cyborg would be the driving force bringing together the eponymous superhero team in ''[[Doom Patrol (TV series)|Doom Patrol]]'', portrayed by [[Joivan Wade]], one of the inaugural television web series on [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/doom-patrol-live-action-series-greg-berlanti-set-at-dc-digital-service-1111715 |title='Doom Patrol' Live-Action Series From Greg Berlanti Set at DC Digital Service |date=May 14, 2018 |accessdate=May 14, 2018 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/doom-patrol-diane-guerrero-crazy-jane-dc-universe-live-action-series-1202436765/ |title=‘Doom Patrol’: Diane Guerrero To Play Crazy Jane In DC Universe Live-Action Series |first=Denise |last=Petski |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 30, 2018 |accessdate=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2018/08/09/breaking-news-cyborg-powers-up-dc-universes-doom-patrol|title=Breaking News: Cyborg Powers Up DC Universe's Doom Patrol |first=Tim |last=Beedle |work=DC Comics |date=August 9, 2018 |accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/09/dc-doom-patrol-series-cyborg-joivan-wade/ |title=DC's ''Doom Patrol'' series upgrades ''The First Purge'' star to Cyborg |last=Romano |first=Nick |date=August 9, 2018 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher= |access-date=August 10, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====
* Cyborg appears in ''[[Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo]]'' movie, voiced by Khary Payton. In the movie, Cyborg goes to Tokyo with the rest of the Titans to find Brushogun. However, he ends up going to an "all you can eat" buffet instead, angering the cook, who cannot satisfy Cyborg's appetite. After its revealed that Brushogun is being used by the local detective for his own selfish purposes, the Titans manage to pull the withered old ink wizard free of the machine stealing his magic to create soldiers. Cy then says "it's about time" when Robin and Starfire finally share a romantic kiss. At the end of the film, Cy is given a large meal as thanks for his help in saving Tokyo.
* An unnamed alternate version of Cyborg from a parallel Earth appears briefly in the animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', working as a "Made Man", lackeys of the [[Crime Syndicate]], among many other alternate versions of well known characters from DC Comics.
* Cyborg appears in ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'', voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Justice-League-Doom-Cast-1038097.aspx|title=Nathan Fillion, Tim Daly and Michael Rosenbaum Join Justice League: Doom|work=TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, this version is depicted as a cheerful but resourceful person. Cyborg is called by [[Batman]] during a fight with the [[Royal Flush Gang]] using a new type of dimensional projector. He states that this is not their standard M.O.. He ends up working alongside the [[Justice League]] after saving [[Wonder Woman]] from a deadly nanite poison created by [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]. Cyborg aids the team during the final battle against [[Vandal Savage]] and the [[Legion of Doom]], and is later inducted into the team for his role in averting the destruction of Earth (in a clear connection to The New 52 team).

* Cyborg appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'', voiced by [[Michael B. Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greys-Anatomy-Kevin-McKidd-Justin-Chambers-Justice-League-Flashpoint-Paradox-1064095.aspx|title=First Look: Grey's Anatomy Stars Get Animated for Justice League|work=TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film's beginning, he appears with the [[Justice League]] to disarm [[Professor Zoom]]'s bombs. With [[Captain Atom]]'s help, Cyborg disarms [[Captain Boomerang]]'s bomb. In the distorted Flashpoint timeline, Cyborg is America's greatest superhero. He puts together a [[Secret Six (comics)|group]] to stop the war between [[Aquaman]]'s and [[Wonder Woman]]'s forces, however, [[Thomas Wayne|Batman]] is the only holdout. After [[Lex Luthor]]'s death to intercept Aquaman's doomsday device, Cyborg is relieved of duty. Later, Cyborg is called by Batman and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] for help in tracking down the government branch responsible for holding [[Superman|Kal-El]]. The three sneak into the underground bunkers, and eventually find a weakened Kal-El. After Kal-El's powers deals with the guards and Flash's worsening seizures, Cyborg and the other heroes are motivated by Flash to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war on their own. When the heroes arrive to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, Cyborg confronts Aquaman. Aquaman almost kills Cyborg, however, Kal-El arrives but cannot save Cyborg from dying from his wounds. His fate was, however, undone after Flash restores the world's timeline.
* Cyborg appears in ''[[Justice League: War]]'', voiced by [[Shemar Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2013/07/initial-details-cast-and-crew-information-for-upcoming-justice-league-war-animated-feature/|title=Initial Details, Cast And Crew Information, For Upcoming "Justice League: War" Animated Feature|work=worldsfinestonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie starts with Victor Stone as a human and a skilled football player (nicknamed "Victory"). However, Victor's father deliberately misses his games, believing that the physical prowess of an ordinary human will be meaningless in the future world of superhumans. Victor's mother seems to be dead by the time the movie starts. At the beginning of the [[Apokolips]] invasion, Victor is hit by an energy blast (the energy being similar to that used to create new Parademons) and left without a right arm or left leg. Barely alive, he is brought by his father to an advanced machine assembled by him from technology across the world. His father attempts to use the machine to heal Victor, but the process ends up with the machine fusing to his body. At first, he is completely covered by metal, but some parts break off his face during the battle, making him look much like his other versions. His former becomes sleeker after he crash-lands in front of the yet-to-be-formed Justice League. He was shown to be capable of interfacing with Apokoliptean technology, to the extent of halting the invasion by inverting all the [[Boom tube|Boom Tubes]] used for the invasion. In the final scene, when the heroes are being honored, Victor's father is shown in the crowd, finally proud of his son.
* Cyborg appears in the animated film ''[[JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time]]'', voiced by [[Avery Waddell|Avery Kidd Waddell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2014/01/target-exclusive-jla-adventures-trapped-in-time-movie-hitting-dvd-january-21st-2014/|title=Target-Exclusive "JLA Adventures: Trapped In Time" Movie Hitting DVD January 21st, 2014|work=worldsfinestonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cyborg appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: Throne of Atlantis]]'', with Shemar Moore reprising his role. Continuing on from ''War'', Cyborg is still adapting to not having a normal life. He resides at the Hall of Justice, which was built for the Justice League; however, only Shazam comes to visit. Cyborg explains that "there is no Justice League" – it's just something the human race came up with to make themselves feel safe. He also has had some of his remaining internal organs replaced with machinery, allowing him to spend extended periods underwater or in space. A former assistant of his father's, who has a crush on him, tries numerous times throughout the film to ask him on date, but her indirect methods fail (although until the end of the movie he finally asks her out). Cyborg proves valuable as he can project images of what he's seen; this allows him to broadcast Ocean Master's boasting about killing his mother, thus making the Atlanteans ally themselves with the hybrid Arthur Curry/Aquaman, the only other heir to the throne.

One of this version's mid-battle quotes is "boo-yah" from ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.

Luckily for Maxwell, they do not find it but they get away and spring [[Amazo]] from his Watchtower cell. Maxwell assists Cyborg in defeating Amazo. Later, Cyborg is hacked by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], leaving him unable to move. As such, he is the only Justice Leaguer who does not fight their nemesis again. He is fixed by Maxwell. When Brainiac teleports the rest of the Justice League, Cyborg attempts to suggest bringing alternate versions of the Justice League to defeat Brainiac, but he to is teleported before he can finish his sentence. Maxwell and Lily figure out what he was saying. Cyborg later bids Maxwell and Lily farewell with the rest of the Justice League.
* Cyborg appears as a playable character in the video game ''[[Infinite Crisis (video game)|Infinite Crisis]]''.
* Cyborg returns as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', with [[Khary Payton]] reprising his role. This version is still allied with Superman's Regime. In the story mode, it is revealed that he joined the Regime due to his anger over the deaths of his follow Titans such as Starfire and Beast Boy. Cyborg is revealed to be imprisoned at the Red Son prison along with Damien and Superman. Batman assigns Firestorm and Blue Beetle to guard the prison. However Black Adam, Wonder Woman, and Supergirl attack the prison to free them. Batman arrives and admits he can't beat Brainiac alone causing him to free Superman and join forces with the Regime to stop Brainiac. Calling a temporary truce, the Regime and Batman's allies plan how they will confront Brainiac. Catwoman states they will need Cyborg to restore communications by fixing Brother Eye. Cyborg however refuses at first due to his animosity towards Batman. However Superman appears in uniform and points out that that is not the issue, as Kara saw first hand how Brainiac destroyed Krypton and that they have less than 48 hours before he does the same to Earth. Batman agrees saying that without tight coordination they will lose valuable time and Superman tells Cyborg they must fix Brother Eye. Batman has Catwoman and Harley go with Cyborg as he will need their help into getting into the Batcave. Catwoman tells Cyborg that they will get in using the old Underground located under Arkham Asylum, though Cyborg is uncomfortable working with the former criminals. However upon arriving at the Asylum they are attacked by Poison Ivy with pheromones though Cyborg manages to blow them away saving himself and Catwoman, though Harley is not so lucky and falls under Ivy's control. Ivy taunts the pair and Harley begins convulsing which Ivy reveals is due to the pheromones causing her to go into shock. After Ivy is defeated, Catwoman asks Cyborg if he has a defibrillator and he confirms he does, causing Catwoman to order him to use it to save Harley's life. Harley is successfully revived and the trio continue their journey to the Batcave. They eventually arrive at the Batcave entrance which Catwoman and Harley open. Catwoman orders Harley to guard the entrance while they fix Brother Eye. Cyborg detects enemies on his built in radar just as they are shot at by Deadshot, though Cyborg manages to deflect it with his energy shield. They are then confronted by Deadshot and Bane. After dealing with Bane and Deadshot, the two reach Brother Eye. Cyborg states that Brother Eye will need a clean power source that Brainiac cannot access and Catwoman suggests the backup generators. However Brainiac appears on Brother Eye's screen. Brainiac calls Victor Stone the pinnacle of human evolution, though states that his humanity inhibits his true potential and that he must purge it. Victor however rejects the idea saying that he's a team player and that humanity is his team. Brainiac blasts him with a beam of energy from the Brother Eye screen which causes [[Grid (comics)|Grid]] to emerge from Cyborg as a separate entity. Grid reveals he is Cyborg's vast memory and intellect liberated from the weakness of flesh and emotion. Grid reveals he was originally a subroutine in Cyborg's systems and an anomaly that never fathomed an existence separated from him though he now realizes his perfection and Cyborg's obsolescence. Grid is defeated and the back up generator is activated. Cyborg begins hacking into Brother Eye, though Brainiac states that no human can gain control his neural network though Cyborg states he is not trying to and reveals he is teaching Brother Eye to ignore Brainiac. Brainiac says that this minor success will not save them as Brother Eye is freed from Brainiac's control. Catwoman welcomes Brother Eye back and he greets her, though he detects Cyborg's presence in the Batcave and begins deploying countermeasures due to being unaware of the truce with the Regime, though Catwoman manages to override it ordering Brother Eye to stand down. Catwoman then orders Brother Eye to activate communications allowing Regime and Insurgency to focus on rescuing civilians before attacking Brainiac. After Superman is seemingly killed by Brainiac during the battle with his Skull Ship in Metropolis, Cyborg arrives with Green Lantern and Aquaman via Boom Tube. Brainiac informs them that in one hour his Betas will explode burning the Earth's atmosphere rendering their world a barren moon unless they hand over Kara Zor-El, though Batman refuses. Cyborg suggests they try shorting them out with an insane amount of power. Black Adam suggests they use magic to generate that kind of power and suggests using the Rock of Eternity to do so though he will need an artifact that can channel that kind of power, causing Aquaman to suggest they use his Trident of Atlantis. Catwoman however points out that Cyborg noted that Brainiac controls the ship with his thoughts and asks how they can deal with that, though Cyborg states that he was able to cut Brainiac from Brother Eye so he should be able to create a signal disruptor to separate Brainiac from his neural network, thus if they can get the shields down he can disarm the Beta Bombs. The plan works allowing Batman and Supergirl to enter the Skull Ship though Kara is captured though Superman is revealed to be alive and joins forces with Batman to take down Brainiac. However they argue on how to deal with Brainiac, with Superman and his Regime followers favoring killing Brainiac as Superman believes Cyborg and him should be able to gain control of the ship and restore the cities and worlds in Brainiac's collection while Batman and his allies including Supergirl favor sparring Brainiac fearing they could lose more cities without his help. If Superman is selected, the Regime is restored and Supergirl is imprisoned while Cyborg assists Superman in becoming one with Brainiac's ship which allows Superman to use Brainiac's technology to brainwash Batman, threatening to do the same to Kara if she refuses to side with him. In Cyborg's character ending, Cyborg takes Brainiac's 12th level intellect and ship's data core after defeating the villain. He uses his newfound powers to restore the cities that Brainiac stole from Earth and plans on restoring the thousands of worlds Brainiac has stolen with the help of the Titans that he brought back using his new powers and genius. In Starfire's Ending, it is revealed that before Metropolis, Cyborg was a member of the Teen Titans along with herself, Raven, Beast Boy, and Dick Greyson though after Metropolis, Beast Boy disappeared and was presumed dead which caused Cyborg to join the Regime while Raven fell under the influence of Trigon.

The bodies of the three brothers were discovered in July 2001 in a mass grave containing 70 Albanians in rural Petrovo Selo, Serbia, near a Serbian police facility. The bodies were found with their hands bound and with gunshot wounds to their heads. The indictment against the alleged perpetrators says the brothers were brought to the edge of the pit and shot in the head, causing them to slump into a mass grave atop 70 corpses dumped there earlier.&lt;ref name="iht.com"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/13/europe/EU-GEN-Serbia-Slain-Americans.php Defendants in murder trial of 3 Albanian Americans temporarily released - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agron (23), Mehmet (21) and Ylli (25) were American citizens of Kosovo Albanian origin born near [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and living in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=bytyqibrothers.org|title=The Bytyqi Brothers|url=http://www.bytyqibrothers.org|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the rebellion started in Kosovo they decided to go to Kosovo and fight in [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]]'s “Atlantic Brigade”.

In July 1999, and immediately after the [[NATO]] aggression to the then [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] ended and the [[Kumanovo Agreement]] was signed, they helped their neighbors&amp;nbsp;– а [[Romani people|Roma]] family from [[Prizren]] ([[Kosovo]])&amp;nbsp;– to return to [[Kraljevo]], from where they escaped during the war. Due to a violation of the Law on Movement and Residence of Foreigners, they were arrested along the transit between [[Kosovo]] and Serbia. They were sentenced to 15 days in prison. Twelve days later after appealing, they were released. Their neighbour Miroslav waited to collect them, but the brothers were instead collected by two men driving a white car with no license plates. They were taken to the MUP Special anti-terrorism unit (SAJ) base. Two days later, they were killed with bullets fired to the back of their heads and buried in a mass grave which already contained the bodies of the massacred [[Kosovo]] [[Albanians]].&lt;ref name="B92 - The Bytyqi Case"&gt;[http://www.b92.net/specijal/bitici_eng/ B92 - The Bytyqi Case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The investigation==
Serbian authorities showed little interest to investigate cases where Serbian police has acted during the war in Kosovo, but since the brothers were American citizens and due to the pressure from US authorities, an investigation was launched. The [[United States]] saw the murder of the Bytyqi brothers as a premeditated crime committed against its citizens; the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) started an investigation while the US Embassy in Belgrade monitored the case carefully.

The main suspect was [[Vlastimir Đordević]], head of MUP’s Public Security and Serbia's assistant minister for internal affairs during the Kosovo war. Đordevic was the commander of the MUP forces in Kosovo in the early 1980s, and one of the most trusted men of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević. In July 1999, Miloševic awarded Đordevic the Medal of the Yugoslav Flag of the First Degree. He was forced into retirement in May 2001, when the cold storage truck{{clarify|what cold storage truck?|date=August 2013}} containing the bodies of Kosovo Albanians was discovered in the Danube. Đordevic is also wanted by the  [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]. Before the investigation started, Đordevic relocated to [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] and since refuses to return. Then Yugoslav Minister of Internal Affairs, Vlajko Stojiljković, allegedly originated the orders.&lt;ref name="bytyqibrothers.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=bytyqibrothers.org|title=Timeline|url=http://bytyqibrothers.org/timeline/|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The killing of Bytyqi brothers is still being investigated by Serbia's War Crimes Court. Two low-ranking police figures who may have marginally abetted the crimes, Milos Stojanović and Sreten Popović, were acquitted of all charges of aiding war crimes in March 2013 because of their marginal involvement in the Bytyqi murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=bytyqibrothers.org|title=Popovic &amp; Stojanovic Appellate Court Decision|url=http://bytyqibrothers.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/popovic-and-stojanovic-appellate-court-decision-january-2013.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-February 2007, the police issued the warrant for [[Goran Radosavljević]], known by his nom de guerre "Guri", after he failed to show up at a trial of Milos Stojanović and Sreten Popović. According to the Serbian media, Radosavljevic left Serbia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0702&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;D=1&amp;O=D&amp;P=42455 JUSTWATCH-L archives - February 2007 (#314)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Radosavljević was in charge of the police training facility where the brothers were illegally detained, executed, and dumped into a mass grave. Radosavljević eventually returned to Serbia and testified in the trial, claiming that he was away on vacation at the time of the Bytyqi brothers' detainment and murders.&lt;ref name="bytyqibrothers.org"/&gt;

Four more officers were detained in late February as the investigation about who exactly ordered and carried out the executions continues.&lt;ref name="iht.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B92 - The Bytyqi Case"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/03/22/europe/EU-GEN-Serbia-Kosovo-Concealing-Crime.php Gruesome details emerge in Serbian mass grave cover up of Kosovo war crimes - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Milenko Arsenijevic, commander of an elite special police unit and three police officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkosovareport.com/?p=9 New Kosova Report - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; None were ever charged.

In March 2007, the US Embassy in Belgrade said the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] will continue to conduct its own investigation pursuant to U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://belgrade.usembassy.gov/embassy/press/2007/b070301.html U.S. Embassy Welcomes Progress in Bytyqi Case, March 1, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial of Sreten Popovic and Milos Stojanovic ==

In a 2012 trial in Serbia two men were found not guilty in aiding in the death of the brothers, in part because of their marginal involvement in the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=11&amp;nav_id=80197&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 prosecutor appeal of the not guilty verdict the acquittals were upheld.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-brings-final-verdict-in-case-of-brothers-bitici&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2014, there are no pending charges in the case and no high-ranking official has been seriously investigated for his or her involvement.

'''Dismemberment''' is the act of cutting, tearing, pulling, wrenching or otherwise removing the limbs of a living thing. It has been practised upon human beings as a form of capital punishment, especially in connection with [[regicide]], but can occur as a result of a traumatic accident, or in connection with murder, suicide, or cannibalism. As opposed to [[surgical]] [[amputation]] of the limbs, dismemberment is often fatal to all but the simplest of creatures. In [[criminology]], a distinction is made between offensive and defensive dismemberment.  Intentional, criminal dismemberment is known as ''mayhem''.

==History==

===Cut apart===
;Sliced to pieces by elephant
Particularly in South-Eastern Asia, [[Execution by elephant|execution by trained elephants]] was a form of capital punishment practiced for several centuries. The techniques by which the convicted person was actually executed varied widely but did, on occasion, include the elephant dismembering the victim by means of sharp blades attached to its feet. The Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting Delhi in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ5CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:travels+intitle:of+intitle:Ibn+intitle:Battuta&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8K36UOuaLImF4gTe4YDoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The travels of Ibn Battuta]", transl. Lee, S, London 1829, pp. 146–47&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Upon a certain day, when I myself was present, some men were brought out who had been accused of having attempted the life of the Vizier. They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives. On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs."|sign=|source=}}
;Quartering procedure in the Holy Roman Empire
[[File:Tiradentes escuartejado (Tiradentes supliciado) by Pedro Américo 1893.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tiradentes|Tiradentes Quartered]]'', [[Pedro Américo]] (1893)]]
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]] emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s 1532 [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] specifies how ''every'' dismemberment (quartering) should ideally occur:&lt;ref&gt;German original "Zu der Viertheylung: Durch seinen gantzen Leib zu vier stücken zu schnitten und zerhawen, und also zum todt gestrafft werden soll, und sollen solche viertheyl auff gemeyne vier wegstrassen offentlich gehangen und gesteckt werden"&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Concerning quartering: To cut and hack apart his entire body into four pieces, and thus be punished unto death, and such four parts are to be hanged on stakes publicly on four common thorough-fares."|sign=|source=}}
Thus, the imperially approved way to dismember the convict within the Holy Roman Empire was by means of ''cutting'', rather than dismemberment through ''ripping'' the individual apart. In paragraph 124 of the same code, beheading prior to quartering is mentioned as allowable when extenuating circumstances are present, whereas aggravating circumstances may allow pinching/ripping the criminal with glowing pincers, prior to quartering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Johann Christoph|title=Hals- oder peinliche Gerichtsordnung Kaiser Carls V. und des H. Röm. Reichs nach der Originalausgabe vom J. 1533 auf das genaueste abgedruckt und mit der zweiten und dritten Ausgabe v. J. 1533 und 1534 verglichen|publisher=J.C. Krieger|year=1824|location=Marburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_o6AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=no#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=91, 60|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of [[Wilhelm von Grumbach]] in 1567, a maverick knight in the Holy Roman Empire who was fond of making his own private wars and was thus condemned for treason, is also worthy of note. Gout-ridden, he was carried to the execution site in a chair and bound fast to a table. The executioner then ripped out his heart, and stuck it in von Grumbach's face with the words: "von Grumbach! Behold your false heart!" Afterwards, the executioner quartered von Grumbach's body. His principal associate was given the same treatment, and an eyewitness avers (confirms)&lt;!--Note that this word "avers" is not a mistake; it means "affirms".--&gt; that ''after'' his heart had been ripped out, Chancellor Brück screamed horribly for "quite some time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortloff|first=Friedrich|title=Geschichte der Grumbachischen Händel, Volume 4|publisher=Friedrich Frommann|year=1870|location=Jena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qw9TAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|pages=156–158|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a highly aggravated execution is illustrated by the fate of Bastian Karnhars on 16 July 1600. Karnhars was found guilty of 52 separate acts of murder, including the rape and murder of 8 women, and the murder of a child, whose heart he had allegedly eaten for rituals of black magic. To begin, Karnhars had three strips of flesh torn from his back, before being pinched 18 times with glowing pincers, having his fingers clipped off one by one, his arms and legs [[broken on the wheel]], and finally, while still alive, quartered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becherer|first=Johann|title=Neue Thüringische Chronica|publisher=Martin Spiess|year=1601|location=Müllhausen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fds-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA648|pages=648|accessdate=2013-03-24}} See also the 3-day long torture and execution method of [[Peter Niers]], who was executed in 1581 for 544 murders, including the murder of 24 women and their fetuses, the latter to be used in rituals of black magic.&lt;/ref&gt;
;A fabled Turkish execution method
In the seventeenth century, a number of travel reports speak of an exotic "Turkish" execution method, where first, the waist of a man was constricted by ropes and cords, and then a swift bisection of the trunk was performed. [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] presents a comparatively prosaic description of the method:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lithgow|first=William|title=The Totall Discourse, of the Rare Aduentures, and Painefull Peregrinations of Long Nineteene Yeares Trauayles from Scotland, to the Most Famous Kingdomes in Europe, Asia, and Affrica|publisher=Nicholas Okes|year=1632|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41oj3JOOUAwC&amp;pg=PA153|pages=153|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"If a Turke should happen to kill another Turke (...) he is brought forth to the market place, and a blocke being brought hither of foure foote high; the malefactor is stripd naked; and then layd thereupon with his belly downeward, they drawe in his middle together so small with running cords, that they strike his body a two with one blow: his hinder parts they cast to be eaten by hungry dogges kept for the same purpose; and the forequarters and head they throw into a grievous fire, made there for the same end .-and this is the punishment for man-slaughter."|sign=|source=}}
[[George Sandys]], however, during the same period, tells of a method as no longer in use, in a rather more mythologized way:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandys|first=George|title=A Relation of a Journey Begun an Dom. 1610.

{{quote|"...they twitch the offender about the waist with a towell, enforcing him to draw up his breath by often pricking him in the body, until they have drawn him within the compasse of a span; then tying it hard, they cut him off in the middle, and setting the body on a hot plate of copper, which seareth the veines, they so up-propping him during their cruell pleasure: who not only retaineth his sense, but the faculties of discourse, until he be taken downe; and then he departeth in an instant."|sign=|source=}}
;Shekkeh in Persia
In 1850s Persia, a particular dismemberment technique called ''shekkeh'' is reported to have been used. Travelling as an official for the [[East India Company]] Robert Binning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/docs/lib-archive/bgallery/Gallery/records/eighteen/binning.html Robert B.M.

When the shekkeh is to be inflicted in a merciful manner, the culprit's head is struck off, previous to bisecting the trunk."|sign=|source=}}

;Korea
Dismemberment was a form of capital punishment for convicts of [[high treason]] in the Korean kingdom of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. This punishment was, for example, meted out to Hwang Sa-Yong in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jai-Keun|first=Choi|pages=135|title=The Origin of the Roman Catholic Church in Korea: An Examination of Popular and Governmental Responses to Catholic Missions in the Late Chosôn Dynasty|publisher=The Hermit Kingdom Press|year=2006|location=Norwalk, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sydu4aOL-WoC&amp;pg=PA135|isbn=9781596890640|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;China
[[The Five Pains]] is a Chinese variation invented during the [[Qin dynasty]]. During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907 CE), [[Waist chop|truncation of the body at the waist]] by means of a fodder knife was a death penalty reserved for those who were seen to have done something particularly treacherous or repugnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benn|first=Charles D.|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang Dynasty|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|location=Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ile3jSveb4sC&amp;pg=PA210|page=210|isbn=9780195176650|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice of cutting in two did not originate in the Tang dynasty; in sources concerning the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE), no less than 33 cases of execution by cutting at the waist are mentioned, but occurs very rarely in earlier material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[http://www.zo.uni-heidelberg.de/md/zo/sino/institute/staff/kampen/eacs_scholar_hulsewe.pdf Hulsewé]|first=Anthony François Paulus|title=Remnants of Chʻin Law: An Annotated Translation of the Chʻin Legal and Administrative Rules of the 3rd Century B.C.

;Current use
Dismemberment is no longer used by most modern governments as a form of execution or [[torture]], though [[amputation#As a punishment in Islam|amputation]] is still carried out in countries that practice [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1371270.php/Saudi_Arabia_chops_off_hand_of_Egyptian_for_theft Saudi Arabia chops off hand of Egyptian for theft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811044139/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1371270.php/Saudi_Arabia_chops_off_hand_of_Egyptian_for_theft |date=11 August 2010 }}, 5 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torn apart===
Dismemberment was carried out in the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Early Modern era]] and could be effected, for example, by tying a person's limbs to chains or other restraints, then attaching the restraints to separate movable entities (e.g. vehicles) and moving them in opposite directions.

====Torn apart by four horses====
Also referred to as "disruption" or being "drawn and quartered", dismemberment could be brought about by chaining four horses to the condemned's arms and legs, thus making them pull him apart, as was the case with the executions of [[François Ravaillac]] in 1610 and [[Robert-François Damiens]] in 1757. Ravaillac's extended torture and execution has been described like this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapié|first=Victor L.|title=France in the Age of Louis Xiii and Richelieu|publisher=CUP Archive|year=1984|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|pages=62–63|isbn=9780521269247|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"He was condemned to be tortured with red-hot pincers on four limbs and on each breast. His wounds were to be sprinkled with molten lead and boiling oil and his body was then to be torn in pieces by four horses, the remains being subsequently burnt."}} 
In the case of Damiens, he was condemned to essentially the same fate as Ravaillac, but the execution did not quite work according to plan, as the eyewitness [[Giacomo Casanova]] could relate:&lt;ref&gt;Described in {{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Irene|title=The A to Z of Punishment and Torture|publisher=Book Guild Publishing|year=2008|location=Brighton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE2KfBWPAt0C&amp;pg=PA103|pages=103–104|isbn=9781846242038|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Damiens' agony went on for hours as each torture was applied. When the horses failed to disconnect the sinews between his body and his limbs, his body, still alive, was quartered with a knife. His friend, the infamous Casanova, reports that he "watched the dreadful sight for four hours." "I was obliged to turn away my face and to stop my ears as I heard his piercing shrieks, half his body having been torn from him."|sign=|source=}} 
[[Image:Tupac amaru execution.jpg|235px|thumb|The execution of [[Túpac Amaru II]], who was dismembered by four horses 18 May 1781.]]
As late as in 1781, this gruesome punishment was meted out to the [[Peruvian people|Peruvian]] rebel leader [[Túpac Amaru II]] by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following is an extract from the official judicial death sentence issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns Túpac Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered in the sentence that Túpac Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out, after watching the executions of his family, and to have his hands and feet tied...

[[File:Brunhilda.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Execution of Brunhilda, engraving by Paul Girardet after [[Henri Félix Emmanuel Philippoteaux]]]]
Queen [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], executed in 613, is generally regarded to have suffered the same death, though one account has it that she was tied to the tail of a single horse and thus suffered more of a [[dragging death]]. The [[Liber Historiae Francorum]], an eighth century chronicle, describes her death by dismemberment as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite book|last=Bitel|first=Lisa M.|title=Women in Early Medieval Europe, 400–1100|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRudk_NcA7cC&amp;pg=PA83|pages=83|isbn=9780521597739|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Then King [[Chlothar II|Chlothar]] ordered that she be lifted onto a camel and led through the entire army.

The story of Brunhilda being tied to the tail of a ''single'' horse (and then to die in some gruesome manner) is promoted, for example, by Ted Byfield (2003), in which he writes: "Then they tied her to the tail of a wild horse; whipped into frenzy, it kicked her to death"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byfield|first=Ted|title=Darkness Descends : A.D. 350 to 565, the Fall of the Western Roman Empire|publisher=Christian History Project|year=2003|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZA4wyCSfUAC&amp;pg=PA223|pages=223|isbn=9780968987339|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cited source for this claim, however, the seventh century "Life of St. Columban" by the monk Jonas, does not support this claim. In paragraph 58 in his work, Jonas just writes: "..but Brunhilda he had placed first on a camel in mockery and so exhibited to all her enemies round about then she was bound to the tails of wild horses and thus perished wretchedly"&lt;ref&gt;Internet History Sourcebooks,[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/columban.asp Medieval Sourcebook: The Life of St. Columban, by the Monk Jonas, (7th Century)], paragraph 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline of Brunhilde being tied to the tail of a single horse and being subsequently ''dragged'' to death has become a classical motif in artistic representations, as can be seen by the included image.

====Torn apart by four ships====
According to [[Olfert Dapper]], a 17th-century Dutchman who meticulously collected reports from faraway countries from seamen and other travelers, a fairly frequent maritime death penalty among the corsairs on the Barbary coast was to affix the hands and feet to chains on four different ships. When the ships then sailed off in different directions, the chains grew taut, and the man in between was torn apart after a while.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Dapper|first=Olfert|title=Umbstaendliche und eigentliche Beschreibung von Africa|year=1670|publisher=J. von Meurs|location=Amsterdam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBs-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167|pages=167|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Torn apart by two trees====
Roman military discipline could be extremely severe, and the emperor [[Aurelian]] (r. 270–275 CE), who had a reputation for extreme strictness, instituted the rule that soldiers who seduced the wives of their hosts should have their legs fastened to two bent-down trees, which were then released, ripping the man in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sabin|first1=Philip|last2=van Wees|first2=Hans|last3=Whitby|first3=Michael|title=The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Volume 2, Rome from the Late Republic to the Late Empire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4aX-W6AVNv8C&amp;pg=PA439|pages=439|isbn=9780521782746|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in an unsuccessful rebellion against the emperor [[Valens]] in 366 CE, the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] met the same fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mariev|first=Sergei|title=Ioannis Antiocheni fragmenta quae supersunt omnia|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2008|location=Berlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY065QbJL7MC&amp;pg=PA374|pages=374–375|isbn=9783110210316|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of [[Darius III]] by [[Alexander the Great]], the Persian monarchy was thrown into turmoil, and Darius was killed. One man, [[Bessus]], claimed the throne as Artaxerxes V, but in 329 BCE, Alexander had him executed. The manner of Bessus' death is rather disputed, and Waldemar Heckel writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heckel|first=Waldemar|title=The Conquests of Alexander the Great|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Chu5MBz1gbQC&amp;pg=PA95|pages=95|isbn= 9781107645394|accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The exact details of Bessus' death are disputed. He may have been crucified, or torn apart by recoiling trees, or (what is most likely) mutilated before being sent to [[Ecbatana]] for execution.}}
The method of tying people to bent down trees, which are then allowed to recoil, ripping the individual to pieces in the process is, however, mentioned by several travelers to nineteenth century Persia. The British diplomat [[James Justinian Morier]] travelled as a special envoy to the Shah in 1808, and Morier writes the following concerning then prevailing criminal justice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morier|first=James Justinian|title=A Journey Through Persia, Armenia and Asia Minor, to Constantinople, in the Years 1808 and 1809|publisher=Longman Hurst|year=1812|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KM-Tdt38mAoC&amp;pg=PA204|pages=204|isbn= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|..for the King never pardons theft, and orders a convicted thief to be executed instantly. The mode is as follows: two young trees are by main strength brought together at their summits, and there fastened with cords together. The culprit is then brought out, and his legs are tied with ropes, which are again carried up and: fixed to the top of the trees. The cords that force the trees together are then cut; and, in the elasticity and power of this spring, the body of the thief is torn asunder, and left thus to hang divided on each separate tree. The inflexibility of the King in this point has given to the roads a security, which, in former times, was little known.}}

====Torn apart by stones====
An obscure Christian martyr, Severianus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienS/Secundus_Carpophorus_Victorinus_Severianus.html Secundus, Carpophorus, Victorinus und Severianus]&lt;/ref&gt; was, about the year 300 AD, martyred in the following way, according to one tale: One stone was fastened to his head, another bound to his feet. His middle was then fastened by a rope to the top of a wall, and the stones released from the height. His body was ripped apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Münchhausen|first=Albert F., Freiherr von|title=Die Attribute der Heiligen, alphabetisch geordnet (etc.) Nebst einem Anh.: uber die Kleidung der kath.

====A Christian martyr withstands being torn apart====
During the reign of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] a Christian named Shamuna was, allegedly, torn apart in the following manner:{{quote|The governor immediately ordered that Shamuna should be made to kneel down on one side and that an iron chain should be fastened on his knee. This having been done, he hung him up head downwards by the foot with which he had made him kneel; the other he pulled downwards with a heavy piece of iron, which cannot be described in words: thus endeavouring to rend the champion in two. By this means the socket of the hip-bone was wrenched out of its place and Shamuna became lame.}}
Some time thereafter, Shamuna was taken down from his hanging position, and was beheaded instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0858.htm Martyrdom of Shamuna, Guria and Habib]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lady Eliza Maria Gordon-Cumming''' (1795- 21 April 1842) was a Scottish [[Nobility|aristocrat]], [[horticulturalist]], [[palaeontologist]] and scientific illustrator. Lady Cumming collected and studied [[Devonian]] fish fossils from the [[Old Red Sandstone]] of [[County of Moray|Morayshire]], [[Scotland]]. She amassed a large and well-known collection which she illustrated, along with her daughter Lady Anne Seymour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burek|first=C. V.|last2=Higgs|first2=B.|title=The role of women in the history and development of geology: an introduction|url=https://doi.org/10.1144/SP281.1|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|volume=281|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1144/sp281.1|year=2007|bibcode=2007GSLSP.281....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Cumming worked with other palaeontologists and geologists of the time including [[Louis Agassiz]], [[William Buckland]] and [[Roderick Murchison]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lady Cumming was born Eliza Maria Campbell in 1795 in [[Inveraray]] to [[Lady Charlotte Bury|Lady Charlotte Campbell]] (later Lady Charlotte Bury) and Colonel [[John Campbell (1770–1809)|John Campbell]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/367680960|title=The biographical dictionary of Scottish women : from the earliest times to 2004|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Ewan, Elizabeth., Innes, Sue., Reynolds, Sian.|isbn=9780748626601|location=Edinburgh|oclc=367680960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was a diarist and [[novelist]] and father a soldier and politician. 

===Palaeontological research===
Lady Cumming was a skilled painter and keen horticulturalist who took up the study of the fossils on her Altyre estate near the [[Moray Firth]] around 1839.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She collected fossils and instructed workers in the quarries on the estate to bring her any they found. She collected a large number of specimens of fossil fish from the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] and began a correspondence with the most famous geologists of the time; [[Louis Agassiz]], [[William Buckland]] and [[Roderick Murchison]] all visited her collection in Scotland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She sent illustrations, letters and specimens around Europe, and intended to publish her illustrations and theories on how these fish would have appeared in life. Some of these illustrations survive in the archives of the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of her ideas about how the fossil remains should be interpreted were later discredited as more fossil evidence came to light, but her illustrations were highly respected.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her work was praised by [[Hugh Miller]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801193210|title=The Edinburgh companion to Scottish women's writing|date=2012|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Norquay, Glenda, 1958-|isbn=9780748644322|location=Edinburgh|oclc=801193210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

&lt;blockquote&gt;...collected these remains and distributed them amongst geologists with the greatest liberality. Lady Cumming had studied the remains with great care, and prepared a series of drawings of all the most perfect specimens with a precision of detail and artistic talent, which few naturalists can hope to attain"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agassiz|first=Louis|date=1842|title=Report on the Fossil Fishes of the Devonian System or Old Red Sandstone|url=|journal=The Geologist|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After his visit to Altyre, Agassiz named a species ''[[Cheirolepis cummingae]]'' (also sometimes spelled ''cummingii'') in honour of Cumming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sketch of the Geology of Moray|last=Duff|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=1842|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species name was later discovered to be a synonym of ''Cheirolepis trialli.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giles|first=Sam|last2=Coates|first2=Michael I.|last3=Garwood|first3=Russell J.|last4=Brazeau|first4=Martin D.|last5=Atwood|first5=Robert|last6=Johanson|first6=Zerina|last7=Friedman|first7=Matt|year=2015|title=Endoskeletal structure in Cheirolepis (Osteichthyes, Actinopterygii), An early ray‐finned fish|journal=Palaeontology|volume=58|issue=5|pages=849–870|doi=10.1111/pala.12182|issn=0031-0239|pmc=4950109|pmid=27478252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the fossils in Cumming's collection were personally identified by Agassiz, and the collection is now held by the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London, and the [[University of Neuchâtel|University of Neuchatel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Wiktionary|fine}}

A '''fine''' or '''mulct''' is money that a [[court of law]] or other [[authority]] decides has to be paid as punishment for a [[crime]] or other [[Offense (law)|offence]]. The amount of a fine can be determined case by case, but it is often announced in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1967184|last=Bray |first=Samuel |year=2012 |title=Announcing Remedies |journal=Cornell Law Review |volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wheel Clamp warning sign.JPG|thumb|150px|A warning sign in Singapore that states the fine for releasing vehicles that are immobilized with wheel clamps by Singapore Police Force officers.]]

The most usual use of the term is for [[financial]] punishments for the commission of crimes, especially minor crimes, or as the [[settlement (law)|settlement]] of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. A synonym, typically used in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] actions, is '''mulct'''.

One common example of a fine is money paid for violations of [[traffic]] laws.  Currently in [[English law|English common law]], relatively [[Standard scale|small fines]] are used either in place of or alongside [[community service order]]s for low-level criminal offences. Larger fines are also given independently or alongside shorter [[prison]] sentences when the [[judge]] or magistrate considers a considerable amount of retribution is necessary, but there is unlikely to be significant danger to the public. For instance, [[fraud]] is often punished by very large fines since fraudsters are typically banned from the position or [[profession]] they abused to commit their crimes.

Fines can also be used as a form of [[tax]]. Money for [[bail]] may be applied toward a fine.

A [[day-fine]] is a fine that, above a minimum, is based on personal income.

Some fines are small, such as for [[loitering]], for which fines range from about $25 to $100. In some areas of the [[United States]] (for example [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], and [[Washington D.C.]]), fines for petty crimes, such as [[criminal mischief]] (shouting in public places, projecting an object at a police car) range from $2500 to $5000.

==Fines by country==

===England and Wales===
In the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], unless the context otherwise requires, the expression "fine", except for the purposes of any enactment imposing a limit on the amount of any fine, includes any pecuniary penalty or pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation payable under a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/section/150 section 150(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In section 32 of that Act, the expression  "fine" includes a pecuniary penalty but does not include a pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/section/32 section 32(9)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In sections 15 to 32 and 48 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], the expression "fine" includes any pecuniary penalty.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/65 section 65(2)] (as amended by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/schedule/7/paragraph/153 paragraph 153] of Schedule 7 to the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]]). This definition previously applied to section 14 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 before it was repealed by the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, there is now a system whereby the court gives the offender a 'fine card' which is somewhat like a [[credit card]]; at any shop that has a paying-in machine he pays the value of the fine to the shop, which then uses the fine card to pass that money on to the court's [[bank account]].

A related concept is the [[fixed penalty notice]], a pecuniary penalty for some minor crimes that can be either accepted (instead of prosecution, thus saving time and paperwork, or taken to court for normal proceedings for that crime. While technically not a fine, which, under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], may be levied only following a conviction, it serves the same purpose of punishment.

Early examples of fines include the [[weregild]] or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] payable under [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[common law]] for causing a death. The murderer would be expected to pay a sum of money or goods dependent on the social status of the victim.

====Criminal law====

=====General information=====
The Dutch Criminal Code ''(Dutch: Wetboek van Strafrecht (WvSr))'' doesn't contain specific amounts for fines for every violation of the law. Instead of that the Criminal Code provides six fine categories. Every penalty clause of the Criminal Code contains a fine category. The categories are:

{| class="wikitable"

|Second
|€4.100
|$2.800
|-
|Third
|€8.200

|Fifth

|-
|Sixth
|€820.000

|}

These sums are only an upper limit, it's up to the judge or the prosecutor to determine the exact sum of the fine. However, the amount of the fine must be at least €3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sums of categories are always 1, 10, 20, 50, 200 and 2000 times the amount of the first category. In addition to the fine, the convict also has to pay an administration fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006717/2014-06-07#Paragraaf3a_Artikel9b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Besluit tenuitvoerlegging geldboeten - BWBR0006717|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; of €9.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2015-37447.html|title=Regeling van de Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie van 19 oktober 2015 tot wijziging van de Regeling vaststelling administratiekosten 2012|first=Ministerie van Veiligheid en|last=Justitie|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amounts are established by the government, via a royal order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the judge convicts an individual to a fine, the judge must also set a term of substitute imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This substitute imprisonment will be executed in the case that the fine remains unpaid. The judge may count one day imprisonment for every unpaid €25,&lt;ref name="overheid.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; however normally judges reckon one day for every €50 which stays unpaid. Though, the substitute imprisonment must be at least one day (even though the fine was €3) and cannot exceed one year (even though the fine was €100.000).&lt;ref name="overheid.nl"/&gt;

=====Execution of a court imposed fine=====

Once a person is irrevocable convicted to a fine, it's up to the public prosecutor to collect the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, the cjib ''(centraal justiteel incassobureau (English: central judicial collection agency))'' is established.

First, the CJIB will send the convict the fine. If the convict pays the fine the case is closed (by paying, the convict loses the right to go into appeal as well), if he doesn't, the case will be continued. The CJIB will then send the convict a reminder, though this reminder will contain an increment of €15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this doesn't lead to the payment of the fine, the CJIB will send another reminder, now with a raise of 20%, however, the raise must be at least €30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fine continues to be unpaid, the CJIB will instruct a bailiff to collect the fine nonetheless. This bailiff may, for example, seize the convict's income and sell his possessions. If these measures do not result in the full collection of the fine, the bailiff will return the case to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will order the police to arrest the convict, in order to execute the earlier written substitute imprisonment. The length of the imprisonment will be percentage-wise reduced if the convict has paid a sum, but not the entire amount of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the substitute imprisonment the convict will be a free man again. He also won't have to pay the fine anymore and the case will be closed.

====Frequently committed traffic violations====

=====General information=====
Before 1 September 1990, all traffic violations were punished via the criminal law. The suspects were first offered a sort of plea bargain. This mostly contains a fine. If the suspect didn't pay the fine of this plea bargain, the public prosecutor had to open a criminal case, otherwise he wasn't authorized to collect the fine through force. The case had to be withdrawn when the capacity of the courts or the prosecutor's office didn't allow the start of a criminal case for a traffic violation. This was the case very often. This situation led to a negative spiral, because traffic offenders hoped and expected their case to be withdrawn, and didn't pay the plea bargain fine. This led to a growing pressure on the capacity of the courts, which causes more sepots (decisions not to prosecute). This encouraged more offenders not to pay, etc.

In order to stop this spiral, the secretary general of the justice department (at that time), Dr. Albert Mulder, designed a new system of law enforcement. Under this new system, the government acquired the right of summary foreclosure. The summary foreclosure means that the CJIB can execute the fine directly, unless the fined subject goes to appeal.

The system regarding frequently committed traffic violations is regulated by Administrative Enforcement of traffic Rules Act ''(Dutch: Wet administratiefrechtelijke handhaving verkeersvoorschriften (WAHV))''. According to the WAHV the maximum sum of the administrative fine is the same as the maximum amount of the first category (Art. 2 section 3 WvSr Criminal Code).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukII_Artikel2 Art. 2 section 3 WAHV]&lt;/ref&gt; The exact fine per violation is determined by an annex of the WAHV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukII_Artikel2 Art. 2 section 1 WAHV]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the fine, the fined subject will also have to pay €9&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; administration costs as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006847/2014-06-07#Paragraaf5a_Artikel11a|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Besluit administratiefrechtelijke handhaving verkeersvoorschriften 1994 - BWBR0006847|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the administration costs will also be determined by the minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2015-37447.html|title=Regeling van de Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie van 19 oktober 2015 tot wijziging van de Regeling vaststelling administratiekosten 2012|first=Ministerie van Veiligheid en|last=Justitie|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Process of the administrative fine=====
Once a subject has been fined by an officer or photographed by a speed camera, he will receive a decision within four months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIII_Artikel4 Art. 4 section 2 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; This decision will contain a short description of the violation, the place and time the violation was committed and sum of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIII_Artikel4 Art. 4 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt;
The subject will have two choices now. He can pay the fine or he can go into appeal. In contrast to the court imposed fine, when the subject has paid the fine, he will keep the right to go into appeal. The subject can go into appeal within six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537/2016-11-03#Hoofdstuk6_Afdeling6.2_Artikel6:7|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Algemene wet bestuursrecht - BWBR0005537|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first instance, the subject appeals to the public prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIV_Artikel6 Art. 6 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor shall withdraw the fine completely when he thinks the appellant has right. He will lower the sum of the fine if he thinks that the suspect is partially right. If the prosecutor thinks that the suspect isn't right, he will uphold the fine. As long as the prosecutor has not made a decision on the appeal, the suspect does not have to pay the fine yet.

Once the prosecutor has made a decision, the suspect will again have two choices. He can pay or he goes into appeal at the sub-district judge of his arrondissement (or the arrondissement of the place where the disputed violation was committed). But now, the suspect has to pay the fine as a surety.&lt;ref name="overheid.nl1"&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukV_Artikel11 Art. 11 section 3 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; If the suspect doesn't pay the surety, the judge will declare him inadmissible (thus the fine will be upheld).&lt;ref name="overheid.nl1"/&gt; The judge will have the same choices as the prosecutor. He can withdraw the fine, lower the fine, or uphold the fine.

If the (remaining) fine is higher than €70 and the suspect or/nor the prosecutor doesn't agree with the sub-district judge's verdict, the suspect or the prosecutor can go into appeal for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukV_Artikel11 Art. 14 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; He does that at the court of appeal of Arnhem-Leeuwarden in Leeuwarden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukVI_Artikel14 Art. 14 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal will be in writing, unless the appellant, per se, wants to do it orally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukV_Artikel11 Art. 20a section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; If the fine is lower than €70, or the appellant's appeal is rejected in Leeuwarden, there will be no legal remedies anymore and the case will be closed. The appellant's surety will be transformed to a fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukVII_Artikel21 Art. 21 section 2 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{homicide}}

'''Foeticide''' (or '''feticide''') is an act that causes the death of a [[fetus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/feticide Definitions of feticide from dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The suffix ''[[wikt:-icide|-icide]]'' is added in place of ''fetus''' last syllable. It derives back to ''occido'', a Latin term meaning "to fell or to kill." Other examples include [[homicide]], [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[matricide]], and [[regicide]].

==Fetal homicide==

===Laws in the United States===
[[File:Map of US, feticide laws.svg|thumb|260px|left|Fetal homicide laws in the United States {{legend|#02ffff;|"Homicide" or "murder".}}
{{legend|#ffff00;|Other crime against fetus.}}
{{legend|#ff3399;|Depends on age of fetus.}}
{{legend|#00ff00;|Assaulting mother.}}
{{legend|#c0c0c0;|No law on feticide.}}]]

In the U.S., most crimes of violence are covered by state law, not federal law.  Thirty-eight (38) states currently recognize the "unborn child" (the term usually used) or fetus as a homicide victim, and twenty-three (23) of those states apply this principle throughout the period of pre-natal development.&lt;ref name="ncsl"&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx Fetal Homicide Laws]. National Conference of State Legislatures, March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These laws do not apply to legally induced abortions. Federal and state courts have consistently held that these laws do not contradict the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on abortion.

In 2004, Congress enacted, and President Bush signed, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], which recognizes the "child in utero" as a legal victim if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of any of the 68 existing ''federal'' crimes of violence.  These crimes include some acts that are federal crimes no matter where they occur (e.g., certain acts of terrorism), crimes in federal jurisdictions, crimes within the military system, crimes involving certain federal officials, and other special cases.  The law defines "child in utero" as "a member of the species ''Homo sapiens'', at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb."

Of the 38&lt;ref name="ncsl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; states that recognize fetal homicide, approximately two-thirds apply the principle throughout the period of pre-natal development, while one-third establish protection at some later stage, which varies from state to state.  For example, California treats the killing of a fetus as homicide, but does not treat the killing of an embryo (prior to approximately eight weeks) as homicide, by construction of the California Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Davis'', 7 Cal.4th 797, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 50, 872 P.2d 591 (Calif. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other states do not consider the killing of a fetus to be homicide until the fetus has reached [[Quickening (medical)|quickening]] or [[Viability (fetal)|viability]].&lt;ref&gt;Hedden, Andrew. [http://www.chronline.org/Feticide%20versus%20Homicide.pdf When is the Death of a Fetus a Homicide?] (Center for Homicide Research 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlawful abortion may be considered "foeticide".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;case=/data2/circs/6th/014124.html Women’s Medical Professional Corporation v. Taft]'' (6th Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetal homicide laws, as well as ordinary murder statutes, are increasingly used to prosecute pregnant women accused of intentionally or recklessly causing miscarriages or [[stillbirth]]s. According to the organization National Advocates for Pregnant Women, [[South Carolina]], one of the first states to pass a foeticide law, has charged only one man who assaulted a pregnant woman under this law, while approximately 300 women have been arrested. Widely publicized cases include that of Rennie Gibbs, [[Bei Bei Shuai]], and [[Purvi Patel]].

Gibbs was charged with murder in [[Mississippi]] in 2006 for having a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] daughter while addicted to cocaine.

==Child destruction==
{{Main|Child destruction}}
In [[English law]], "child destruction" is the crime of killing a fetus "[[viability (fetal)|capable of being born alive]]", before it has "a separate existence".&lt;ref name="bknight"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Bernard |title=Lawyers guide to forensic medicine |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=1998 |edition=2nd |page=70 |isbn=1-85941-159-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crimes Act]] 1958 defined "capable of being born alive" as 28 weeks' gestation, later reduced to 24 weeks.&lt;ref name="bknight"/&gt;  The 1990 Amendment to the [[Abortion Act 1967]] means a medical practitioner cannot be guilty of the crime.&lt;ref name="bknight"/&gt;

The charge of child destruction is rare.&lt;ref name="rare"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1552650/Child-destruction-charge-is-rarely-used.html |title=Child destruction: charge is rarely used |date=27 May 2007 |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman who had an [[unsafe abortion]] while 7½ months pregnant was given a [[suspended sentence]] of 12 months in 2007;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1552651/Jury-convicts-mother-who-destroyed-foetus.html |title=Jury convicts mother who destroyed foetus |last=Britten |first=Nick |date=27 May 2007 |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was unaware of any similar conviction.&lt;ref name="rare"/&gt;

==Use during legal abortion==
In medical use, the word "foeticide" is used simply to mean causing the death of the fetus, usually prior to some form of abortion. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends foeticide be performed "before medical abortion after 21 weeks and 6 days of gestation to ensure that there is no risk of a live birth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/Abortion%20guideline_web_1.pdf |title=3270 RCOG Abortion guideline.qxd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In abortions after 20 weeks, an [[medical injection|injection]] of [[digoxin]] or [[potassium chloride]] into the fetal heart to stop the fetal heart can be used to achieve foeticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vause | first1 = S | last2 = Sands | first2 = J | last3 = Johnston | first3 = TA | last4 = Russell | first4 = S | last5 = Rimmer | first5 = S | date = May 2002 | title = Could some fetocides be avoided by more prompt referral after diagnosis of fetal abnormality? | url = | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 243–5 | doi = 10.1080/01443610220130490 | pmid = 12521492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dommergues | first1 = M | last2 = Cahen | first2 = F | last3 = Garel | first3 = M | last4 = Mahieu-Caputo | first4 = D | last5 = Dumez | first5 = Y | year = 2003 | title = Feticide during second- and third-trimester termination of pregnancy: opinions of health care professionals | url = | journal = Fetal Diagn Ther | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 91–7 | pmid = 12576743 | doi=10.1159/000068068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhide | first1 = A | last2 = Sairam | first2 = S | last3 = Hollis | first3 = B | last4 = Thilaganathan | first4 = B | date = Sep 2002 | title = Comparison of feticide carried out by cordocentesis versus cardiac puncture | url = | journal = Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 230–2 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-0705.2002.00797.x | pmid = 12230443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Senat | first1 = MV | last2 = Fischer | first2 = C | last3 = Bernard | first3 = JP | last4 = Ville | first4 = Y | date = Mar 2003 | title = The use of lidocaine for fetocide in late termination of pregnancy | url = | journal = BJOG | volume = 110 | issue = 3| pages = 296–300 | pmid = 12628271 | doi=10.1016/s1470-0328(02)02217-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"&gt;''[[Gonzales v.

The most common method of [[selective reduction]]—a procedure to reduce the number of fetuses in a multifetus pregnancy—is foeticide via a chemical injection into the selected fetus or fetuses. The reduction procedure is usually performed during the first trimester of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Komaroff, Anthony.

'''Hammerton Killick''' (April 18, 1856 – September 6, 1902) was an admiral in the [[Haitian Navy]].&lt;!-- The New York Times Postage Stamp article has language that may indicate he was the "first admiral"; but I'm not sure what it means by that - first admiral Haiti ever had? Or is first an indication of being higher ranked than other admirals? - and since the article's behind a paywall, I'm not indicating that here until I can get access to it. --&gt; He was killed in the 1902 Fermin rebellion when he refused to surrender his ship to the German warship {{SMS|Panther||6}}. A [[Killick|naval base]] in [[Port-au-Prince]] is named after him.&lt;ref name=Revolution&gt;{{cite book|title=Haiti: A Slave Revolution: 200 years after 1804|date=September 2004|publisher=International Action Center|isbn=978-0974752105|url=http://www.iacenter.org/haiti/flag.htm|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he was honored with a postage stamp.&lt;ref name=Stamp&gt;{{cite news|title=Haiti stamp for defier of Germans|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B01EEDC1230E53BBC4E51DFBF668388659EDE|accessdate=January 31, 2015|work=New York Times|date=September 26, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Killick was an "Anglo-Haitian [[mulatto]]."&lt;ref name=Haiti&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clammer|first1=Paul|title=Haiti|date=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guide|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncDQSIG6mlMC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was of either Scottish&lt;ref  name=World /&gt; or Irish&lt;ref name="Haiti after Emancipation" /&gt; descent.

==Military service==
[[Haiti]] in Killick's time was a poor country, and its navy was ill-equipped, with many of its officers serving under contract from other nations.&lt;ref name="Black Rules White"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hesketh-Prichard|first1=Hesketh Vernon|title=Where Black Rules White: A Journey Through and About Hayti|date=October 15, 2012|publisher=Wermod and Wermod Publishing Group|isbn=9780956183583|pages=77–84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i3-TAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At any given time, the number of ships in the Navy ranged between two and four.&lt;ref name="Black Rules White" /&gt; An observer in 1899 described obsolete, possibly un-[[seaworthy]] ships badly in need of paint being cannibalized for parts.&lt;ref name="Black Rules White" /&gt; Sailors in the navy often had to go without pay,&lt;ref name=Eve&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prence|first1=Katherine|title=ON THE EVE OF REVOLUTION; The Preliminary Fighting in the Streets of Port-au-Prince – Fusillades of Musketry from Soldiers of Contending Parties – Cabinet Minister Who Attends a Voodoo Church – Admiral Killick Runs Off with the Navy – How He Defied the Authorities|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/08/03/117980687.pdf|accessdate=February 17, 2015|work=New York Times|date=August 3, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often had little, poor quality food.&lt;ref name=Eve /&gt;&lt;ref name="Black Rules White" /&gt; Moreover, the political situation in Haiti was not stable, with President [[Florvil Hyppolite]] facing revolts and rebellions, and the scorn of the international community.

As the Admiral of this poorly equipped, underfunded force a significant amount of Killick's resources went to trying to acquire more ships. In January 1894 an American [[yacht]] called the ''[[Natalie (ship)|Natalie]]'' sailed out of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], went missing and was presumed lost.&lt;ref name="Natalie"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE STORY OF THE NATALIE.; Triumph of Haitian Diplomacy Over the Revolutionary Cause|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/03/14/106096947.pdf|accessdate=February 17, 2015|work=New York Times|date=March 14, 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were rumors that the ''Natalie'' was carrying arms and ammunition to be used in a plot to overthrow Hyppolite,&lt;ref name=NatalieCaptured&gt;{{cite news|title=Natalie Captured and Crew Shot|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/03/11/106900095.pdf|accessdate=February 17, 2015|work=New York Times|date=March 11, 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her captain denied that there were any weapons on board, and claimed the trip was just a pleasure cruise.&lt;ref name=Yacht&gt;{{cite news|title=Yacht Natalie's Captain Here|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/03/13/106096650.pdf|accessdate=February 17, 2015|work=New York Times|date=March 13, 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Natalie'' was spotted near [[Long Cay]], [[Bahamas]] in February.&lt;ref name=NatalieCaptured /&gt; A short time later two Haitian vessels, the ''[[Defence (Haitian ship)|Defence]]'' and the ''[[Dessalines (ship)|Dessalines]]'', with Killick on board, showed up near the ''Natalie''.&lt;ref name="Natalie" /&gt; The ''Defence'' was carrying $25,000 in American gold to purchase the ''Natalie'',&lt;ref name="Natalie" /&gt; and the ''Dessalines'' was carrying $60,000 in gold coin for the purchase of the ''Natalie''.&lt;ref name=Yacht /&gt; Killick and the ''Natalie'''s captain negotiated a purchase of the ''Natalie'' for £5,208 6''s'' 8''d'',&lt;ref name=Mystery&gt;{{cite news|title=The Natalie Mystery|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH18940327.2.14#|accessdate=February 18, 2015|work=Los Angeles Herald|issue=Volume 47 Number 157|date=March 27, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly $25,000.&lt;ref name=Exchange&gt;{{cite web|last1=Officer|first1=Lawrence|title=Dollar-Pound Exchange Rate From 1791|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/exchangepound/result.php|website=Measuring Worth|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Natalie'' was retrofitted in Savannah and added to the Haitian Navy.&lt;ref name="Natalie" /&gt;

In 1896 Haiti was able to add a brand new ship to its fleet, the ''[[Crête-à-Pierrot]]''.&lt;ref name="Black Rules White" /&gt; The ''Crête-à-Pierrot'' was commissioned to be the [[flagship]] of the navy.&lt;ref name="Black Rules White" /&gt; It was built in England and armed in France.&lt;ref name="Black Rules White" /&gt; It had 11 guns, could steam 15 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], and displaced 940 tonnes of water.&lt;ref name="Black Rules White" /&gt; In 1899 the captain commented about how often the Admiral came aboard.&lt;ref name="Black Rules White" /&gt;

In July 1898, Admiral Killick caused some anxiety in the international community when he went missing for nineteen days.&lt;ref name=Returns&gt;{{cite news|title=Admiral Killick Returns|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/07/03/102074398.pdf|accessdate=February 17, 2015|work=New York Times|date=July 3, 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion and death==

In May 1902, Haitian President [[Tirésias Simon Sam]] resigned in embarrassment over Haiti's inability to assert itself in the international community after the [[Emil Lüders]] incident.&lt;ref name=Aftershocks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dubois|first1=Laurent|title=Haiti: The Aftershocks of History|date=January 3, 2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780805095623|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drU3HlesN5kC&amp;pg=PT221&amp;dq=Hammerton+Killick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Haiti|1889 constitution]] provided for the [[Haitian Parliament#National Assembly|National Assembly]] to name a president, but there was an uprising demanding [[direct elections]].&lt;ref name=Aftershocks /&gt; A provisional government was created to oversee the election of deputies who, together with the National Assembly would appoint the president.&lt;ref name=History&amp;Detractors /&gt; [[Anténor Firmin]] soon emerged as a popular favorite, but he was opposed by the military and the provisional government, which both supported [[Pierre Nord Alexis]].&lt;ref name=Aftershocks /&gt; By June 1902 a civil war had broken out between the supporters of Firmin and the supporters of Alexis.&lt;ref name=Aftershocks /&gt;

Admiral Killick declared his support for Firmin very early on,&lt;ref name=Untitled&gt;{{cite news|title=Article 6 – Untitled|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/05/16/118470378.pdf|work=New York Times|date=May 16, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Battle&gt;{{cite news|title=Battle in Haiti Expected|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/05/15/118470189.pdf|accessdate=February 18, 2015|work=New York Times|date=May 15, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his support meant that although Alexis had the support of the military, Firmin had the support of the navy, and full control of the coast.&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{cite book|title=World Today|date=1902|publisher=Current Encyclopedia Company|page=1802|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ipDNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1892&amp;lpg=PA1892&amp;dq=Cr%C3%AAte-%C3%A0-Pierrot+ship}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 15 May, Killick had not only declared for Firmin, but taken the flagship of the Haitian Navy, the ''[[Crête-à-Pierrot]]'', to [[Cap-Haïtien]] to pick up Firminist troops and transport them to [[Port-au-Prince]].&lt;ref name=Untitled /&gt;&lt;ref name=Battle /&gt; Meanwhile, the rest of the Haitian Navy, comprising a single ship, the ''[[Toussaint Louverture (ship)|Toussaint Louverture]]'', was in [[Gonaïves]],&lt;ref name=Untitled /&gt; where Firmin had many supporters.&lt;ref name=History&amp;Detractors /&gt;

Firmin campaigned to be elected deputy of both his hometown Cap-Haïtien, and Gonaïves.&lt;ref name=History&amp;Detractors /&gt; He was elected deputy for Gonaïves, but on June 28 fighting broke out in Cap-Haïtien between his supporters and troops controlled by Alexis, who had been sent there to supervise the elections.&lt;ref name=History&amp;Detractors /&gt;&lt;ref name="Indianapolis Journal"&gt;{{cite news|title=More Trouble in Haiti: Fighting in the Streets of Cape Hatien Last Evening|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015679/1902-06-29/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1856&amp;sort=date&amp;date2=1903&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;lccn=&amp;index=2&amp;words=HAITI+Haiti+Killick&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=Hammerton+Killick+Kellick&amp;proxtext=Haiti&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=2|accessdate=May 12, 2015|work=Indianapolis Journal|date=June 29, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fighting broke out Firmin embarked on the ''Crête-à-Pierrot'' and sailed to Gonaïves.&lt;ref name=History&amp;Detractors&gt;{{cite book|last1=Léger|first1=Jacques Nicolas|title=Haiti: Her History and Her Detractors|date=1907|publisher=Neale Publishing Company|location=New York and Washington|pages=252–253|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Haiti-_Her_History_and_Her_Detractors.djvu|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he continued to protest against the way the elections were being conducted.&lt;ref name=History&amp;Detractors /&gt;

Due to his role in the conflict between Firmin and Alexis, Killick was [[Commission (document)|decommissioned]] by July 12.&lt;ref name="Loses commission"&gt;{{cite news|title=SITUATION IN HAITI.; Admiral Loses His Commission for Disobeying the New Government.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/07/13/101276583.pdf|accessdate=January 31, 2015|work=New York Times|date=July 13, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the disrupted, disputed elections were still on-going in July,&lt;ref name="Loses commission" /&gt; by July 26, Firmin had been declared president by inhabitants of [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]] and several other regions of Haiti, Jumeau's land forces were reported to be within one day's march of Port-au-Prince, and the ''Crête-à-Pierrot'' was in the harbor at Port-au-Prince.&lt;ref name=FirminOutlaw&gt;{{cite news|title=THE REVOLUTION IN HAITI.; Provisional Government Declares Firmin an Outlaw – Great Excitement at Port-au-Prince|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/07/27/117980052.pdf|accessdate=February 17, 2015|work=New York Times|date=July 27, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Killick attempted to establish a blockade of the harbor at [[Cap-Haïtien]].&lt;ref name=World /&gt;
On September 2, 1902,&lt;ref name=History&amp;Detractors /&gt; Killick and his crew seized a German ammunition ship, the ''[[Markomannia incident|Markomannia]]'' en route to Cape Haitian to provide ammunition to Alexis' forces.&lt;ref name="Haiti after Emancipation" /&gt; Alexis asked Germany for help subduing a [[pirate ship]].&lt;ref name=Aftershocks /&gt; In response, Germany sent the gunboat {{SMS|Panther||6}} to find and capture the ''Crête-à-Pierrot''.&lt;ref name="Haiti after Emancipation" /&gt;

On September 6, the ''Crête-à-Pierrot'' was in port at [[Gonaïves]], with Killick and most of the crew on [[shore leave]] when the ''Panther'' appeared.&lt;ref name="Revolution" /&gt; Killick rushed on-board and ordered his crew to abandon ship.&lt;ref name="Revolution" /&gt; When all but four crew members had evacuated the ship&lt;ref name="Haiti after Emancipation" /&gt; Killick, inspired by the tale of [[Captain LaPorte]], wrapped himself in a Haitian flag, fired the aft magazine, and blew up the ship, along with the arms that were supplied by German merchants,&lt;ref name=Dessalines&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholls|first1=David|title=From Dessalines to Duvalier: Race, Colour, and National Independence in Haiti|date=1996|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813522401|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRQn8Pc3K08C&amp;pg=PA140}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than let the Germans take her.&lt;ref name="Revolution" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTDown"&gt;{{cite news|title=Killick Went Down with His Warship|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/09/11/118478751.pdf|accessdate=February 3, 2015|work=New York Times|date=September 11, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killick and the remaining four crew members went [[The captain goes down with the ship|down with the ship]].&lt;ref name="Revolution" /&gt;

Killick's sacrifice was seen as the ultimate act of patriotism, yet Firmin's struggling revolution was doomed to failure by the loss of the ''Crête-à-Pierrot'' and the support of Haiti's navy.&lt;ref name="Firminist War" /&gt; Within a month Firmin went into exile in [[Saint Thomas, Barbados]], where he died in 1911.&lt;ref name="Firminist War" /&gt;

'''Harry Pollitt''' (22 November 1890 &amp;ndash; 27 June 1960) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[politician]] who served as the head of the trade union department of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and the General Secretary of the party.&lt;ref name="Tameside"/&gt; 

==Biography==

===Early life===
Pollitt was born 22 November 1890 in [[Droylsden]], Lancashire. He was the second of six children of Samuel Pollitt (1863–1933), a [[Blacksmith#Blacksmith's striker|blacksmith's striker]], and his wife, Mary Louisa (1868–1939), a [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinner]], daughter of William Charlesworth, a [[joiner]]. Pollitt's parents were [[socialism|socialists]] and [[Freethought|freethinkers]] and it was his mother, a member of the [[Independent Labour Party]], who provided the youngster with his first induction into the principles and local networks of socialism. Theirs was an especially close relationship and Pollitt found in his mother both a confidante and a model of [[working-class]] dignity in the face of affliction.&lt;ref name="Tameside"/&gt;

His own sense of injustice at family poverty, as three of his siblings [[died in infancy]], was likewise fundamental to the strong identification with the working class that lay at the root of his political outlook. His formal education, at the local school, ended when he was thirteen. Pollitt was a [[boilermaker]] by trade and he frequently travelled around the country in this connection.

In 1915, whilst living in [[Southampton]], he led a strike of boilermakers.

On 10 October 1925, Pollitt married Marjorie Brewer in [[Caxton Hall]], Westminster. His [[best man]] and witness was fellow-CPGB activist and organiser [[Percy Glading]], who would later be convicted of spying for the Soviet Union and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahon|first=J.|title=Harry Pollitt: A Biography|year=1976|publisher=Lawrence and Wishart|location=London|isbn=978-0-85315-327-6|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport-Hines|first=R.|title=Enemies Within: Communists, the Cambridge Spies and the Making of Modern Britain|year=2018|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-751668-1|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist union leader===
In 1919 Pollitt was involved in the "Hands off Russia" campaign to protest against [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. At the end of the war he joined [[Sylvia Pankhurst]]'s [[Workers' Socialist Federation]], which became the [[Communist Party (British Section of the Third International)]]. As a member of this group he joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] when it was formed in mid-1920. Pankhurst soon left the party, but Pollitt remained. He was heavily influenced by the Communist [[intellectual]] [[Rajani Palme Dutt]] and the two remained close allies for many years. From 1924 to 1929 Pollitt was General Secretary of the [[National Minority Movement]], a Communist-led united front within the [[labor union|trade unions]].

In 1925, he married Marjory Edna Brewer (b. 1902), a communist [[schoolteacher]], and they had a son and a daughter. That year Pollitt was one of 12 members of the Communist Party convicted at the [[Old Bailey]] under the [[Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797]] and one of the five defendants sentenced to 12 months [[imprisonment]].

===General Secretary of the CPGB===
In 1929 the CPGB elected him General Secretary, a position he held, with a brief interruption during [[World War II]], until 1956. He was then made Chairman of the Party, a position he held until his death four years later aboard an ocean liner carrying him home from a visit to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Tameside"/&gt;

In his public statements, Pollitt was loyal to the [[Soviet Union]] and to [[CPSU]] [[General Secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]. He was a defender of the [[Moscow Trials]] in which Stalin murdered or otherwise disposed of his political and military opponents. In the ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)#The Daily Worker (1930–1966)|Daily Worker]]'' of 12 March 1936 Pollitt told the world that "the trials in Moscow represent a new triumph in the history of progress". The article was illustrated by a photograph of Stalin with [[Nikolai Yezhov]], himself shortly to vanish and his photographs airbrushed from history by [[NKVD]] archivists.&lt;ref&gt;Redman, Joseph "The British Stalinists and the Moscow Trials", ''Labour Review'', 3:2, March–April 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollitt also organised a protest against [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;John Mahon, ''Harry Pollitt: A Biography'' Lawrence &amp; Wishart, Limited, 1976 {{ISBN|0853153272}} (p. 193)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/ Labour History Archive and Study Centre] at the [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]] holds the collection of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. This collection includes the papers of Harry Pollitt, which covers the years 1920 to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Collection Catalogues and Descriptions |publisher=Labour History Archive and Study Centre |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/online-catalogue/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of World War II===
In September 1939, despite the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]], he welcomed the British declaration of war on [[Nazi Germany]]. When this turned out to be contrary to the Comintern line (as [[Rajani Palme Dutt]], who succeeded him as General Secretary, had warned him it would be), he was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;John Mahon, ''Harry Pollitt: A Biography'' (p. 236)&lt;/ref&gt; He was reinstated after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941]].

===Political activities===
Pollitt contested many parliamentary elections. He fought [[Rhondda East]] several times; in [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]] he was within a thousand votes of winning the seat from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate.

Pollitt faced another crisis when [[Nikita Khrushchev]], in his 1956 [[Secret Speech]], attacked the legacy of Stalin. The Soviet repression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] made the crisis in the party worse, and most of its intellectual figures (including [[Doris Lessing]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) and many ordinary members resigned. Others, for example [[Eric Hobsbawm]], chose to stay in the Party to try to reform it. Pollitt, depressed both by physical illness (including [[Vision loss|temporary blindness]]) and his increasing political isolation, resigned as General Secretary and was appointed CP Chairman.

In this position, Pollitt, like many other communists around the world, became disillusioned with Khrushchev's [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] and attacks on Stalin. "He's staying there as long as I'm alive", he said of the portrait of Stalin that hung in his living room.

===Death and legacy===
[[File:The Soviet Union 1970 CPA 3964 stamp (Harry Pollitt and Freighter 'Jolly George').jpg|thumb|right|300 px|A [[USSR]] [[Postage stamp|stamp]] of 1970 commemorating Harry Pollitt]]
Harry Pollitt  died, aged 69, of a [[Cerebral hemorrhage|cerebral haemorrhage]], after years of worsening health, while returning on the [[RMS Orion|SS ''Orion'']] from a speaking tour of [[Australia]] on 27 June 1960. He was [[cremated]] at [[Golders Green Crematorium|Golders Green]] on 9 July, and was survived by his wife and two children, Brian and Jean.

In 1971, Pollitt's devotion to the Soviet cause and to international communism was acknowledged by Moscow when the Soviet navy named a ship after him. A plaque dedicated to the memory of Pollitt was unveiled by the Mayor of [[Tameside]] on 22 March 1995 outside [[Droylsden]] Library.&lt;ref name="Tameside"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tameside.gov.uk/blueplaque/harrypollitt |title=A Tribute to Harry Pollitt 1890 - 1960 |work=Blue Plaques |publisher=Tameside District Council |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also ironically commemorated in the humorous song ''The Ballad of Harry Pollitt'', which actually circulated most popularly in his lifetime.  Part of the lyrics dealt with his death:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE LIMELITERS - HARRY POLLITT LYRICS |accessdate=2012-01-13 |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/harry-pollitt-lyrics-the-limeliters.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;poem&gt;
Harry Pollitt was a worker, one of Lenin's lads
He was foully murdered by those counter revolutionary cads
Counter revolutionary cads, counter revolutionary cads
He was foully murdered by those counter revolutionary cads!

Old Harry went to heaven, feeling weak about the knees,
Said, "May I speak with Comrade God; I am Harry Pollitt please
I'm Harry Pollitt please, I'm Harry Pollitt please,
May I speak with Comrade God, I am Harry Pollitt please... 

They dressed him in a nightie, put a harp into his hand,
And he played the Internationale in the Hallelujah band,
In the Hallelujah band, in the Hallelujah band,
He played the Internationale in the Hallelujah band.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Secret communications with Soviet Union==
In operation [[MASK (MI5 operation)|MASK]] (1934&amp;ndash;1937), an [[MI5]] counterspy infiltrated the party, and was for a time Pollitt's assistant and a [[clandestine radio]] [[radio operator|operator]].  This allowed [[John Tiltman]] and his colleagues to crack the code and decrypt, for a few years, messages between [[Moscow]] and some of its foreign parties, such as the CPGB.  They revealed the [[Comintern]]'s close supervision of the Communist Party and Pollitt. Among other things, Pollitt was instructed to refute [[news leak]]s about a Stalinist purge.  Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of [[Ernst Thälmann]], a German communist leader who had been arrested by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and who later died at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. Pollitt replied that he was 'having difficulties' getting English statesmen to make public declarations supporting Thälmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in [[London]]. In one of the more amusing dispatches, Pollitt (1936) informed his Soviet contact about a recent visit to [[France]] to make campaign appearances for candidates from the [[French Communist Party]]. "At great inconvenience went to Paris to speak in the election campaign". Pollitt went on to complain that he was "kept sitting two days and comrades refused to allow me to speak. Such treatment as I received in Paris is a scandal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">'''Ideological repression''' refers to forceful activities against competing [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[philosophy|philosophies]].

[[Alan Wolfe]] defines ideological repression as "the attempt to manipulate people's consciousness so they accept the ruling ideology, and distrust and refuse to be moved by competing ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;as cited in "Television as an Instrument of Terror", by [[Arthur Asa Berger]], p. 369 &lt;!-- need to find the original text --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the [[Soviet Union]] and in other countries, ideological repression was carried out by [[political repression]] of the carriers of competing ideologies.

Instruments of ideological repression are [[propaganda]] and [[censorship]]. During the days of "Marxism-Leninism" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Soviet Union -around the early 1930s- students of this particular school of thought were given textbooks that encouraged one particular way of thinking (the Marxist way) as being paramount and the most scientific and true school of thought.

Through ideological repression and control of output information, the Soviet Union was attempting to keep social revolutions at bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, [[database]]s were viewed as computer systems that stored record-oriented and business data such as manufacturing inventories, bank records, and sales transactions. A database system was not expected to merge numeric data with text, images, or [[multimedia]] information, nor was it expected to automatically notice patterns in the data it stored. In the late 1980s the concept of an '''intelligent database''' was put forward as a system that manages information (rather than data) in a way that appears natural to users and which goes beyond simple record keeping.

The term was introduced in 1989 by the book ''Intelligent Databases'' by [[Kamran Parsaye]], [[Mark Chignell]], Setrag Khoshafian and [[Harry Wong]]. The concept postulated three levels of intelligence for such systems: high level tools, the [[user interface]] and the [[database engine]]. The high level tools manage data quality and automatically discover relevant patterns in the data with a process called [[data mining]]. This layer often relies on the use of [[artificial intelligence]] techniques. The user interface uses [[hypermedia]] in a form that uniformly manages text, images and numeric data. The intelligent database engine supports the other two layers, often merging [[relational database]] techniques with [[object-oriented programming|object orientation]].

In the twenty-first century, intelligent databases have now become widespread, e.g. hospital databases can now call up patient histories consisting of charts, text and x-ray images just with a few mouse clicks, and many corporate databases include [[decision support]] tools based on sales pattern analysis.

The '''introspection illusion''' is a [[cognitive bias]] in which people wrongly think they have direct insight into the origins of their mental states, while treating others' [[introspection]]s as unreliable. In certain situations, this illusion leads people to make confident but false explanations of their own behaviour (called "causal theories"&lt;ref name=SocPsy/&gt;) or inaccurate [[affective forecasting|predictions of their future mental states]].

The illusion has been examined in [[psychological]] experiments, and suggested as a basis for biases in how people compare themselves to others. These experiments have been interpreted as suggesting that, rather than offering direct access to the processes underlying mental states, [[introspection]] is a process of construction and [[inference]], much as people indirectly infer others' mental states from their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2002|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When people mistake unreliable introspection for genuine self-knowledge, the result can be an [[illusory superiority|illusion of superiority]] over other people, for example when each person thinks they are less biased and less conformist than the rest of the group. Even when experimental subjects are provided with reports of other subjects' introspections, in as detailed a form as possible, they still rate those other introspections as unreliable while treating their own as reliable. Although the hypothesis of an introspection illusion informs some psychological research, the existing evidence is arguably inadequate to decide how reliable introspection is in normal circumstances.&lt;ref name="knowing_more"/&gt; Correction for the bias may be possible through education about the bias and its unconscious nature.&lt;ref name="introspectionillusion"&gt;{{harvnb|Pronin|2009|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

The phrase "introspection illusion" was coined by [[Emily Pronin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=The Mind of the Market: Compassionate Apes, Competitive Humans, and Other Tales from Evolutionary Economics |publisher=Times Books |year=2007 |page=72 |isbn=978-0-8050-7832-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pronin describes the illusion as having four components:
# People give a strong weighting to introspective evidence when assessing themselves.
# They do not give such a strong weight when assessing others.
# People disregard their own behaviour when assessing themselves (but not others).
# Own introspections are more highly weighted than others. It is not just that people lack access to each other's introspections: they regard only their own as reliable.&lt;ref name="adv5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pronin|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unreliability of introspection==

{{Quote box |quote=[I]ntrospection does not provide a direct pipeline to nonconscious mental processes. Instead, it is best thought of as a process whereby people use the contents of consciousness to construct a personal narrative that may or may not correspond to their nonconscious states. |source=[[Timothy D. Wilson]] and Elizabeth W. Dunn (2004)&lt;ref name="annreview"/&gt; |width=20% |align=right}}

A 1977 paper by psychologists [[Richard Nisbett]] and [[Timothy D. Wilson]] challenged the directness and reliability of introspection, thereby becoming one of the most cited papers in the science of consciousness.&lt;ref name="tellingmore"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1977 |title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes |journal= Psychological Review |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=231–259 |ref=harv |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.231|last1=Nisbett |first1=Richard E. |last2=Wilson |first2=Timothy D. }} reprinted in {{cite book |title=Social cognition: key readings |editor=David Lewis Hamilton |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-86377-591-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; Nisbett and Wilson reported on experiments in which subjects verbally explained why they had a particular preference, or how they arrived at a particular idea. On the basis of these studies and existing [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]] research, they concluded that reports on mental processes are [[confabulated]]. They wrote that subjects had, "little or no introspective access to higher order cognitive processes".&lt;ref name="strangers104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2002|pp=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; They distinguished between mental ''contents'' (such as feelings) and mental ''processes'', arguing that while introspection gives us access to contents, processes remain hidden.&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;

[[File:Five Senses03.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Research continues to find that humans [[Evolution|evolved]] only limited abilities to introspect]]

Although some other experimental work followed from the Nisbett and Wilson paper, difficulties with testing the hypothesis of introspective access meant that research on the topic generally stagnated.&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; A ten-year-anniversary review of the paper raised several objections, questioning the idea of "process" they had used and arguing that unambiguous tests of introspective access are hard to achieve.&lt;ref name="knowing_more"&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Peter A. |year=1988 |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=79 |title=Knowing more about what we can tell: 'Introspective access' and causal report accuracy 10 years later |publisher=British Psychological Society |issue=1 |pages=13–45 |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1988.tb02271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Updating the theory in 2002, Wilson admitted that the 1977 claims had been too far-reaching.&lt;ref name="strangers104"/&gt; He instead relied on the theory that the ''[[adaptive unconscious]]'' does much of the moment-to-moment work of perception and behaviour. When people are asked to report on their mental processes, they cannot access this unconscious activity.&lt;ref name="annreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Dunn|first2=Elizabeth W.|title=Self-Knowledge: Its Limits, Value, and Potential for Improvement|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2004|volume=55|issue=1|pages=493–518|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141954|pmid=14744224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than acknowledge their lack of insight, they [[confabulate]] a plausible explanation, and "seem" to be "unaware of their unawareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 22, 2008 |title=The Unseen Mind |journal=Science |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |volume= 321 |pages=1046–1047 |doi=10.1126/science.1163029 |pmid=18719269 |issue=5892 |ref=harv|author1=Wilson |first1=T. D. |last2=Bar-Anan |first2=Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that people can be mistaken about their inner functioning is one applied by [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialists]]. These philosophers suggest that some concepts, including "belief" or "pain" will turn out to be quite different from what is commonly expected as science advances.

The faulty guesses that people make to explain their thought processes have been called "causal theories".&lt;ref name=SocPsy&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aronson |first1=Elliot |first2=Timothy D. |last2=Wilson |first3=Robin M. |last3=Akert |first4=Samuel R. |last4=Sommers|title=Social Psychology |edition= 9th |year=2015 |location= |publisher=Pearson Education |ref=harv|isbn=9780133936544|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causal theories provided after an action will often serve only to justify the person's behaviour in order to relieve [[cognitive dissonance]]. That is, a person may not have noticed the real reasons for their behaviour, even when trying to provide explanations. The result is an explanation that mostly just makes themselves feel better. An example might be a man who discriminates against homosexuals because he is embarrassed that he himself is attracted to other men. He may not admit this to himself, instead claiming his prejudice is because he believes that homosexuality is unnatural.

A study conducted by philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel and psychologist Russell T. Hurlburt was set up to measure the extent of introspective accuracy by gathering introspective reports from a single individual who was given the pseudonym "Melanie". Melanie was given a beeper which sounded at random moments, and when it did she had to note what she was currently feeling and thinking. After analyzing the reports the authors had mixed views about the results, the correct interpretation of Melanie's claims and her introspective accuracy. Even after long discussion the two authors disagreed with each other in the closing remarks, Schwitzgebel being pessimistic and Hurlburt optimistic about the reliability of introspection.&lt;ref name=Hurlburt&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwitzgebel and Hurlburt |title=Describing Inner Experience?|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11340 |isbn=978-0-262-08366-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors in accuracy===

Nisbett and Wilson conjectured about several factors that they found to contribute to the accuracy of introspective self-reports on cognition.&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;
*''Availability'':  Stimuli that are highly [[:wikt:salient|salient]] (either due to [[recency]] or being very memorable) are more likely to be recalled and considered for the cause of a response.
*''[[Plausibility]]'':  Whether a person finds a stimulus to be a sufficiently likely cause for an effect determines the influence it has on their reporting of the stimulus.
*''Removal in time'':  The greater the distance in time since the occurrence of an event, the less available and more difficult to accurately recall it is.
*''Mechanics of judgment'':  People do not recognize the influence that judgment factors (e.g., position effects) have on them, leading to inaccuracies in self-reporting.
*''[[Context (language use)|Context]]'':  Focusing on the context of an object distracts from evaluation of that object and can lead people to falsely believe that their thoughts about the object are represented by the context.
*''Non-events'':  The absence of an occurrence is naturally less salient and available than an occurrence itself, leading nonevents to have little influence on reports.
*''Nonverbal behaviour'':  While people receive a large amount of information about others via [[nonverbal]] cues, the verbal nature of relaying information and the difficulty of translating nonverbal behaviour into verbal form lead to its lower reporting frequency.
*''Discrepancy between the magnitudes of [[causality|cause and effect]]'':  Because it seems natural to assume that a certain size cause will lead to a similarly-sized effect, connections between causes and effects of different magnitudes are not often drawn.

===Unawareness of error===

Several hypotheses to explain people's unawareness of their inaccuracies in introspection were provided by Nisbett and Wilson:&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;
*''Confusion between [[Process theory|content and process]]'':  People are usually unable to access the exact process by which they arrived at a [[Result|conclusion]], but can recall an intermediate step prior to the result. However, this step is still content in nature, not a process. The confusion of these discrete forms leads people to believe that they are able to understand their judgment processes. (Nisbett and Wilson have been criticized for failing to provide a clear definition of the differences between mental content and mental processes.) 
*''Knowledge of prior [[idiosyncratic]] reactions to a stimulus'':  An individual's belief that they react in an abnormal manner to a stimulus, which would be unpredictable from the standpoint of an outside observer, seems to support true introspective ability. However, these perceived [[covariation]]s may actually be false, and truly abnormal covariations are rare.
*''Differences in causal theories between subcultures'':  The inherent differences between discrete subcultures necessitates that they have some differing causal theories for any one stimulus. Thus, an outsider would not have the same ability to discern a true cause as would an insider, again making it seem to the introspector that they have the capacity to understand the judgment process better than can another.
*''Attentional and intentional knowledge'':  An individual may consciously know that they were not paying attention to a certain stimulus or did not have a certain intent. Again, as insight that an outside observer does not have, this seems indicative of true introspective ability. However, the authors note that such knowledge can actually mislead the individual in the case that it is not as influential as they may think.
*''Inadequate feedback'':  By nature, introspection is difficult to be [[Disconfirmation bias|disconfirmed]] in everyday life, where there are no tests of it and others tend not to question one's introspections. Moreover, when a person's causal theory of reasoning is seemingly disconfirmed, it is easy for them to produce alternative reasons for why the evidence is actually not disconfirmatory at all.
*''[[Motivation]]al reasons'':  Considering one's own ability to understand their reasoning as being equivalent to an outsider's is intimidating and a threat to the ego and sense of control. Thus, people do not like to entertain the idea, instead maintaining the belief that they can accurately introspect.

===Criticisms===

The claim that confabulation of justifications evolved to relieve cognitive dissonance is criticized by some evolutionary biologists for assuming the evolution of a mechanism for feeling dissonanced by a lack of justification. These evolutionary biologists argue that if [[cause and effect|causal theories]] had no higher predictive accuracy than prejudices that would have been in place even without causal theories, there would be no evolutionary selection for experiencing any form of discomfort from lack of causal theories.&lt;ref&gt;John Relethford (2017), "50 Great Myths of Human Evolution: Understanding Misconceptions about Our Origins"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;António Zilhão (2010), "Evolution, rationality and cognition"&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that studies in the United States that appear to show a link between homophobia and homosexuality can be explained by an actual such link is criticized by many scholars. Since much homophobia in the United States is due to religious indoctrination and therefore unrelated to personal sexual preferences, they argue that the appearance of a link is due to volunteer-biased erotica research in which religious homophobes fear God's judgment but not being recorded as "homosexual" by Earthly psychologists while most non-homophobes are misled by [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]] to assume that the notion that men can be sexually fluid is somehow "homophobic" and "unethical".&lt;ref&gt;Paul G.

==Choice blindness==
{{See also|Change blindness}}
Inspired by the Nisbett and Wilson paper, [[Petter Johansson]] and colleagues investigated subjects' insight into their own preferences using a new technique. Subjects saw two photographs of people and were asked which they found more attractive. They were given a closer look at their "chosen" photograph and asked to verbally explain their choice. However, in some trials, the experimenter had slipped them the other photograph rather than the one they had chosen, using [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name=Johansson2005&gt;{{cite journal|title=Failure to Detect Mismatches Between Intention and Outcome in a Simple Decision Task |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5745 |pages=116–119 |date=October 7, 2005 |url=http://beyond-belief.org.uk/sites/beyond-belief.org.uk/files/Johansson_et_al-2005-Failure_to_detect_mismatches.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1111709 |pmid=16210542 |ref=harv |author1=Johansson |first1=P |last2=Hall |first2=L |last3=Sikström |first3=S |last4=Olsson |first4=A |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222080249/http://beyond-belief.org.uk/sites/beyond-belief.org.uk/files/Johansson_et_al-2005-Failure_to_detect_mismatches.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of subjects failed to notice that the picture they were looking at did not match the one they had chosen just seconds before.

These researchers examined male and female subjects' reports of what they found attractive. Men typically reported that physical attractiveness was crucial while women identified earning potential as most important. These subjective reports did not predict their actual choices in a [[speed dating]] context, or their dating behaviour in a one-month follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 2008 |title=Sex differences in mate preferences revisited: Do people know what they initially desire in a romantic partner? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=245–264 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.245 |pmid=18211175 |ref=harv |author1=Eastwick |first1=P.

Actors also have privileged information access that includes some degree of introspective access to pertinent causal stimuli and thought processes, as well as better access (than observers) to stimulus-response covariation data about their own behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.arizona.edu/ic/psyc358/358-Lect_6.htm |title=How well can we know ourselves? — Further Exploration of Introspection |last=Kaszniak |first=A.

Examples include people of many different non-open political ideologies, despite their enmity to each other, having a shared belief that it is "ethical" to give an appearance of humans justifying beliefs and "unethical" to admit that humans are open-minded in the absence of threats that inhibit critical thinking, making them fake justifications.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Swatridge (2014), "Oxford Guide to Effective Argument and Critical Thinking"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig P. Speelman, Marek McGann (2016), "Challenges to Mean-Based Analysis in Psychology: The Contrast Between Individual People and General Science"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitude change==

Studies that ask participants to introspect upon their [[reasoning]] (for liking, choosing, or believing something, etc.) tend to see a subsequent decrease in correspondence between attitude and behaviour in the participants.&lt;ref name="attitudebehavior"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introspection, attitude change, and attitude-behavior consistency: The disruptive effects of explaining why we feel the way we do|volume=22|year=1989|pages=287–343|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60311-1|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Dunn|first2=Dana S.|last3=Kraft|first3=Dolores|last4=Lisle|first4=Douglas J.|isbn=9780120152223}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a study by Wilson ''et al.'', participants rated their interest in puzzles that they had been given. Prior to rating, one group had been instructed to contemplate and write down their reasons for liking or disliking the puzzles, while the control group was given no such task. The amount of time participants spent playing with each puzzle was then recorded. The correlation between ratings of and time spent playing each puzzle was much smaller for the introspection group than the control group.&lt;ref name="effectsofanalyzing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy|author2=D. Dunn |author3=J. Bybee |author4=D. Hyman |author5=J. Rotondo |title=Effects of analyzing reasons on attitude-behavior consistency|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=47|pages=5–16|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent study was performed to show the generalizability of these results to more "realistic" circumstances. In this study, participants were all involved in a steady romantic relationship. All were asked to rate how well-adjusted their relationship was. One group was asked to list all of the reasons behind their feelings for their partner, while the control group did not do so. Six months later, the experimenters followed up with participants to check if they were still in the same relationship. Those who had been asked to introspect showed much less attitude-behaviour consistency based upon correlations between earlier relationship ratings and whether they were still dating their partners. This shows that introspection was not predictive, but this also probably means that the introspection has changed the evolution of the relationship.&lt;ref name=effectsofanalyzing/&gt;

The authors theorize that these effects are due to participants changing their attitudes, when confronted with a need for justification, without changing their corresponding behaviours. The authors hypothesize that this attitude shift is the result of a combination of things: a desire to avoid feeling foolish for simply not knowing why one feels a certain way; a tendency to make justifications based upon cognitive reasons, despite the large influence of emotion; ignorance of mental biases (e.g., halo effects); and self-persuasion that the reasons one has come up with must be representative with their attitude. In effect, people attempt to supply a "good story" to explain their reasoning, which often leads to convincing themselves that they actually hold a different belief.&lt;ref name=attitudebehavior/&gt; In studies wherein participants chose an item to keep, their subsequent reports of satisfaction with the item decreased, suggesting that their attitude changes were temporary, returning to the original attitude over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy|author2=D.

===Introspection by focusing on feelings===
In contrast with introspection by focusing on reasoning, that which instructs one to focus on their [[feeling]]s has actually been shown to increase attitude-behaviour correlations.&lt;ref name=attitudebehavior/&gt; This finding suggests that introspecting on one's feelings is not a maladaptive process.

===Criticisms===

The theory that there are mental processes that act as justifications do not make behaviour more adaptive is criticized by some biologists who argue that the cost in nutrients for brain function selects against any brain mechanism that does not make behaviour more adapted to the environment. They argue that the cost in [[Nutrient#Essentiality|essential nutrients]] causes even more difficulty than the cost in calories, especially in social groups of many individuals needing the same scarce nutrients, which imposes substantial difficulty on feeding the group and lowers their potential size. These biologists argue that the evolution of argumentation was driven by the effectiveness of arguments on changing risk perception attitudes and life and death decisions to a more adaptive state, as "luxury functions" that did not enhance life and death survival would lose the evolutionary "tug of war" against the selection for nutritional thrift. While there have been claims of non-adaptive brain functions being selected by [[sexual selection]], these biologists criticize any applicability to introspection illusion's causal theories because sexually selected traits are most disabling as a fitness signal during or after puberty but human brains require the highest amount of nutrients before puberty (enhancing the nerve connections in ways that make adult brains capable of faster and more nutrient-efficient firing).&lt;ref&gt;Agustín González, Fernando Martinez-Garcia, Luis Puelles (2014), "Adaptive Function and Brain Evolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francisco J. Ayala, John C. Avise (2013), "In the Light of Evolution: Volume VI: Brain and Behavior"&lt;/ref&gt;

==''A priori'' causal theories==
In their classic paper, Nisbett and Wilson proposed that introspective confabulations result from ''a priori'' theories, of which they put forth four possible origins:&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;
*Explicit cultural rules (e.g., stopping at red traffic lights)
*Implicit cultural theories, with certain schemata for likely stimulus-response relationships (e.g., an athlete only endorses a brand because he is paid to do so) 
*Individual observational experiences that lead one to form a theory of covariation
*Similar connotation between stimulus and response

The authors note that the use of these theories does not necessarily lead to inaccurate assumptions, but that this frequently occurs because the theories are improperly applied.

==Explaining biases==
Pronin argues that over-reliance on intentions is a factor in a number of different biases. For example, by focusing on their current good intentions, people can overestimate their likelihood of behaving virtuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pronin |first=Emily |date=January 2007 |title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |publisher= Elsevier |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=37–43 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001 |pmid=17129749 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In perceptions of bias===
{{Main|Bias blind spot}}
The [[bias blind spot]] is an established phenomenon that people rate themselves as less susceptible to bias than their peer group. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler argue that this phenomenon is due to the introspection illusion.&lt;ref name="gilovich"/&gt; In their experiments, subjects had to make judgments about themselves and about other subjects.&lt;ref name="blindspot"&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 2007 |title=Valuing thoughts, ignoring behavior: The introspection illusion as a source of the bias blind spot |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |publisher=Elsevier |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=565–578 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.011 |ref=harv|last1=Pronin |first1=Emily |last2=Kugler |first2=Matthew B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They displayed standard biases, for example rating themselves above the others on desirable qualities (demonstrating [[illusory superiority]]). The experimenters explained cognitive bias, and asked the subjects how it might have affected their judgment. The subjects rated themselves as less susceptible to bias than others in the experiment (confirming the [[bias blind spot]]). When they had to explain their judgments, they used different strategies for assessing their own and others' bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt;

Pronin and Kugler's interpretation is that when people decide whether someone else is biased, they use overt behaviour. On the other hand, when assessing whether or not they themselves are biased, people look inward, searching their own thoughts and feelings for biased motives. Since biases operate unconsciously, these introspections are not informative, but people wrongly treat them as reliable indication that they themselves, unlike other people, are immune to bias.&lt;ref name="gilovich"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |author2=Nicholas Epley |author3=Karlene Hanko  |title=The Self in Social Judgment |editor=Mark D. Alicke |editor2=David A. Dunning |editor3=Joachim I. Krueger |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |year=2005 |series=Studies in Self and Identity |page=77 |chapter=Shallow Thoughts About the Self: The Automatic Components of Self-Assessment |isbn=978-1-84169-418-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronin and Kugler tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. To do this, they made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they decided whether their answer to a previous question might have been affected by bias. Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt;

When asked what it would mean to be biased, subjects were more likely to define bias in terms of introspected thoughts and motives when it applied to themselves, but in terms of overt behaviour when it applied to other people. When subjects were explicitly told to avoid relying on introspection, their assessments of their own bias became more realistic.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt;

Additionally, Nisbett and Wilson found that asking participants whether biases (such as the position effect in the stocking study){{clarify|date=January 2014}} had an effect on their decisions resulted in a negative response, in contradiction with the data.&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;

===In perceptions of conformity===
Another series of studies by Pronin and colleagues examined perceptions of [[conformity]]. Subjects reported being more immune to social conformity than their peers. In effect, they saw themselves as being "alone in a crowd of sheep". The introspection illusion appeared to contribute to this effect. When deciding whether others respond to social influence, subjects mainly looked at their behaviour, for example explaining other student's political opinions in terms of following the group. When assessing their own conformity, subjects treat their own introspections as reliable. In their own minds, they found no motive to conform, and so decided that they had not been influenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Alone in a Crowd of Sheep: Asymmetric Perceptions of Conformity and Their Roots in an Introspection Illusion |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages=585–595 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.4.585 |pmid=17469946 |ref=harv|author1=Pronin |first1=E |last2=Berger |first2=J |last3=Molouki |first3=S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In perceptions of control and free will===
{{see also|Neuroscience of free will}}
Psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]] has argued that an introspection illusion contributes to belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena such as [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref name="selfismagic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wegner |first= Daniel M. |title=Are we free? Psychology and Free Will |editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor3=Roy F. Baumeister |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2008 |chapter=Self is Magic |isbn= 978-0-19-518963-6 |chapter-url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic67047.files/2_13_07_Wegner.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the processes connecting the two are not consciously accessible. Hence though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own [[free will]], the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory, called "apparent mental causation", acknowledges the influence of [[David Hume]]'s view of the mind.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"/&gt; This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an [[illusion of control]]. This could happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"/&gt;

As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on [[magical thinking]] in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a [[basketball]] player taking a series of [[free throws]]. When they were instructed to visualise him making his shots, they felt that they had contributed to his success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2006 |title=Everyday Magical Powers: The Role of Apparent Mental Causation in the Overestimation of Personal Influence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=218–231 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Pronin,%20Wegner,%20McCarthy,%20&amp;%20Rodriguez%20(2006).pdf |accessdate=2009-07-03 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.2.218 |pmid=16881760 |ref=harv |author1=Pronin |first1=E |last2=Wegner |first2=D.

If the introspection illusion contributes to the subjective feeling of free will, then it follows that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behaviour, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behaviour, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pronin|2009|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
However, criticism of Wegner's claims regarding the significance of introspection illusion for the notion of free will has been published.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. criticism by H. Andersen in his paper with the title 'Two Causal Mistakes in Wegner's Illusion of Conscious Will' ; Also as a criticism, read "On the alleged illusion of conscious will' by Van Duijn and Sacha Bem. Other papers can be found).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that human volunteers can estimate their response times accurately, in fact knowing their "mental processes" well, but only with substantial demands made on their attention and cognitive resources (i.e. they are distracted while estimating). Such estimation is likely more than ''post hoc'' interpretation and may incorporate privileged information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.01.003|pmid=20129603|title=Mapping introspection's blind spot: Reconstruction of dual-task phenomenology using quantified introspection |journal=Cognition|volume=115|issue=2|pages=303–313|year=2010 |last1=Marti|first1=Sébastien|last2=Sackur|first2=Jérôme|last3=Sigman|first3=Mariano|last4=Dehaene|first4=Stanislas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2011.03.008|pmid=21498087|title=The neural basis of event-time introspection|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1899–1915|year=2011|last1=Guggisberg|first1=Adrian G.|last2=Dalal|first2=Sarang S.|last3=Schnider|first3=Armin|last4=Nagarajan|first4=Srikantan S.|pmc=3161169}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]] training can also increase introspective accuracy in some instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Maja |last1=Djikic |first2=Ellen J. |last2=Langer |first3=Sarah |last3=Fulton Stapleton |title=Reducing Stereotyping Through Mindfulness: Effects on Automatic Stereotype-Activated Behaviors |journal=Journal of Adult Development |date=June 2008 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=106–111 |doi=10.1007/s10804-008-9040-0 |url=http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Djikic,%20Langer,%20&amp;%20Stapleton.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729151801/http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca///facBios/file/Djikic%2C%20Langer%2C%20%26%20Stapleton.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=3277910|pmid= 22347856|year= 2012|author1= Roberts-Wolfe|first1= D|title= Mindfulness training alters emotional memory recall compared to active controls: Support for an emotional information processing model of mindfulness|journal= Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume= 6|pages= 15|last2= Sacchet|first2= M.

==Correcting for the bias==
A study that investigated the effect of educating people about unconscious biases on their subsequent self-ratings of susceptibility to bias showed that those who were educated did not exhibit the bias blind spot, in contrast with the control group. This finding provides hope that being informed about unconscious biases such as the introspection illusion may help people to avoid making biased judgments, or at least make them aware that they are biased. Findings from other studies on correction of the bias yielded mixed results. In a later review of the introspection illusion, Pronin suggests that the distinction is that studies that merely provide a warning of unconscious biases will not see a correction effect, whereas those that inform about the bias and emphasize its unconscious nature do yield corrections. Thus, knowledge that bias can operate during conscious awareness seems the defining factor in leading people to correct for it.&lt;ref name=introspectionillusion/&gt;

[[Timothy Wilson]] has tried to find a way out from "introspection illusion", recounted in his book ''Strangers to Ourselves.'' He suggests that the observation of our own behaviours more than our thoughts can be one of the keys for clearer introspective knowledge.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Criticisms===
{{Confusing section|date=July 2018}}
Some 21st century [[critical rationalism|critical rationalists]] argue that claims of correcting for introspection illusions or other cognitive biases pose a threat of immunizing themselves to criticism by alleging that criticism of psychological theories that claim cognitive bias are "justifications" for cognitive bias, making it [[falsifiability|non-falsifiable]] by labelling of critics and also potentially [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. These modern critical rationalists argue that a theory that defending a theory by claiming that it overcomes bias and alleging that critics are biased can defend any pseudoscience from criticism, that the claim that "criticism of A is a defense of B" is inherently incapable of being evidence-based and that any actual "most humans" bias (if it existed) would be shared by most psychologists and make psychology's claims of biases a way of accusing unbiased criticism of being biased and marketing the biases as overcoming of bias.&lt;ref&gt;R. Nola, H. Sankey (2012), "After Popper, Kuhn and Feyerabend: Recent Issues in Theories of Scientific Method"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Sassower (2014), "Popper's Legacy: Rethinking Politics, Economics and Science"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Ruprecht Kroenen''' is a fictional character in the ''[[Hellboy]]'' comic book series, created by [[Mike Mignola]].

In the comics, Kroenen was a relatively unremarkable [[Nazi]] [[SS]] scientist, whose most distinguishing characteristic was that he always wore a [[gas mask]] and protective bodysuit, which Mignola attributes to a disfiguring accident of some kind.

Director [[Guillermo del Toro]] created a significantly expanded biography for the character, to appear as a villain in the 2004 [[Hellboy (2004 film)|film adaptation]].

==History==

===Comics history===
A [[Germany|German]] scientist working for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]s, and a member of the [[Thule Society]], Dr. Kroenen became one of the top scientists for [[Project Ragna Rok]], and a close disciple of [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]], along with [[Ilsa Haupstein]] and [[Project Ragna Rok#Leopold Kurtz|Leopold Kurtz]].  He was present with Rasputin at the secret ritual in [[Scotland]] that brought [[Hellboy]] to the world.

Kroenen, Haupstein, and Kurtz were frozen inside a secret Nazi base, until they were resuscitated by industrialist Roderick Zinco, acting on Rasputin's orders.  Kroenen resumed work on several of his former projects, including making an "Apocalypse Army" by combining corpses with robotics.  He also convinced Zinco to retrieve the head of his colleague, [[Herman von Klempt]], from South America.  Kroenen retained an affection for his colleague, though Rasputin had rejected Klempt as unsuitable for Ragna Rok.  When Klempt's head was re-animated, he tried to convince Kroenen to abandon Rasputin's plan to awaken the [[Ogdru Jahad]] - and instead to use the Army to retrieve Klempt's work in South America.  Overhearing, Kurtz became furious and attacked Klempt's head, screaming, "Rasputin is master!"  In a panic, Kroenen seized a knife and killed Kurtz.  When their plan failed, an enraged Rasputin struck Zinco, who was blinded.  Wandering around, Zinco accidentally pressed a self-destruct button in the base, destroying it completely and taking Kroenen with it.

===Film biography===

(Kroenen's expanded biography appears as a series of comic panels in the book ''Hellboy: The Art of the Movie'', as well as in the special features of the film's DVD).

Karl Ruprecht Kroenen was born in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] in 1897. A musical prodigy with angelic features and blonde hair, young Kroenen toured the capitals of [[Europe]] singing [[opera]] until his voice deepened with the onset of [[puberty]], thereby ending his career. From a very early age, he demonstrated symptoms of [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], whipping himself with a fresh branch of oak each day, and finding pleasure in the pain. As a teenager, he loathed his awkwardness and developed an extreme form of [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (termed "surgical addiction" in the film).  In his obsession with physical perfection, he conducted brutal experiments on his own body, including surgically removing his own eyelids, lips, and his toe- and finger nails.  He also designed a tight-fitting gas mask to filter out [[Microorganism|germ]]s, which he wore almost permanently. He also became quite adept with mechanical devices, believing that fusing mechanical constructs with living bodies would help create perfection.  One of his early inventions was a [[clockwork]] [[nightingale]] that sang a [[Mozart]] aria perfectly.

[[Image:Hellboy Shot 1.jpg|thumb|left|Karl Ruprecht Kroenen as seen in the first Hellboy film]]

In 1930, he met the [[resurrection|resurrected]] Rasputin for the first time. Obsessed with purity, Kroenen quickly became Rasputin’s most loyal disciple. He subsequently joined the [[Nazi Party]], and rose quickly through the ranks, joining the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) in 1933 and achieving the rank of ''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' ([[lieutenant colonel]]). He was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for services to the [[Third Reich]], including a tour of duty as commandant of [[Auschwitz]] [[concentration camp]], where he served with distinction.  Kroenen became head of the [[Thule Society]], a group of German [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s obsessed with the [[occult]]. He helped them to spearhead [[Project Ragna Rok]], engineering the portal generator that would conjure the Scarlet Beast, Hellboy, in October 1944.

A masterful fencer, he also became renowned for his swordsmanship and created his own signature swords.

When [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] stormed the island off the coast of [[Scotland]] where Project Ragna Rok took place, Kroenen killed several of the American soldiers attacking the base, but was distracted by a [[grenade]] thrown under the portal device by a young Professor [[Trevor Bruttenholm]]. Kroenen tried to retrieve the grenade, but his left hand was blown off, and a length of concrete reinforcing rod (or [[rebar]]) impaled him through the chest, severing his spine. Shortly thereafter, he disappeared.

After his disappearance, in 1956, an unmarked grave in [[Romania]] was found. Dental records identified the remains as those of Kroenen.

However, Kroenen reappeared in 2004. Thanks to the inexplicable powers of science and black magic, Kroenen "repaired" himself with a [[prosthetic]] mechanical hand, a steel rod replacing the broken part of his spine and a [[clockwork]] [[heart]], operated by a wind-up key implanted in his chest. By cranking the key, he was able to increase his speed and reflexes. After long decades, the [[blood]] in his veins dried up completely, leaving only dust, and rendering him virtually invulnerable to gunshot wounds. He could also turn the key to "switch off" his body (literally), remaining in a dormant state and appearing dead, until he was reanimated. He used this deceptive technique to infiltrate the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|BPRD]] headquarters. After critically wounding BPRD Agent Clay, he faked his own death and lay beside Clay, and they were both taken into the headquarters. Once inside, Kroenen drew Rasputin there, and personally killed the now elderly Professor Bruttenholm, before disappearing with Rasputin.

The BPRD tracked Rasputin to his own [[mausoleum]] beneath [[Moscow]]. Hellboy seemingly avenged Bruttenholm's death by throwing Kroenen into an impalement trap — a spiked pit hidden beneath a [[trapdoor]]. Skewered on the stakes, Kroenen was crushed when Hellboy dropped a giant [[Gear|cog]] on top of him. The damage done to him was probably more than Kroenen could survive.

Kroenen's smashed gas mask later appeared in a display case at the BPRD in ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]''. In the script for that film, an epilogue scene was written to be a lead-in for a third movie, but was cut for budgetary reasons. An animated version of the scene appears on the DVD's special features. Found by Roderick Zinco in the mausoleum ruins, Kroenen's remains are brought to a doctor to be revived with advanced [[alchemy]], before traveling to the Arctic into a long abandoned Nazi weapon storage building to insert the disembodied head of Kroenen into a huge robotic body at which point Kroenen awakes and praises his "Master" foreseeing his resurrection as Rasputin appears on screen.

In the commentary of ''Golden Army'', Guillermo del Toro also stated that, in the planned story for the third film, Kroenen was to have some history with the character of [[Johann Krauss]]. This was hinted in the second film when Johann is seen staring in deep thought at Kroenen's mask in the display case during the part when Hellboy is in the ward.

==Weapons and equipment==
Kroenen's comics version is a fairly ordinary scientist, who seems to possess some surgical training.

In the original script for ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'', the young Professor Bruttenholm describes Kroenen as "one of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]]'s top scientists, and head of the [[Thule Society|Thule Occult Society]]."  In the film release, the line was re-dubbed so that the first phrase was replaced by "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s top assassin."

In his initial appearance, while wearing an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] uniform, Kroenen wields a [[Luger P08]] pistol against the attacking U.S. soldiers, and then a pair of [[Katar (dagger)|Katar]] (कटार)-like daggers that extend from the sleeves of his [[trench coat]].

In his later appearances, he wields a pair of [[tonfa]]-style swords, and also has several other daggers strapped to his suit.

Kroenen is also briefly seen in his workshop, which includes a whole array of disturbing gadgets, along with several different versions of his gas mask.

Several times in ''Hellboy II'', Kroenen's battered gasmask can be seen in a display case along with a golden mask that resembles the head of Sammael.

==Portrayals==
[[Czech Republic|Czech]] actor [[Ladislav Beran]] portrayed Kroenen in the film adaptation of ''Hellboy''.

This portrayal is radically different from the comics. Kroenen, who originally played the part of a meek character, who Del Toro describes as someone who is likely to say "Aargh! Don't break the machine!" is here portrayed as a murderous soldier who is inhumanly loyal to Rasputin.

==Critical response==
German film historian Florian Evers devotes a whole chapter of his book on [[National Socialism]] in modern pop culture to the character of Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. He points out the allegoric puzzle segments of [[Shoah]]-iconography behind the design of Kroenen, calling him an [[incarnation]] of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrnmeU9HQoAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=vexierbilder+des+Holocaust&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JVSeUPPgGoXOsgbUu4GICQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| work=Vexierbilder des Holocaust, LIT, Munster, 2011, pages 79-90 | title= Florian Evers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The real Karl Ruprecht==
The real [[Karl Ruprecht]] was an [[Austria]]n Nazi official and folklorist. He was born on June 19, 1910 in [[Gratkorn]].&lt;ref&gt;
Karl Ruprecht, dissertation: ''Wilhelm Heinrich Riehls "Kulturgeschichtliche Novellen" mit Berücksichtigung ihres Verhältnisses zur Quelle'', Paul Escher Publishing House, Königsberg, 1936, page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied German and English philology and folklore at the [[University of Graz]], then at the [[University of Vienna]], and then from 1934 on at the [[University of Königsberg]]. Karl Ruprecht earned his Phd with Prof. Walter Ziesemer and a work on [[Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl]]. He then worked at the "Office for the Improvement of Literature" (Amt Schrifttumspflege),&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Ash, Wolfram Nieß, Ramon Pils: Geisteswissenschaften im Nationalsozialismus. Das Beispiel der Universität Wien, Vienna University Press, Göttingen 2010, pages 219. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the "Office for Folklore and Organization of Festivals" (Amt Volkskunde und Feiergestaltung),&lt;ref&gt;Chriatiaan Janssen: Abgrenzung und Anpassung. Deutsche Kultur zwischen 1930 und 1945 im Spiegel der Referatenorgane Het Duitsche Boek und De Weegschaal, Waxmann, Münster 2003, pages 186-187.&lt;/ref&gt; both part of the [[Amt Rosenberg|Rosenberg Bureau]]. Within the [[Advanced School of the NSDAP]], he was a leading member of the "Reich Institute for German Folklore".&lt;ref&gt;
Nancy C. McEntire: ''The Folkore Historian, Journal of the Folklore and History Section of the American Folklore Society'', Indiana State University, Volume 22, 2005, pages 40, 54, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Ruprecht was the leader of the "Research Post for Peasant Life Structures" (Forschungsstelle Bäuerliche Lebensformen). He published articles in the [[Nationalsozialistische Monatshefte|National Socialist Monthly]] and the journal "Idea and Action" (Idee und Tat).

[[File:Apollo Pad Abort Test -2.jpg|thumb|Apollo LES [[pad abort test]] with [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] crew module.]]

A '''launch escape system (LES)''' or '''launch abort system (LAS)''' is a crew safety system connected to a [[space capsule]], used to quickly separate the capsule from its [[launch vehicle]] rocket in case of a launch abort emergency, such as an impending explosion. Such systems are usually of two types:
*A solid-fueled rocket, mounted above the capsule on a tower, which delivers a relatively large thrust for a brief period of time to send the capsule a safe distance away from the launch vehicle, at which point the capsule's parachute recovery system can be used for a safe landing on ground or water. The tower and rocket are jettisoned from the [[space vehicle]] in a normal flight at the point where it is either no longer needed, or cannot be effectively used to abort the flight. These have been used on the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo]], and [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] capsules.
*The crew are seated in [[ejection seats]] as used in military aircraft; each crewmember returns to Earth with an individual parachute. Such systems are effective in a limited range of altitudes and speeds. These have been used on the [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] capsules.

The system is typically controlled by a combination of automatic rocket failure detection, and a manual backup for the crew commander's use.

A launch escape system has performed its intended function twice successfully.  In 1983, the crew of the Soviet [[Soyuz 7K-ST No. 16L|Soyuz T-10-1]] were carried away from their launch vehicle via their LES two seconds before the launch vehicle exploded due to a pad fire.  The crew survived.

In 2018 the crew of [[Soyuz MS-10|Soyuz MS-10]] escaped their launch vehicle after a booster rocket separation failure occurred at an altitude of 50 km during the ascent. The crew were uninjured and landed safely.

==History==
[[File:Escape rocket of Mercury-Redstone 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The escape system unintentionally blasted off from the Mercury spacecraft on the failed [[Mercury-Redstone 1]] mission]]
The idea of using a rocket to remove the capsule from a space vehicle was developed by [[Maxime Faget]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://astronautix.com/craft/mertower.htm|title=astronautix Escape Tower|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108103328/http://astronautix.com/craft/mertower.htm|archivedate=2013-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system, using the tower on the top of the space capsule to house rockets, was first used on a test of the Project Mercury capsule in March 1959.
Historically, LESes were used on American [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Apollo abort modes|Apollo]] spacecraft. Both designs used a [[solid-fuel rocket]] motor. The Mercury LES was built by the Grand Central Rocket Company in [[Redlands, California]] (which later became the [[Lockheed Propulsion Company]]). Apollo used [[Apollo_spacecraft#Launch_Escape_System_.28LES.29|a design]] that had many similarities to the Mercury system. Launch Escape Systems continue to be used on the Russian [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] and Chinese [[Shenzhou programme]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX|SpaceX-designed]] [[Dragon V2]] uses a [[Hypergolic propellant|hypergolic]] [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fueled]] launch abort system integrated to the capsule to minimize spacecraft costs. 

The LES may be used while the [[launch vehicle]] is still on the [[launch pad]], or during its ascent.

The Soviet [[Vostok program|Vostok]] and American [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] spacecraft both made use of [[ejection seat]]s.  The [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] and the Soviet [[Buran programme|''Buran''-class]] [[spaceplane]]s would also have made use of them if they had ever flown with crews.  As shown by [[Soyuz T-10-1|Soyuz T-10a]], an LES must be able to carry a crew compartment from the launch pad to a height sufficient for its parachutes to open. Consequently, they must make use of large, powerful (and heavy) [[solid rocket]]s. The Soyuz launch escape system is called ''CAC'' or ''SAS'', from the Russian/[[Transliteration|transliterate]]d Russian ''Система Аварийного Спасения'' or ''Sistema Avariynogo Spaseniya'', meaning emergency rescue system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suzymchale.com/ruspace/soyescape.html|title=Soyuz launch escape system - RuSpace|first=Suzy|last=McHale|date=|website=suzymchale.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Space Shuttle]] was fitted with ejection seats for the two pilots in the initial "shakedown" flights, but these were removed once the vehicle was deemed operational and carried additional crew members, which could not be provided with escape hatches. Following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]], all surviving orbiters were fitted to allow for crew evacuation through the main ingress/egress hatch, although only when the Shuttle was in a controlled glide, as the crew would have had to reach the exit from their seats and jump out.

[[File:Crew_Dragon_Pad_Abort_Test_(16814592054).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Dragon V2]] undergoing a Pad Abort test on May 6, 2015, demonstrating a "pusher" LAS.]]
The [[Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]] being developed to follow the shuttle program will use a Mercury and Apollo-style escape rocket system, while an alternative system, called the [[Max Launch Abort System]] (MLAS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5300 NASA Spaceflight: ''Orion MLAS''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208094607/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5300 |date=2007-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been floated to use existing solid-rocket motors integrated into the bullet-shaped protective launch shroud.

Under NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) program [[Blue Origin]] has been awarded $3.7 million for development of an innovative 'pusher' LAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newspacejournal.com/2010/02/18/blue-origin-proposes-orbital-vehicle/ |title=Blue Origin proposes orbital vehicle |author=Jeff Foust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also under NASA's CCDev program, [[SpaceX]] was awarded $75 million for the development of their own version of a "pusher" LAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/asd/2011/04/19/02.xml |title=NASA Provides Seed Money For CCDev-2 |author=Frank Morring, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Dragon V2]] spacecraft will use its [[SuperDraco]] engines during a launch abort scenario. Although often referred to as a "pusher" arrangement since it lacks a tower, the Dragon V2 LAS removes both the capsule and its trunk together from the launch vehicle. The system is designed to abort with the Super Draco engines at the top of the abort stack as occurs with a more traditional tractor LAS. The concept was first tested in a Pad Abort test conducted at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|SLC-40]], [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], on May 6, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacex.com/news/2015/05/06/crew-dragon-completes-pad-abort-test|title=Crew Dragon Completes Pad Abort Test|first=Hannah|last=Post|date=6 May 2015|website=spacex.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SpaceX will next test the system during ascent of the Falcon 9 rocket in  [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]] from where it plans to launch crews to the International Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SpaceX moves launch of Dragon abort test to KSC|url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/spacex-moves-launch-of-dragon-abort-test-to-ksc/33950886|work=Local 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] intends to sell the LAS it was building for the [[Orion spacecraft]] to future commercial crew vehicle providers in the wake of cancellation of the Constellation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1002/18orionlas/ |title=Orbital sees bright future for Orion launch abort system |author=Stephen Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The first fully operational test flight of an LES was [[A-004|Apollo mission A-004]] on January 20, 1966. The mission used a [[Little Joe II]] booster, carrying an early version of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]].

[[File:Soyuz T-10-1 abort.jpg|thumb|Soviet officers watch as the [[Soyuz T-10-1|Soyuz T-10]] capsule aborts from the launch pad.]]
The first usage with a manned misison occurred during the attempt to launch [[Soyuz T-10-1]] on September 26, 1983. The rocket caught fire, just before launch, and the LES carried the crew capsule clear, seconds before the rocket exploded. The crew were subjected to an acceleration of 14 to 17 [[g-force|''g'']] (140 to 170&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for five seconds and were badly bruised.  Reportedly, the capsule reached an altitude of {{convert|2000|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=2}} and landed {{convert|4|km|mi|sp=us}} from the launch pad. The Soyuz LES system also has [[grid fin]]s mounted on the [[payload fairing]] that deploy to stabilize the craft.

An accidental pad firing of a launch escape system occurred during the attempted launch of the unmanned [[Soyuz 7K-OK No.1]] spacecraft on December 14, 1966. The vehicle's strap-on boosters did not ignite, preventing the rocket from leaving the pad. About 30 minutes later, while the vehicle was being secured, the LES engine fired. Separation charges started a fire in the rocket's third stage, leading to an explosion that killed a pad worker. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. Originally it was thought that the LES firing was triggered by a gantry arm that tilted the rocket past 7 degrees, meeting one of the defined in-flight abort conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kamanin Diaries|url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/kamaries.htm|website=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=18 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817172305/http://astronautix.com/articles/kamaries.htm|archivedate=17 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MOEA Framework''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[evolutionary computation]] library for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] that specializes in [[multi-objective optimization]].  It supports a variety of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), including [[genetic algorithms]], [[genetic programming]], [[grammatical evolution]], [[differential evolution]], and [[particle swarm optimization]].  As a result, it has been used to conduct numerous comparative studies to assess the efficiency, reliability, and controllability of state-of-the-art MOEAs.

== Features ==
The MOEA Framework is an extensible framework for rapidly designing, developing, executing, and statistically testing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).  It features 25 different state-of-the-art MOEAs and over 80 analytical test problems.  It supports NSGA-II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deb|first=K.|title=A Fast Elitist Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm: NSGA-II.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation|volume=6|pages=182–197|year=2000|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; its recently introduced successor NSGA-III&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deb|first=K.|author2=Jain, H.|title=An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point-Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part I: Solving Problems With Box Constraints.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation|volume=18|issue=4|pages=577–601|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; epsilon-MOEA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deb|title=A Fast Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Finding Well-Spread Pareto-Optimal Solutions.|journal=KanGAL Report No 2003002|year=2003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; GDE3.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kukkonen|author2=Lampinen|year=2005|title=GDE3: The Third Evolution Step of Generalized Differential Evolution.|journal=KanGAL Report Number 2005013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MOEA/D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=H.|author2=Zhang, Q. |title=Multiobjective Optimization problems with Complicated Pareto Sets, MOEA/D and NSGA-II.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation|volume=13|issue=2|pages=284–302|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  natively.  In addition, it integrates with the JMetal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmetal.sourceforge.org|title=JMetal Website}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Platform and Programming Language Independent Interface for Search Algorithms (PISA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/pisa/|title=PISA Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Borg MOEA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borgmoea.org|title=Borg MOEA Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; libraries to provide access to all popular MOEAs.  Additionally, using Java's [[service provider interface]] (SPI), new MOEAs and problems can be introduced into the framework.  This supports the use of the MOEA Framework in scientific studies, allowing new MOEAs to be tested against a suite of state-of-the-art algorithms across a large collection of test problems.

New problems are defined in the MOEA Framework using one or more decision variables of a varying type.  This includes common representations such as binary strings, real-valued numbers, and permutations.  It additionally supports evolving grammars in [[Backus–Naur form]] and programs using an internal [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]] programming language.  Once the problem is defined, the user can optimize the problem using any of supported MOEAs.

== Sensitivity analysis ==
The MOEA Framework is the only known framework for evolutionary computation that provides support for [[sensitivity analysis]].  Sensitivity analysis in this context studies how an MOEA's parameters impact its output (i.e., the quality of the results).  Alternatively, sensitivity analysis measures the robustness of an MOEA to changes in its parameters.  An MOEA whose behavior is sensitive to its paramterization will not be easily controllable; conversely, an MOEA that is insensitive to its parameters is controllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hadka|first=D.|author2=Reed, P.|title=Diagnostic Assessment of Search Controls and Failure Modes in Many-Objective Evolutionary Optimization|journal=Evolutionary Computation|year=2012|volume=20|issue=3|pages=423–452|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/EVCO_a_00053|doi=10.1162/evco_a_00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By measuring the sensitivities of each MOEA, the MOEA Framework can identify the controlling parameters for each MOEA and provide guidance for fine-tuning the parameters.  Additionally, MOEAs that are consistently insensitive to parameter changes across an array of problem domains are regarded highly due to their robust ability to solve optimization problems.

'''Marjorie Oelrichs Duchin''' (June 23, 1908 &amp;ndash; August 3, 1937), nicknamed "Bubbles", was an American socialite. The daughter of Marjorie Ramely Oelrichs (nee Turnbull) (1883-1952) and Charles de Loosey Oelrichs (1882-1973), she became the wife of dance bandleader [[Eddy Duchin]] after the two met at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf]], and wed on June 5, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Leo. ''The Big Band Almanac.'' Page 109. Da Capo Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known New York and Newport beauty, she was described by [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] as having "waxen skin and eyebrows like butterflies."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sally Bedell. ''In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley, the Legendary Tycoon and His Brilliant Circle''. Page 97. Simon and Schuster, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Edward Steichen]] photograph of Oelrichs was included in an advertisement for [[Pond's Creams|Pond's cold cream]] in a 1926 copy of ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Patricia A. ''Real Fantasies: Edward Steichen's Advertising Photography.'' Page 180. University of California Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Oelrichs died six days after the 1937 birth of the couple's son, [[Peter Duchin]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;''Dictionary of American Biography.'' Page 188. 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

A maternal aunt was suffragist [[Alison Turnbull Hopkins]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2040995/newport_mercury/ "Mrs. Alison T. Hopkins," ''Newport Mercury'' (March 23, 1951): 3.] via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the poet [[Blanche Oelrichs]] was her paternal aunt.

[[Kim Novak]] portrayed Oelrichs in the 1956 Hollywood biopic ''[[The Eddy Duchin Story]]'' opposite [[Tyrone Power]] as Duchin.

'''Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies''' ('''MA-MISS''') is a miniaturized [[imaging spectrometer]] designed to provide imaging and spectra by reflectance in the [[near-infrared]] (NIR) wavelength region and determine the mineral composition and [[stratigraphy]]. The instrument is part of the science payload onboard the European [[ExoMars rover]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/34664-exomars-facts.html ExoMars: Searching for Life on Mars]. Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s, and scheduled to [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in 2021. MA-MISS is essentially inside a drill on the Rover, and will take measurements of the sub-surface directly.

MA-MISS will help on the search for biosignatures by studying minerals and ices ''in situ'' before the collection of samples. The instrument is integrated within the Italian [[core drill]] system called DEEDRI, and it will be dedicated to ''in situ'' studies of the mineralogy inside the excavated holes in terms of visible and infrared spectral reflectance.&lt;ref name='Vago 2017'&gt;[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2016.1541 Ma_MISS on ExoMars: Mineralogical Characterization of the Martian Subsurface].

==Objectives==

The [[ExoMars|ExoMars programme]] is an [[astrobiology]] project focused on the search for [[biosignature]]s in the subsurface of Mars, and to better understand the geological evolution and [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] of Mars. The study of the Martian subsurface will provide important constraints on the nature, timing and duration of alteration and sedimentation processes on Mars, as well as on the complex interactions between the surface and the atmosphere. The stated objectives of the MA-MISS experiment are: &lt;ref name='Vago 2017'/&gt; 
*Determine the composition of subsurface materials.
*Map the distribution of subsurface [[Water on Mars|water]] and {{chem|CO|2}} ices.
*Characterize grain size.
*Reconstruct a [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] column for clues on subsurface geological processes.

'''Mary Eno Pinchot Meyer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|.|ər}}; October 14, 1920 &amp;ndash; October 12, 1964) was an American painter who lived in Washington D.C. Her work is considered part of the [[Washington Color School]] and was selected for the Pan American Union Art Exhibit at the [[Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art in Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Peter. ''Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.'' New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to [[Central Intelligence Agency]] official [[Cord Meyer]] from 1945–1958, and she became involved romantically with President [[John F. Kennedy]] after her divorce from Meyer.

Meyer was shot to death on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal|Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal]] towpath on October 12, 1964, three weeks after the release of the [[Warren Commission Report]], whose conclusions Meyer allegedly challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Peter. ''Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.'' New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, Robert D. ''First Hand Knowledge.'' New York: S.P.I. Books, 1992, pp. 274-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer’s long history of criticism of the CIA, the timing of her killing, the CIA’s wiretapping of her phone,&lt;ref&gt;Nina Burleigh, ''A Very Private Woman: The Life and Unsolved Murder of Presidential Mistress Mary Meyer'', New York: Bantam Books, 1998, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and the effort by CIA counterintelligence chief [[James Jesus Angleton]] to retrieve Meyer’s diary immediately after her death prompted investigation of possible CIA involvement in her murder.&lt;ref&gt;Bradlee, Ben., ''A Good Life - Newspapering and Other Adventures.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995. pp. 267-271.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Army personnel records for prosecution witness Lt. William L. Mitchell, released in 2015 and 2016 under the Freedom of Information Act, corroborate his ties to the intelligence community.&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary’s Mosaic'' (3rd edition), pp. 416-446.&lt;/ref&gt; CIA involvement has also been suggested by the phone call that was placed by top Agency official Wistar Janney to Ben Bradlee, hours before the police had identified Meyer’s body.&lt;ref&gt;Bradlee, ''A Good Life - Newspapering and Other Adventures,'' p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The man accused of the murder, Ray Crump, Jr., was acquitted at trial in July, 1965. The murder remains officially unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia: ''United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr. Defendant''; Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pinchot was born in New York City, the elder of two daughters of [[Amos Pinchot|Amos]] and [[Ruth Pickering Pinchot|Ruth]] (née Pickering) Pinchot. Amos Pinchot was a wealthy lawyer and a key figure in the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] who had helped fund the [[socialist]] magazine ''[[The Masses]]''.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=9781438119144|pages=240–241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd|authorlink=Michael Newton (author)|accessdate=March 12, 2013|chapter=Mary Pinchot Meyer|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA240#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother Ruth was Pinchot's second wife and was a journalist who wrote for such magazines as ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]''. Mary was also the niece of [[Gifford Pinchot]], a noted [[conservation movement|conservationist]] and two-time [[Governor of Pennsylvania]]. Pinchot and her younger sister Antoinette (nicknamed "Tony") were raised at the family's [[Grey Towers National Historic Site|Grey Towers]] home in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]]. As a child, Pinchot met such left-wing intellectuals as [[Mabel Dodge]], [[Louis Brandeis]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]], and [[Harold L. Ickes]]. She attended [[Brearley School]] and [[Vassar College]], where she became interested in [[Communism]]. She started dating [[William Attwood]] in 1935 and, while with him at a dance held at [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Choate]], first met John F. Kennedy in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Attwood, William. ''The Reds and the Blacks: A Personal Adventure.'' New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967. pp. 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

After her graduation from Vassar in 1942, Meyer became a journalist, writing for the [[United Press]] and ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]''. As a [[pacifist]] and member of the [[American Labor Party]], she came under scrutiny by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

==Marriage==
Pinchot met [[Cord Meyer]] in 1944 when he was a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] lieutenant who had lost his left eye because of shrapnel injuries received in combat. The two had similar pacifist views and beliefs in [[world government]] and married on April 19, 1945. That spring they both attended the UN Conference on International Organization in [[San Francisco]], during which the [[United Nations]] was founded, Cord as an aide of [[Harold Stassen]] and Pinchot as a reporter for a newspaper syndication service. She later worked for a time as an editor for ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. Their eldest child Quentin was born in November 1945, followed by Michael in 1947, after which Pinchot became a homemaker, although she attended classes at the [[Art Students League of New York]].

Cord Meyer became president of the [[United World Federalists]] in May 1947 and its membership doubled. Mary Meyer wrote for the organization's journal.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Croswell. ''Young Man In Quest Of Peace''. PM Sunday. Volume III – No. 237. (published by The Newspaper PM, Inc. New York.) Sunday, March 21, 1948. p. m6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, their third child, Mark, was born and they moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Meanwhile, her husband began to re-evaluate his notions of world government as members of the [[Communist Party USA]] infiltrated the international organizations he had founded. It is unknown when he first began secretly working with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], but in 1951 [[Allen Dulles]] approached Cord Meyer; he became an employee of the CIA and was soon a "principal operative" of [[Operation Mockingbird]], a covert operation meant to sway American print and broadcast media toward the CIA line.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

With her husband's CIA appointment, they moved to Washington D.C. and became highly visible members of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] society. Their acquaintances included [[Joseph Alsop]], [[Katharine Graham]], [[Clark Clifford]], and ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter [[James Truitt]] and his wife, noted artist [[Anne Truitt]]. Their social circle also included CIA-affiliated people such as [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.]], high-ranking counter-intelligence official [[James Angleton]], and Mary and [[Frank Wisner]], Meyer's boss at CIA. During her time as a CIA wife, Pinchot Meyer was openly critical of the Agency and its programs, likening CIA Director Allen Dulles to Machiavelli.&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary’s Mosaic'' (3rd edition), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] publicly accused Cord Meyer of being a [[Communism|Communist]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was reported to have looked into Mary's political past. Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner aggressively defended Meyer and he remained with the CIA. However, by early 1954, Cord Meyer had become unhappy with his CIA career. He used contacts from his covert operations in Operation Mockingbird to approach several New York publishers for a job but was rebuffed.

During the summer of 1954, [[John F. Kennedy]] and his wife [[Jackie Kennedy]] bought the house next door to the Meyers'; Pinchot Meyer and Jackie Kennedy became acquainted and "they went on walks together."&lt;ref&gt;Parmet, Herbert S. ''JFK: The Presidency of John F. Kennedy''. New York: Dial Press, 1983. p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1954, Cord Meyer was still with the CIA and often in Europe, running [[Radio Free Europe]], [[Radio Liberty]], and managing millions of dollars of U.S. government funds worldwide to support progressive-seeming foundations and organizations opposing the [[Soviet Union]].

One of Pinchot Meyer's close friends was her Vassar chum, Cicely d'Autremont, who married James Angleton.&lt;ref name="mcadams"&gt;mcadams.posc.mu.edu, ''[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/death12.htm Mary Pinchot Meyer]'', retrieved 1 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Meyer's sister Antoinette (Tony) married [[Ben Bradlee]], who was then Washington bureau chief of ''[[Newsweek]]''. On December 18, 1956, the Meyers' middle son Michael, aged nine, was hit by a car near their house and killed. Although this tragedy briefly brought Mary and Cord Meyer closer for a time, Mary filed for divorce in 1958.

==Relationship with Kennedy==
After the divorce, Pinchot Meyer and her two surviving sons moved to Georgetown. She began painting again in a converted garage studio at the home of her sister Tony and Tony's husband, [[Ben Bradlee]]. She also started a close relationship with abstract-minimalist painter [[Kenneth Noland]] and became friendly with [[Robert Kennedy]], who had purchased his brother's house, [[Hickory Hill (McLean, Virginia)|Hickory Hill]], in 1957. [[Nina Burleigh]], in her book ''A Very Private Woman'', writes that after the divorce Meyer became "a well-bred ingenue out looking for fun and getting in trouble along the way."&lt;ref name="secrets"&gt;O'Brien, Patricia, ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E3DB113AF933A15751C1A96E958260 When History Had Secrets]'', ''New York Times'', 20 December 1998, retrieved 1 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Angleton told Joan Bross, the wife of John Bross, a high-ranking CIA official, that he had begun tapping Mary Meyer's telephone after she left her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh, ''A Very Private Woman'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Angleton often visited the family home and took her sons on fishing outings. Pinchot Meyer visited John F. Kennedy at the White House in October 1961 and their relationship became intimate.&lt;ref name="mcadams"/&gt; Pinchot Meyer told Anne and James Truitt she was keeping a diary.

Rumors and tabloid press reports of her affair with Kennedy&lt;ref name="Enquirer"&gt;Ward, Bernie and Toogood, Granville. "Former Vice President of Washington Post Reveals JFK - 2 Year White House Romance." ''National Enquirer''. March 2, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 1976"&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron and Nobile, Phillip. "The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair." ''New Times''. July 9, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; were confirmed by her brother-in-law, ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Ben Bradlee]], in his 1995 autobiography ''A Good Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Bradlee, Ben., ''A Good Life - Newspapering and Other Adventures.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster,  1995. pp. 266-271.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Timothy Leary]] later claimed Pinchot Meyer influenced Kennedy's "views on nuclear disarmament and rapprochement with Cuba." In an interview with Nina Burleigh, Kennedy aide Myer Feldman said, "I think he might have thought more of her than some of the other women and discussed things that were on his mind, not just social gossip." Burleigh wrote, "Mary might actually have been a force for peace during some of the most frightening years of the cold war..."&lt;ref name="burleigh"&gt;Burleigh, Nina, ''[http://partners.nytimes.com/books/first/b/burleigh-private.html A Very Private Woman]'' (''NYT'' excerpt), Bantam, 1998, retrieved 1 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 interview with author [[Peter Janney]] for his book ''Mary's Mosaic'', journalist and Kennedy intimate [[Charles L. Bartlett (journalist)|Charles Bartlett]] emphasized the serious nature of Pinchot Meyer's romance with the late president, stating, "That was a dangerous relationship. Jack was in love with Mary Meyer. He was certainly smitten with her, he was heavily smitten. He was very frank with me about it."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1963, one month before his assassination, Kennedy wrote a letter to Mary Meyer, imploring her to join him for a tryst. The unsent letter, written on White House stationery and retained by Kennedy's personal secretary Evelyn Lincoln, sold in June 2016 at auction for just under $89,000.&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2016/06/24/jfk-love-letter-sells-for-big-money/eEXTw3JN7Qi9CIDhGdtwtM/story.html|title=JFK love letter to his alleged mistress sells for big money|date=June 24, 2016|publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter reads: "Why don’t you leave suburbia for once – come and see me – either here – or at the Cape next week or in Boston the 19th. I know it is unwise, irrational, and that you may hate it – on the other hand you may not – and I will love it. You say that it is good for me not to get what I want. After all of these years – you should give me a more loving answer than that. Why don’t you just say yes." The letter is signed "J."&lt;ref name=Letter/&gt;

==Murder==
[[File:Mary Pinchot Meyer (3145208929).jpg|thumb|right|250px|C &amp; O Canal from Chain Bridge at the base of the Palisades]]
On October 12, 1964, Pinchot Meyer finished a painting and went for her customary daily walk along the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] towpath in Georgetown. Mechanic Henry Wiggins was trying to fix a car on Canal Road and heard a woman cry out, "Someone help me, someone help me." Wiggins heard two gunshots and ran to a low wall looking upon the path where he saw "a black man in a light jacket, dark slacks, and a dark cap standing over the body of a white woman."&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia: United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr. Defendant;
Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20. 1965, pp. 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinchot Meyer's body had two bullet wounds, one in the left temple and one in the back.&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia: ''United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr. Defendant''; Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20. 1965, pp. 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; An FBI forensic expert later said "dark haloes on the skin around both entry wounds suggested they had been fired at close-range, possibly [[point-blank]]".

Approximately forty minutes after the murder, Washington D.C. Police Detective John Warner spotted a soaking-wet African American man named Ray Crump about a quarter of a mile from the murder scene. Crump wasn’t running; "he was walking," Detective Warner testified at the murder trial.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; Crump was arrested at 1:15 pm at the murder scene based on car mechanic Wiggins’ statement to police that Crump was the man he had seen standing over the victim’s body.&lt;ref&gt;''United States District Court for the District of Columbia: United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr. Defendant''; Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20. 1965, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the murder, a second witness, Army Lt. William L. Mitchell, came forward and told police that when jogging on the towpath the preceding day, he had seen a black man trailing a white woman he believed was Mary Meyer. Mitchell’s description of the man’s clothing was similar to the clothing Crump had been wearing that day. On the strength of the statements of these two witnesses, Crump was indicted without a preliminary hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Peter. Mary’s Mosaic (3rd edition 2016), pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no gun was ever found, and Crump was never linked to any gun of the type used to murder Mary Pinchot Meyer. The FBI Crime Report, withheld from the defense during the trial and published by Peter Janney in his book ''Mary's Mosaic'', documented that there was no forensic evidence linking Crump to the victim or murder scene.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', pp. 418-421.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Pinchot Meyer bled profusely from her head wound, no trace of her blood was found on Crump's person or clothing.&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia: ''United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr. Defendant''; Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20. 1965.'' pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FBI Crime Report in Janney, Peter, ''Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.'' New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, pp.&amp;nbsp;418–421&lt;/ref&gt; On the afternoon of the murder, hours before police had identified the body, CIA official Wistar Janney first placed a call to Meyer’s brother-in-law Ben Bradlee, and then subsequently to Cord Meyer, notifying them both of Meyer’s death.&lt;ref&gt;Bradlee, ''A Good Life - Newspapering and Other Adventures'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Cord, ''Facing Reality: From World Federalism to the CIA.'' (Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1980). pp. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Crump came to trial, Judge [[Howard Francis Corcoran|Howard Corcoran]] ruled Mary Pinchot Meyer's private life could not be disclosed in the courtroom. Pinchot Meyer's background was also kept from [[Dovey Johnson Roundtree]], Crump's lawyer, who later recalled she could find out almost nothing about the murder victim: "It was as if she existed only on the towpath on the day she was murdered." At trial, Roundtree demonstrated the porousness of the police dragnet and showed that the black man described by the two witnesses was approximately 50 pounds heavier and five inches taller than Crump.&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Peter, ''Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.'' New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, pp.132-137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United States District Court for the District of Columbia: United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr. Defendant; Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20. 1965.'' pp. 927-938&lt;/ref&gt; Crump was acquitted of all charges on July 29, 1965, and the murder remains unsolved. Crump went on to what has been described as a "horrific life of crime."&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt; Post-trial revelations, however, appear to further corroborate his innocence in the Meyer murder, notably the likely presence of another black man at the scene after his arrest and the fact that the police search for his jacket was dispatched 15 minutes before his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Peter, ''Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.'' New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, pp.122-130&lt;/ref&gt; Crump's attorney Dovey Roundtree, in her autobiography ''Justice Older than the Law'', stated that Crump had an alibi witness but that she disappeared before trial.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Katie, and Roundtree, Dovey Johnson. ''Justice Older Than the Law: The Life of Dovey Johnson Roundtree.'' Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2009, pp. 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cord Meyer left the CIA in 1977. In his 1982 autobiography ''Facing Reality: From World Federalism to the CIA'' he wrote, "I was satisfied by the conclusions of the police investigation that Mary had been the victim of a sexually motivated assault by a single individual and that she had been killed in her struggle to escape."&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=Cord |authorlink=Cord Meyer |date=1982 |chapter=Chapter 7: Private Sorrow |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOyriqI87LcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Facing Reality: From World Federalism to the CIA |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOyriqI87LcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=University Press of America, Inc. |pages=143–144 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated he rejected "journalistic speculation" that said he believed his former wife's death had some other explanation.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

==Posthumous allegations==

===James Truitt and the ''National Enquirer''===
The March 2, 1976, issue of the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' quoted [[James Truitt]] as stating Meyer had a two-year affair with [[John F. Kennedy]] and that they smoked marijuana in a [[White House]] bedroom.&lt;ref name=Enquirer/&gt; According to Truitt, their first rendezvous occurred after Meyer was chauffeured to the White House in a limousine driven by a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent where she was met by Kennedy and taken to a bedroom.&lt;ref name=Enquirer/&gt; He stated that Meyer and Kennedy regularly met in that manner, sometimes two or three times each week, until [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|his assassination]]. Truitt said the two would "usually have drinks or dinner alone or sometimes with one of the aides", and claimed that Meyer offered [[marijuana]] cigarettes to Kennedy after one such meeting on April 16, 1962. He said after they smoked three joints, she commented, "This isn't like cocaine. I'll get you some of that." According to the ''Enquirer'', Meyer also kept a diary of the affair.&lt;ref name=Enquirer/&gt; The paper quoted Tony Bradlee — Meyer's sister — as confirming the existence of the affair and the diary, stating that Bradlee found the diary in Meyer's [[Studio#Art studio|studio]] after her death, then turned it over to [[James Jesus Angleton]] who subsequently burned it at [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]].&lt;ref name=Enquirer/&gt;

In an interview with a correspondent from ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Truitt confirmed the ''Enquirer'''s account, stated that Meyer had told him of the affair, and that he had kept notes about what he had been told. According to Truitt, Meyer and Kennedy met approximately 30 times — frequently when [[Jackie Kennedy]] was out of town — from January 1962 until the time of the President's death in November 1963. Truitt stated that the two would occasionally have drinks or dinner with one of Kennedy's aides, whom he identified as [[David Powers]] and Timothy J. Reardon Jr. Contradicting his earlier account with the ''Enquirer'', Truitt said Kennedy gave the marijuana to Meyer. Truitt acknowledged that he received payment from the ''Enquirer'', but did not disclose the amount of payment.&lt;ref name=Enquirer/&gt;

Truitt's allegations were denied by Kennedy aides [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] and Timothy Reardon, Jr.,&lt;ref name="WA Post 1976-02-23"&gt;{{cite news | last=Oberdorfer | first=Don | title=JFK Had Affair with D.C. Artist, Smoked Grass | work=Washington Post | date=February 23, 1976 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Powers was unavailable for comment. Pinchot Meyer's sister Tony stated that the Enquirer had quoted her out of context to create the impression that she agreed with Truitt's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron and Nobile, Phillip. "The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair." ''New Times''. July 9, 1976. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Post'', AP and UPI printed a follow-up story which cited assertions by Truitt's physician and his former wife that his judgment was impaired by mental illness.&lt;ref name="WA Post 1976-02-23" /&gt; However, Truitt's allegations regarding Pinchot Meyer's affair with the late President Kennedy and the existence of a diary in which she recorded the affair were confirmed in 1995 by her brother-in-law Ben Bradlee in his memoir ''A Good Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Bradlee, ''A Good Life''. pp. 267-268&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth O’Donnell also confirmed the affair in his 1977 interviews with the late author Leo Damore.&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diary===
[[Ben Bradlee]] states in his 1995 memoir ''A Good Life'' that he and his wife Tony received a phone call on the night of the murder from Pinchot Meyer's friend Anne Truitt in Japan, who was looking for James Jesus Angleton at the Bradlee house. Truitt advised all of them, including Angleton, of the existence of the Pinchot Meyer diary and the urgent need to retrieve it, given its details of her affair with President Kennedy during the last two years of his life.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 1976"/&gt; A decision was then quickly made by Bradlee, his wife, James Angleton and his wife Cicely, and another friend present at the scene, to keep the diary's existence from authorities.

According to Bradlee's 1995 account – one of at least four conflicting versions of the events surrounding the diary&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Mary's Mosaic, pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; – the search at Pinchot Meyer's art studio behind the Bradlee house began the day after the murder. Bradlee says he and his wife arrived at the studio with tools to obtain entry, since they had no key, and upon arriving they found Angleton in the process of picking the lock with special tools he had for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Bradlee, A Good Life. pp. 267-268.&lt;/ref&gt; "The fact that the CIA's most controversial counterintelligence specialist had been caught in the act of breaking and entering, and looking for her diary," Bradlee said, was not something he considered appropriate for public disclosure.  With respect to the diary itself, he added, he and his wife, upon reading it and seeing that it revealed Pinchot Meyer's affair with the late President Kennedy, "concluded this was in no sense a public document, despite the braying of the knee jerks about some public right to know."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. pp. 269-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bradlee testimony at murder trial ===
Bradlee's 1995 memoir account conflicted with the testimony he gave at the July 1965 trial of Ray Crump, the African-American laborer accused of Pinchot Meyer's murder, where he was asked by prosecuting attorney Alfred Hantman whether he had made any effort to gain entrance to his sister-in-law's art studio on the evening of the murder. Bradlee answered in the affirmative, but gave no indication of any difficulty in entering the padlocked premises, nor of the presence of anyone else accompanying him in this endeavor. Asked by Hantman, "Now besides the usual articles of Mrs. Meyer's avocation, did you find there any other articles of her personal property?" Bradlee replied, "There was a pocketbook there," adding that it contained keys, a wallet, cosmetics, and pencils.&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia: ''United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr. Defendant''; Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20, 1965, pp.46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; He made no mention of the diary.

Upon learning years later of the existence, contents and alleged burning of the diary, prosecutor Alfred Hantman and defense attorney Dovey Johnson Roundtree, as well as D.C. Police Detective Bernie Crooke, stated that knowledge of that information at the time of the trial would have materially affected the proceedings. "I’d have been very upset at the time if I’d known that the deceased's diary had been destroyed," Crooke told author Ron Rosenbaum in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum &amp; Nobile, "The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair," p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1991 interview with the late author Leo Damore, Hantman said that he had been "totally unaware of who Mary Meyer was or what her connections were," and that having that knowledge "could have changed everything."&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2009 autobiography, ''Justice Older than the Law'', defense counsel Dovey Johnson Roundtree expressed shock at learning of the diary's significance from Bradlee's book. "How differently my line of cross-examination would have run had I been aware, on July 20, 1965, of the story Mr. Bradlee told thirty years later in his autobiography . . . James Angleton's awareness of the diary's existence and his interest in finding it, reading it, and destroying it – all of that unsettled me deeply when I read Mr. Bradlee's 1995 account, as did his insistence that the diary was a private document…Had I been aware of it, I would have felt compelled to pursue it."&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Katie, and Roundtree, Dovey Johnson. ''Justice Older Than the Law: The Life of Dovey Johnson Roundtree.'' Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2009, pp. 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinchot Meyer biographers Peter Janney and Nina Burleigh have both criticized Bradlee's omission of key information under oath.&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Bradlee had excoriated Cord Meyer [Pinchot Meyer's ex-husband] for his ‘derisive scorn’ for the people's right to know in the 1960s, but the rules changed when the subject of a story was his sister-in-law," Burleigh says.&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh, ''A Very Private Woman'', pp. 297-298.&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] champion of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] investigation admitted in his memoir that he gave Mary Meyer's diary to the CIA because it was ‘a family document.’"&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timothy Leary===
In 1983, former [[Harvard University]] psychology lecturer [[Timothy Leary]] claimed that in the spring of 1962, Pinchot Meyer, who, according to her biographer [[Nina Burleigh]] "wore manners and charm like a second skin",&lt;ref name="burleigh"/&gt; told Leary she was taking part in a plan to avert worldwide nuclear war by convincing powerful male members of the Washington establishment to take mind-altering drugs, which would presumably lead them to conclude that the [[Cold War]] was meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Timothy F., ''Flashbacks'', Tarcher, 1983, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Peter. ''Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.'' New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, pp. 222-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Leary, Meyer had sought him out for the purpose of learning how to conduct [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] sessions with these powerful men, including, she strongly implied, President John F. Kennedy, who was then her lover. Leary alleged that Pinchot Meyer told him she had shared in this plan with at least seven other Washington socialite friends who held similar political views and were trying to supply LSD to a small circle of high-ranking government officials. Leary also claimed that Pinchot Meyer had asked him for help while in a state of fear for her own life after the assassination of President Kennedy.

In his biography ''[[Flashbacks (book)|Flashbacks]]'' (1983), Leary claimed he had a call from Pinchot Meyer soon after the Kennedy assassination during which she sobbed and said, "They couldn't control him any more. He was changing too fast...They've covered everything up. I gotta come see you.  I'm afraid.  Be careful."&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Timothy F., ''Flashbacks'', Tarcher, 1983, p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Burleigh does not draw a conclusion as to whether Meyer participated in LSD sessions with President Kennedy or other powerful figures, but also does not dismiss Leary's claims out of hand. Burleigh confirms Pinchot Meyer's own use of LSD, her involvement with Leary during his tenure at Harvard, and that this involvement occurred at the same time as Pinchot Meyer's intimate association with President Kennedy. Burleigh also states that the timing of Pinchot Meyer's visits to Leary coincided with the dates of Meyer's known private meetings with Kennedy. Burleigh writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mary's visits to Timothy Leary during the time she was also Kennedy's lover suggest that Kennedy knew more about hallucinogenic drugs than the CIA might have been telling him.  No one has ever confirmed that Kennedy tried LSD with Mary.  But the timing of her visits to Timothy Leary do coincide with her known private meetings with the president.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Burleigh, ''A Very Private Woman: The Life and Unsolved Murder of Presidential Mistress Mary Meyer'', New York: Bantam Books, 1998, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing interviews with the late author Leo Damore, Peter Janney asserts in his book ''Mary's Mosaic'' that Kennedy and Meyer did have a mild psychedelic experience together, probably LSD or [[psilocybin]],&lt;ref name="bostonglobe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2012/05/26/north_shore_author_peter_janney_makes_his_case_for_the_cia_plotting_to_murder_john_f_kennedy_and_jfk_mistress_mary_pinchot_meyer/|title=One man's suspicion, obsession, and an unsolved murder|last=Kahn|first=Joseph P.|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May 1963 at the Georgetown home of journalist Joseph Alsop. According to Janney, Meyer's friend, journalist Anne Chamberlin, confided to Damore that this event did take place. Chamberlin was also allegedly part of Meyer's LSD group in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', pp.222-226; pp. 254-256.&lt;/ref&gt;

LSD was then legal in the US, and its use to facilitate artistic endeavors was common in some of Pinchot Meyer's social circles.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Burleigh, ''A Very Private Woman: The Life and Unsolved Murder of Presidential Mistress Mary Meyer'', New York: Bantam Books, 1998, pp. 67, 169-74, 211, 212, 289, 290, 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 2009 film ''[[An American Affair]]'' [[Gretchen Mol]] starred as a character based on Mary Pinchot Meyer.

In the Canadian-American miniseries ''[[The Kennedys (miniseries)|The Kennedys]]'' (2011) Meyer was portrayed by Canadian actress [[Nahanni Johnstone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4284">[[File:Jastrzębiec Abramowiczów.jpg|thumb|Abramowicz coat of arms]]
'''Mikołaj Abramowicz''' or '''Abrahamowicz''' ({{lang-lt|Mikalojus Abrahamovičius}}) ([[:Category:1590s births|1590s]]&amp;mdash;[[:Category:1651 deaths|1651]]) was a [[Polish-Lithuanian (adjective)|Polish-Lithuanian]] soldier who was one of the leading military and diplomatic figures of his period.

A [[szlachcic]], of [[Jastrzębiec coat of arms]], Mikołaj Abramowicz was the son of [[Smoleńsk Voivodeship|Smolensk]] [[voivode]] [[Jan Abramowicz]]. His birth documents have not survived, but it is recorded that he served as the senior cannon officer (artillery leader) during the 1621&amp;ndash;22 [[Polish-Swedish wars|war with Sweden]]. In subsequent conflicts with [[History of Sweden (1611-1648)|Sweden]], he fought in the failed [[Polish–Swedish War (1621–1625)|1625 campaign]], capturing the bridge crossing at [[Daugava River|Daugava]], and particularly distinguished himself as a regimental commander during the [[Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629)|1626&amp;ndash;29 war]], in the [[Battle of Vistula]].

As one of the last [[Protestant]] leaders in the predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] region, he granted his [[Lutsk]] mansion to the Lithuanian [[Calvinist]] [[synod]] for use as an evangelical school.

Returning to military service, Mikołaj Abramowicz served in the 1633&amp;ndash;34 [[Smolensk War]] and, holding the rank of colonel, was one of the negotiators in the June 1634 [[Treaty of Polyanovka]], which ended the conflict. In 1638 King [[Władysław IV Vasa]] nominated him as [[Cześnik]] Wielki Litewski (Great Grand Duke's Cup-Bearer of Lithuania). He rose to the office of [[castellan]] of [[Mstsislaw|Mścisław]] in 1639, General (top commander) of the Artillery of Lithuania in 1640, [[Voivode of Mścisław]] in 1643, and [[Trakai voivodeship|voivode of Trakai]] in 1647.

In view of Abramowicz's prominent activity in the Lithuanian Calvinist synod at a time of increased [[Counter-Reformation]] in the Commonwealth, his ability to retain high offices, was taken as sign of King Władysław's faith in his leadership. The confidence proved particularly well-founded during the 1645 event known as the [[Trubchevsk]] incident (''incydent trubecki''), as Lithuanian nobles rose in opposition to the king's treaty with Russia, which signed away the fortified border town of Trubchevsk. The king sent Abramowicz at the head of a company of King's Guards to restore order and oversee the territorial transfer. In the aftermath, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]] lodged a high complaint against Abramowicz for illegal expropriation of property and sentenced him to loss of honor, banishment and a high compensatory damage. The sentences were never carried out due to the intervention of the king, who rewarded Abramowicz's loyalty with advancement to the [[Trakai Voivodeship]].

In the final three years of his life, Mikołaj Abramowicz served as a diplomat in the 1648 negotiations with Sweden, and in the Senate talks of 1649. In his final public function, he signed the Senate resolution known as the ''Evangelical Salvation'', providing certain rights to Calvinists. He died in Vilnius in his early to mid-fifties.

A '''mirror image''' (in a plane mirror) is a reflected duplication of an object that appears almost identical, but is reversed in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface. As an [[optics|optical]] effect it results from [[Specular reflection|reflection]] off of substances such as a [[mirror]] or [[water]]. It is also a concept in [[geometry]] and can be used as a conceptualization process for 3-D structures.

In [[geometry]], the mirror image of an object or [[2D geometric model|two-dimensional figure]] is the [[virtual image]] formed by [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a [[plane mirror]]; it is of the same size as the original object, yet different, unless the object or figure has [[reflection symmetry]] (also known as a [[P-symmetry]]).

Two-dimensional mirror images can be seen in the reflections of mirrors or other reflecting surfaces, or on a printed surface seen inside-out. If we look at an object that is effectively two-dimensional (such as writing) and then turn it towards a mirror, the object turns through an angle of 180º and we see a left-right reversal in the mirror. In this example, it is the change in orientation rather than the mirror itself that causes the observed reversal. Another example is when we stand with our backs to the mirror and face an object that's in front of the mirror. Then we compare the object with its reflection by turning ourselves 180º, towards the mirror. Again we perceive a left-right reversal due to a change in orientation. So, in these examples the mirror does not actually cause the observed reversals.

===In three dimensions===
[[File:Mirror.jpg|thumb|A symmetrical urn and its mirror image]]
The concept of reflection can be extended to [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] objects, including the inside parts, even if they are not [[transparency (optics)|transparent]]. The term then relates to structural as well as visual aspects. A three-dimensional object is reversed in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface. In physics, mirror images are investigated in the subject called [[geometrical optics]]. 

In chemistry, two versions (isomers) of a molecule, one a "mirror image" of the other, are called [[enantiomer]]s if they are not "superposable" (the correct technical term, though the term "superimposable" is also used) on each other. That is an example of [[chirality (chemistry)]]. In general, an object and its mirror image are called [[enantiomorph]]s.

If a point of an object has coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') then the image of this point (as reflected by a mirror in the ''y'', ''z'' plane) has coordinates (-''x'', ''y'', ''z''). Thus reflection is a reversal of the coordinate axis perpendicular ([[Surface normal|normal]]) to the mirror's surface. Although a plane mirror reverses an object only in the direction normal to the mirror surface, there is usually a ''perception'' of a left-right reversal. Hence, the reversal is called "lateral inversion". The perception of a left-right reversal is probably because the left and right of an object are defined by its perceived top and front, but there is still some debate about the explanation amongst psychologists.The psychology of the perceived left-right reversal is discussed in "Much ado about mirrors" by Professor [[Michael Corballis]] (see "external links", below).  

Reflection in a mirror ''does'' result in a change in [[Chirality (mathematics)|chirality]], more specifically from a right-handed to a left-handed coordinate system (or vice versa). As a consequence, if one looks in a mirror and lets two axes (up-down and front-back) coincide with those in the mirror, then this gives a reversal of the third axis (left-right).   

If a person stands side-on to a mirror, left and right will be reversed ''directly'' by the mirror, because the person's left-right axis is then normal to the mirror plane. However, it's important to understand that there are ''always'' only two enantiomorphs, the object and its image.Therefore, no matter how the object is oriented towards the mirror, all the resulting images are fundamentally identical (as Professor Corballis explains in his paper "Much ado about mirrors", mentioned above). 

In the picture of the mountain reflected in the lake (photograph top right), the reversal normal to the reflecting surface is obvious. Notice that there is no obvious front-back or left-right of the mountain. In the example of the urn and mirror (photograph to right), the urn is fairly symmetrical front-back (and left-right).Thus, no obvious reversal of any sort can be seen in the mirror image of the urn.

A mirror image appears more obviously three-dimensional if the observer moves, or if the image is viewed using [[binocular vision]]. This is because the relative position of objects changes as the observer's perspective changes, or is differently viewed with each eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_071b.html | title = Are dogs unable to see 2-D images (mirrors, photos, TV)? | date = 1985-09-27 | accessdate = 2008-01-31 | last = Adams | first = Cecil | publisher = [[The Straight Dope]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking through a mirror from different positions (but necessarily with the point of observation restricted to the halfspace on one side of the mirror) is like looking at the 3D mirror image of space; without further mirrors only the mirror image of the halfspace before the mirror is relevant; if there is another mirror, the mirror image of the other halfspace is too.

====Effect of mirror on the lighting of the scene====
A mirror does not just produce an image of what would be there without it; it also changes the light distribution in the halfspace in front of and behind the mirror. A mirror hanging on the wall makes the room brighter because additional light sources appear in the mirror image. However, the appearance of additional light does not violate the [[conservation of energy]] principle, because some light no longer reaches behind the mirror, as the mirror simply re-directs the light energy. In terms of the light distribution, the virtual mirror image has the same appearance and the same effect as a real, symmetrically arranged half-space behind a window (instead of the mirror). Shadows may extend from the mirror into the halfspace before it, and vice versa.

==Mirror writing==
[[File:Fire-mirror-image.jpg|thumb|The word "FIRE" and its mirror image, ERIF, are displayed on the front of this [[fire engine]]]]
{{Main|Mirror writing}}
In [[mirror writing]] a text is deliberately displayed in mirror image, in order to be read through a mirror. For example, emergency vehicles such as [[ambulance]]s or fire engines use mirror images in order to be read from a driver's [[rear-view mirror]]. Some [[movie theater]]s also take advantage of mirror writing in a [[Rear Window Captioning System]] used to assist individuals with [[hearing impairment]]s watching the film.

==Systems of mirrors==
In the case of two mirrors, in planes at an angle α, looking through both from the sector which is the intersection of the two halfspaces, is like looking at a version of the world rotated by an angle of 2α; the points of observations and directions of looking for which this applies correspond to those for looking through a frame like that of the first mirror, and a frame at the mirror image with respect to the first plane, of the second mirror. If the mirrors have vertical edges then the left edge of the field of view is the plane through the right edge of the first mirror and the edge of the second mirror which is on the right when looked at directly, but on the left in the mirror image.

In the case of two parallel mirrors, looking through both once is like looking at a version of the world which is translated by twice the distance between the mirrors, in the direction perpendicular to them, away from the observer. Since the plane of the mirror in which one looks directly is beyond that of the other mirror, one always looks at an oblique angle, and the translation just mentioned has not only a component away from the observer, but also one in a perpendicular direction. The translated view can also be described by a translation of the observer in opposite direction. For example, with a vertical [[periscope]], the shift of the world is away from the observer and down, both by the length of the periscope, but it is more practical to consider the equivalent shift of the observer: up, and backward.

It is also possible to create a [[non-reversing mirror]] by placing two [[first surface mirror]]s at 90º to give an image which is not reversed.

'''''Monster Rancher Advance 2''''' (known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Monster Farm Advance 2'''''|モンスターファーム アドバンス 2|Monsutā Fāmu Adobansu Tsū}}) is the second of the ''[[Monster Rancher]]'' games to be released on [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Monster Rancher Advance]]''.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay in ''Monster Rancher Advance 2'' involves the creating, training, and fighting of [[monsters]] much like previous games in the Monster Rancher series. Like the first Monster Rancher Advance, the player generates monsters by inputting key phrases. This is unlike the rest of the series on disk based video game systems, in which they generate monsters by inserting readable [[Compact Disc|CD]]s, or [[DVD]]s.

The player is also able to create a variety of monsters by combining two different monsters. The new monster will show qualities of both parents.

'''Murray Monster''' is a character on [[Sesame Street]]. He is performed by [[Joey Mazzarino]].

==History==
Murray is an energetic monster. Although unnamed, the character was referred to on the set as "FilFil," as his design is based on that of Filfil from ''[[Alam Simsim]]''. Beginning in Season 38, he gained an identity as Murray, hosting the "What's the Word on the Street?" segments that precede each episode of Sesame Street where he asks people what each Word of the Day means.

By season 39, he began appearing in his own segment "Murray Has a Little Lamb" where he goes to a certain school with his pet purple lamb Ovejita.

In season 40, Murray started serving as a host of the new "block format", presenting the letter and number of the day, introducing upcoming sketches within the episodes, and announcing the sponsors.

Murray was given a new segment in Season 42 called "Murray's Science Experiments" which are spread through the tune-ins.

==Joey Mazzarino on Murray Monster==
Joey Mazzarino talked about Murray Monster in his interview with the Tough Pigs website where he quoted "I kinda keep Murray like, who's the guy on ''[[Fraggle Rock]]''? Uncle Traveling Matt. Because I feel like he goes out into the real world, and when we put him onto the street, there's just a million characters who can service this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Hennes |title=A Chat with Joey Mazzarino, part 1 |url=http://www.toughpigs.com/a-chat-with-joey-mazzarino-part-1/ |work=Tough Pigs |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nautilus''' (from the [[Latin]] form of the original {{lang-grc|ναυτίλος}}, 'sailor') is a [[pelagic]] marine [[mollusc]] of the [[cephalopod]] family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily [[Nautilaceae]] and of its smaller but near equal suborder, [[Nautilina]].

It comprises six living species in two genera, the [[type genus|type]] of which is the genus ''[[Nautilus (genus)|Nautilus]]''. Though it more specifically refers to species ''[[Nautilus pompilius]]'', the name [[chambered nautilus]] is also used for any of the Nautilidae. All are protected under [[CITES Appendix II]].

Nautilidae, both extant and extinct, are characterized by [[involute]] or more or less convolute shells that are generally smooth, with compressed or depressed [[whorl (mollusc)|whorl]] sections, straight to sinuous sutures, and a tubular, generally central [[siphuncle]].&lt;ref name=Kummel&gt;Kümmel, B. 1964. Nautiloidae-Nautilida, in the [[Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology]], Geological Society of America and Univ of Kansas Press, Teichert and Moore eds.&lt;/ref&gt; Having survived relatively unchanged for millions of years, nautiluses represent the only living members of the subclass [[nautiloidea]], and are often considered "[[living fossil]]s".

The word nautilus is derived from the Greek ναυτίλος ''nautílos'' and originally referred to the paper nautiluses of the genus ''[[Argonauta]]'', which are actually  octopuses. The word ''nautílos'' literally means "sailor", as paper nautiluses were thought to use two of their arms as sails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Origin of nautilus |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/nautilus |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-11-15 |dictionary=Dictionary.com Unabridged }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
[[File:Nautilus diagram-en.svg|400px|thumb|Diagram of the anatomical structure of a female ''[[Nautilus pompilius]]'' including most of its internal organs.]]

===Cirri===
The "tentacles" of the nautiluses are actually [[cirrus (biology)|cirri]] (singular: cirrus), composed of long, soft, flexible appendages which are retractable into corresponding hardened sheaths. Unlike [[Cephalopod#Head appendages|the 8–10 head appendages]] of [[Coleoidea|coleoid]] cephalopods, nautiluses have many cirri. In the early embryonic stages of nautilus development a single [[molluscan]] foot differentiates into a total of 60–90 cirri, varying even within a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udIwDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Squid Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Cephalopods |last=Staaf |first=Danna |date=3 October 2017 |publisher=University Press of New England |isbn=9781512601282 |location=Lebanon, NH |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nautilus cirri also differ from the tentacles of some coleoids in that they are non-elastic and lack pads or suckers. Instead, nautilus cirri adhere to prey by means of their ridged surface. Nautiluses have a powerful grip, and attempts to take an object already grasped by a nautilus may tear away the animal's cirri, which will remain firmly attached to the surface of the object. The main cirri emerge from sheaths which cohere into a single firm fleshy mass. Also, the pair of cirri before the eye (pre-ocular) and the pair of cirri behind the eye (post-ocular) are separate from the others. These are more evidently grooved, with more pronounced ridges. They are extensively [[cilia]]ted and are believed to serve an [[Olfactory system|olfactory]] purpose.&lt;ref name=Willey&gt;{{Cite journal

===Digestive system===
The [[radula]] is wide and distinctively has nine teeth.

The mouth consists of a [[cephalopod beak|parrot-like beak]] made up of two interlocking jaws capable of ripping the animal's food— mostly crustaceans— from the rocks to which they are attached.&lt;ref name=grif&gt;{{Cite book

The crop is the largest portion of the digestive tract, and is highly extensible.  From the crop, food passes to the small muscular stomach for crushing, and then goes past a digestive caecum before entering the relatively brief intestine.

===Circulatory system===
Like all cephalopods, the blood of the nautilus contains [[hemocyanin]], which is blue in its oxygenated state. There are two pairs of [[gill]]s which are the only remnants of the ancestral [[Metamerism (biology)|metamerism]] to be visible in extant cephalopods.&lt;ref name=Wingstrand1985&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}}  Oxygenated blood arrives at the heart through four ventricles and flows out to the animal's organs through distinct aortas but returns through veins which are too small and varied to be specifically described.  The one exception to this is the vena cava, a single large vein running along the underside of the crop into which nearly all other vessels containing deoxygenated blood empty.  All blood passes through one of the four sets of filtering organs (composed of one pericardial appendage and two renal appendages) upon leaving the vena cava and before arriving at the gills for re-oxygenation.  Blood waste is emptied through a series of corresponding pores into the [[pallial cavity]].

===Nervous system===
The central component of the nautilus nervous system is the oesophageal [[nerve ring]] which is a collection of [[ganglia]], [[commissure]]s, and connectives that together form a ring around the animal's oesophagus.  From this ring extend all of the nerves forward to the mouth, tentacles, and funnel; laterally to the eyes and [[rhinophore]]s; and posteriorly to the remaining organs.

The nerve ring does not constitute what is typically considered a cephalopod "brain": the upper portion of the nerve ring lacks differentiated lobes, and most of the nervous tissue appears to focus on finding and consuming food (i.e., it lacks a "higher learning" center).  Nautiluses also tend to have rather short memory spans, and the nerve ring is not protected by any form of brain case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Shell===

{{double image|right|NautilusTop.jpg|76|NautilusBottom.jpg|76|A nautilus shell viewed from above (left), and from underneath  (right)}}

Nautiluses are the sole living cephalopods whose bony body structure is externalized as a planispiral [[Animal shell|shell]]. The animal can withdraw completely into its shell and close the opening with a leathery hood formed from two specially folded [[tentacle]]s. The shell is coiled, [[aragonite|aragonitic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Buchardt| first1 = B.| title = Diagenesis of aragonite from Upper Cretaceous ammonites: a geochemical case-study| journal = Sedimentology| volume = 28| issue =  3| pages = 423–438| year = 1981| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3091.1981.tb01691.x| last2 =  Weiner| first2 = S.|bibcode = 1981Sedim..28..423B }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nacre]]ous and pressure resistant, imploding at a depth of about {{cvt|800|m|ft|-2}}. The nautilus shell is composed of two layers: a [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] white outer layer, and a striking white [[iridescence|iridescent]] inner layer. The innermost portion of the shell is a pearlescent blue-gray. The [[osmeña pearl]], contrarily to its name, is not a [[pearl]], but a [[jewellery]] product derived from this part of the shell.

Internally, the shell divides into [[Camera (cephalopod)|camerae]] (chambers), the chambered section being called the [[phragmocone]]. The divisions are defined by [[Septa (biology)|septa]], each of which is pierced in the middle by a duct, the [[siphuncle]]. As the nautilus matures it creates new, larger camerae, and moves its growing body into the larger space, sealing the vacated chamber with a new septum. The camerae increase in number from around four at the moment of [[egg (biology)|hatching]] to thirty or more in adults.

The shell colouration also keeps the animal [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]] in the water. When seen from above, the shell is darker in color and marked with irregular stripes, which helps it blend into the dark water below. The underside is almost completely white, making the animal indistinguishable from brighter waters near the surface. This mode of [[camouflage]] is called [[countershading]].

The nautilus shell presents one of the finest natural examples of a [[logarithmic spiral]], although it is not a [[golden spiral]]. The use of nautilus shells in art and literature is covered at [[Chambered Nautilus#In literature and art|nautilus shell]].

===Size===
''[[Nautilus pompilius]]'' is the largest species in the genus. One form from [[Indonesia]] and northern [[Australia]], once called ''Nautilus repertus'', may reach {{cvt|25.4|cm}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Pisor, D.L. (2008). ''[[Registry of World Record Size Shells]]''. Fifth edition. ConchBooks, Hackenheim. 207&amp;nbsp;pp. {{ISBN|0615194753}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most nautilus species never exceed {{cvt|20|cm|in|0}}. ''[[Bellybutton Nautilus|Nautilus macromphalus]]'' is the smallest species, usually measuring only {{cvt|16|cm|in|frac=2}}. A dwarf population from the [[Sulu Sea]] (''[[Nautilus pompilius suluensis]]'') is even smaller, with a mean shell diameter of {{cvt|11.56|cm}}.&lt;ref name="Dunstan et al. 2011" /&gt;

==Physiology==

===Buoyancy and movement===
[[File:Nautilus.ogv|thumb|Nautilus locomotion&lt;br/&gt;File format: Ogg&lt;br/&gt;File size: 1.29 MB&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 5 seconds|alt=Video]]
[[Image:Nautilus oceanworld thailand.png|thumb|left|upright|Nautilus with extended tentacles and hyponome visible|alt=]]

To swim, the nautilus draws water into and out of the living chamber with its [[hyponome]], which uses [[jet propulsion]]. While water is inside the chamber, the [[siphuncle]] extracts [[salt]] from it and diffuses it into the blood. The animal adjusts its [[buoyancy]] only in long term density changes by [[osmosis]], either removing liquid from its chambers or allowing water from the blood in the siphuncle to slowly refill the chambers. This is done in response to sudden changes in buoyancy that can occur with predatory attacks of fish, which can break off parts of the shell. This limits nautiluses in that they cannot operate under the extreme [[hydrostatic pressure]]s found at depths greater than approximately {{convert|800|m}}, and in fact implode at about that depth, causing instant death.&lt;ref name="Dunstan et al. 2011" /&gt; The gas also contained in the chambers is slightly below atmospheric pressure at sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Nautilus: The Biology and Paleobiology of a Living Fossil. Springer Netherlands. pp. 552, ch. 34.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum depth at which they can regulate buoyancy by osmotic removal of chamber liquid is not known.&lt;ref name=Ward1987 /&gt;

The nautilus has the extremely rare ability to withstand being brought to the surface from its deep natural habitat without suffering any apparent damage from the experience.  Whereas fish or crustaceans brought up from such depths inevitably arrive dead, a nautilus will be unfazed despite the pressure change of as much as {{convert|80|atm|psi|lk=in}}. The exact reasons for this ability, which is thought to be coincidental rather than specifically functional, are not known, though the perforated structure of the animal's [[vena cava]] is thought to play an important role.&lt;ref name=grif/&gt;{{rp|p. 188}}

===Senses===
[[File:Nautilus pompilius (head).jpg|thumb|Head of ''Nautilus pompilius'' showing the rudimentary eye, which functions similarly to a [[pinhole camera]]]]

Unlike many other cephalopods, nautiluses do not have what many consider to be good vision; their [[eye]] structure is highly developed but lacks a solid [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. Whereas a sealed lens allows for the formation of highly focused and clear, detailed surrounding imagery, nautiluses have a simple [[Pinhole camera|pinhole]] eye open to the environment which only allows for the creation of correspondingly simple imagery.

Instead of vision, the animal is thought to use [[olfaction]] (smell) as the primary sense for [[foraging]] and for locating and identifying potential mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Grasso | first1 = F.| last2 = Basil | first2 = J.| title = The evolution of flexible behavioral repertoires in cephalopod molluscs| journal = Brain, Behavior and Evolution| volume = 74| issue = 3| pages = 231–245| year = 2009| pmid = 20029186| doi = 10.1159/000258669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ear" of the nautilus consists of structures called ''[[otocyst]]s'' located immediately behind the pedal [[ganglia]] near the nerve ring.  They are oval structures densely packed with elliptical [[calcium carbonate]] crystals.

===Brain and intelligence===
{{Main|Cephalopod intelligence}}
Nautiluses are much closer to the first cephalopods that appeared about 500 million years ago than the early modern cephalopods that appeared maybe 100 million years later ([[ammonoids]] and [[coleoids]]).  They have a seemingly simple [[brain]], not the large complex brains of [[octopus]], [[cuttlefish]] and [[squid]], and had long been assumed to lack intelligence.  But the cephalopod nervous system is quite different from that of other animals, and recent experiments have shown not only memory, but a changing response to the same event over time.&lt;ref name="callaway"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14033-simpleminded-nautilus-reveals-flash-of-memory.html|title=Simple-Minded Nautilus Shows Flash of Memory|author=Ewen Callaway|date=2 June 2008|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/12/iii.full.pdf#page=1&amp;view=FitH|title=Living Fossil Memories|author=Kathryn Phillips|date=15 June 2008|page=iii|volume=211|doi=10.1242/jeb.020370 |journal=Inside JEB|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crook"/&gt;

In a study in 2008, a group of nautiluses (''N. pompilius'') were given food as a bright blue light flashed until they began to associate the light with food, extending their tentacles every time the blue light was flashed. The blue light was again flashed without the food 3 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours later. The nautiluses continued to respond excitedly to the blue light for up to 30 minutes after the experiment. An hour later they showed no reaction to the blue light. However, between 6 and 12 hours after the training, they again responded to the blue light, but more tentatively. The researchers concluded that nautiluses had memory capabilities similar to the "[[short-term memory|short-term]]" and "[[long-term memory|long-term memories]]" of the more advanced cephalopods, despite having different brain structures.&lt;ref name="callaway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phillips" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crook"/&gt; However the long-term memory capability of nautiluses was much shorter than that of other cephalopods. The nautiluses completely forgot the earlier training 24 hours later, in contrast to octopuses, for example, which can remember conditioning for weeks afterwards. However, this may be simply the result of the [[classical conditioning|conditioning]] procedure being suboptimal for sustaining long-term memories in nautiluses. Nevertheless, the study showed that scientists had previously underestimated the memory capabilities of nautiluses.&lt;ref name="crook"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Robyn Crook  |author2=Jennifer Basil |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|title=A biphasic memory curve in the chambered nautilus, ''Nautilus pompilius'' L.

===Reproduction and lifespan===
Nautiluses reproduce by laying [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. Gravid females attach the fertilized eggs, either singly or in small batches, to rocks in warmer waters (21-25 Celsius), whereupon the eggs take eight to twelve months to develop until the {{convert|30|mm}} juveniles hatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hanlon |first1=Roger T. |last2=Messenger |first2=John B. |title=Cephalopod Behaviour |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521645836 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females spawn once per year and regenerate their [[gonad]]s, making nautiluses the only cephalopods to present [[iteroparity]] or [[polycyclic spawning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rocha | first1 = F. | last2 = Guerra | first2 = Á. | last3 = González | first3 = Á.

Nautiluses are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], in that males have four tentacles modified into an organ, called the "[[spadix (zoology)|spadix]]", which transfers sperm into the female's mantle during mating.  At sexual maturity, the male shell becomes slightly larger than the female's.&lt;ref name="Bruce Saunders1978"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bruce Saunders | first1 = W. | last2 = Spinosa | first2 = C. | title = Sexual Dimorphism in Nautilus from Palau | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 349–358 | year = 1978 | doi=10.2307/2400210|jstor=2400210| doi-broken-date = 2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Males have been found to greatly outnumber females in practically all published studies, accounting for 60 to 94% of all recorded individuals at different sites.&lt;ref name="Dunstan et al. 2011" /&gt;

The lifespan of nautiluses may exceed 20 years, which is exceptionally lengthy for a cephalopod, many of whom live less than three even in captivity and under ideal living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saunders WB |title=Nautilus Growth and Longevity: Evidence from Marked and Recaptured Animals |journal=Science |volume=224 |issue=4652 |pages=990–992 |date=June 1984 |pmid=17731999 |doi=10.1126/science.224.4652.990 |url=|bibcode = 1984Sci...224..990S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nautiluses typically do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 15 years old, limiting their reproductive lifespan to often less than five years.&lt;ref name="Dunstan et al. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dunstan AJ; Ward PD; Marshall NJ |title=''Nautilus pompilius'' life history and demographics at the Osprey Reef Seamount, Coral Sea, Australia |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=e16312 |date=February 2011 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0016312 |editor1-last=Solan |editor1-first=Martin |pmid=21347356 |pmc=3037366|bibcode = 2011PLoSO...616312D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

===Range and habitat===
[[File:Comparison of Nautilus capture rates with trapping depth.png|thumb|350px|Number of captured ''N.&amp;nbsp;pompilius'' at various depths around the Osprey Reef Seamount, [[Coral Sea]]. The data was collated from 271 trapping events spread across all months of the year. Nautiluses were most common at {{cvt|300|-|350|m|ft|-2}}. No specimens were recovered from a depth of less than {{cvt|150|m|ft|-2}} during 18 trapping efforts.&lt;ref name="Dunstan et al. 2011" /&gt;]]
Nautiluses are found in only the [[Indo-Pacific]], from 30° N to 30° S latitude and 90° E to 175° E longitude. They inhabit the deep slopes of [[coral reef]]s.

Nautiluses usually inhabit depths of several hundred metres. It has long been believed that nautiluses rise at night to feed, mate and lay [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], but it appears that, in at least some populations, the vertical movement patterns of these animals are far more complex.&lt;ref name=vertical&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dunstan | first1 = A.

==Evolution==
[[File:Allonautilus vs Nautilus.png|thumb|Shell characters of the genera ''[[Nautilus (genus)|Nautilus]]'' and  ''[[Allonautilus]]'']]
[[File:Section cut Nautilus.jpg|thumb|Section cut of a nautilus shell]]
[[Fossil]] records indicate that nautiloids have not evolved much during the last 500 million years. Many were initially straight-shelled, as in the extinct genus ''[[Lituites]]''. They developed in the Late [[Cambrian]] period and became a significant group of sea [[predator]]s during the [[Ordovician]] period. Certain species reached over {{cvt|2.5|m|ft|0}} in size. The other cephalopod subclass, [[Coleoidea]], diverged from the nautiloids long ago and the nautilus has remained relatively unchanged since. Nautiloids were much more extensive and varied 200 million years ago. [[Extinction|Extinct]] relatives of the nautilus include [[ammonite]]s, such as the [[baculite]]s and [[goniatites]].

The family Nautilidae has its origin in the [[Trigonocerataceae]] ([[Centroceratina]]), specifically in the [[Syringonautilidae]] of the [[Late Triassic]]&lt;ref name=Kummel /&gt; and continues to this day with ''[[Nautilus (genus)|Nautilus]]'', the type genus, and its close relative, ''[[Allonautilus]]''.

===Fossil genera===
[[File:Eutrephoceras dorbignyanum (Forbes in Darwin, 1846) - Santiago specimen.jpg|thumb|''[[Eutrephoceras|Eutrephoceras dorbignyanum]]'']]
The fossil record of Nautilidae begins with ''[[Cenoceras]]'' in the Late Triassic, a highly varied genus that makes up the [[Jurassic]] ''Cenoceras'' complex. ''Cenoceras'' is evolute to involute, and globular to lentincular; with a suture that generally has a shallow ventral and lateral lobe and a siphuncle that is variable in position but never extremely ventral or dorsal. ''Cenoceras'' is not found above the [[Middle Jurassic]] and is followed by the [[Upper Jurassic]]-[[Miocene]] ''[[Eutrephoceras]]''.

''[[Eutrephoceras]]'' is generally subglobular, broadly  rounded laterally and ventrally, with a small to occluded umbilicus, broadly rounded hyponomic sinus, only slightly sinuous sutures, and a small siphuncle that is variable in position.

Next to appear is the [[Lower Cretaceous]] ''[[Strionautilus]]'' from [[India]] and the European ex-[[USSR]], named by Shimankiy in 1951. ''Strionautilus'' is compressed, involute, with fine longitudinal striations. Whorl sections are subrectangular, sutures sinuous, the siphuncle subcentral.

Also from the Cretaceous is ''[[Pseudocenoceras]]'', named by Spath in 1927. ''Pseudocenoceras'' is compressed, smooth, with subrectangular whorl sections, flattened venter, and a deep umbilicus. The suture crosses the venter essentially straight and has a broad, shallow, lateral lobe. The siphuncle is small and subcentral. ''Pseudocenoceras'' is found in the [[Crimea]] and in [[Libya]].

''[[Carinonautilus]]'' is a genus from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] of [[India]], named by Spengler in 1919. ''Carinonautilus'' is a very involute form with high whorl section and flanks that converge on a narrow venter that bears a prominent rounded keel. The umbilicus is small and shallow, the suture only slightly sinuous. The siphuncle is unknown.

''[[Obinautilus]]'' has also been placed in Nautilidae by some authorities, though it may instead be an [[Argonautidae|argonautid]] [[octopus]].&lt;ref&gt;Teichert, C. &amp; T. Matsumoto (2010).

Throughout the world, nautilus are collected or fished for sale as live animals or to carve the shells for souvenirs and collectibles, not for just the shape of their shells, but also the nacreous inner shell layer, which is used as a [[pearl]] substitute.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nijman|first=Vincent|last2=Lee|first2=Paige Biqi |date=2016-12-07|title=Trade in nautilus and other large marine molluscs as ornaments and decorations in Bali, Indonesia |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311466511 |journal=ResearchGate|volume=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Angelis|first=Patricia|year=2012|title=Assessing the impact of international trade on chambered nautilus|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016699511000982|journal=Geobios|volume=45|pages=5–11|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.geobios.2011.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Investigation into the Trade of Nautilus.|author=Freitas, B and Krishnasamy, K |publisher=TRAFFIC|year=2016|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low [[fecundity]], late maturity, long gestation period and long life-span of nautiluses suggest that these species are vulnerable to over-exploitation and demand for the ornamental shell is causing population declines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunstan|first=Andrew|last2=Bradshaw|first2=Corey J.

'''Odo''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|d|oʊ}}, played by [[René Auberjonois (actor)|René Auberjonois]], is a fictional character in the science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.  He is a member of a shapeshifting species called [[Changeling (Star Trek)|Changelings]] and serves as the head of security for the space station [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] on which the show is set. Intelligent, observant and taciturn, Odo uses his unique abilities throughout the show to maintain security on the DS9 station and, later, aids the Bajoran people and the Federation throughout the [[Dominion War]] against his own people, the [[Founders (Star Trek)|Founders]].

==Overview==

=== Star Trek: Deep Space 9 ===
The original Writer's Bible from 1992 for [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]] described Odo as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Odo, an alien male, middle-aged curmudgeon, and a shape-shifter. In his natural state he is a gelatinous liquid. He was a [[Bajoran]] law enforcement officer on the space station under the [[Cardassian|Cardassians]]. [[Starfleet]] decides to have him continue in that role, since he's extremely savvy about the Promenade and all who frequent it. His backstory is: 50 years ago, with no memory of his past, he was found alone in a mysterious spacecraft that appeared in the Denarias asteroid belt. He was found by the [[Bajoran]] and lived amongst them. At first he was sort of an [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]], a source of curiosity and humor as he turned himself into a chair or pencil. Finally he realized he would have to take the form of a humanoid to assimilate and function in their environment. He does it, but resents it. As a result, Odo performs a uniquely important role in the ensemble: he is a character who explores and comments on Human values. Because he is forced to pass as one of us, his point of view usually comes with a cynical and critical edge. But he can't quite get it right, this humanoid shape, though he continues to try. So he looks a little unfinished in a way. He's been working on it a long time. Someone might ask him: Why don't you take the form of a younger man. His answer: I would if I could. He has the adopted child syndrome, searching for his own personal identity. Although he doesn't know anything about his species, he is certain that justice is an integral part of their being, because the necessity for it runs through every fiber of his body – a racial memory. That's why he became a law man. He has a couple of Bajoran deputies; he doesn't allow weapons on the Promenade, and once every day he must return to his gelatinous form. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.twguild.com/resources/development1.html |title=Star Trek Deep Space Nine Pre-Premiere Bible |website=Trek Writer's Guild |access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

[[File:Rene Auberjonois by Luigi Rosa, 12.jpg|thumb|left|Odo was portrayed in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' by actor [[René Auberjonois]]]]

Actor [[René Auberjonois|Rene Auberjonous]] describes Odo as "a very unformed being" who was  "trying to get some kind of shape to his life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/catching-up-with-ds9undefineds-rene-auberjonois-part-1|title=Catching Up with DS9’s Rene Auberjonois, Part 1|work=StarTrek.com|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-creator of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', [[Michael Piller]], speaks of Odo's role within the show as being prompted by needing "a character who represented the traditions of [[Spock]] and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], the outsider who looks in at humanity." &lt;ref&gt;''New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine'', DS9 Season 2 DVD, Special Features&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 5)|fifth season]], in the episode “[[Children of Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Children of Time]]”, an Odo who has lived an additional 200 years tells the “current” Kira Nerys that he has loved her from the time their friendship first began. With this revelation, Kira and the “current” Odo eventually become a couple.

===Mirror Universe===
In the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], Odo is the supervisor of the mining complex at [[Terok Nor]]. He is a brutal taskmaster over [[Earth|Terran]] slaves there and tolerates no deviation from his strict rules. Relatively little is known of him, as no one in the Mirror Universe is aware that the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]] exists or who Odo's [[Changelings (Star Trek)|people]] are. During a mining accident, Odo begins an evacuation of the Terran workers from the complex. [[Julian Bashir]], seizing the opportunity to escape, disintegrates him with a [[phaser (fictional weapon)|disruptor]].

In this reality, Odo has his own set of rules called the "[[Rules of Obedience]]" and quotes one of the rules in the same way that regular universe [[Quark]] would quote his "[[Rules of Acquisition]]".

After filming of the episode "[[Crossover (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Crossover]]", which was mirror Odo's sole onscreen appearance, actor [[René Auberjonois|Rene Auberjonois]] liked the alternate uniform so much he began wearing it while playing the regular universe version of Odo as well.

===Novels===
In the initial [[Deep Space Nine relaunch|''Deep Space Nine'' relaunch]] novels, Odo is succeeded as security chief by [[Ro Laren]], who is working for the [[Bajoran]] Militia. He also sent a [[Jem'Hadar]] ambassador to the [[Galactic quadrant (Star Trek)|Alpha Quadrant]] to foster understanding in the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] of other cultures, and soon returned to [[Deep Space Nine (fictional space station)|DS9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Millennium'' series of novels, it is revealed that Odo rarely shifted into smaller forms such as insects due to a psychological block from his original "training" under Doctor Mora. The novel series also speculates that the Founders placed a mental block on Odo's abilities to make it difficult for him to alter his face, thus explaining why he can never get faces quite right, even after linking with other Changelings on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Star trek, deep space nine millennium |first=Judith |last=Reeves-Stevens |date=2002 |publisher=Pocket Books |last2=Reeves-Stevens |first2=Garfield |isbn=0743442490| location=New York |oclc=48747215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Star Trek: Terok Nor'' novel ''Night of the Wolves'', Odo was found in a spherical module in the Denorios Belt by the [[Cardassian]] vessel ''Kevalu'', which was under the command of Dalin Malyn Ocett, in 2345.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Night of the wolves : 2345-2357 |last=Perry |first=S.

In the ''Star Trek: Typhon Pact'' novel ''Raise the Dawn'', Odo returned to the Alpha Quadrant to help Sisko investigate reports that the Typhon Pact, an alliance of the Federation's enemies, have stolen Jem'Hadar technology to perfect their own quantum slipstream drive, only to be trapped in the Alpha Quadrant when the wormhole was seemingly destroyed thanks to Kira's attempt to stop a Typhon Pact ship from using it again. Sisko offered Odo a place on his new ship, the ''Robinson'', but the novel ends with Odo deciding to remain on Bajor for a time to think about what he will do next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Raise the dawn| last=George III |first=David R. |date=2012 |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=1451649568 |location=New York |oclc=851699974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Haig Nitschke'''&lt;ref name="unisydney"&gt;[http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/people/alumni/viewuserdetail.php?id=2458 NITSCHKE, Philip Haig - The University of Sydney]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪ|tʃ|k|ɪ}}; born 8 August 1947) is an [[Australia]]n [[humanism|humanist]], author, former physician and founder and director of the pro-[[euthanasia]] group [[EXIT (Australia)|Exit International]]. He campaigned successfully to have a legal euthanasia law passed in Australia's [[Northern Territory]] and assisted four people in ending their lives before the law was overturned by the [[Government of Australia]]. Nitschke was the first doctor in the world to administer a legal, voluntary, lethal injection,&lt;ref name="nytt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/26/world/australian-man-first-in-world-to-die-with-legal-euthanasia.html |title=Australian Man First in World To Die With Legal Euthanasia |work=[[New York Times]] |date=1996-09-26 |accessdate=2017-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the patient activated the syringe using a computer. Nitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities. In 2015 Nitschke burned his medical practising certificate in response to what he saw as onerous conditions that violated his right to free speech, imposed on him by the Medical Board of Australia.&lt;ref name="ntn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Billias |first=Maria |url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/doctor-death-goes-to-blazes/story-fnk0b1zt-1227626165659 |title=‘Doctor Death’ goes to blazes |work=NT News |date=28 November 2015 |accessdate=6 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke is variously referred to in the media as "Dr Death" or "the Elon Musk of assisted suicide".

==Early life and career==
Born in 1947 in rural [[South Australia]], Nitschke studied [[physics]] at the [[University of Adelaide]], gaining a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Flinders University]] in [[laser]] physics in 1972. Rejecting a career in the sciences, he instead travelled to the [[Northern Territory]] to take up work with the [[Aboriginal land rights]] activist [[Vincent Lingiari]] and the [[Gurindji people|Gurindji]] at [[Gurindji strike|Wave Hill]]. After the hand-back of land by the Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], Nitschke became a [[Northern Territory]] Parks and Wildlife ranger. However, after badly injuring his [[subtalar joint]], which effectively finished his career as a ranger, he began studying for a medical degree. In addition to having long been interested in studying medicine he has suffered from [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondria]] most of his adult life and futilely hoped with his medical studies to educate himself out of the problem.&lt;ref name ="autobiography"&gt;{{cite news |title=Between life and death |date=31 August 2013 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/between-life-and-death-20130826-2skl0.html|work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=7 November 2013 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] Medical School in 1989.&lt;ref name="unisydney"/&gt;

After graduating Nitschke worked as an intern at [[Royal Darwin Hospital]], and then as an after hours general practitioner. When the Northern Territory branch of the [[Australian Medical Association]] publicly opposed the proposed Northern Territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia, Nitschke and a small group of dissenting Territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the [[NT News]] under the banner ''Doctors for change''. This put him in a position of an informal spokesperson for the proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dammed if I do|last=Nitschke|first=Philip|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Carlton|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995|Rights of the Terminally Ill Act]] (ROTI Act) came into force on 1 July 1996, Nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the [[Euthanasia device|Deliverance Machine]] he developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/objects/display?id=91717|title=Euthanasia machine, Australia, 1995-1996|website=www.sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was ceased when the ROTI Act was effectively nullified by the Australian Parliament's [[Euthanasia Laws Act 1997]].

After the ROTI Act was nullified Nitschke began providing advice to others about how they can end their lives, leading to the formation of Exit International in 1997. A notable case of Nitschke's was that of [[Nancy Crick]], aged 69. On 22 May 2002, Crick, in the presence of over 20 friends and family (but not Nitschke), took a lethal dose of [[barbiturates]], went quickly to sleep and died within 20 minutes. Nitschke had encouraged Crick to enter palliative care, which she did for a number of days before returning home again. She had undergone multiple surgeries to treat bowel cancer and was left with multiple dense and inoperable bowel adhesions that left her in constant pain and frequently in the toilet with diarrhoea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/breakfast/stories/2002/564719.htm |title=Radio National Breakfast – 27&amp;nbsp;May 2002  – Nancy Crick's Cancer |publisher=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not, however, [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 Australian federal election]] Nitschke ran against the Australian politician [[Kevin Andrews (Australian politician)|Kevin Andrews]] in the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] seat of [[Division of Menzies|Menzies]] but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Election results for the seat of Menzies (Australian Electoral Commission)| url = http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-13745-229.htm | date = 26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Nitschke helped to promote ''Dignified Departure'', a 13-hour, pay-television program on doctor-assisted suicide in [[Hong Kong]] and mainland [[China]]. The program aired in October in China on the Family Health channel, run by the official [[China National Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=ac_J3XqlfuhM |title='Dr. Death' Nitschke Sells Euthanasia to China Before TV Show - Bloomberg.com |publisher=www.bloomberg.com |accessdate=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2014, as a consequence of the Brayley case, the MBA voted to use emergency powers to suspend his practitioner's licence immediately, on the grounds that he presented "a serious risk to public health and safety". Nitschke said he would appeal the suspension, which he claimed was politically motivated, and that the Board "made it clear that what they really object to is the way I think. It's ideas they object to — namely, my belief that people should have a right to suicide, is something they think is contrary to medical practice."&lt;ref name="suspension"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-24/euthanasia-advocate-philip-nitschke-suspended-by-medical-board/5615268 |title=Euthanasia advocate Philip Nitschke suspended by the Australian Medical Board|date=24 July 2014|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MBA later clarified that the suspension was an interim measure pending the outcome of an inquiry.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/euthanasia-campaigner-nitschke-suspended/story-fni0xqi4-1226999570958 |title=Euthanasia campaigner Nitschke will appeal |accessdate=24 July 2014 |publisher=Herald Sun |author=Karlis Salna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke said the suspension will not affect his work for Exit International and that he had not practised medicine for years.&lt;ref name="not-a-md"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/euthanasia-advocate-philip-nitschke-banned-from-practising-medicine-20140724-zw7xw.html |title=Euthanasia advocate Philip Nitschke banned from practising medicine |accessdate=3 September 2014 |publisher=SMH |author=Julia Medew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitschke appealed to a MBA tribunal in Darwin to have his July 2014 suspension from practising medicine overturned. In late 2014 the appeal was rejected on the grounds that, although it was accepted that Brayley was not Nitschke's patient,&lt;ref name="tribunal-finding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nt/NTHPRT/2014/5.pdf |title=Nitschke's Appeal to the NT Health Professional Review Tribunal |accessdate=19 January 2015 |publisher=AMA |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the controversial concept of rational suicide was inconsistent with the medical profession's code of conduct and that, as a medical practitioner providing advice on suicide, he posed a serious risk because people may elect to commit suicide believing it to be a pathway sanctioned by a medical practitioner and perhaps the medical profession generally.&lt;ref name="conduct"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/07/philip-nitschke-heads-to-supreme-court-to-fight-for-his-medical-licence |title=Philip Nitschke heads to supreme court to fight for his medical licence |accessdate=17 January 2015 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-06/philip-nitschke-fails-to-overturn-medical-board-suspension/6003180  |title=Philip Nitschke fails to overturn suspension from practising medicine |author=Gribbin, Caitlyn|date=6 January 2015|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke then appealed the tribunal's decision to the Darwin Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="conduct" /&gt;

On 6 July 2015 the Northern Territory supreme court upheld Nitschke's appeal, finding the emergency suspension of his licence by the MBA should not have been upheld by a review tribunal.&lt;ref name="reversal"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/06/nitschke-wins-appeal-against-medical-licence-suspension |title=Philip Nitschke wins appeal over medical licence suspension |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 July 2015 |accessdate=6 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Hiley's ruling said that the tribunal and board had misconstrued the doctors’ code of conduct, which requires them to "protect and promote the health of individuals", as extending to all doctors and all individuals. "A doctor would constantly need to fear that any interaction with any other individual or community, including an individual who is not and never has been his or her patient, may be in breach of the (code), even if the doctor did nothing in circumstances where there was no other obligation to do something," he said. Nitschke said the MBA's erroneous interpretation was "ludicrous" and flew in the face of common law.&lt;ref name="reversal2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/philip-nitschke-wins-back-medical-licence/story-e6frg8y6-1227431425070 |title=Philip Nitschke wins back medical licence |work=[[The Australian]] |date=6 July 2015 |accessdate=6 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke's lawyer will apply for costs of approximately AU$300,000, which were paid using donations, including $20,000 from Swiss euthanasia organisation [[Dignitas (assisted dying organisation)|Dignitas]].&lt;ref name="nt-n"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/justice-overturns-nitschkes-suspension/story-fnk0b1zt-1227431121981 |title= Justice overturns Nitschke's suspension |work=NT News |date=6 July 2015 |accessdate=21 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2015 the MBA lifted Nitschke's suspension but drew up a list of 25 conditions under which Nitschke could continue to practise. These conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia, or Nembutal, or suicide, and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the 'Peaceful Pill' handbook and related videos.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/27/philip-nitschke-burns-medical-certificate-and-says-he-will-promote-euthanasia |title=Philip Nitschke burns medical certificate and says he will promote euthanasia |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 November 2015 |accessdate=28 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Nitschke, calling the MBA's actions "a heavy-handed and clumsy attempt to restrict the free flow of information on end-of-life choice", surveyed more than 1,000 members of his advocacy group, Exit International, and received strong support for ending his medical registration.&lt;ref name="alight"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-27/philip-nitschke-sets-medical-certificate-alight/6981522 |title=Euthanasia advocate Philip Nitschke sets medical certificate alight, rejects Medical Board |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=27 November 2015 |accessdate=28 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the MBA restrictions and the results of the member survey, Nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career, vowing to continue to promote euthanasia.&lt;ref name="end"/&gt;

Nitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title "doctor" (he has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]), and will continue to see patients and Exit members in clinics that he runs in Australia and other countries.&lt;ref name="smh-cert"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/euthanasia-campaigner-philip-nitschke-sets-medical-licence-alight-20151127-gl9wpr.html |title=Euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke sets medical licence alight |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=27 November 2015 |accessdate=28 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of this incident, Nitschke and his partner, Fiona Stewart, decided in 2015 to relocate to the more liberal politico-legal environment of Holland.&lt;ref name="holland"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://exitinternational.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sept-Nov-2016-eDeliverance-1.pdf |format=PDF |title=e-Deliverance Newsletter Sep-Nov 2016 |publisher=[[Exit International]] |date=2016-11-01 |accessdate=2016-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2009 Nitschke was detained for nine hours by British Immigration officials at [[Heathrow Airport]] after arriving for a visit to the UK to lecture on voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life choices.

They decided Dr Henry "had capacity" and would not be [[Mental Health Act 1983|sectioned]] (detained involuntarily for mental assessment).&lt;ref name="police-force"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Euthanasia-campaigner-s-concerns-Exeter-police/story-29144299-detail/story.html |title=Euthanasia campaigner |work=Exeter Express and Echo |date=2016-04-20 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worried that the police would return and confiscate her remaining Nembutal, she committed suicide four days later.&lt;ref name="exeter" /&gt; Dr Nitschke commented that police had made Dr Henry's last days on earth a misery and that “police need to realise that in the UK, suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention", adding that the police action was "a significant abuse of power against a vulnerable elderly woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Retired-Exeter-professor-dies-home-days-police/story-29151376-detail/story.html |title=Retired Exeter professor dies in her home four days after police visit to check her welfare |work=Exeter Express and Echo |date=2016-04-21 |accessdate=2016-04-22 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 [[Australian Federal Police]] used local police force personnel in different regions of the country to conduct late night raids on the homes of elderly Exit members, demanding to know if they had bought the euthanasia drug Nembutal.&lt;ref name="tweed"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.echo.net.au/2018/05/tweed-exit-members-late-night-police-questioning/ |title= Tweed Exit member’s late-night police questioning |work=Echonetdaily |date=2018-05-29 |accessdate=2018-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pensioners in poor health, some in wheelchairs, were forced to leave their beds and answer police questions.

===Operation Painter===
In October 2016 New Zealand police, in a "sting" operation code named "Operation Painter", set up roadblocks (checkpoints) outside an Exit International meeting and took down names and addresses of all attendees.&lt;ref name="roadblocks"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/85828119/Wellington-woman-Annemarie-Treadwells-death-trigger-for-Police-euthanasia-furore |title=Wellington woman Annemarie Treadwell's death trigger for Police euthanasia furore |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher=Fairfax NZ |date=2016-10-28 |accessdate=2016-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the elderly members of the group were later visited at their homes by police with warrants, and searches were conducted. Computers, tablets, cameras, letters and books were seized.&lt;ref name="seize"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/85896648/letters-from-dead-friend-seized-during-controversial-police-euthanasia-crackdown |title=Letters from dead friend seized during controversial police euthanasia crackdown |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2016-11-01 |accessdate=2016-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke said police actions were unprecedented and probably in breach of the Bill of Rights, which guaranteed freedom of association. The police operation is now the subject of an [[Independent Police Conduct Authority]] investigation.&lt;ref name="roadblocks" /&gt; Legal action against the police followed.&lt;ref name="legal-action"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/85989298/police-facing-legal-action-after-wellington-euthanasia-checkpoint |title=Police facing legal action after Wellington euthanasia checkpoint |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2016-11-03 |accessdate=2016-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, the Independent Police Conduct Authority found Operation Painter to be illegal.&lt;ref name="gisborne"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/opinion/3363141-135/the-new-zealand-kgb |title=The New Zealand KGB? |work=The Gisborne Herald |date=2018-05-11 |accessdate=2018-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coincided with another action by New Zealand police in which 76-year old Patsy McGrath, a member of Nitschke's Exit group, had her home raided in 2016 and her store-bought helium balloon cylinder confiscated under warrant.&lt;ref name="balloon"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/85307936/Police-seize-voluntary-euthanasia-advocates-helium-balloon-kit |title=Police seize voluntary euthanasia advocate's helium balloon kit |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2016-10-14 |accessdate=2016-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The confiscation of the cylinder was later found to be illegal and it was returned to her in 2018.&lt;ref name="gisborne" /&gt;

==Views on euthanasia==
{{Euthanasia}}

===Dying with dignity===
On 29 April 2009 Nitschke said: "It seems we demand humans to live with indignity, pain and anguish whereas we are kinder to our pets when their suffering becomes too much. It simply is not logical or mature. Trouble is, we have had too many centuries of religious claptrap."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|publisher=www.google.com
|accessdate=30 April 2009
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He works mainly with older people from whom he gains inspiration, saying: "You get quite inspired and uplifted by the elderly folk who see this as quite a practical approach".&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2009/07/02/his-choice-to-live-or-die/ |title=His choice to live or die |accessdate=2 July 2009 |publisher=Lismore Northern Star |author=Saffron Howden |date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 Nitschke said he no longer believed voluntary euthanasia should only be available to the terminally ill, but that elderly people afraid of getting old and incapacitated should also have a choice.&lt;ref name="not-only-ill"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25754012-29277,00.html |title=Give all elderly the right to die – Nitschke |accessdate=8 July 2009 |publisher=News Corp. | date=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Nitschke expects that Australia will eventually legislate for a, "very, very conservative," form of euthanasia, "certainly in the first steps",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/the-conspicuous-silence-from-euthanasia-activists-about-belgians-horrific-c/ |title=The conspicuous silence from euthanasia activists about Belgium’s horrific child euthanasia law |author=Paul Russell |date=19 February 2014|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he states that a growing number of people importing their own euthanasia drugs, "really don't care if the law is changed or not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.4zzzfm.org.au/sites/default/files/news_package/dom_euthanasia_mixdown.mp3 |title=News Package Euthanasia|work= 4ZZZ Brisbane FM|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palliative care===
Palliative care specialists state that many requests for euthanasia arise from fear of physical or psychological distress in the patient's last days, and that widespread and equitable availability of specialist palliative care services will reduce requests for euthanasia. Nitschke is dismissive of this argument. "We have too many people who have the best palliative care in the world and they still want to know that they can put an end to things," he said.&lt;ref name="irish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imt.ie/opinion/2010/03/does_the_freedom_to_die_enhanc.html |title=Does the freedom to die enhance lives? |work=Irish Medical Times |accessdate=30 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "By and large, palliative care have done pretty well out of the argument over the euthanasia issue, because they are the ones that have argued that they just need better funding and then no one will ever want to die – that's a lie."

===Younger people and suicide===
In 2010 the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine released a report into Australian deaths caused by the drug Nembutal, which Nitschke recommends as a euthanasia drug. Of the 51 deaths studied, 14 were of people between the ages of 20 and 40.&lt;ref&gt;Medew, Julia. (15 February 2010). "[http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/young-people-gain-access-to-euthanasia-drug-20100215-nzon.html Young people gain access to euthanasia drug]". ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. Retrieved 26 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke acknowledged that the information about the drug that was provided online could be accessed by people below the age of 50 who were not terminally ill, but argued that the risk was necessary in order to help the elderly and the seriously ill.&lt;ref&gt;Medew, Julia. (15 February 2010). "[http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-death-trap-20100214-nzh7.html The Death Trap]". ''[[The Age]]''.  Retrieved 26 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was alleged that Joe Waterman, 25, had committed suicide after accessing Nitschke's online euthanasia handbook, by misrepresenting his age as over 50. Waterman subsequently imported Nembutal and ended his life.&lt;ref name="Gribbin&amp;Owens"&gt;Gribbin, Caitlyn; Owens, Dale. (3 July 2014). "[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-03/nitschke-criticsed-for-offering-support-to-a-suicidal-man/5570162 Euthanasia advocate Philip Nitschke criticised over support for 45-year-old who committed suicide]". [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. Accessed 3 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In another case Lucas Taylor, 26, committed suicide in [[Germany]] by taking Nembutal after soliciting advice at an Exit International online forum (which, according to Nitschke, he accessed by claiming his age was 65).&lt;ref name="lucastaylor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-25/euthanasia-forum-coached-young-man-into-taking-his-life-mother/5623408 |title=Exit International forum coached young man to his death, mother claims |accessdate=26 July 2014 |publisher=ABC |author=Stephanie Chalkley-Rhoden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual rights argument===
Nitschke argues that an [[Individual and group rights|individual person]] has a fundamental right to control their own death just as they have a right to control their own life.&lt;ref name="irish"/&gt; He believes in having the "Peaceful Pill" available for every adult of sound mind.&lt;ref name ="autobiography"/&gt;

==Censorship==

===Internet===
{{details|Internet censorship in Australia}}
On 22 May 2009 it was disclosed in the press, citing [[WikiLeaks]], that the [[Australian Government]] had added the online ''Peaceful Pill Handbook'' to the blacklist maintained by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] used to filter internet access to citizens of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/web-filtering-pulls-plug-on-euthanasia-debate-20090521-bh0s.html|title=Web filtering pulls plug on euthanasia debate|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=22 May 2009|first=Michael|last=Duffy|date=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Communications Minister, [[Stephen Conroy]], planned to introduce legislation just before the 2010 election to make internet service providers block a blacklist of "refused classification" websites. The blacklist is expected to include Exit's websites and other similar sites. Nitschke said the proposals were the "final nail in the coffin for euthanasia advocacy" in Australia, where people are banned from discussing end-of-life issues over the phone, buying books about it or importing printed material on it. "The one avenue we had open to us was the internet, and now it looks like it will be part of Conroy's grand plan to provide a so-called clean feed to Australia. It's outrageous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/big-brother-laws-to-be-brought-in-for-web-20091215-kuka.html |title=Big Brother laws to be brought in for web |work=The Age |accessdate=16 December 2009 |location=Melbourne |first=Asher |last=Moses |date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 Nitschke began holding a series of "Hacking Masterclasses" to teach people how to circumvent the Australian internet filter.&lt;ref name="hack"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/euthanasia-workshops-to-fight-filter-20100405-rluv.html |title=Euthanasia workshops 'to fight filter' |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=5 April 2010 |first=Cortlan |last=Bennett |date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to Nitschke's online ''Peaceful Pill Handbook'' was blocked during trials of the government's filter. A government spokeswoman said euthanasia would not be targeted by the proposed filter,&lt;ref name="hack" /&gt; but confirmed that "The (website) ... for accessing an electronic version of the [Peaceful Pill Handbook] was classified as refused classification" because it provided detailed instruction in "crimes relating to the possession, manufacture and importation of barbiturates".

Nitschke said Exit International would investigate if it could set up its own [[proxy server]] or [[VPN]] tunnel, so its members had a safe way of accessing its information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/elderly-learn-to-beat-euthanasia-blacklist-20100405-rn6i.html |title=Elderly learn to beat euthanasia firewall |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=6 April 2010 |first=Geesche |last=Jacobsen |date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, [[YouTube]] deleted Nitschke's YouTube channel "Exityourtube". The channel had been operating for 10 years. YouTube gave no reason why the account was deleted without notice.

===Television===
On 10 September 2010 Nitschke complained that the [[FreeTV Australia|Commercials Advice]] self-regulator of advertising content on Australian commercial television had prevented the television screening of a paid advertisement from Exit International in which an actor depicted a dying man who requested the option of voluntary euthanasia. Commercials Advice reportedly cited Section 2.17.5 of the ''Commercial Television Code of Practice'': Suicide. The advertisement was felt to condone the practice of suicide. Nitschke responded that the acts of Commercials Advice constitute interference with the right to [[free speech]]. Similar TV commercials, planned for use during Nitschke's Canadian lecture tour of 2010, were likewise banned by the Television Bureau of Canada, after lobbying by anti-euthanasia pressure groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ad-campaign-for-assisted-suicide-banned-from-canadian-airwaves/article1727127/ |title=Ad campaign for assisted suicide banned from Canadian airwaves – The Globe and Mail |publisher=theglobeandmail.com |accessdate=28 September 2010 |location=Toronto |first=Les |last=Perreaux |date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Billboards===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Exit-billboard.jpg|thumb|left|Australia's first pro-[[voluntary euthanasia]] billboard, on the [[Hume Highway]] in western [[Sydney (Australia)|Sydney]]]] --&gt;In 2010 Nitschke planned to use billboards in Australia to feature the message "85 per cent of Australians support voluntary euthanasia but our government won't listen". In September 2010, Nitschke's billboard advertising campaign was blocked by ''Billboards Australia''.&lt;ref name="billboards"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/another-blow-for-euthanasia-campaign-20100915-15cfd.html |title=Another blow for euthanasia campaign |publisher=smh.com.au |accessdate=16 September 2010 |first=Danny |last=Rose |date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billboards Australia cited section of the NSW Crimes Act that outlaws the aiding or abetting of suicide or attempted suicide. Nitschke was told to provide legal advice outlining how his billboard did not break this law, a request Nitschke described as "ludicrous", pointing out that the billboards urge "political change and in no way could be considered to be in breach of the crimes act".&lt;ref name="billboards"/&gt; Nitschke said he had sought a legal opinion from prominent human rights lawyer Greg Barns.&lt;ref name="billboards"/&gt; The lawyer was able to convince Billboards Australia to rescind its ruling, in part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/euthanasia-billboard-approved-20101004-162x7.html |title=Euthanasia billboard approved |publisher=smh.com.au |accessdate=4 October 2010 |date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euthanasia techniques==

===Exit bag and CoGen===
Nitschke created devices to aid people who want euthanasia, including a product called the "[[exit bag]]" (a large plastic bag with a drawstring allowing it to be secured around the neck) and the "CoGen" (or "Co-Genie") device. The CoGen device generates the deadly gas [[carbon monoxide]], which is inhaled with a face mask.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euthanasia device===
{{main|Euthanasia_device#Exit.27s_euthanasia_device|l1=EXIT's Euthanasia Device}}
In December 2008 Nitschke released details of a [[Euthanasia device#Exit.27s euthanasia device|euthanasia machine]] to the media. He called it "flawless" and "undetectable", saying the new process uses ordinary household products including a barbecue gas bottle&amp;nbsp;— available from hardware stores&amp;nbsp;— filled with nitrogen.&lt;ref name="deathmachine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24816520-5006301,00.html |title=AdelaideNow...

&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke developed a process in which patients lose consciousness immediately and die a few minutes later.

Nitschke said: "So it's extremely quick and there are no drugs. Importantly this doesn't fail&amp;nbsp;– it's reliable, peaceful, available and with the additional benefit of undetectability."&lt;ref&gt;Wheatley, Kim (18 December 2008). [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24817295-5006787,00.html "Doctor Philip Nitschke to launch 'undetectable' death machine".] ''[[The Australian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barbiturate testing kit===
In 2009 Nitschke made a barbiturate testing kit available, initially launched in the UK,&lt;ref name="guardian-barbituate-test"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke said the kit was made available by Exit International in response to growing demand for something to test the [[Nembutal]] obtained from Mexico, often delivered in the post without labels. "They want to be sure they have the right concentration," Nitschke said. The kits have chemicals that change colour when mixed with Nembutal. He was detained for an hour for questioning on arrival at [[Auckland Airport]] in [[New Zealand]] on a trip to hold public meetings and launch the kit.&lt;ref name="nz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/21/2632602.htm?section=justin |title=Nitschke held over drug kits in NZ |accessdate=22 July 2009 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pentobarbital long-storage pill===
In October 2009 Nitschke announced his intention to inform people at his workshops where to obtain a long-storage form of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal) that manufacturers say can be stored for up to fifty years without degrading.&lt;ref name="long"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/30/2728364.htm |title=Nitschke to promote illegal pill – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=30 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liquid forms of pentobarbital degrade within a few years, while the solid form (a white, crystalline powder) does not. Nitschke intends to advise people on how to reconstitute the pill into liquid form for ingestion if and when it ever becomes appropriate. He said that he sees it as a way of keeping people accurately informed and allowing them to make viable choices. The provision of this information would be consistent with good medical care, in his view.&lt;ref name="long" /&gt;

===Nitrogen canisters===
{{more|Suicide bag}}
In 2012 Nitschke started a beer-brewing company (''Max Dog Brewing'') for the purpose of importing nitrogen canisters. Nitschke stated that the gas cylinders can be used for both brewing and, if required, to end life at a later stage in a "peaceful, reliable [and] totally legal" manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2012/s3657550.htm |title=Euthanasia campaigner under scrutiny|author=Sexton, Mike |date=18 December 2012 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC]] |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke said, "[nitrogen] was undetectable even by autopsy, which was important to some people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/euthanasia-group-to-show-west-aussies-how-to-die-well-20130503-2ixgd.html |title=Euthanasia group to show West Aussies how to die 'well' |author=Orr, Aleisha |date=3 May 2013 |work=WAToday|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarco machine===
In 2017 Nitschke invented the 3D-printed suicide capsule, which he named the Sarco machine, "sarco" being short for "[[sarcophagus]]".&lt;ref name="sarc3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/15/nitschke-suicide-machine-amsterdam-euthanasia-funeral-fair |title=Nitschke's 'suicide machine' draws crowds at Amsterdam funeral fair |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2018-04-15 |accessdate=2018-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="capsule"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overington |first=Caroline |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/philip-nitschke-invents-suicide-capsule-with-3d-printer/news-story/318561693f3a6eee1e10069df83a3839?nk=8a500b8067a5ef429d365255e635c3d2-1511568834 |title=Philip Nitschke invents suicide capsule with 3D printer |work=[[The Australian]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=2017-11-25 |accessdate=2017-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarco consists of a detachable coffin mounted on a stand containing a nitrogen canister.&lt;ref name="sarc3" /&gt; The coffin or capsule contains a touchpad, and once an activation code is entered, "the person is again asked if they wish to die".&lt;ref name="capsule" /&gt; An affirmative answer causes nitrogen to flow into the capsule, displacing oxygen, and death follows shortly thereafter. The Sarco machine cannot be printed on small 3D printers. The Sarco offers a "euphoric death".&lt;ref name="hp2018" /&gt;

Nitschke plans to release the [[open-source model|open source]] plans for the Sarco by 2019.&lt;ref name="hp2018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nitschke |first=Philip |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarco-death-philip-nitschke_us_5abbb574e4b03e2a5c7853ca |title=Here’s Why I Invented A ‘Death Machine’ That Lets People Take Their Own Lives |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2018-04-05 |accessdate=2018-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in December 2017 about the Sarco, [[Newsweek]] referred to Nitschke as "the Elon Musk of assisted suicide".&lt;ref name="musk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-assisted-suicide-machine-727874 |title=Meet The Elon Musk Of Assisted Suicide, Whose Machine Lets You Kill Yourself Anywhere |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=2017-01-12 |accessdate=2018-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedian==
Nitschke began his comedy career at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in August 2015 with his show ''Dicing with Dr Death''. ''[[ThreeWeeks]]'' called it "engaging and highly thought-provoking".&lt;ref name="lkhkmn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threeweeksedinburgh.com/article/ed2015-theatre-review-dicing-with-dr-death-dr-philip-nitschke/ |title=Dicing With Dr Death (Dr Philip Nitschke) |work=''[[ThreeWeeks]]'' |date=2015-08-17 |accessdate=2018-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed a newer Australian version of his show, retitled ''Practising without a License'', at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] in April 2016 and again in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in August 2016. The ''[[Herald Sun]]'' reviewed his performance favorably: "[Nitschke] presented his case with such measure, warm humour and intelligence that even his puns were excusable".&lt;ref name="hsreview"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/arts/philip-nitschke-in-dicing-with-dr-death-/news-story/8bfbfdd55d7e77dc2338d165ad55a2df?nk=7f319f0bf7118a7b2732bd9b546ce791-1523152650 |title=Philip Nitschke in Dicing with Dr Death |work=[[Herald Sun]] |date=2016-04-04 |accessdate=2018-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She sought advice from Nitschke. Nigot took an overdose of medication which she had bought in the United States and died, not long before her 80th birthday.&lt;ref name="nigot"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/25/1038173695743.html |title=Healthy woman thanks Dr Nitschke, then kills herself – smh.com.au |publisher=www.smh.com.au |accessdate=11 October 2009 |date=26 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a note to Nitschke thanking him for his support, she described him as a crusader working for a worthwhile humane cause.

[[File:A trench at the potter's field on Hart Island, circa 1890 by Jacob Riis.jpg|thumb|A trench at the potter's field on [[Hart Island, New York]], circa 1890 by [[Jacob Riis]]]]
A '''potter's field''', '''paupers' grave''' or '''common grave''' is a [[cemetery|place for the burial]] of unknown or [[indigent]] people.  "Potter's field" is of [[Bible|Biblical]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition. HarperCollins Publishers. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/potters field (accessed: December 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; referring to [[Akeldama]], bought by the high priests of Jerusalem for the burial of strangers, criminals, and the poor, and paid for with the coins that had been paid to Judas Iscariot for his identification of Jesus.

==Origin==
{{Main|Akeldama}}
The term "potter's field" comes from [[Matthew 27:3]]-[[Matthew 27:8|27:8]] in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]], in which Jewish priests take [[Thirty pieces of silver|30 pieces of silver]] returned by a remorseful [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]:

{{quote|Then Judas, [[Kiss of Judas|who betrayed him]], seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients, saying: "I have sinned in betraying innocent blood."  But they said: "What is that to us?  Look thou to it."  And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed, and went and hanged himself with a halter.  But the chief priests, having taken the pieces of silver, said: "It is not lawful to put them into the [[mite box|corbona]], because it is the price of blood."  And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.  For this the field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douay-Rheims Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The site referred to in these verses is traditionally known as [[Akeldama]], in the [[Gehenna|valley of Hinnom]], which was a source of potters' clay. After the clay was removed, such a site would be left unusable for agriculture and thus might as well become a graveyard for those who could not be buried in an orthodox cemetery. This may be the origin of the name.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An Introduction and Commentary, Eerdmans (1985), page 386&lt;/ref&gt; A field where potters dug for clay would also be "conveniently already full of trenches and holes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.common-place-archives.org/vol-06/no-04/bahde/|title=The Common Dust of Potter’s Field|first=Thomas|last=Bahde|date=30 December 2016|publisher=|volume=06|issue=04|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Common-Place}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of Matthew was drawing on earlier Biblical references to potters' fields. The passage continues, with verses 9 and 10:

{{quote|Then what the prophet Jeremiah had said came true: "They took the thirty silver coins, the amount the people of Israel had agreed to pay for him, and used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord had commanded me."}}

This is based on a quotation from [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] ({{Bibleref2|Zechariah 11:12-13}}). However, Matthew attributes the quote to Jeremiah. The author of Matthew may have been mistaken.  There are two other possible reasons for the reference.  First, Jeremiah also speaks of buying a field, in {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah 32:6-15}}. That field is a symbol of hope, not despair as mentioned in Matthew, and the price is 17 pieces of silver. The author of Matthew could have combined the words of Zechariah and Jeremiah, while only citing the "major" prophet. Secondly, "Jeremiah" was sometimes used to refer to the Books of the Prophets ''in toto''{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} as "The Law" is sometimes used to refer to Moses' five books &amp;ndash; Genesis through Deuteronomy, the [[Pentateuch]].

[[Craig Blomberg]] suggests that the use of the [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] to buy a burial ground for foreigners in [[Matthew 27:7]] may hint at the idea that "Jesus' death makes salvation possible for all the peoples of the world, including the [[Gentiles]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Blomberg|Craig L. Blomberg]], "Matthew," in ''Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2007), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars do not read the verse as referring to Gentiles, but rather to Jews who are not native to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown|Brown, Raymond]]. ''The Death of the Messiah''. Yale University Press, Dec 1, 1998 pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*[[William Blake]] used the term in Chapter 1 of ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]'', "Jerusaem is our Harlot-Sister / Return'd with the Children of pollution, to defile our House, / With Sin and Shame. Cast! Cast her into the Potter's field."
*[[Lincoln Park]], on [[Chicago]]'s [[North Side, Chicago|North Side]], found its origin in the 1840s as Chicago City Cemetery. The southernmost portion of the cemetery, where one may now find a number of baseball fields (north of LaSalle Dr., west of North Avenue Beach), was the location of the City Cemetery potter's field from 1843 to 1871. More than 15,000 people, including 4,000 Confederate soldiers, were buried here on marshy land near the water's edge. The baseball fields have occupied these grounds since 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiddentruths.northwestern.edu/potter_field.html|title=Hidden Truths: Potter's Field|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Madison Square|Madison Square Park]], [[Washington Square Park]] and [[Bryant Park]] in [[New York City]] originated as potter's fields. The city's current potter's field, and one of the largest cemeteries in the United States, with at least 800,000 burials, is on [[Hart Island (New York)|Hart Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart Island; Melinda Hunt and Joel Sternfeld; {{ISBN|3-931141-90-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Potter's Field was also the name of a small cove of the [[East River]] just below the Williamsburg Bridge on the Brooklyn side, where bodies that have been in the river from November through the winter season surface in April as the rising temperature causes them to decompose and rise to the surface. The fluid dynamics of the East River causes a collection of these bodies every year off the docks of Potter's Field. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

After the repair process has been completed, there is a loss in the structure or function of the injured tissue. In this type of repair, it is common that granulation tissue (stromal connective tissue) proliferates to fill the defect created by the necrotic cells. The necrotic cells are then replaced by scar tissue. | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | access-date = 2012-12-07 | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131110180450/http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | archive-date = 2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where after the necrotic tissue comes [[fibrosis]].&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt; At its most elementary level, regeneration is mediated by the molecular processes of [[gene regulation]].&lt;ref name="Himeno92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Himeno Y, Engelman RW, Good RA | title = Influence of calorie restriction on oncogene expression and DNA synthesis during liver regeneration | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 5497–501 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1608960 | pmc = 49319 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.12.5497 | bibcode = 1992PNAS...89.5497H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant88"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bryant PJ, Fraser SE | title = Wound healing, cell communication, and DNA synthesis during imaginal disc regeneration in Drosophila | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 197–208 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 2452103 | doi = 10.1016/0012-1606(88)90201-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration in biology, however, mainly refers to the [[Morphogenesis|morphogenic]] processes that characterize the [[phenotypic plasticity]] of [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] allowing multi-cellular organisms to repair and maintain the integrity of their physiological and morphological states. Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual cellular processes.&lt;ref name="Brokes08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A | title = Comparative aspects of animal regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 525–49 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18598212 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration is different from reproduction. For example, [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of [[budding]].

The [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] and the [[planarian]] flatworm have long served as model organisms for their highly [[adaptation|adaptive]] regenerative capabilities.&lt;ref name="Sánchez00"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Regeneration in the metazoans: why does it happen? | journal = BioEssays | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 578–90 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10842312 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200006)22:6&lt;578::AID-BIES11&gt;3.0.CO;2-# | url = http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/publications/BioEssays.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once wounded, their cells become activated and start to remodel tissues and organs back to the pre-existing state.&lt;ref name="Reddien04"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddien PW, Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Fundamentals of planarian regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 20 | pages = 725–57 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15473858 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.095114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caudata]] ("urodeles"; [[salamander]]s and [[newt]]s), an [[Order (biology)|order]] of tailed [[amphibia]]ns, is possibly the most adept [[vertebrate]] group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes and a variety of internal structures.&lt;ref name="Carlson07" /&gt; The regeneration of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among [[metazoa]]n creatures.&lt;ref name="Sánchez00" /&gt; In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] through [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], [[budding]], or [[fission (biology)|fission]].&lt;ref name="Brokes08" /&gt; A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] of the original.&lt;ref name="Campbell_1996"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell NA | title=Biology | edition=4th | year = 1996 | publisher=The Benjamin Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. | place=California | pages=1206 | isbn = 978-0-8053-1940-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echinoderms]] (such as the sea star), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of [[autotomy]], for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate.&lt;ref name="Wilkie01"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkie IC | title = Autotomy as a prelude to regeneration in echinoderms | journal = Microscopy Research and Technique | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 369–96 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11782069 | doi = 10.1002/jemt.1185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maiorana77"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maiorana VC | title=Tail autotomy, functional conflicts and their resolution by a salamander | journal=Nature | volume=2265 | issue=5594 | pages=533–535 | year=1977 | doi=10.1038/265533a0| bibcode=1977Natur.265..533M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maginnis06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maginnis TL | title=The costs of autotomy and regeneration in animals: a review and framework for future research | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=857–872 | year=2006 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arl010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.&lt;ref name="UCSB Science Line"&gt;{{Cite web|title = UCSB Science Line|url = http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1103|website = scienceline.ucsb.edu|access-date = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecosystems==
{{main|regeneration (ecology)}}

Ecosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and [[Assembly rules|community assembly]] process is known as regeneration in [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Dietze08"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1890/07-0271.1 | vauthors = Dietze MC, Clark JS | title=Changing the gap dynamics paradigm: Vegetative regenerative control on forest response to disturbance | journal=Ecological Monographs | volume=78 | issue=3 | pages=331–347 | url=http://coweeta.uga.edu/publications/10300.pdf | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey02"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00564-3 | vauthors = Bailey J, Covington WW | title=Evaluation ponderosa pine regeneration rates following ecological restoration treatments in northern Arizona, USA | journal=Forest Ecology and Management | volume=155 | pages=271–278 | url= http://library.eri.nau.edu/gsdl/collect/erilibra/index/assoc/HASH0e9a.dir/doc.pdf | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular molecular fundamentals==
Pattern formation in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by [[Regulation of gene expression|genetic induction factors]] that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as [[GAP-43]], [[tubulin]], [[actin]], an array of novel [[neuropeptide]]s, and [[cytokines]] that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage.&lt;ref name="Fu97"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu SY, Gordon T | title = The cellular and molecular basis of peripheral nerve regeneration | journal = Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 14 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 67–116 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9170101 | doi = 10.1007/BF02740621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the genes that are involved in the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the [[Primordium|primordia]] of [[zebrafish]] fins, for example, express four genes from the [[homeobox]] ''msx'' family during development and regeneration.&lt;ref name="akimenko96"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akimenko MA, Johnson SL, Westerfield M, Ekker M | title = Differential induction of four msx homeobox genes during fin development and regeneration in zebrafish | journal = Development | volume = 121 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–57 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7768177 | url = http://dev.biologists.org/content/121/2/347.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissues==
"Strategies include the rearrangement of pre-existing tissue, the use of adult [[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[stem cells]] and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, and more than one mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt; All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form."&lt;ref name="Alvarado06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A, Tsonis PA | title = Bridging the regeneration gap: genetic insights from diverse animal models | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 873–84 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17047686 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1923 | url = http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/publications/NRG2006.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|873}} During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of [[Cell potency|cell]] as they differentiate into different tissues. Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a [[blastema]], which is "a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins".&lt;ref name="Kumar07"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar A, Godwin JW, Gates PB, Garza-Garcia AA, Brockes JP | title = Molecular basis for the nerve dependence of limb regeneration in an adult vertebrate | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5851 | pages = 772–7 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17975060 | pmc = 2696928 | doi = 10.1126/science.1147710 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318..772K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process. This should not be confused with the  transdifferentiation of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell.&lt;ref name="Alvarado06" /&gt;

==In animals==

=== Arthropods ===
[[Arthropod]]s are known to regenerate appendages following loss or [[autotomy]].&lt;ref name="Skinner_1985"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Skinner DM | chapter = Molting and Regneration | veditors = Bliss DE, Mantel LH | title = Integument, Pigments, and Hormonal Processes | date = 1985 | volume = 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JG1lh--v1sYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-323-13922-9 | pages = 46–146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration among arthropods is restricted by molting such that [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] [[insect]]s are capable of regeneration only until their final [[Moulting|molt]] whereas most [[crustacean]]s can regenerate throughout their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Seifert AW 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seifert AW, Monaghan JR, Smith MD, Pasch B, Stier AC, Michonneau F, Maden M | title = The influence of fundamental traits on mechanisms controlling appendage regeneration | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 330–45 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21929739 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00199.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molting cycles are hormonally regulated in arthropods,&lt;ref name="Travis_1955"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Molting Cycle of the Spiny Lobster, Panulirus argus Latreille.

Along with epimorphosis, some [[polychaetes]] like ''[[Sabella pavonina]]'' experience morphallactic regeneration.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bely AE | title = Early events in annelid regeneration: a cellular perspective | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 688–99 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25122930 | doi = 10.1093/icb/icu109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphallaxis involves the de-differentiation, transformation, and re-differentation of cells to regenerate tissues. How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in [[oligochaetes]] is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, it is possible that morphallaxis is a common mode of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in ''L. variegatus'', past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis.

Following amputation, most annelids are capable of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to infection prevention. In certain species, such as ''[[Limnodrilus]]'', [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] can be seen within hours after amputation in the [[ectoderm]] and [[mesoderm]]. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.

===Echinoderms===

Tissue regeneration is widespread among echinoderms and has been well documented in [[starfish]] ''(Asteroidea)'', [[sea cucumber]]s ''(Holothuroidea)'', and [[sea urchin]]s ''(Echinoidea).'' Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Candia Carnevali MD, Bonasoro F, Patruno M, Thorndyke MC | title = Cellular and molecular mechanisms of arm regeneration in crinoid echinoderms: the potential of arm explants | journal = Development Genes and Evolution | volume = 208 | issue = 8 | pages = 421–30 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9799422 | doi = 10.1007/s004270050199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = San Miguel-Ruiz JE, Maldonado-Soto AR, García-Arrarás JE | title = Regeneration of the radial nerve cord in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima | journal = BMC Developmental Biology | volume = 9 | pages = 3 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19126208 | pmc = 2640377 | doi = 10.1186/1471-213X-9-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages. Autotomy is the self-amputation of a body part, usually an appendage. &amp;nbsp;Depending on severity, starfish will then go through a four-week process where the appendage will be regenerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patruno M, Thorndyke MC, Candia Carnevali MD, Bonasoro F, Beesley PW | title = Growth factors, heat-shock proteins and regeneration in echinoderms | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 204 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 843–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11171408 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/5/843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species must retain mouth cells in order to regenerate an appendage, due to the need for energy.&lt;ref name="Morgan_1900" /&gt;  The first organs to regenerate, in all species documented to date, are associated with the digestive tract. Thus, most knowledge about visceral regeneration in holothurians concerns this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = García-Arrarás JE, Greenberg MJ | title = Visceral regeneration in holothurians | journal = Microscopy Research and Technique | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 438–51 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11782073 | doi = 10.1002/jemt.1189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planaria (Platyhelminthes)===

Regeneration research using [[Planarian]]s began in the late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Morgan_1900"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Regeneration in Planarians | vauthors = Morgan TH | date = 1900 | journal = Archiv für Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen | volume= 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | doi = 10.1007/BF02156347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A, Newmark PA | title = The use of planarians to dissect the molecular basis of metazoan regeneration | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–20 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9824561 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian&lt;ref name="Morgan_1900" /&gt; or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks.&lt;ref name="Montgomery_1974"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montgomery JR, Coward SJ | title = On the minimal size of a planarian capable of regeneration | journal = Transactions of the American Microscopical Society | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 386–91 | date = July 1974 | pmid = 4853459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After amputation, stump cells form a [[blastema]] formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott SA, Sánchez Alvarado A | title = The history and enduring contributions of planarians to the study of animal regeneration | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–26 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23799578 | doi = 10.1002/wdev.82 | pmc = 3694279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells.&lt;ref name="Montgomery_1974" /&gt; Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner DE, Wang IE, Reddien PW | title = Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration | journal = Science | volume = 332 | issue = 6031 | pages = 811–6 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21566185 | doi = 10.1126/science.1203983 | pmc = 3338249 | bibcode = 2011Sci...332..811W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddien PW, Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Fundamentals of planarian regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 20 | issue =  | pages = 725–57 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15473858 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.095114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphibians===
Limb regeneration in the [[axolotl]] and [[newt]] has been extensively studied and researched. Urodele amphibians, such as salamanders and newts, display the highest regenerative ability among tetrapods.&lt;ref name="Brockes_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A, Velloso CP | title = Regeneration as an evolutionary variable | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 199 | issue = Pt 1-2 | pages = 3–11 | date = 2001 | pmid = 11523827 | pmc = 1594962 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they can fully regenerate their limbs, tail, jaws, and retina via epimorphic regeneration leading to functional replacement with new tissue.&lt;ref name="Brockes_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A | title = Plasticity and reprogramming of differentiated cells in amphibian regeneration | journal = Nature Reviews.

[[File:AxolotlBE.jpg|thumbnail|[[Axolotl]]s can regenerate a variety of structures, including their limbs]]

After amputation, the epidermis migrates to cover the stump in  1–2 hours, forming a structure called the wound epithelium (WE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Satoh A, Bryant SV, Gardiner DM | title = Nerve signaling regulates basal keratinocyte proliferation in the blastema apical epithelial cap in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 366 | issue = 2 | pages = 374–81 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22537500 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.03.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epidermal cells continue to migrate over the WE, resulting in a thickened, specialized signaling center called the apical epithelial cap (AEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christensen RN, Tassava RA | title = Apical epithelial cap morphology and fibronectin gene expression in regenerating axolotl limbs | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 217 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–24 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10706145 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1097-0177(200002)217:2&lt;216::aid-dvdy8&gt;3.0.co;2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several days there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a [[blastema]] (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells). As the blastema forms, [[Hox genes in amphibians and reptiles|pattern formation genes]] &amp;ndash; such as [[Homeobox|Hox]]A and HoxD &amp;ndash; are activated as they were when the limb was formed in the [[embryo]].&lt;ref name="bryant"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bryant SV, Endo T, Gardiner DM | title = Vertebrate limb regeneration and the origin of limb stem cells | journal = The International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 7 | pages = 887–96 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12455626 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullen LM, Bryant SV, Torok MA, Blumberg B, Gardiner DM | title = Nerve dependency of regeneration: the role of Distal-less and FGF signaling in amphibian limb regeneration | journal = Development | volume = 122 | issue = 11 | pages = 3487–97 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8951064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The positional identity of the [[anatomical terms of location|distal]] tip of the limb (i.e. the autopod, which is the hand or foot) is formed first in the blastema.

In spite of the historically few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable progress has been made recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in [[genomics]], [[bioinformatics]], and [[somatic cell]] [[transgenesis]] in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl.&lt;ref name="stepwise"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Endo T, Bryant SV, Gardiner DM | title = A stepwise model system for limb regeneration | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 270 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–45 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15136146 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.02.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad. An [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has led to the creation of the first amphibian gene map and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Voss SR, Muzinic L, Zimmerman G | url = http://www.ambystoma.org | title = Sal-Site | work = Ambystoma.org | date = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydra ===
[[Hydra (genus)|''Hydra'']] is a genus of freshwater [[polyp]] in the phylum [[Cnidaria]] with highly proliferative [[stem cells]] that gives them the ability to regenerate their entire body.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bosch TC | title = Why polyps regenerate and we don't: towards a cellular and molecular framework for Hydra regeneration | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 303 | issue = 2 | pages = 421–33 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17234176 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.12.012 | publisher = Elsevier }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any fragment larger than a few hundred [[epithelial]] cells that is isolated from the body has the ability to regenerate into a smaller version of itself.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; The high proportion of stem cells in the hydra supports its efficient regenerative ability.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wenger Y, Buzgariu W, Reiter S, Galliot B | title = Injury-induced immune responses in Hydra | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 277–94 | date = August 2014 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2014.06.004 | publisher = Elsevier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regeneration among hydra occurs as foot regeneration arising from the basal part of the body, and head regeneration, arising from the apical region.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; Regeneration tissues that are cut from the gastric region contain polarity, which allows them to distinguish between regenerating a head in the apical end and a foot in the basal end so that both regions are present in the newly regenerated organism.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; Head regeneration requires complex reconstruction of the area, while foot regeneration is much simpler, similar to tissue repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buzgariu W, Crescenzi M, Galliot B | title = Robust G2 pausing of adult stem cells in Hydra | journal = Differentiation; Research in Biological Diversity | volume = 87 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 83–99 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1016/j.diff.2014.03.001 | publisher = Elsevier | others = Science Direct }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both foot and head regeneration, however, there are two distinct [[biochemical cascade|molecular cascades]] that occur once the tissue is wounded: early injury response and a subsequent, signal-driven pathway of the regenerating tissue that leads to [[cellular differentiation]].&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt; This early-injury response includes epithelial cell stretching for wound closure, the migration of interstitial progenitors towards the wound, [[cell death]], [[phagocytosis]] of cell debris, and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt;

Regeneration in hydra has been defined as morphallaxis, the process where regeneration results from remodeling of existing material without cellular proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Morgan TH | year = 1901 | title = Regeneration | volume = 7 | series = Columbia University Biological Series | publisher = The MacMillan Company | location = New York | url = https://archive.org/details/regeneration00morggoog }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agata_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agata K, Saito Y, Nakajima E | title = Unifying principles of regeneration I: Epimorphosis versus morphallaxis | journal = Development, Growth &amp; Differentiation | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–8 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17335428 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2007.00919.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a hydra is cut into two pieces, the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent hydra, approximately the same size as the two smaller severed sections.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; This occurs through the exchange and rearrangement of soft tissues without the formation of new material.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt;

===Aves (birds)===

Owing to a limited literature on the subject, birds are believed to have very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies&lt;ref name="Vorontsova_1960"&gt;{{cite book | title = Asexual Reproduction and Regeneration | vauthors = Vorontsova MA, Liosner LD | veditors = Billet F | translator-first = PM | translator-last1 = Allen | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Pergamon Press | year = 1960 | location = London | pages = 367–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation&lt;ref name="Vorontsova_1960" /&gt;  and Sidorova (1962) observed liver regeneration via hypertrophy in roosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sidorova VF | title = Liver regeneration in birds | journal = Biulleten' Eksperimental'noi Biologii I Meditsiny | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 1426–9 | date = July 1962 | pmid = 14039265 | doi = 10.1007/BF00785312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cotanche DA, Lee KH, Stone JS, Picard DA | title = Hair cell regeneration in the bird cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage | journal = Anatomy and Embryology | volume = 189 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8192233 | doi = 10.1007/BF00193125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development.

Similar to the physiological regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers in order to repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage. Typically, seasonal changes that are associated with breeding seasons will prompt a hormonal signal for birds to begin regenerating feathers.

In 2012, researchers discovered that two species of [[Spiny Mouse|African Spiny Mice]], ''Acomys kempi'' and ''Acomys percivali'', were capable of completely regenerating the [[autotomy|autotomically]] released or otherwise damaged tissue.

Despite these examples, it is generally accepted that adult [[mammal]]s have limited regenerative capacity compared to most [[vertebrate]] embryos/larvae, adult salamanders and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Kevin | last = Xu | name-list-format = vanc | title = Humans' Ability To Regenerate Damaged Organs Is At Our Fingertips | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/how-regeneration-works-2013-7 | work = Business Insider | date = July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the regeneration therapy approach of [[Robert O.

Some researchers have also claimed that the [[Murphy Roths Large|MRL mouse]] strain exhibits enhanced regenerative abilities.

MRL mice are not protected against [[myocardial infarction]]; heart regeneration in adult mammals ([[neocardiogenesis]]) is limited, because heart muscle cells are nearly all [[G0 phase|terminally differentiated]].

====Humans====
{{main|Regeneration in humans}}

The regrowth of lost tissues or organs in the human body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 = Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation. Complete regeneration can occur in pathological situations in tissues that have good regenerative capacity. | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121207231322/http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-12-07 | access-date = 2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human organs that have been regenerated include the bladder, vagina and the penis.&lt;ref name=regen2014104&gt;{{cite web | last =Mohammadi | first = Dara | name-list-format = vanc | title = Bioengineered organs: The story so far… | work = The Guardian | date = 4 October 2014 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/04/penis-transplants-anthony-atala-interview | access-date = 9 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As are all metazoans, humans are capable of physiological regeneration (i.e. the replacement of cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of Regenerative Biology | vauthors = Carlson BM | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2007 | pages = 25–26 | isbn = 978-0-12-369439-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of physiological regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferenczy A, Bertrand G, Gelfand MM | title = Proliferation kinetics of human endometrium during the normal menstrual cycle | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 133 | issue = 8 | pages = 859–67 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 434029 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(79)90302-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, humans are limited in their capacity for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury.&lt;ref name="Michalopoulos_1997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalopoulos GK, DeFrances MC | title = Liver regeneration | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5309 | pages = 60–6 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9082986 | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5309.60 | pmc = 2701258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taub_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taub R | title = Liver regeneration: from myth to mechanism | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 836–47 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15459664 | doi = 10.1038/nrm1489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established in direct proportion to the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawasaki S, Makuuchi M, Ishizone S, Matsunami H, Terada M, Kawarazaki H | title = Liver regeneration in recipients and donors after transplantation | journal = Lancet | volume = 339 | issue = 8793 | pages = 580–1 | date = March 1992 | pmid = 1347095 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(92)90867-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained.&lt;ref name="Taub_2004" /&gt; This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.&lt;ref name="Michalopoulos_1997" /&gt; The normal sequence of inflammation and regeneration does not function accurately in cancer. Specifically, cytokine stimulation of cells leads to expression of genes that change cellular functions and suppress the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult neurogenesis is also a form of cellular regeneration. For example, hippocampal neuron renewal occurs in normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spalding KL, Bergmann O, Alkass K, Bernard S, Salehpour M, Huttner HB, Boström E, Westerlund I, Vial C, Buchholz BA, Possnert G, Mash DC, Druid H, Frisén J | title = Dynamics of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6 | pages = 1219–1227 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23746839 | pmc = 4394608 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac myocyte renewal has been found to occur in normal adult humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergmann O, Bhardwaj RD, Bernard S, Zdunek S, Barnabé-Heider F, Walsh S, Zupicich J, Alkass K, Buchholz BA, Druid H, Jovinge S, Frisén J | title = Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5923 | pages = 98–102 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19342590 | pmc = 2991140 | doi = 10.1126/science.1164680 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324...98B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beltrami AP, Urbanek K, Kajstura J, Yan SM, Finato N, Bussani R, Nadal-Ginard B, Silvestri F, Leri A, Beltrami CA, Anversa P | title = Evidence that human cardiac myocytes divide after myocardial infarction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 344 | issue = 23 | pages = 1750–7 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11396441 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200106073442303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in adult myocardium following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of cardiac muscle. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced.

Another example of reparative regeneration in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after phalange amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McKim LH | title = REGENERATION OF THE DISTAL PHALANX | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 549–50 | date = May 1932 | pmid = 20318716 | pmc = 402335 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muneoka K, Allan CH, Yang X, Lee J, Han M | title = Mammalian regeneration and regenerative medicine | journal = Birth Defects Research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10001">Clinical ethics support services initially developed in the United States of America, following court cases such as the [[Karen Ann Quinlan case]], which stressed the need for mechanisms to resolve ethical disputes within health care. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requirement for hospitals, nursing homes, and home care agencies to have a standing mechanism to address ethical issues has also fostered this development (this requirement no longer appears in the Joint Commission regulations, however).

Despite initial doubts as the possibility of importing what was initially felt to be a specificity of the US system, ethics support services have developed in many other countries, including Canada&lt;ref&gt;MacRae S. et al: Clinical bioethics integration, sustainability, and accountability: the Hub and Spokes Strategy Journal of Medical Ethics 2005;31:256-261&lt;/ref&gt; but also various countries in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Forde R. et al: Clinical ethics, information, and communication: review of 31 cases from a clinical ethics committee. J Med Ethics. 2005 Feb;31(2):73-7&lt;/ref&gt; and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama M. et al: A report on small team clinical ethics consultation programmes in Japan. J Med Ethics. 2008 Dec;34(12):858-62&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to share experience and resources among these clinical [[research ethics consultation]] and support services, networks and platforms have increasingly developed.&lt;ref&gt;Slowther A. et al: Development of clinical ethics committees. BMJ.2004;328(7445):950–952&lt;/ref&gt; This page is intended to summarise existing online resources aimed at assisting new and developing clinical ethics support services. Its goal is to make these resources more easily accessible. Listing in this page does not constitute endorsement of the various contents: users will still need to judge the value of these resources for themselves.

It is reasonable to suppose that these resources will increasingly be international. Because of the role of the English language in international communication, multi-lingual resources whose languages include English are given in their English title. Those not available in English are given in their original language.

==Clinical ethics committee guidelines==

Many clinical ethics support services develop guidelines and advise policy within the health care setting. While the conclusions of consultations regarding individual patients are, of course, confidential, general ethical guidelines and policy advice regarding ethical difficulties which come up repeatedly in clinical care are not. Some ethics support services make these guidelines available online. Adding yours will make these resources more useful!

'''Ronald N. Kornblum''' was an American coroner who served as [[Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner|Los Angeles County Coroner]] from 1982 to 1990.

==Early life==
Kornblum was born December 5, 1933 in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Woo&gt;{{cite news|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=L.A.

==Early career==
After Kornblum's naval service, he pursued his medical residency at Santa Clara County Hospital. Kornblum discovered that he enjoyed diagnosing illnesses more than treating them and decided to specialize in pathology. In 1966 he took a job with the Maryland Medical Examiner's office, where he rose to the position of chief deputy.&lt;ref name=Woo /&gt;  There he presided over the autopsy of [[Yosef Alon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dayan: Arabs Killed Envoy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bI9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BgYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4462,475488&amp;dq|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=July 2, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ventura County==
In November 1973, Kornblum was named [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]]'s first full-time Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner after the county adopted a new system. He took office on January 1, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical Examiner Appointed|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jIxLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8CMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4382,7241406&amp;dq|accessdate=November 30, 2013|newspaper=The Press-Courier|date=November 28, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Angeles County==
In 1980, Kornblum left Ventura County to become the top assistant to [[Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles|Los Angeles County Coroner]] Thomas Noguchi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=County Coroner To Quit|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=REheAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=02ANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5699,3738466&amp;dq|accessdate=November 30, 2013|newspaper=The Press-Courier|date=November 28, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Noguchi was demoted to physician specialist for speaking too freely to the media, moonlighting, and alleged mismanagement. Kornblum was appointed acting coroner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Noguchi Begins New Job|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19820429&amp;id=ZoZhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bOQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6580,5716558|accessdate=October 16, 2013|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=April 29, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he was appointed to the job outright after the [[Supreme Court of California]] declined to hear Noguchi's legal challenge of his demotion.&lt;ref name="Kornblum Named LA County Coroner" /&gt;

Kornblum was praised for improving the office's efficiency and professionalism. He was also recognized for his knowledge of [[Sudden infant death syndrome]], [[chokehold]] deaths, and fatalities involving [[Taser]]s.&lt;ref name=Woo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; However Kornblum's office was also criticized for moving too slow on autopsies, leaving bodies at crime scenes for hours, and for bouncing corpses on freeways due to bad door locks on old coroner vehicles.

Notable autopsies Kornblum performed include [[John Belushi]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Truman Capote]], [[William Holden]], [[Karen Carpenter]], [[Ron Settles]], and [[Warren Oates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Official Unsure of Cause Of Football Star's Death|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3CNLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=myMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6624,7226297&amp;dq|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=The Press-Courier|date=August 28, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heart attack ruled|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S49VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0j8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6156,1765719&amp;dq|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=The Leader-Post|date=April 7, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of his capacity as coroner he testified in the [[Robert Chambers (criminal)|Preppie Murder]] trial as an expert on chokehold deaths.&lt;ref name=Woo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;

In 1990, Kornblum resigned as Los Angeles County Coroner after an independent audit found that staff shortages and a high homicide rate were leading to unsanitary conditions, including dead insect larvae in the morgue and a body that had decomposed because it had been misplaced, and poor oversight of employees that had allowed for a double-billing scam to take place.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA county coroner to resign"&gt;{{cite news|title=LA county coroner to resign|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=myNLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hyMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2848,2508782&amp;dq|accessdate=November 30, 2013|newspaper=The Press-Courier|date=April 13, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kornblum stated that he agreed with most of the 154 changes called for in the audit and had begun to implement some, but certain changes were impossible due to the "limited sized of the department's budget and the overwhelming workload".&lt;ref name="LA county coroner to resign" /&gt;

==Death==
Kornblum died on September 23, 2008 at his home in [[La Cañada Flintridge, California]].&lt;ref name=Woo /&gt;

'''''Schlock Mercenary''''' is a comedic [[webcomic]] written and drawn by [[Howard Tayler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferro|first1=David L.|last2=Swedin|first2=Eric G.|authorlink2=Eric G. Swedin|editor=David L. Ferro, Eric G. Swedin|title=Science Fiction and Computing: Essays on Interlinked Domains|year=2011|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn=9780786445653|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows the tribulations of a star-travelling [[mercenary]] company in a satiric, mildly [[dystopia]]n 31st-century [[space opera]] setting. Since its debut on June 12, 2000 the comic has updated daily, begun to [[webcomics and income|support its author]], and been nominated for five [[Hugo Award]]s.

==Publication history==
[[File:Howard Tayler at CONduit 2007.png|thumb|right|Creator [[Howard Tayler]] at [[Conduit (convention)|CONduit]] in 2007.]]
Over time, Tayler's art improved, in his words, from bad to "marginally less bad."&lt;ref name="first strip"/&gt; [[Jean Elmore]] served as colorist for the strip from February 9, 2003 to the spring of 2004 when she developed a [[repetitive strain injury]] from her work.

On March 3, 2003, the comic reached its 1001st strip. Tayler marked the milestone by "re-launching" the comic. With the relaunch, the strip was slightly reoriented for publication, organizing the comic's ongoing story into "books". Each book has a fairly self-contained story, although they are still chronological and connected.&lt;ref name="schlock-archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/archive.html|title=Schlock Mercenary: The Archive Synopsize|accessdate=November 18, 2010|publisher=The Tayler Corporation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622030958/http://www.schlockmercenary.com/archive.html|archivedate=June 22, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2005, Tayler published the comic's 2000th daily strip&lt;ref name="comicon interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004490|title=Howard Tayler interviewed at The Pulse|date=|publisher=Comicon.com|accessdate=June 3, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605172652/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004490|archivedate=June 5, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the series' debut. On June 12, 2010, ''Schlock Mercenary'' marked ten years of uninterrupted daily run, a feat matched by few other webcomics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In March 2006, Tayler published ''Schlock Mercenary: Under New Management'', the first book-based collection of ''Schlock Mercenary'' comics. This collection features stories printed from March 9, 2003 through August 23, 2003, plus five pages of new material including a foreword by [[John Ringo]], a feature explaining how Sgt. Schlock "got turned on to plasma cannons", bonus art, the author's biography, and architectural deck plans to Tagon's third ship ''Serial Peacemaker''.

In December 2007, Tayler published ''Schlock Mercenary: The Tub of Happiness''.  It features stories from the beginning of the webcomic to October 2001, as well as the bonus story "Baggage Claim," explaining the circumstances around Schlock joining the Toughs.  There are numerous pieces of fan art throughout the book, as well as early concept art drawn by Tayler and notes to the reader from both Tayler and his wife, talking about the characters and Tayler's early cartooning efforts.

On Monday, February 17, 2014, Tayler announced in the commentary that the strip had reached 5,000 comics.

==Cast==
{{Main|List of Schlock Mercenary characters}}
The story primarily centers on Captain Kaff Tagon and his mercenary crew, Tagon's Toughs. Notable members of the crew include Munitions Commander and resident mad scientist Kevyn Andreyasn; title character Sergeant Schlock, who is a carbosilicate amorph with no easily definable limbs, organs, or moral compass; Petey, a former artificial intelligence and now Fleetmind and pseudo-God; and the wry AI and former [[boyband]], Ennesby.

==Story==
Many plotlines revolve around the jobs Kaff Tagon and his mercenary crew have accepted, preferably involving as much brawn as necessary and as little brain as possible (although resident mad scientist Kevyn Andreyasn can pick up the slack if need be). Other times, the crew is swept up in a galaxy-spanning or truly intergalactic conflict.

In the distant future of ''Schlock Mercenary'''s setting, many changes have faced Terran society. [[Faster-than-light]] travel has been attained, alien races have been contacted, and technology has undergone radical improvements.

Alien species have varied from fairly [[humanoid]] to almost unrecognizable. There have been carbosilicate amorphs with no easily definable limbs or organs (the eponymous Sgt. Schlock), eight-limbed Gatekeepers, two-bodied Uklakk, and the unknowable Pa'anuri, beings made of [[Dark matter in fiction|dark matter]].

The number of sapient [[species]] descended from terran stock has increased as Earth's genetic engineers refined their craft. Enhanced [[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[snake]]s and two species of sentient [[elephant]] now have citizenship. Genetic enhancement of the human population has resulted in the purple-skinned photosynthetic "Purps", along with more general improvements to the population.

===Technology===
As in many science fiction stories, technology forms a large part of ''Schlock Mercenary'''s storytelling framework. Several story arcs revolve around the political conflict surrounding rapid technological change. When a particularly complex or interesting new system is introduced to the comic, its in-comic explanation is often supplemented with a footnote.

Travel between the stars is accomplished through the use of "wormgates", large [[wormhole]] generators controlled by the enigmatic F'sherl-Ganni Gatekeepers. Within the storyline of the comic, wormgates are largely supplanted by the "teraport", a device that allows for near-instant travel between any two points&amp;mdash;usually as long as neither point is within range of an interdicting device. In that case, the teraporting object may be destroyed.

The F'sherl-Ganni also constructed several buuthandi, ''Schlock Mercenary'''s take on a [[Dyson sphere]]. A buuthandi is a balloon of [[solar sail|solar-sail]] material around a star. Light pressure and solar wind offset the star's gravitation to keep the balloon inflated, while habitats and maintenance facilities dangling from the inner side act as ballast to keep the sails in check. Despite their tremendous surface area, a buuthandi provides a disproportionally small amount of livable habitat.&lt;ref name="buuthandi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020421.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=April 21, 2002|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Control cables, millions of square kilometers of slack sail material, and some very clever engineering allow the 'balloon' to compensate for (and in some cases mitigate) the mood swings of the contained star."&lt;ref name="buuthandi 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020309.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=March 9, 2002|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''Schlock Mercenary'' universe, a buuthandi is about 300 million kilometers in diameter.&lt;ref name="buuthandi 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20010707.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=July 7, 2001|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Buuthandi" is a shortened form of a F'sherl-Ganni phrase which, when the foul language is removed, can be roughly translated as "This was expensive to build.")

Medical technology is based on nanotechnology or artificial replacements for damaged body parts. One important item that is featured in the comic is the "magic cryo-kit", an illegally modified device that has the capability to rebuild an entire body as long as the brain is intact. In the strip this has always been shown as "from the head down" but presumably nothing more than the brain is actually necessary. It appears that conventional, legal medical technology is also capable of full-body regeneration, though at a much slower pace and dependent on your [[HMO]] insurance options. The Toughs employ various technologies to protect survival of heads until their owners can be regenerated. An example of this technology is the comedically ubiquitous "head-in-a-jar", which permits a character to interact in a storyline despite [[decapitation|an otherwise-fatal injury]]. Another is the "nanny-bag", which maintains the severed head and/or entire body of an otherwise mortally-wounded teammate for an unknown length of time.  (Evidence as to the duration of a nanny-bag's preservation varies&amp;mdash;the head of Kevyn Andreyasn was sustained for several weeks, whereas in a past storyline his companions worried about his [[Information-theoretic death|head going "gamey"]] after less than an hour. Though the latter may have simply been Sergeant Schlock's culinary opinion.)

In addition to medical benefits, nanotechnology gives the ability to "boost" soldiers to high levels of physical performance. Minor enhancements are legal, but the more extreme military modifications are highly regulated. The most significant examples of soldier-boosting within the strip are the mercenary grunt Nick&lt;ref name="Nick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20011105.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=November 5, 2001|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bounty hunter Doythaban,&lt;ref name="Doythaban"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20021117.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=November 17, 2002|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doythaban 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20010309.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=March 9, 2001|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the extreme boost of Kevyn.&lt;ref name="Kevyn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20070429.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=April 29, 2007|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer hardware has progressed to the point where [[artificial general intelligence|true, strong artificial intelligence]] is common, and several artificial intelligences have been characters in the story.

Weapons technology has been drastically improved as well, and a mercenary's arsenal can include [[railgun]]s, [[laser]]s, [[Non-lethal force|non-lethal]] [[nanotechnology|nanomotive]] "goober" rounds, and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] cannons. Old-fashioned [[bullet]]-firing [[firearm]]s are still in use as they continue to be effective against unprotected targets and are less likely to rupture a hull than a plasma bolt.

Energy is a resource literally [[too cheap to meter]]. Anything that cannot be powered by miniaturized [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactors (which, in the 31st century, are so advanced they can operate solely on atmospheric gasses&lt;ref name="atmospheric gasses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20000829.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=August 29, 2000|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is easily fueled by massively powerful [[neutronium]]-annihilation "annie" plants - spherical devices that generate massive amounts of power by [[gravitation]]ally converting mass to energy, a means of power generation made possible by ubiquitous gravity manipulation. One-shot devices (and [[bomb]]s) are often powered by [[fullerene]]d [[antimatter]], a carbon-based powder which contains antiprotons at the parts-per-thousand level, and should ''never'' be incinerated.

Gravity manipulation is a process as commonplace as modern electronics, employed not only in starship propulsion and artificial gravity, but also weapons and shielding against weapons. Controlled/artificial gravity is referred to as "gravy." Gravitic weapons in particular are both common and well developed due to their dual purpose—not only are they potent weapons, they can compress matter into neutronium which can then fuel an annie plant. The degree of this control is dependent on the number of projectors. For example, the battleplate ''Tunguska'' was able to manipulate not only individual limbs but individual ''digits'' of crew on board the ''Serial Peacemaker''&lt;ref name="Serial Peacemaker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20040229.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=February 29, 2004|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the much smaller ship can only create nodes of gravity in a few points on the ship and without the same level of control. However, the generation of gravity is beyond the capabilities of the sophonts of the Milky Way, necessitating ships to be constructed around annie plants as sources of gravity to manipulate{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

These devices and more are built using fabrication technology, or "fabbers". While rare and expensive, possession of one of these portable factories and the appropriate designs allows for the cheap mass-production of any physical item.&lt;ref name="fabber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20040425.html|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=April 25, 2004|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of the mercenaries are trained in fabber design, allowing the company to cheaply produce and repair their own gear.

===Schlocktoberfest===
A mostly annual storyline that occurs during the month of October. The story arc always starts out typically, but soon develops a dark tone, usually involving gruesome events and often character death, before typically resolving itself at the end of the month. It is considered ''Schlock Mercenary'''s version of Halloween stories. The last year with a Schlocktoberfest storyline was 2008, and Tayler has stated that he is no longer doing it.&lt;ref name="schlocktoberfest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/blog/halloween2010|title=Schlock Mercenary|date=October 31, 2010|first=Howard|last=Tayler|authorlink=Howard Tayler|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Collections of ''Schlock Mercenary'' strips were originally published in book form by "The Tayler Corporation", and are now published through Hypernode Press. Tayler's wife, [[Sandra Tayler|Sandra]], is the publisher. The first published collection, ''Under New Management'' does not start at the beginning of the archive, but at the 1001st strip, when the strip was relaunched. The first 1,000 strips were published later in books 1 and 2.

==Inspiration==
[[John Ringo]]'s [[Troy Rising]] series has been inspired by the ''Schlock Mercenary'' universe. It is set in the early days of human-alien contact; it is however not considered [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] for the comic series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ovalkwiki.com/FAQ |title=FAQ |publisher=Ovalkwiki |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossovers===
There was a crossover with ''Schlock Mercenary'' in the webcomic ''Under the Lemon Tree'', although it was noncanon in the ''Schlock Mercenary'' continuity.

==Planet Mercenary==
A role-playing game written by Alan Bahr and Howard Tayler based on the comic was launched as a [[Kickstarter]] on April 14, 2015. It successfully funded the following day.&lt;ref name="planet mercenary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/howardtayler/the-planet-mercenary-role-playing-game/ |title=The Planet Mercenary Role-playing Game |publisher=[[Kickstarter]] |accessdate=January 5, 2017 |archivedate=January 5, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6nIfcU1Yx?url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/howardtayler/the-planet-mercenary-role-playing-game/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Setting Sun''' ([[foal]]ed 1952) was a [[Tennessee Walking Horse]] stallion who competed in his breed's World Grand Championship three times. On his first attempt, in 1956, he placed third; he won the Reserve World Grand Championship in 1957 and the [[Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration#World Grand Championship|World Grand Championship]] in 1958. He was trained by Sam Paschal. After his wins, Setting Sun made nationwide television appearances. He died in 1976 and is buried near [[Newport, Tennessee]].

==Life==

Setting Sun was a [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] stallion sired by the notable breeding stallion [[Midnight Sun (horse)|Midnight Sun]], and out of the [[mare]] Alice Carver. He was foaled in 1952 and bred by W. H. Webb of [[Carthage, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="walkerswest.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkerswest.com/Champs/SettingSun.htm|title=Tennessee Walking horse – Setting Sun #530380 home page by Walkers West|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was owned by the industrialist M. M. Bullard of [[Newport, Tennessee]], and trained by [[Sam Paschal]] of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="walkerswest.com"/&gt; 
Paschal showed Setting Sun at the [[Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration]] for the first time in 1956. They placed third in the World Grand Championship. The following year Setting Sun was the Reserve World Grand Champion, and in 1958 he finally won the World Grand Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjhWAAAAYAAJ|title=Biography of the Tennessee walking horse|first=Ben A.|last=Green|date=1 January 1960|publisher=Parthenon Press|accessdate=19 June 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had 159 wins in 160 shows, and was estimated to be one of the most widely known Tennessee Walkers of the time.&lt;ref name=Star/&gt;
Setting Sun retired from showing in the mid-1960s. His last public appearance was at a horse show in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Following retirement from the show ring, he was used for breeding.&lt;ref name=Star/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''softmax function''', '''softargmax''',{{sfn|Goodfellow|Bengio|Courville|2016|p=184}} or '''normalized exponential function''',&lt;ref name="bishop"/&gt;{{rp|198}} is a generalization of the [[logistic function]] that "squashes" a {{mvar|K}}-dimensional vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; of arbitrary real values to a {{mvar|K}}-dimensional vector &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{z})&lt;/math&gt; of real values, for {{tmath|K \ge 2}}, where each entry is in the interval {{math|(0, 1)}}, and all the entries add up to 1.{{efn|The definition can be generalized to have range the [[closed interval]] {{math|[0, 1]}}, and allow &lt;math&gt;K = 1&lt;/math&gt;, using [[extended real numbers]].}}

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma\colon \mathbb{R}^K \to \left\{\sigma \in \mathbb{R}^K| \sigma_i &gt; 0, \sum_{i = 1}^K \sigma_i  = 1 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

The standard (unit) softmax function is given by the standard [[exponential function]] on each coordinate, divided by the sum of all the coordinates, as a [[normalizing constant]], so the output coordinates sum to 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{z})_j = \frac{e^{z_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^K e^{z_k}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; for ''j'' = 1, …, ''K''.

Instead of {{mvar|''e''}}, a different [[Base (exponentiation)|base]] {{mvar|''b''}} can be used, for any positive {{math|''b'' &gt; 0}}. This is written using &lt;math&gt;b = e^\beta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b = e^{-\beta}&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|Positive {{mvar|''β''}} corresponds to the maximum convention, and is usual in machine learning, corresponding to the highest score having highest probability.

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{z})_j = \frac{e^{\beta z_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^K e^{\beta z_k}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{z})_j = \frac{e^{-\beta z_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^K e^{-\beta z_k}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; for ''j'' = 1, …, ''K''.

In some fields, the base is fixed, corresponding to a fixed scale,{{efn|In statistical mechanics, fixing {{mvar|''β''}} is interpreted as having coldness and temperature of 1.}} while in others the parameter {{mvar|''β''}} is varied.

== Interpretations ==
=== Smooth arg max ===
{{see|Arg max}}
The name "softmax" is misleading; the function is not a [[smooth maximum]] (a [[smooth approximation]] to the [[maximum]] function), but is rather a smooth approximation to the [[arg max]] function: the function whose value is ''which'' index has the maximum. In fact, the term "softmax" is also used for the closely related [[LogSumExp]] function, which is a smooth maximum. For this reason, some prefer the more accurate term "softargmax", but the term "softmax" is conventional in machine learning.&lt;ref name="sako2018"/&gt;{{sfn|Goodfellow|Bengio|Courville|2016|pp=183–184|ps=: The name “softmax” can be somewhat confusing. The function is more closely related to the arg max function than the max function. The term “soft” derives
from the fact that the softmax function is continuous and differentiable. The arg max function, with its result represented as a one-hot vector, is not continuous or differentiable. The softmax function thus provides a “softened” version of the arg max. The corresponding soft version of the maximum function is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{z})^\top \mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt;. It would perhaps be better to call the softmax function “softargmax,” but the current name is an entrenched convention.}} For this section, the term "softargmax" is used to emphasize this interpretation.

Formally, instead of considering the arg max as a function with categorical output &lt;math&gt;1, \dots, n&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to the index), consider the arg max function with [[one-hot]] representation of the output (assuming there is a unique max arg):
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,max}(z_1, \dots, z_n) = (y_1, \dots, y_n) = (0, \dots, 0, 1, 0, \dots, 0),&lt;/math&gt;
where the output coordinate &lt;math&gt;y_i = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the arg max of &lt;math&gt;(z_1, \dots, z_n)&lt;/math&gt;, meaning &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; is the unique maximum value of &lt;math&gt;(z_1, \dots, z_n)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, in this encoding &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,max}(1, 5, 10) = (0, 0, 1),&lt;/math&gt; since the third argument is the maximum.

This can be generalized to multiple arg max values (multiple equal &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; being the maximum) by dividing the 1 between all max args; formally {{math|1/''k''}} where {{mvar|k}} is the number of arguments assuming the maximum. For example, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,max}(1, 5, 5) = (0, 1/2, 1/2),&lt;/math&gt; since the second and third argument are both the maximum. In case all arguments are equal, this is simply &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg\,max}(z, \dots, z) = (1/n, \dots, 1/n).&lt;/math&gt; Points {{mvar|'''z'''}} with multiple arg max values are [[Singular point of an algebraic variety|singular points]] (or singularities, and form the singular set) – these are the points where arg max is discontinuous (with a [[jump discontinuity]]) – while points with a single arg max are known as non-singular or regular points.

With this representation, softargmax is now a smooth approximation of arg max: as {{tmath|\beta \to \infty}}, softargmax converges to arg max. There are various notions of convergence of a function; softargmax converges to arg max [[pointwise convergence|pointwise]], meaning for each fixed input {{math|'''z'''}} as {{tmath|\beta \to \infty}}, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\beta(\mathbf{z}) \to \operatorname{arg\,max}(\mathbf{z}).&lt;/math&gt; However, softargmax does not [[uniform convergence|converge uniformly]] to arg max, meaning intuitively that different points converge at different rates, and may converge arbitrarily slowly. In fact, softargmax is continuous, but arg max is not continuous at the singular set where two coordinates are equal, while the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous. The failure to converge uniformly is because for inputs where two coordinates are almost equal (and one is the maximum), the arg max is the index of one or the other, so a small change in input yields a large change in output. For example,
&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\beta(1, 1.0001) \to (0, 1),&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\beta(1, 0.9999) \to (1, 0),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\beta(1, 1) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; for all inputs: the closer the points are to the singular set &lt;math&gt;(x, x)&lt;/math&gt;, the slower they converge. However, softargmax does [[compact convergence|converge compactly]] on the non-singular set.

Conversely, as {{tmath|\beta \to -\infty}}, softargmax converges to arg min in the same way, where here the singular set is points with two arg ''min'' values. In the language of [[tropical analysis]], the softmax is a [[deformation theory|deformation]] or "quantization" of arg max and arg min, corresponding to using the [[log semiring]] instead of the [[max-plus semiring]] (respectively [[min-plus semiring]]), and recovering the arg max or arg min by taking the limit is called "tropicalization" or "dequantization".

It is also the case that, for any fixed {{mvar|''β''}}, if one input {{tmath|z_i}} is much larger that the others ''relative'' to the temperature, {{tmath|T = 1/β}}, the output is approximately the arg max. For example, a difference of 10 is large relative to a temperature of 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(0, 10) := \sigma_1(0, 10) = \left(1/(1 + e^10), e^10/(1 + e^10)\right) \approx (0.00005, 0.99995)&lt;/math&gt;
However, if the difference is small relative to the temperature, the value is not close to the arg max. For example, a difference of 10 is small relative to a temperature of 100:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{1/100}(0, 10) \left(1/(1 + e^{1/10}), e^{1/10}/(1 + e^{1/10})\right) \approx (0.475, 0.525).&lt;/math&gt;
As {{tmath|\beta \to \infty}}, temperature goes to zero, &lt;math&gt;T = 1/\beta \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, so eventually all differences become large (relative to a shrinking temperature), which gives another interpretation for the limit behavior.

=== Probability theory ===
In [[probability theory]], the output of the softmax function can be used to represent a [[categorical distribution]] – that is, a [[probability distribution]] over {{mvar|K}} different possible outcomes.

=== Statistical mechanics ===
In [[statistical mechanics]], the softmax function is known as the [[Boltzmann distribution]] (or [[Gibbs distribution]]):{{sfn|LeCun|Chopra|Hadsell|Ranzato|Huang|2006|p=7}} the index set &lt;math&gt;{1, \dots, k}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] of the system; the inputs &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; are the energies of that state; the denominator is known as the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]], often denoted by {{mvar|''Z''}}; and the factor {{mvar|''β''}} is called the [[coldness]] (or [[thermodynamic beta]], or [[inverse temperature]]).

== Applications ==
The softmax function is used in various [[multiclass classification]] methods, such as [[multinomial logistic regression]] (also known as softmax regression)&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher M. |last=Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206–209}} [http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/SoftmaxRegression/], multiclass [[linear discriminant analysis]], [[naive Bayes classifier]]s, and [[artificial neural network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;ai-faq [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part2/section-12.html What is a softmax activation function?]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in multinomial logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis, the input to the function is the result of {{mvar|K}} distinct [[linear function]]s, and the predicted probability for the {{mvar|j}}'th class given a sample vector {{math|'''x'''}} and a weighting vector {{math|'''w'''}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;P(y=j\mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{e^{\mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{w}_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^K e^{\mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{w}_k}}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen as the [[function composition|composition]] of {{mvar|K}} linear functions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \mapsto \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{w}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x} \mapsto \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{w}_K&lt;/math&gt; and the softmax function (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the inner product of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;). The operation is equivalent to applying a linear operator defined by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; to vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, thus transforming the original, probably highly-dimensional, input to vectors in a {{mvar|K}}-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^K&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Neural networks ===
The softmax function is often used in the final layer of a neural network-based classifier. Such networks are commonly trained under a [[Cross entropy|log loss]] (or [[cross-entropy]]) regime, giving a non-linear variant of multinomial logistic regression.

Since the function maps a vector and a specific index ''i'' to a real value, the derivative needs to take the index into account:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial}{\partial q_k}\sigma(\textbf{q}, i) = \cdots =  \sigma(\textbf{q}, i)(\delta_{ik} - \sigma(\textbf{q}, k))&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the [[Kronecker delta]] is used for simplicity (cf. the derivative of a [[sigmoid function]], being expressed via the function itself).

See [[Multinomial logit]] for a probability model which uses the softmax activation function.

===Reinforcement learning===
In the field of [[reinforcement learning]], a softmax function can be used to convert values into action probabilities. The function commonly used is:&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. S. and Barto A. G. ''Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction''. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998. [http://incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/node17.html Softmax Action Selection]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
P_t(a) = \frac{\exp(q_t(a)/\tau)}{\sum_{i=1}^n\exp(q_t(i)/\tau)} \text{,}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the action value &lt;math&gt;q_t(a)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the expected reward of following action a and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is called a temperature parameter (in allusion to [[statistical mechanics]]). For high temperatures (&lt;math&gt;\tau\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;), all actions have nearly the same probability and the lower the temperature, the more expected rewards affect the probability. For a low temperature (&lt;math&gt;\tau\to 0^+&lt;/math&gt;), the probability of the action with the highest expected reward tends to 1.

===Softmax normalization===
Sigmoidal or Softmax normalization is a way of reducing the influence of extreme values or outliers in the data without removing them from the dataset. It is useful given outlier data, which we wish to include in the dataset while still preserving the significance of data within a standard deviation of the mean. The data are nonlinearly transformed using one of the sigmoidal functions.

The logistic sigmoid function:&lt;ref name="ANN200516"&gt;{{cite book|title=Artificial Neural Networks: An Introduction|year=2005|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x_i' \equiv \frac{1}{1+e^{-(x_i - \mu_i)/\sigma_i}} &lt;/math&gt;

The hyperbolic tangent function, tanh:&lt;ref name="ANN200516"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x_i' \equiv \frac{1-e^{-(x_i - \mu_i)/\sigma_i}}{1+e^{-(x_i - \mu_i)/\sigma_i}} &lt;/math&gt;

The sigmoid function limits the range of the normalized data to values between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function is almost linear near the mean and has smooth nonlinearity at both extremes, ensuring that all data points are within a limited range. This maintains the resolution of most values within a standard deviation of the mean.

The [[hyperbolic tangent]] function, tanh, limits the range of the normalized data to values between −1 and 1. The hyperbolic tangent function is almost linear near the mean, but has a slope of half that of the sigmoid function. Like sigmoid, it has [[Smoothness|smooth]], [[monotonic]] nonlinearity at both extremes. Also, like the sigmoid function, it remains [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] everywhere and the sign of the derivative (slope) is unaffected by the normalization. This ensures that optimization and numerical integration algorithms can continue to rely on the derivative to estimate changes to the output (normalized value) that will be produced by changes to the input in the region near any [[linearisation]] point.

== Properties ==
Geometrically the softmax function maps the vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^K&lt;/math&gt; to the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of the [[standard simplex|standard &lt;math&gt;(K-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex]], cutting the dimension by one (the range is a &lt;math&gt;(K-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional simplex in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space), due to the [[linear constraint]] that all output sum to 1 meaning it lies on a [[hyperplane]].

Along the main diagonal &lt;math&gt;(x, x, \dots, x),&lt;/math&gt; softmax is just the uniform distribution on outputs, &lt;math&gt;(1/n, \dots, 1/n)&lt;/math&gt;: equal scores yield equal probabilities.

More generally, softmax is invariant under translation by the same value in each coordinate: adding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = (c, \dots, c)&lt;/math&gt; to the inputs &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{z} + \mathbf{c}) = \sigma(\mathbf{z})&lt;/math&gt;, because it multiplies each exponent by the same factor, &lt;math&gt;e^c&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;e^{z_i + c} = e^{z_i} \cdot e^c&lt;/math&gt;), so the ratios do not change:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{z} + \mathbf{c})_j = \frac{e^{z_j + c}}{\sum_{k=1}^K e^{z_k + c}} = \frac{e^{z_j} \cdot e^c}{\sum_{k=1}^K e^{z_k} \cdot e^c} = \sigma(\mathbf{z})_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Geometrically, softmax is constant along diagonals: this is the dimension that is eliminated, and corresponds to the softmax output being independent of a translation in the input scores (a choice of 0 score). One can normalize input scores by assuming that the sum is zero (subtract the average: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c = \frac{1}{n} \sum z_i&lt;/math&gt;), and then the softmax takes the hyperplane of points that sum to zero, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum z_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;, to the open simplex of positive values that sum to 1&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum \sigma(\mathbf{z})_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;, analogously to how the exponent takes 0 to 1, &lt;math&gt;e^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and is positive.

By contrast, softmax is not invariant under scaling. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\sigma\bigl((0, 1)\bigr) = \bigl(1/(1 + e), e/(1+e)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\sigma\bigl((0, 2)\bigr) = \bigl(1/(1 + e^2), e^2/(1+e^2)\bigr).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[standard logistic function]] is the special case for a 1-dimensional axis in 2-dimensional space, say the ''x''-axis in the {{math|(x, y)}} plane. One variable is fixed at 0 (say &lt;math&gt;z_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;), so &lt;math&gt;e^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and the other variable can vary, denote it &lt;math&gt;z_1 = x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e^{z_1}/\sum_{k=1}^2 e^{z_k} = e^x/(e^x + 1),&lt;/math&gt; the standard logistic function, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e^{z_2}/\sum_{k=1}^2 e^{z_k} = 1/(e^x + 1),&lt;/math&gt; its complement (meaning they add up to 1). The 1-dimensional input could alternatively be expressed as the line &lt;math&gt;(x/2, -x/2)&lt;/math&gt;, with outputs &lt;math&gt;e^{x/2}/(e^{x/2} + e^{-x/2}) = e^x/(e^x + 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{-x/2}/(e^{x/2} + e^{-x/2}) = 1/(e^x + 1).&lt;/math&gt;

The softmax function is also the gradient of the [[LogSumExp]] function, a [[smooth maximum]]; defining:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LSE}(z_1, \dots, z_n) = \log\left( \exp(z_1)+ \cdots + \exp(z_n) \right),&lt;/math&gt;
the partial derivatives are:
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\partial_i LSE(\mathbf{x}) = \exp x_i /\bigl(\sum_i \exp x_i\bigr).&lt;/math&gt;
Expressing the partial derivatives as a vector with the [[gradient]] yields the softmax.

== History ==
The softmax function was used in [[statistical mechanics]] as the [[Boltzmann distribution]] in the foundational paper {{harvtxt|Boltzmann|1868}}, formalized and popularized in the influential textbook {{harvtxt|Gibbs|1902}}.

The use of the softmax in [[decision theory]] is credited to {{harvtxt|Luce|1959}},{{sfn|Gao|Pavel|2017|p=1}} who used the axiom of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] in [[rational choice theory]] to deduce the softmax in [[Luce's choice axiom]] for relative preferences.

In machine learning, the term "softmax" is credited to John S. Bridle in two 1989 conference papers, {{harvtxt|Bridle|1990a}}:{{sfn|Gao|Pavel|2017|p=1}} and {{harvtxt|Bridle|1990b}}:&lt;ref name="sako2018"/&gt;

|We are concerned with feed-forward non-linear networks (multi-layer perceptrons, or MLPs) with multiple outputs. We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (''e.g.'' pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (''e.g.'' weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential ('''softmax''') multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity.{{sfn|Bridle|1990a|p=227}}}}
{{quote
|For any input, the outputs must all be positive and they must sum to unity. ...

Given a set of unconstrained values, {{tmath|V_j(x)}}, we can ensure both conditions by using a Normalised Exponential transformation:
:&lt;math&gt;Q_j(x) = e^{V_j(x)} / \sum_k e^{V_j(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
This transformation can be considered a multi-input generalisation of the logistic, operating on the whole output layer. It preserves the rank order of its input values, and is a differentiable generalisation of the ‘winner-take-all’ operation of picking the maximum value. For this reason we like to refer to it as '''softmax'''.{{sfn|Bridle|1990b|p=213}}}}

== Example ==

If we take an input of [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3], the softmax of that is [0.024, 0.064, 0.175, 0.475, 0.024, 0.064, 0.175]. The output has most of its weight where the '4' was in the original input. This is what the function is normally used for: to highlight the largest values and suppress values which are significantly below the maximum value. But note: softmax is not scale invariant, so if the input were [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3] (which sums to 1.6) the softmax would be [0.125, 0.138, 0.153, 0.169, 0.125, 0.138, 0.153]. This shows that for values between 0 and 1 softmax, in fact, de-emphasizes the maximum value (note that 0.169 is not only less than 0.475, it is also less than the initial proportion of 0.4/1.6=0.25).

Computation of this example using simple Python code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; z_exp = [math.exp(i) for i in z]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print([round(i, 2) for i in z_exp])
[2.72, 7.39, 20.09, 54.6, 2.72, 7.39, 20.09]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum_z_exp = sum(z_exp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(round(sum_z_exp, 2))
114.98
&gt;&gt;&gt; softmax = [i / sum_z_exp for i in z_exp]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print([round(i, 3) for i in softmax])
[0.024, 0.064, 0.175, 0.475, 0.024, 0.064, 0.175]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Another example with python using Numpy:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; softmax = lambda z:np.exp(z)/np.sum(np.exp(z))
&gt;&gt;&gt; softmax(z)
array([0.02364054, 0.06426166, 0.1746813 , 0.474833  , 0.02364054,
       0.06426166, 0.1746813 ])
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Here is an example of [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="jlcon"&gt;
julia&gt; A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
7-element Array{Float64,1}:
 1.0
 2.0
 3.0
 4.0
 1.0
 2.0
 3.0

julia&gt; exp.(A) ./ sum(exp.(A))
7-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.0236405
 0.0642617
 0.174681
 0.474833
 0.0236405
 0.0642617
 0.174681
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Here is an example of R code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="r"&gt;
&gt; z &lt;- c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
&gt; softmax &lt;- exp(z)/sum(exp(z))
&gt; softmax
[1] 0.02364054 0.06426166 0.17468130 0.47483300 0.02364054 0.06426166 0.17468130

'''Susan Peters''' (born '''Suzanne Carnahan'''; July 3, 1921{{spaced en dash}}October 23, 1952) was an American film, stage, and television actress who appeared in over twenty films over the course of her decade-long career. Though she began her career in uncredited and [[ingénue]] roles, she would establish herself as a serious dramatic actress in the mid-1940s.

Born in [[Spokane, Washington]], Peters was raised by her mother in [[Portland, Oregon]] and later, Los Angeles. Upon graduating from high school, she studied acting with Austrian theater director [[Max Reinhardt]], and signed a contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]. She appeared in numerous bit parts before earning a minor supporting role in ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940). She made her last film for Warner Bros. in 1942, the film noir ''[[The Big Shot (1942 film)|The Big Shot]]'' opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Richard Travis (actor)|Richard Travis]]; after its release, Warner opted not to renew her contract.

In 1942, Peters appeared in a supporting role in ''[[Tish (film)|Tish]]'', which resulted in her signing a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). The same year, she had a featured role in the [[Mervyn LeRoy]]-directed drama ''[[Random Harvest (film)|Random Harvest]]'', which earned her an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and established her as a serious dramatic performer. Peters went on to appear as the lead in numerous films for MGM, including roles in the romantic comedy ''[[Young Ideas]]'' (1943), and several war films: ''[[Assignment in Brittany]]'' (1943), ''[[Song of Russia]]'' (1944), and ''[[Keep Your Powder Dry]]'' (1945).

On New Year's Day 1945, Peters's [[spinal cord]] was damaged from an accidental gunshot wound, leaving her permanently [[paraplegia|paraplegic]]. She returned to film portraying a wheelchair-bound villain in ''[[The Sign of the Ram]]'' (1948). Peters then transitioned to theater, appearing as Laura Wingfield in a critically acclaimed 1949 production of [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', which was slightly altered to allow Peters to perform in a wheelchair. She followed this with a production of ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'', in which she portrayed crippled poet [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]. By 1952, however, Peters had been suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] for several years due to the dissolution of her marriage and her limited career options. In late 1952 she began [[starvation|starving]] herself, which combined with her paralysis led to chronic kidney infections and pneumonia. She died of ensuing health complications that year at age 31.

Peters transferred to [[Hollywood High School]] during her senior year, and began taking drama classes in which she opted to enroll in place of cooking courses: "I took a drama course instead of a cooking course because I thought it was easier," Peters said. "Acting meant money, and [my family] needed money."{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=177}} While still in high school, she signed with a talent agent.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=177}} She graduated from Hollywood High School in June 1939, along with [[Jason Robards]], [[Sheila Ryan]], and [[Dorothy Morris]] as members of her graduating class.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=177}} With a newfound interest in acting, Peters earned a scholarship to the Max Reinhardt School of Dramatic Arts.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=178}} 

While performing in a showcase production of [[Philip Barry]]'s ''[[Holiday (play)|Holiday]]'' at the Reinhardt School,{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=178}} Peters was spotted by a talent scout for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), who gave her a walk-on part in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Susan and God]]'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dean Jagger Dominant in Religious Feature|author=Schallert, Edwin|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 20, 1940|p=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the shoot, Peters was reportedly so nervous that she fainted in front of the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Starlet Has 'Jitters'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 29, 1940|page=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her apprehension on set, Peters became a protégée of Cukor, who personally assigned her to private acting lessons with drama coach Gertrude Vogler.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|pages=177–178}} Cukor believed Peters had star potential, but needed to not "talk through [her] nose."{{sfn|Parish|Bowers|1973|p=556}} He later recalled that she reminded him of "a young [[Katharine Hepburn]].

[[File:Susan Peters 1941 portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Peters in an early 1941 portrait for Warner Bros. as Suzanne Carnahan]]
In early 1940, Peters screen tested for [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], who subsequently offered her a contract.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=178}} Then credited under her birth name, Suzanne Carnahan, Peters was cast in various small parts in Warner Bros. films; many these were uncredited bit parts or walk-on roles, such as in ''[[River's End (1940 film)|River's End]]'', ''[[The Man Who Talked Too Much]]'', ''[[Money and the Woman]]'', and ''[[Always a Bride]]'' (all released in 1940).{{sfn|Crivello|1988|pages=176–179}} She had her first credited role in the big-budget Western film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940), opposite [[Errol Flynn]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], and [[Rita Hayworth]]. In the film, Peters portrayed a young woman from [[Boston]] in love with a [[Kansas]] military officer.{{Sfn|Crivello|1988|p=178}} During the [[Film promotion|press junket]]s to promote the film, Peters found interviews overwhelming, and later admitted: "I wasn't a good sport. I locked herself in my compartment during most of the trip."{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=178}}

After ''Santa Fe Trail'', Peters had small roles in ''[[The Strawberry Blonde]]'', ''[[Meet John Doe]]'', ''[[Here Comes Happiness]]'' (1941), and ''[[Scattergood Pulls the Strings]]'' (all 1941), the latter of which earned her favorable reviews.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|pages=179–180}} She then had a lead role as an [[ingénue]] in the comedy ''[[Three Sons o' Guns]]'' (1941), followed by a dramatic part playing the girlfriend of a convict in ''[[The Big Shot (1942 film)|The Big Shot]]'' (1942), opposite [[Richard Travis (actor)|Richard Travis]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]].{{sfn|Crivello|1988|pages=179–180}} She was also in shorts such as ''Young America Flies'' (1940) and ''Sockaroo'' (1941).&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite news|title=Academy Starts Drive for Museum Collection|author= Schallert, Edwin|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 14, 1940|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the urging of the studio (who initially suggested she change her name to Sharon O'Keefe), she dropped her birth name and took the stage name Susan Peters.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=177}}{{sfn|Parish|Bowers|1973|p=557}} By 1942, however, Warner Bros. chose not to renew her contract.&lt;ref name=macpherson&gt;{{cite news|work=St. Petersburg Times|page=11|location=St. Petersburg, Florida|series=Hollywood Roundup|title=Susan Peters Gave Herself 3 Years To Make Good--Did|author=MacPherson, Virginia|via=Google News|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19441206&amp;id=96BPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wU4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7068,1430505|date=December 6, 1944}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Susan Peters in Tish trailer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Peters in the trailer for ''[[Tish (film)|Tish]]'' (1942)]]
Several months after being dropped by Warner Bros., Peters was contacted by MGM to test for a supporting role in the film ''[[Tish (film)|Tish]]'' (1942), a loose adaptation of a series of stories by [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]].{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=180}} She won the role and also signed a contract with the studio.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=180}} At the time, Peters was one of the most screen-tested actresses in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's Who at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBEPAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|year=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; While filming ''Tish'', Peters met future husband, actor [[Richard Quine]], with whom she also starred in her second film with MGM, ''[[Dr. Gillespie's New Assistant]]'' (1942), alongside [[Van Johnson]].{{sfn|Crivello|1988|pages=180–181}} She and Peters later married on November 7, 1943 at Westwood Community Church in West Los Angeles.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=182}}

After completing filming of the comedy ''[[Andy Hardy's Double Life]]'' (1942) in which she had a lead role,{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=181}} [[Mervyn LeRoy]] cast Peters in the drama ''[[Random Harvest (film)|Random Harvest]]'',{{sfn|Troyan|2010|p=139}}  in which she portrayed a young woman who falls in love with her step-uncle.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=181}} The film was one of the top 25 highest-earning films of the year,{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=181}} and Peters's performance garnered her critical acclaim, earning her an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].&lt;ref name="toledo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19890301&amp;id=JnwUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-gIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4480,1513385|title=Susan Peters: A Look Back|date=March 1, 1989|work=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]]|location=Toledo, Ohio|pages=P–3|accessdate=May 23, 2014|via=Google News}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Random Harvest'' led MGM to give Peters lead roles in other major pictures such as ''[[Assignment in Brittany]]'' (1943), in which she portrayed a French peasant girl.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=181}} This was followed with a minor but top-billed credit in the comedy ''[[Young Ideas]]'' (1943) with [[Herbert Marshall]] and [[Mary Astor]], directed by [[Jules Dassin]].{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=181}} She was subsequently cast as the female lead in ''[[Song of Russia]]'' (1943) opposite Robert Taylor.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=182}} The role earned her further critical acclaim, with a review in ''The Hollywood Reporter'' noting her as "a dramatic actress of the first rank."{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=182}} The film however was controversial, as its portrayal of the [[Soviet Union]] was interpreted by some audiences and critics as being favorable and of a pro-[[Communism|Communist]] stance.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=182}} 

In early 1944, Peters was one of ten actors who were elevated from "featured player" status to the studio's official "star" category; the others included [[Esther Williams]], [[Laraine Day]], [[Kathryn Grayson]], Van Johnson, [[Margaret O'Brien]], [[Ginny Simms]], [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]], [[Gene Kelly]], and [[George Murphy]]. An official portrait taken of MGM's contracted players during this period prominently features Peters sharing the front row with the head of the studio himself, [[Louis B.

MGM continued to pay Peters a $100 weekly salary and medical expenses, but, unable to find suitable projects, she subsequently left the studio.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|pages=183–184}} She later recalled: "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept sending me [[Pollyanna]] scripts about crippled girls who were all sweetness and light, which I kept turning down.

After the cancelation of ''Miss Susan'', she began a relationship with Robert Clark, a U.S. Colonel, and the two announced their engagement to be married; however, Clark broke off the engagement, which sent Peters into a deeper depression.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=187}} She relocated to [[Lemon Grove, California]], to live on her brother's cattle ranch, and her health began to steadily decline.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=187}} In mid-1952, she was admitted to a hospital in [[Exeter, California]] to undergo a [[skin graft]] procedure, after which she returned to her brother's home and lived in seclusion.{{Sfn|Crivello|1988|p=187}} She had plans to resume another touring stage production of ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street'' the following year, but her strength had dwindled and she struggled to put on weight.{{sfn|Crivello|1988|p=187}}

In August 1952, Peters told her physician, Dr. Manchester: "I'm getting awfully tired. I think it possibly would be better if I did die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[National Board of Review#Films In Review|Films In Review]]|year=1976|volume=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRFCAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=susan+peters+I’m+getting+awfully+tired.+I+think+it+would+be+better+if+I+did+die.%22&amp;dq=susan+peters+I’m+getting+awfully+tired.+I+think+it+would+be+better+if+I+did+die.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirkcad2b_VAhVL_mMKHYTlBzUQ6AEIKDAA|page=214|title=Susan Peters|publisher=National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|issn=0015-1688}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following two months, she began [[starvation|starving herself]].&lt;ref name=easy/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt; Peters died on October 23, 1952 at Memorial Hospital in [[Visalia, California]] at the age of 31.

==Legacy==
Much of the public assessment and discussion of Peters has hinged on her paralysis and its impact on her life and career: Media historian [[Hal Erickson (author)|Hal Erickson]] considered Peters "one of Hollywood's most promising young actresses" of the 1940s, who "courageously attempted a comeback" despite her health problems.{{sfn|Erickson|2009|p=189}} Film scholar Gene Blottner similarly praised Peters as a "brilliant actress,"{{sfn|Blottner|2015|p=202}} as did John Charles of [[Turner Classic Movies]], who deemed her paralysis "one of the worst tragedies to affect the Hollywood acting community during the 1940s."&lt;ref name=tcm&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|last=Charles|first=John|accessdate=August 14, 2018|title=Susan Peters Biography|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/151081%7C143413/Susan-Peters/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her contribution to motion pictures, Peters was posthumously&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt; awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1601 [[Vine Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/susan-peters/|title=Hollywood Star Walk: Susan Peters|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Thomas I d'Autremencourt''', commonly misspelled '''de Stromoncourt''', was the first [[Lord of Salona]] (modern [[Amfissa]]) in [[Central Greece]]. A knight from [[Autremencourt]] in [[Picardy]], he was given Salona as a fief by [[Boniface of Montferrat]], [[King of Thessalonica]], in 1205 during the division of the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the [[Fourth Crusade]]. Thomas extended his domain over most of [[Phocis]], from the [[Gulf of Corinth]] to the passes of [[Gravia]] in the north and the [[Parnassus]] in the east. Ca. 1210, he tried to extend his rule westwards, and attacked the port town of [[Galaxidi]]. Its inhabitants, however, called upon the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]], for aid. The Epirote army attacked and captured Salona, with Thomas himself falling in battle (ca. 1212). As the Epirote ruler was pre-occupied elsewhere, however, his occupation did not last long, and within a few years Thomas's son, [[Thomas II d'Autremencourt|Thomas II]], was able to reclaim Salona.

{{no footnotes|date=April 2017}}
'''Tyrone Crawley''' (born 2 November 1958) is a former professional [[Boxing|boxer]] from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

During his professional boxing career he was known for his hand and foot speed, and the ability to switch effortlessly from the [[orthodox stance]] to the [[Southpaw (boxing)|southpaw stance]]. Many opponents were confused by this style, and some boxing experts contend that Crawley might have been the best "switch hitter" of his time along with middleweight champion [[Marvelous Marvin Hagler]].

As an amateur, Tyrone compiled a record of 56-6 (22 RSCs), and was a [[Golden Gloves]] champion and All Army champion in the late 1970s. Tyrone turned pro in October 1980 and won the [[ESPN]] lightweight title in only his ninth pro fight with a twelve-round decision over knockout puncher {{anchor|Al "Earthquake" Carter}} Al "Earthquake" Carter in September 1982. In his next fight, Crawley scored an impressive ten-round decision over future jr. welterweight champion [[Gene Hatcher]] on national television in October 1982.  He defended his ESPN lightweight in December 1982 with a tenth round stoppage of Anthony Murray, but lost his ESPN title in a close 12-round decision to [[Melvin Paul]] in his next fight in February 1983. It is noteworthy that Crawley entered the Paul fight with a broken knuckle and broken finger.

Crawley rebounded in 1983 and scored a huge upset win over #1 lightweight contender [[Robin Blake]] in Blake's hometown of [[Levelland, Texas]]. Blake had knocked out Melvin Paul in his previous fight, and many expected him to dispose of Crawley easily. Blake was zeroing in on a title shot with [[Ray Mancini|Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini]], but Blake had trouble solving Crawley's style, and was soundly beaten in a lopsided ten-round decision.

In 1984, [[Livingstone Bramble]] dethroned Ray Mancini to take the WBA lightweight title. Crawley was the #1 contender, and accepted $150,000 to step aside and allow Bramble and Mancini to engage in a rematch. Bramble defeated Mancini in their rematch on February 16, 1985.

Crawley won the [[United States Boxing Association|USBA]] lightweight title in June 1985 with a twelve-round decision over crosstown rival and future [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] lightweight champion [[Charlie "Choo Choo" Brown]]. Crawley was supposed to challenge Bramble for the WBA lightweight crown on a few occasions in 1985, but the bout was postponed due to injuries to both fighters. Bramble and Crawley finally met for Bramble's title in February 1986 in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Crawley suffered the first knockdown of his career in the second round of that bout, but rallied over the next several rounds to draw even on the scorecards after eight rounds. Crawley eventually tired late in the fight, and was knocked out in the 13th round.

After the Bramble bout, Crawley joined the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] during the summer of 1986. He resumed his boxing career in June 1987 while maintaining his duties with the Philadelphia P.D. He scored three more wins, and retired from professional boxing in early 1988 with a record of 22-2 (7 KOs). In that same year, Tyrone was named Director of the North Philadelphia [[Police Athletic League]], a position he still holds to this day.

Crawley attended [[Temple University]]. He was inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003. He was also recently inducted as a member of the 2010 class of the Pennsylvania Boxing Hall of Fame.

Tyrone has 3 children, Ageenah his eldest child, Tyrone Crawley Jr a current professional boxer, and Kevin Crawley an entertainment screenwriter.
