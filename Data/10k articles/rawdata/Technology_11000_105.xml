'''1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene''' is a [[nitro compound|nitrated]] [[benzene]]-derivative that is classified as a high explosive, being moderately explosive in liquid form and extremely explosive in its dry powder form. It has a clear to light yellow sludgy appearance. It will detonate under strong shock. High temperatures, whether by sudden heating of any quantity, or by the accumulation of heat when large quantities are burning, will also cause detonation.  The material can react vigorously with reducing materials and is incompatible with [[sodium dichromate]] or [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Sax, N. I. and Lewis, R. J. Sr. (1987) ''Hazardous chemicals desk reference''. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York. p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; It must be stored in a cool, ventilated place, away from acute fire hazards and easily oxidized materials. It also reacts violently with [[aluminium]], [[boron phosphide]], [[cyanides]], [[ester]]s, PN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H, [[phosphorus]], [[sodium cyanide|NaCN]], SnC&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, [[sodium hypophosphite]], [[thiocyanate]]s, etc. When heated to decomposition it emits highly toxic fumes of [[Nitrogen oxide|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is an extremely powerful oxidizing agent which may cause violent reaction with reducing materials.&lt;ref&gt;Sax, N. I. and Lewis, R. J. Sr. (1987) ''Hazardous chemicals desk reference''. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York. p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and applications==
Trinitrobenzene is used primarily as a high explosive for commercial mining and military use. Some other uses include a narrow-range pH indicator, an agent to vulcanize natural rubber, and a mediating agent to mediate the synthesis of other explosive compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives-nitroaromatics.htm |title=Explosives – Nitroaromatics |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=1997-05-21 |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety precautions==
It is recommended that people avoid contact if possible. Avoid breathing dusts, and fumes from burning or reacting material. Wear appropriate chemical protective gloves and goggles. Do not handle broken packages unless wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Wash away any material which may have contacted the body with copious amounts of water or soap and water. Do not store near other chemicals (especially other oxidizers), near sources of heating, or places where rapid temperature changes may occur. In case of spillage immediately soak with water and carefully and slowly clean up. In case of fire let burn; DO NOT attempt to put out the resulting fire. In any case where the compound is ingested call [[Poison Control Center]] immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/17641 |title=TRINITROTOLUENE (TNT) AND TRINITROBENZENE MIXTURES [OR] TRINITROTOLUENE (TNT) AND HEXANITROSTILBENE MIXTURES |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528125813/http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/17641 |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |website=CAMEO Chemicals |type=Chemical Datasheet |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health problems==
The most common modes of exposure are either direct contact with the substance or through drinking contaminated water. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene is believed to cause similar health problems as TNT.  Exposure to high concentrations most commonly causes [[anemia]], or the reduced ability for blood to carry oxygen. As a result of the lack of oxygen, the skin typically becomes blue or purple in color. Other symptoms of exposure include headache, nausea, and dizziness. The long-term effects from exposure are not known because no long-term studies of health effects have been performed. It is believed that long-term exposure will cause sterility (especially in males) and cataracts. It is unknown if Trinitrobenzene causes birth defects or cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts74.html |title=ATSDR – Redirect – ToxFAQs™: 1,3-Dinitrobenzene and 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1462">The '''AN/WQX-2''' is a diver-detector [[sonar]] used in [[anti-frogman techniques|anti-frogman precautions]]. It is in service with the  [[US Navy]]. It uses [[Kongsberg Mesotech]] components. It can detect divers up to 2400 feet (= nearly half a mile) away.

The AN/WQX-2 finds range and bearing of the detected target relative to the sonar. The C3D console developed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20061007023826/http://enterprise.spawar.navy.mil/ SPAWAR] converts this to a [[GPS]] position. It has software to distinguish diver echoes from shoals of fish, marine mammals, debris, bubbles from boat wakes, etc.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Accel World characters}}

Haruyuki "Haru" Arita is a short, overweight boy who is frequently ridiculed by delinquents at the Umesato Junior High School. Using his Neuro Linker to escape the torment of real life, he logs onto the school's Local Network cyberspace where he always plays virtual squash alone, and his innate video game skills bring him to the attention of Kuroyukihime (literally meaning "Black Snow Princess"), the school's popular, highly intellectual and attractive female Student Council Vice-President.

After helping him against the delinquents, Kuroyukihime introduces Haruyuki to Brain Burst, a secret program that is able to accelerate the human cognitive process to the point at which time appears to stop. Haruyuki soon learns that Brain Burst is more than just a program, but an [[Augmented Reality]] Massively Multiplayer Online (ARMMO) [[Fighting Game]] where people fight each other in fierce duels in order to obtain Burst Points which can be spent for acceleration abilities in the real world.

Kuroyukihime then enlists Haruyuki's help in reaching Level 10 within Brain Burst by defeating the "Six Kings of Pure Colour" and ultimately meet the creator of Brain Burst to learn its true purpose. With every challenge they face in the Accelerated World, Haru and Kuroyukihime, under their aliases "Silver Crow" and "Black Lotus", gather trusted allies, confront treacherous enemies and their bond grows stronger while working to attain their ultimate objective: to reach the highest in-game level and meet the game's creator, who will 
reveal why the game was created and the true purpose of it.

===Light novels===
''Accel World'' began as a light novel series written by [[Reki Kawahara]] and illustrated by HiMA. Originally, Kawahara entered the first novel in the series into [[ASCII Media Works]]' 15th [[Dengeki Novel Prize]] in 2008 and the novel won the Grand Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.asciimw.jp/award/taisyo/15/ |script-title=ja:第15回 電撃大賞 入賞作品 |trans-title=15th Dengeki Bunko Prize Winning Works |publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]] |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005221918/http://archive.asciimw.jp/award/taisyo/15/ |archivedate=October 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first novel was published by ASCII Media Works on February 10, 2009 under their [[Dengeki Bunko]] imprint.&lt;ref name=vol1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asciimw.jp/search/mode/item/cd/A0900370|script-title=ja:アクセル・ワールド1|trans-title=Accel World 1|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]]|accessdate=October 1, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, 23 volumes have been published.&lt;ref name=vol23/&gt; At their [[Japan Expo USA]] panel, [[Yen Press]] announced the rights to publish the light novels in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-23/yen-press-adds-sword-art-online-accel-world-light-novels-more-madoka-magica-manga|title=Yen Press Adds ''Sword Art Online'', ''Accel World'' Light Novels, More ''Madoka Magica'' Manga|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=August 23, 2013|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume was released on July 22, 2014.&lt;ref name=ln_en_1 /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Anime News Network]] reviewed the series and gave a story rating of A-, stating a similar basis of ''[[Sword Art Online]]'' with improved characters.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Animenewsnetwork.com_November_14_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/accel-world/blu-ray-set-1 |title=Accel World Blu-Ray - Review - Anime News Network |newspaper=Animenewsnetwork.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Eisenbeis of [[Kotaku]] praised the anime for its well-thought out story, relatable main character, and great villain protagonist, but criticizes the anime for its third arc. At the end, he says that the anime starts out strong, but ends on a weak note.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Kotaku.com_November_18_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5948119/accel-world-starts-strong-but-ends-wrong |title=Accel World Starts Strong, But Ends Wrong |newspaper=Kotaku.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nifrigel declared great things about the anime in terms of soundtrack, characters, and story, but strongly criticized Reki Kawahara's lack of knowledge in the subject of [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref name="MyUser_Plantowatch.blogspot.com_November_20_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plantowatch.blogspot.com/2013/01/accel-world-review.html |title=Nifrigel's Otaku Review: Accel World Review |newspaper=Plantowatch.blogspot.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">An '''Alternate Reconstitutional Base''' ('''ARB''') is a concept used during the [[Cold War]] by the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Strategic Air Command]] for the rearming of nuclear bombers.  The idea was, after a nuclear exchange, primary [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] airfields would be destroyed and returning bombers would have no location to rearm their stores and reattack additional targets. ARB allowed trained teams to depart their home installation and create landing locations for returning bombers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/047/464.xml Air Force Historical Research Agency IRIS Document 01047464]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/041/159.xml Air Force Historical Research Agency IRIS Document 01041159]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/033/516.xml Air Force Historical Research Agency IRIS Document 01033516]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/031/378.xml Air Force Historical Research Agency IRIS Document 01031378]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/456/970.xml Air Force Historical Research Agency IRIS Document 00456970]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian Airfields==
A few civilian airfields, such as [[Clinton-Sherman Airport]], were originally [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] bases. The long-length runways were maintained, as well as the [[Christmas tree (aviation)|Christmas tree]] alert structure for possible reuse by [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] forces in the event of nuclear war.

==Training==
Various SAC communications squadrons would conduct ARB training by installing a mobile [[high frequency]] radio set at a pre-planned site and establish a communications net.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16683">[[File:ESD label.jpg|thumb|A label on an antistatic bag featuring the circle symbol on the left and the reaching symbol on the right]]
An '''antistatic device''' is any device that reduces, dampens, or otherwise inhibits [[electrostatic discharge]]; the buildup or discharge of [[static electricity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is antistatic device?|url = http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/asd.htm|website = www.computerhope.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How do anti-static products work? - Explain that Stuff|url = http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howantistaticcoatingswork.html|website = www.explainthatstuff.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can damage electrical components such as computer hard drives, and even ignite [[flammable]] liquids and gases.

Many methods exist for neutralizing, varying in use and effectiveness depending on the application. [[Antistatic agent|Antistatic agents]] are chemical compounds that can be added to an object, or the packaging of an object, to help deter the buildup or discharge of static electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esdjournal.com/techpapr/ryne/esdbags.htm|title=ESD BAGS: TO SHIELD OR NOT TO SHIELD|last=Allen|first=Ryne C.|date=|website=|publisher=EE-Evaluation Engineering|publication-date=August 1999|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the neutralization of static charge in a larger area, such as a factory floor or workshop, antistatic systems may utilize electron emission effects such as [[corona discharge]] or [[Photoelectric effect|photoemission]] that introduce ions into the area that combine with and neutralize any electrically charged object.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/manufacturing_process_equipment/electronics_microelectronics_manufacturing/static_eliminators|title=Ionizers and Static Eliminators Information|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[GlobalSpec|IEEE GlobalSpec]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many situations, sufficient ESD protection can be achieved with [[Ground (electricity)|electrical grounding]].

== Symbology ==
Various symbols can be found on products, indicating that the product is electrostatically sensitive, as with sensitive electrical components, or that it offers antistatic protection, as with antistatic bags.

=== Reach symbol ===
[[Electrostatic Discharge Association#ESD standards.5B1.5D|ANSI/ESD standard]] S8.1-2007 is most commonly seen on applications related to electronics. Several variations consist of a triangle with a reaching hand depicted inside of it using [[negative space]].
[[File:ESD (Susceptible).svg|left|frameless|48x48px]]

Versions of the symbol will often have the hand being crossed out as a warning for the component being protected, indicating that it is ESD sensitive and is not to be touched unless antistatic precautions are taken. 
[[File:ESD (Protected).svg|left|frameless|46x46px]]

Another version of the symbol has the triangle surrounded by an arc. This variant is in reference to the antistatic protective device, such as an antistatic wrist strap, rather than the component being protected. It usually does not feature the hand being crossed out, indicating that it makes contact with the component safe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.shippinglabels.com/esd/ESD_tip3.aspx|title = ESD Labels – Have A Look At The Various Symbols For ESD Labels|website = www.shippinglabels.com|access-date = 2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Circle ===
Another common symbol takes the form of a bold circle being intersected by three arrows. Originating as a U.S. military standard, it has been adopted industry-wide. It is intended as a depiction of a device or component being breached by static charges, indicated by the arrows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:ESD label.jpg|frameless|185x185px]]One version on the circle with three arrows can be seen at the left of this picture.

== Examples ==
Types of antistatic devices include:

=== Antistatic bag ===
{{main|Antistatic bag}}
An '''antistatic bag''' is a [[bag]] used for storing or shipping [[Electronics|electronic]] components which may be prone to damage caused by [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).

=== Ionizing bar ===
An '''ionizing bar''', sometimes referred to as a '''static bar''', is a type of industrial equipment used for removing [[static electricity]] from a [[production line]] to dissipate [[static cling]] and other such phenomena that would disrupt the line. It is important in the manufacturing and printing industries, although it can be used in other applications as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exair.com/en-US/Primary%20Navigation/Products/Static%20Eliminators/Pages/Static%20Eliminators.aspx|title=Static Eliminators|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=EXAIR|access-date=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swedishelectrostatics.com/leaflet_antistatic_electrostatic.html|title=Static electricity, dust and particle problem|website=www.swedishelectrostatics.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionizing bars are most commonly suspended above a conveyor belt or other apparatus in a production line where the product can pass below it; the distance is usually calibrated for the specific application.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bar works by emitting an [[Corona discharge|ionized corona]] onto the products below it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If then a product on the line has a [[Electric charge|positive or negative static charge]], as it passes through the ionized aura created by the bar, it will attract the correspondingly charged positive or negative ions and become electrically neutral.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pffc-online.com/static-beat/7708-paper-static-bars-work-1209|title=How Static Bars Work|last=Robinson|first=Kelly|date=2009-12-01|website=|publisher=Paper, Film &amp; Foil CONVERTER|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airtx.com/static-bars/|title=Static Control Components: Static Bars|date=|publisher=AiRTX International|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antistatic garments''' or '''antistatic clothing''' is required to prevent damage to electrical components or to prevent fires and explosions when working with [[flammable]] liquids and gases.

One of the ways to bond or electrically connect personnel to ground is the use of an ESD garment. ESD garments have conductive threads in them, creating a wearable version of a [[faraday cage]]. ESD garments attempt to shield [[Electrostatic sensitive device|ESD sensitive devices]] from harmful static charges from clothing such as [[wool]], [[silk]], and synthetic fabrics on people working with them. For these garments to work properly, they must also be connected to ground with a strap. Most ESD garments are not conductive enough to provide personal grounding so antistatic foot straps and [[antistatic wrist strap]]s are also worn. ESD garments are considered an optional method to control [[Electrostatic discharge|ESD]].

An ESD protected area is a defined location with the necessary materials, tools, and equipment capable of controlling static electricity to a level that minimizes damage to ESD susceptible items. In the ESD protected area, all conductors in the environment, including personnel, shall be bonded or electrically connected and attached to a known ground or contrived ground. This attachment creates an equipotential balance between all items and personnel. Electrostatic protection can be maintained at a potential above a "zero" voltage ground potential as long as all items in the system are at the same potential.

Antistatic garments are used in many industries such as electronics, communications, telecommunications and defense applications. As computers and electronics become ever more pervasive in consumer products so an increasing number of manufacturers will need to apply anti-static control measures. One such measure is antistatic apparel because people are the greatest source of static charge in the workplace.

Transportation of electrostatic sensitive devices also requires packaging that provides protection from electrostatic hazards in the transportation or storage system. In the case of an ESD protected area designed with continuous grounding of all conductors and dissipative items (including personnel), packaging may not be necessary.

The amount of static electricity we feel varies according to factors such as our body and foot size. A larger body and bigger feet require more charge to be stored to produce the same voltage. The material our clothes are made from and the soles of our shoes can influence static electricity too. Weather affects it as well. There is more build-up of static charge when the air is dry. Most people feel harmless shocks at around 2,000-4,000 volts. However electrical components can be damaged by as little as a few volts. It is estimated that between eight percent and 33 percent of product losses—-the proportion of products which are rendered faulty—-are due to static electricity. Static electricity is generally harmless to the individual but if not controlled, [[electrostatic discharge]] can cause product damage to [[electrostatic sensitive device]]s and lead to machinery downtime, lost [[man-hour]]s, returned products and warranty costs particularly in the [[semiconductor]] and [[electronics]] industries, which caused {{nowrap|5 billion USD}} worth of damage to products each year.

=== Antistatic mat ===
An '''antistatic floor mat''' or '''ground mat''' is one of a number of [[antistatic devices]] designed to help eliminate [[static electricity]]. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a metal mat would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an insulating mat would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding. Typical resistance is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ohms between points on the mat and to ground.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/3M%20PDFs/8200_Series.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aclstaticide.com/datasheets/DualmatTDS_0810.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618013640/http://aclstaticide.com/datasheets/DualmatTDS_0810.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/3M%20PDFs/8800_Series.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The mat would need to be [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] (earthed). This is usually accomplished by plugging into the grounded line in an electrical outlet.  It's important to discharge at a slow rate, therefore a [[resistor]] should be used in earthing the mat. The resistor, as well as allowing high-voltage charges to leak through to earth, also prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Some ground mats allow you to connect an [[antistatic wrist strap]] to them. Versions are designed for placement on both the floor and desk.

=== Antistatic wrist strap ===
[[File:ESD-Armband.jpg|thumb|Antistatic wrist strap connected to a bench mounted grounding socket]]
[[File:AntiStatic-Wrist-Guard.jpg|thumb|right|An antistatic wrist strap with crocodile clip.]]
An '''antistatic wrist strap''', '''ESD wrist strap''', or '''ground bracelet''' is an antistatic device used to safely [[ground (electricity)|ground]] a person working on very sensitive [[electronics|electronic]] equipment, to prevent the buildup of [[static electricity]] on their body, which can result in [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD). It is used in the electronics industry by workers working on electronic devices which can be damaged by ESD, and also sometimes by people working around explosives, to prevent [[electric spark]]s which could set off an explosion. It consists of an elastic band of [[Textile|fabric]] with fine [[conductive]] fibers woven into it, attached to a wire with a clip on the end to connect it to a [[ground conductor]]. The fibers are usually made of carbon or carbon-filled rubber, and the strap is bound with a stainless steel clasp or plate. They are usually used in conjunction with an [[antistatic mat]] on the workbench, or a special static-dissipating plastic laminate on the workbench surface.

The wrist strap is usually worn on the nondominant hand (the left wrist for a right-handed person). It is connected to ground through a coiled retractable cable and 1&amp;nbsp;[[Ohm (unit)|megohm]] [[resistor]], which allows high-voltage charges to leak through but prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Where higher voltages are present, extra resistance (0.75&amp;nbsp;[[ohm (unit)|megohm]] per 250&amp;nbsp;V) is added in the path to ground to protect the wearer from excessive currents; this typically takes the form of a 4&amp;nbsp;megohm resistor in the coiled cable (or, more commonly, a 2&amp;nbsp;megohm resistor at each end).

Wrist straps designed for industrial use usually connect to earth bonding points, [[Ground (electricity)|ground connections]] built into the workplace,  via either a standard 4&amp;nbsp;mm plug or 10&amp;nbsp;mm press stud, whereas straps designed for consumer use often have a [[crocodile clip]] for the ground connection.

In addition to wrist straps, ankle and heel straps are used in industry to bleed away accumulated charge from a body.  These devices are usually not tethered to earth ground, but instead incorporate high resistance in their construction, and work by dissipating electrical charge to special floor tiles.  Such straps are used when workers need to be mobile in a work area and a grounding cable would get in the way.  They are used particularly in an [[operating theatre]], where oxygen or explosive anesthetic gases are used.

"Wireless" or "dissipative" wrist straps are available, which claim to protect against ESD without needing a ground wire, typically by air ionization or [[corona discharge]]. These are widely regarded as ineffective,&lt;ref name="Namaguchi"&gt;{{cite conference

[[File:Arthur Beale.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Arthur Beale''' is a [[yacht-chandler]] on London's [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], which stocks a wide variety of nautical equipment and accessories.  The business started as the [[rope-maker]] '''John Buckingham''' by the nearby [[Fleet river]] in the 16th century and has been based in premises in [[Bloomsbury]] since then.  In the 19th century, they became known as the exclusive suppliers of climbing rope to the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]].  They still make and stock a large variety of ropes and lines and so also supply [[theatrical rigging]] and ornamental ropes for decoration and crowd control.  

==History==
[[File:John Buckingham.png|thumb|right|Advert in ''[[Edward Whymper|Whymper's Guides Advertiser]]'' in 1897]]
The business started as rope-maker, John Buckingham, on the [[Fleet river]] at the start of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=832 |title=The London Encyclopedia |year=2008 |isbn=9781405049245}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, they had premises at number 6 in the Middle Row of [[St Giles, London|St Giles]]—an impressive terrace in the middle of [[Broad Street (ward)|Broad Street]]—but had to move when this was demolished in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/streets/middle_row_bloomsbury.htm |work=UCL Bloomsbury Project |title=Middle Row Bloomsbury |date= 14 April 2011 |author=Deborah Colville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then operated from premises on Shaftesbury Avenue when John Buckingham and then the new proprietor, Arthur Beale, were exclusive suppliers of [[climbing rope]] to early members of the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]].&lt;ref name=CM/&gt; This was made to the club's specification so that it was both light and strong, being made from three strands of [[manila hemp]], treated to be rot proof and marked with a red thread of [[worsted]] yarn.&lt;ref name=CM&gt;{{citation |page=58|author=George Dixon Abraham |title=The Complete Mountaineer |year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rope was used for British expeditions to [[Mount Everest]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.arthurbeale.co.uk/newsletter_140618.pdf |title=Arthur Beale Summer Watch |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711205117/http://www.arthurbeale.co.uk/newsletter_140618.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also supplied [[ice axe]]s to polar explorer, [[Ernest Shackleton]]; the [[flagpole]] for [[Buckingham Palace]] and rigging for [[escapologist]]s and the [[window display]]s of [[Selfridges]] department store.&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/best-of-british-arthur-beale-chandlery/ |title=Best of British: Arthur Beale Chandlery  |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=31 March 2016 |author=Christian House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Eugenia Bell, writing in ''The Traditional Shops and Restaurants of London'', praised the establishment:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Traditional Shops and Restaurants of London |page=193 |chapter=Arthur Beale |isbn=1-892145-95-2 |year=2010 |author=Eugenia Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The teal shopfront matches the pegboards inside, festooned with gleaming brass shackles, bolts and hooks of every size and description.

[[File:Trunk 1.jpg|thumb|A [[trunk (luggage)|trunk]].]]

'''Baggage''' or '''luggage''' consists of bags, cases, and containers which hold a [[travel]]ler's articles while the traveler is in [[transport|transit]]. &lt;ref&gt;"Luggage" is more or less a synonym of "baggage" but is normally used in relation to the personal baggage of a specific person or persons (e.g. ''I have lost my luggage'', ''he has prepared his luggage'', but not normally ''I have lost my baggage'', ''he has prepared his baggage'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[tourist|traveller]] can be expected to have packages containing [[clothing]], toiletries, small possessions, trip necessities, and on the return-trip, [[souvenir]]s. For some people, luggage and the [[Fashion|style]] thereof is representative of the owner's [[wealth]].

Baggage (not luggage),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/difference-between-luggage-and-baggage|title=What's the Difference Between Luggage and Baggage?|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''baggage train'', can also refer to the train of people and goods, both military and of a personal nature, which commonly followed pre-modern armies on campaign.

==Overview==
Luggage has changed over time. Historically the most common types of luggage were [[Chest (furniture)|chest]]s or [[Trunk (luggage)|trunk]]s made of wood or other heavy materials. These would be shipped by professional movers. Since the [[Second World War]] smaller and more lightweight [[suitcase]]s and bags that can be carried by an individual have become the main form of luggage.

==Etymology==
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the word ''baggage'' comes from Old French ''bagage'' (from ''baguer'' "tie up") or from ''bagues'' ("bundles"). It may also be related to the word ''bag''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/baggage&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word ''luggage'' originally meant inconveniently heavy baggage and comes from the verb ''lug'' and the suffix ''-age''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/luggage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of luggage==
[[File:Suitcases-1.jpg|thumb|A set of custom made (bespoke) suitcases.]]
[[File:Carpetbag.jpg|thumb|Carpet bag.]]
* [[Trunk (luggage)|Trunk]] - A wooden box, generally much larger than other kinds of luggage. Trunks come in smaller sizes as in the case of footlockers and larger ones called steamers. These days trunks are more commonly used for storage than transportation. Items large enough to require a trunk are now usually shipped in transport cases. Some of the better known trunk makers are [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Goyard]], [[Moynat]], [[M. M. Secor]] and [[Leatheroid]].
* [[Suitcase]] - A wheeled or non-wheeled luggage, as well as soft or hard side luggage.
* [[Garment bag]] - A style of luggage that folds over on itself to allow long garments such as suits or dresses to be packed flat to avoid creasing. Garment bags come in both wheeled and non-wheeled models, and are usually one of the largest pieces in any set of luggage
* [[Tote bag|Tote]] - A small bag, usually worn on the shoulder
* [[Duffle bag]] - A barrel-shaped bag, almost exclusively soft side, is well suited to casual travel, with little organization inside.
* [[Carpet bag]] - travel luggage traditionally made from carpets.
* [[Packing Cubes]] - Small rectangular bags of different sizes and different colors created to keep the baggage organized and save space
* [[Gate Check Bags]] - Bags specially designed to protect frequent [[gate checking]] items, such as strollers and car seats

==Luggage features==
* Locks - locks serve multiple purposes; a deterrent to dishonest airport workers and locks also help keep baggage closed during handling.  Since 2003 most locks integrated into luggage use the TSA Lock standard developed by [[Travel Sentry]] to allow opening by the US [[Transportation Security Administration]].
* Expandable Luggage - suitcases that can be unzipped to expand for more packing space.

Luggage carriers – light-weight wheeled carts or harnesses on which luggage could be temporarily place or that can be temporarily attached to luggage – date at least to the 1930s, such as in US patent 2,132,316 "Luggage carrier" by Anne W. Newton (filed 1937, published 1938).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.ac/patents/US2132316 US 2,132,316 A]&lt;/ref&gt; These were refined over the following decades, as reflected in patents such as US patent 2,650,105 A "Luggage carriage" (filed 1949, published 1953)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US2650105 US 2,650,105]&lt;/ref&gt; and US patent 2,670,969 "Luggage carriage harness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.ac/patents/US2670969 US 2,670,969 A]&lt;/ref&gt; both by Kent R. Costikyan.&lt;ref&gt;See citations at patents and [http://www.google.ac/patents/US3532355 US 3,532,355] for more.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wheels were ''external'' to the suitcases. Patents were published for wheeled luggage – a wheeled trunk in 1887, and a wheeled suitcase in 1945 – but these were not successfully commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-humble-suitcase-180951376/ |title=The History of the Humble Suitcase |author=Daniel A. Gross |publisher=Smithsonian |date=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful rolling suitcases was invented in 1970, when Bernard D. Sadow applied for a patent that was granted in 1972 as United States patent 3,653,474 for "Rolling Luggage".&lt;ref name=nyt2010/&gt; The patent application cited the increase in air travel, and "baggage handling [having] become perhaps the single biggest difficulty encountered by an air passenger", as background of the invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=t2w3AAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United States patent 3,653,474]&lt;/ref&gt; Sadow's four-wheeled suitcases, pulled using a loose strap, were later surpassed in popularity by suitcases that feature two wheels and are pulled in an upright position using a long handle. These were invented in 1987 by US pilot Robert Plath, and initially sold to crew members. Plath later commercialized them, after travelers became interested after seeing them in use by crew members, and founded the Travelpro company, which marketing the suitcases under the trademark "Rollaboard".&lt;ref name=nyt2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://travelproluggageblog.com/2010/06/luggage/the-history-of-rolling-luggage/

While initially designed for carry-on use (to navigate through a large terminal), as implied by the analogous name, similar designs are also used for [[checked baggage]].

More recently, four-wheeled luggage with [[caster]]s has become popular, notably since their use by [[Samsonite]] in the 2004 version of their signature ''Silhouette'' line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2014/05/30/history-luggage.html |title=The history of luggage |author=Blane Bachelor |date=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are otherwise similar in design to two-wheel roll-aboards, with a vertical orientation and a retracting handle, but are designed to be pushed beside or in front of the traveler, rather than pulled behind them. These are often referred to as "spinner" luggage, since they can spin about their [[vertical axis]].

Sadow attributes the late invention of luggage on wheels to a "macho thing" where "men would not accept suitcases with wheels".&lt;ref name=nyt2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharkey|first1=Joe|title=Reinventing the Suitcase by Adding the Wheel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/business/05road.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others attribute the late invention to "the abundance of luggage porters with carts in the 1960s, the ease of curbside drop-offs at much smaller airports and the heavy iron casters then available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ridely|first1=Matt|title=Don't Look for Inventions Before Their Time|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444100404577643723610334602|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hold luggage==
Some [[vehicle]]s have an area specifically for luggage to be held, called the automobile "trunk" in the United States. Items stored in the hold are known as '''hold luggage'''.  A typical example would be a suitcase.  If travelling by [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] passengers will often be expected to place their own luggage in the hold, before boarding. [[Aeroplane]]s in contrast are loaded by professional [[baggage handler]]s.

==Hand luggage (carry-on)==

{{Main article|Hand luggage}}
Passengers are allowed to carry a limited number of smaller bags with them in the vehicle, these are known as '''hand luggage''' (more commonly referred to as '''carry-on''' in [[North America]]), and contain valuables and items needed during the journey. There is normally storage space provided for hand luggage, either under seating, or in overhead lockers. Trains often have luggage racks at the ends of the [[Railroad car|carriage]] near the doors, or above the seats if there are compartments. There are differing views between North America and Europe in relation to the rules concerning the amount of baggage carried on to aircraft. In North America there is considerable debate as to whether passengers carry too many bags on board and that their weight could be a risk to other passengers and flight safety. US airlines are beginning to introduce weight and size restrictions for carry-on baggage. Whereas in Europe, many airlines, especially low-cost airlines, impose what is commonly known as "the one-bag rule". This is a restriction imposed to stop excessive weight on board and airlines claim that this policy allows them to speed the boarding of the aircraft. Airports in Europe have mounted a campaign with the European Commission in an attempt to overturn these hand luggage regulations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} They claim that it is affecting their duty-free and other airport retail sales and is reducing their revenues.

==Smart luggage==
Smart luggage is baggage that has a built-in or a removable battery within. It often includes features designed to help with travel, including GPS tracking and USB ports to charge electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-travel-briefcase-bluesmart-20180505-story.html| title=Maker of smart luggage goes out of business after airlines ban bags with built-in batteries| date=May 5, 2018| author=Hugo Martin| publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/debbikickham/2018/06/27/popular-luggage-trends-for-2018/#a2e34e07c02c| title=Popular Luggage Trends for 2018| date=June 27, 2018| author=Debbi Kickman| publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bags include a WiFi hotspot and electric wheels for personal transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/smart-luggage-banned-what-is-smart-luggage-10013169| title=Airlines Ban Smart Luggage!

Several smart luggage companies have shut down as a result of a ban which came into effect in January 2018 on smart luggage with non-removable batteries being carried as check-in luggage on flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2018/06/big-brands-go-bust-as-smart-luggage-is-banned-on-major-us-airlines| title=Big brands go bust as smart luggage is banned on major US airlines| date=June 6, 2018| author=Callum Tennent| publisher=Which}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/grantmartin/2018/01/18/airline-smart-luggage-ban-goes-into-effect/#7cc8ae466b64| title=Airline Smart Luggage Ban Goes Into Effect| date=January 18, 2018| author=Grant Martin| publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baggage claim/reclaim==
In airport terminals, a [[baggage claim]] or reclaim area is an area where arriving passengers claim checked-in baggage after disembarking from an airline flight. At most airports and many train stations, baggage is delivered to the passenger on a [[baggage carousel]].

==Left luggage==
{{globalize|section|date=February 2015}}
Left luggage, also luggage storage or bag storage, is a place where one can temporarily store one's luggage so as to not have to carry it. Left luggage is not synonymous with [[lost luggage]]. Often at an airport or train station there may be a staffed 'left luggage counter' or simply a coin-operated or automated locker system. With higher threats of terrorism all around the globe, this type of public storage is disappearing.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Luggage forwarding==
'''Luggage forwarding''', also known as '''luggage shipping''' or '''luggage logistics''', is a type of speciality shipping service that has been available for approximately 10 years and has grown in demand, particularly after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Luggage forwarding is an alternative to checking in baggage during air travel. {{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Military baggage==
Baggage can also refer to the train of people and goods, both military and of a personal nature, which commonly followed pre-modern armies on campaign. The baggage was considered a strategic resource and guarded by a [[rear guard]]. Its loss was considered to weaken and demoralize an army, leading to [[rearguard]] attacks such as that at the [[Battle of Agincourt]].

'''Bruce Charles''' "'''Bill'''" '''Mollison''' (4 May 1928 – 24 September 2016) was an Australian &lt;b&gt;researcher&lt;/b&gt;, author, scientist, teacher and biologist. 

He is referred to as the "father of [[permaculture]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Companion to Tasmanian History|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/M/Bill%20Mollison.htm|work=University of Tasmania, Australia; Library|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Although Joseph Russell Smith is not similarly referred to as the "father" of permaculture, some have offered the disclaimer that Smith, and not Mollison/Holmgren, was the first to write about a system of permanent agriculture in a book entitled ''Tree Crops'', published in 1929, and earlier in 1910, in a book entitled ''Breeding and Use of Tree Crops.'' Others would argue, however, that such a disclaimer is based on a common misunderstanding of permaculture as a specific style of agriculture or gardening, rather than an ecologically-inspired design system. A food forest certainly can be one outcome of a permaculture design process, but so can an organic backyard garden. From the Wikipedia article on permaculture: "a system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems."&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture (a [[portmanteau]] of "permanent agriculture")&lt;ref name="movementgrows"&gt;Tortorello, Michael (27 July 2011) {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/garden/permaculture-emerges-from-the-underground.html|title=The Permaculture Movement Grows From Underground|date=|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an integrated system of ecological and environmental design which Mollison co-developed with [[David Holmgren]], and which they together envisioned as a perennial and sustainable form of agriculture. In 1974, Mollison began his collaboration with Holmgren, and in 1978 they published their book ''Permaculture One'', which introduced this design system to the general public. 

Mollison founded The Permaculture Institute in Tasmania, and created the education system to train others under the umbrella of permaculture.&lt;ref name="robynfrancis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://permaculture.com.au/bill-mollison-giant-tree-fallen-forest-humanity/ | title=Bill Mollison – a giant tree has fallen in the forest of humanity | publisher=Permaculture College of Australia - Djangbung Gardens | date=30 September 2016 | author=Francis, Robyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;I.e., many of the more prominent teachers are listed in the "See also" section of this article, but includes many others without Wikipedia articles such as April Sampson-Kelly who created the first on-line system called, Permaculturevisions Online Institute in 1993, via permaculturevisions.com.&lt;/ref&gt; This education system of "train the trainer", utilized through a formal Permaculture Design Course and Certification (PDC), has taught thousands of people throughout the world how to grow food and be sustainable using permaculture design principles. In 1981 he was awarded with the Right Livelihood Award (also known as "Alternative Nobelprize") for his accomplishments in the field of permaculture. 

==Life and work==
===Biography===
Bruce Charles "Bill" Mollison was born in 1928, in the [[Bass Strait]] fishing village of  [[Stanley, Tasmania|Stanley]] located on the north-west part of [[Tasmania]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.echo.net.au/2016/09/permaculture-design-leader-bill-mollison-dies/ | title=Permaculture-design leader Bill Mollison dies | publisher=Echo Netdaily | date=26 September 2016 | accessdate=29 September 2016 | author=Felix, Luis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved from Tasmania to [[Tyalgum]] in the [[Tweed Valley]] of northern [[New South Wales]] in 1987 where he lived for the next decade before returning to Tasmania.&lt;ref name="robynfrancis"/&gt; He spent his final years in [[Sisters Beach, Tasmania|Sisters Beach]] in north-west Tasmania.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt; He died in Hobart, Tasmania, in 2016, aged 88. He is survived by his fifth wife Lisa, four daughters, and two sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://permaculturenews.org/2016/09/25/bill-mollison/ | title="With deep sorrow, we wish to inform family and friends that Bruce Charles “Bill” Mollison, the “Father of Permaculture,” has passed away." | publisher=The Permaculture Research Institute | date=25 September 2016 | accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/10/bill-mollison-obituary | title=Bill Mollison obituary: Ecologist and one of the co-creators of permaculture | publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media Ltd. | work=The Guardian | date=10 October 2016 | accessdate=12 October 2016 | author=Dunwell, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Mollison left school at age 15 to help run the family bakery. In the following ten years he worked as a shark fisherman, seaman, forester, mill worker, trapper, snarer, tractor-driver and naturalist.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;O'Connor, Ted (26 September 2016) {{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-26/tributes-flow-in-for-permaculture-father-bill-mollison/7878118|title='You started a quiet revolution': Tributes flow for permaculture 'father' Bill Mollison|date=|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, at the age of 26, Mollison joined and worked for the 'Wildlife Survey Section' of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO).&lt;ref name="grahambell"/&gt; In the 1960s, he worked as a curator at the Tasmanian Museum. He also worked with the Inland Fisheries Commission, where he was able to resume his field work. In 1966, he entered the University of Tasmania. After he received his degree in bio-geography, he stayed on to lecture and teach, and developed the unit of Environmental Psychology.&lt;ref name="grahambell"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://grahambell.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bill-Mollison-Obituary-25.9.16.pdf | title=Bill Mollison Obituary | publisher=grahambell.org | date=26 September 2016 | accessdate=29 September 2016 | author=Bell. Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from teaching in 1979.&lt;ref name="Preface to IP"/&gt;

===Development of permaculture===
Mollison's work with the CSIRO laid the foundation for his life-long passion: Permaculture.&lt;ref name="grahambell"/&gt; Mollison told his student [[Toby Hemenway]] that the original idea for permaculture came to him in 1959 while he was observing marsupials browsing in the Tasmanian rain forests, because he was "inspired and awed by the life-giving abundance and rich interconnectedness of this eco-system."&lt;ref name="gaisgarden"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture (2nd ed.) | publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing | author=Hemenway, Toby | year=2009 | pages=5 | isbn=978-1603580298}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that moment, Mollison jotted down the following words in his diary: "I believe that we could build systems that would function as well as this one does."&lt;ref name="gaisgarden"/&gt; By the late 1960s, he started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of Tasmania. This resulted from his own personal observations of the growth and use of the industrial-agricultural methods that he believed had rapidly degraded the soil of his native state.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Raver, Anne (13 February 2013) {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/garden/a-permaculture-love-story.html|title=Their Trip to Bountiful|date=|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, these same methods posed a danger because they were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing [[biodiversity]], and removing billions of tons of [[topsoil]] from previously fertile landscapes.&lt;ref name="Preface to IP"&gt;''Introduction to Permaculture'', 2011, Mollison, p.v&lt;/ref&gt; Writes Mollison:
{{quote|After many years as a scientist with the CSIRO Wildlife Survey Section and with the Tasmanian Inland Fisheries Department, I began to protest against the political and industrial systems I saw were killing us and the world around us. But I soon decided that it was no good persisting with opposition that in the end achieved nothing. I withdrew from society for two years; I did not want to oppose anything ever again and waste time. I wanted to come back only with something very positive, something that would allow us all to exist without the wholesale collapse of biological systems.&lt;ref name="Preface to IP"/&gt;}}

In 1974, he and his [[University of Tasmania]] student David Holmgren "jointly evolved a framework for a sustainable agricultural system based on a multi-crop of perennial trees, shrubs, herbs (vegetables and weeds), fungi, and root systems" for which they coined the word "permaculture".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; 

Soon after permaculture was first introduced and then put into practice by the public, Mollison recognized that permaculture principles encompassed a movement that included not only agriculture, horticulture, architecture, and ecology, but also economic systems, land access strategies, and legal systems for businesses and communities:
{{quote|As I saw permaculture in the 1970s, it was a beneficial assembly of plants and animals in relation to human settlements, mostly aimed towards household and community self-reliance, and perhaps as a "commercial endeavor" only arising from a surplus from that system. However, permaculture has come to mean more than just food-sufficiency in the household. Self-reliance in food is meaningless unless people have access to land, information, and financial resources. So in recent years it has come to encompass appropriate legal and financial strategies, including strategies for land access, business structures, and regional self-financing. This way it is a whole human system.&lt;ref name="Preface to IP"/&gt;}}

He helped found the first Permaculture Institute, established in 1979 to "teach the practical design of sustainable soil, water, plant, and legal and economic systems to students worldwide." In 1981, the first graduates of the permaculture design course (PDC) that he had helped to initiate, started to design permaculture systems in their respective communities.&lt;ref name="Preface to IP"/&gt; In this way, the philosophy of permaculture had begun to move beyond its original context in "land management" to cover most, if not all, aspects of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jul/19/communities.guardiansocietysupplement2 | title=The permaculture club | publisher=The Guardian | date=18 July 2006 | accessdate=29 September 2016 | author=Hodgson, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Mollison taught the first PDC course that was offered in [[India]].&lt;ref name="robynfrancis"/&gt; By 2011 there had been over 300,000 such graduates practicing and teaching throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://permacultureglobal.org/projects | title=Worldwide Permaculture Projects A growing list of permaculture projects worldwide | publisher=Permaculture Research Institute | date=2016 | accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2042">'''Broadcast and Multicast Service (BCMCS)''' is an interface for providing [[broadcast]] and [[multicast]] services in [[3GPP2]] [[CDMA|CDMA2000]] [[Mobile computing|mobile]] [[computer network|networks]]. BCMCS can be used to transfer light [[video]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] [[Video clip|clips]] or other [[data]] to a large group of mobile [[subscriber]]s in an efficient manner. To do so, BCMCS is a so-called [[point-to-multipoint]] [[Service (systems architecture)|service]]. This means that multiple users receive the same [[information]] using the same [[radio]] [[resources]]. 

== Usage of BCMCS ==
BCMCS can be used for two different kind of services. [[Broadcast]] services in which all users within the [[broadcasting]] area can receive the same [[information]] and a [[multicast]] [[Service (systems architecture)|services]] in which only users that have [[Subscription|subscribed]] to the service can receive the [[information]] 
Although BCMCS can be used for [[mobile TV]], it has some limitations in the capacity that can be used for this kind of services within the network. 

== Enhanced Broadcast and Multicast Services ==
EBCMCS is an enhanced version of BCMCS. EBCMCS uses a new [[radio]] interface based on [[OFDM]] to [[combat]] problems with [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] ([[Multipath propagation|multipath]]) in the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]].

'''Chassis Management Controller''' (also known as a CMC) is an embedded system management hardware and software solution to manage multiple servers, networking, and storage.

Chassis Management Controllers provide a secure browser-based interface that enables an [[Information technology|Information Technology]] [[system administrator]] to take inventory, perform configuration and monitoring tasks, remotely power on/off [[blade server]]s, enable alerts for events on servers, as well as components in the blade chassis. It has its own [[microprocessor]] and [[Memory (Computer)|memory]] and powered by the modular chassis it is plugged into. The discovery is built-in and a Chassis Management Controller has a dedicated internal network. The blade enclosure, which can hold multiple blade servers, provides power, cooling, various interconnects and additional systems management capabilities. Unlike a [[Industrial PC|tower]] or [[Server rack|rack server]], a [[blade server]] cannot run by itself; it requires a compatible [[blade enclosure]].

The '''Chumby''' is a [[consumer electronics]] product formerly made by '''Chumby Industries, Inc.''' It is an [[embedded computer]] which provides [[Internet]] and [[LAN]] access via a [[Wi-Fi]] connection. Through this connection, the Chumby runs various software [[GUI widget|widgets]]. In 2010 [[Sony]] introduced a single product based on an offshoot version of Chumby, the [[Sony Dash]].

==Devices==
Roughly resembling a small [[clock radio]], the original Chumby features a small resistive [[touch-screen]] housed in a leather and plastic exterior with six color options. Power to the original Chumby and the Chumby 8 is supplied through an AC adapter. A later model, the Chumby One, also offered the option of a 9v backup battery. Related devices, the Infocast 3.5 and Infocast 8, devices manufactured by Best Buy based on the Chumby software, are also only AC powered. The device is designed to be customizable by users:&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Walker|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after agreeing to the Chumby HDK License, users may download schematics and other hardware information.&lt;ref name=license/&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine named Chumby one of its top gadgets for 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/multimedia/2008/12/YE8_gadgets?slide=7&amp;slideView=3|title=The Top Gadgets of 2008|last=Dumas|first=Daniel|author2=Charlie Sorrell|date=2008-12-22|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its software is mostly open source, running on [[Linux]].

In 2012, Chumby ceased operation and was liquidated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.chumby.com/viewtopic.php?id=9710|author=duane maxwell|title=Chumby news|publisher=blue octy}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with the assets being purchased by Duane Maxwell, the former Chief Technology Officer of Chumby Industries, who formed Blue Octy, LLC. The server needed to keep the devices running were kept online as a full service by Blue Octy. LLC until March 2013. At that point, the server went offline and  all devices only displayed a single widget, referred to as the "Space Clock." Blue Octy, LLC relaunched the full Chumby service on July 1, 2014 as a paid subscription service, currently charging $3 USD per month. An open source firmware is available for free that allows existing devices some of the functionality of the paid service at no cost.&lt;ref name="offline firmware"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sf.net/projects/zurk/files/|title=offline firmware|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices without a subscription still receive the Space Clock widget.

==History==
[[Andrew Huang (hacker)|Andrew "bunnie" Huang]] was the lead hardware engineer at Chumby.
The Chumby premiered on August 25, 2006 at [[Foo Camp]] and was released to around 100 alpha release testers at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/06/23/chumby-one-year-later/
|title=Chumby: One Year Later|accessdate=2008-03-11
|author=Michael Arrington|date=2007-06-23|publisher=Tech Crunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foo-camp"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://chumby.wordpress.com/2006/08/29/why-we-gave-away-chumbys-at-foo-camp/
|title=Why we gave away chumbys at FOO Camp|accessdate=2008-03-11|date=2006-08-26
|publisher=chumblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Foo Camp, Chumby announced a free offer, where applicants would receive the same alpha-level Chumby as those previously given away. Applicants submitted ideas for software applications or hardware modifications. One of the goals for the free offer was to have Chumbys in the hands of developers who were willing to begin building applications.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Free chumbys available (soon). "Widgetoons" wanted!|accessdate=2008-03-12|date=2006-09-13
|publisher=chumblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, a ''First 50'' was released to 50 random applicants, who received the next generation of Chumbys.&lt;ref name="first 50"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://chumby.wordpress.com/2007/07/29/chumbys-first-50-program/
|title=Chumby’s "First 50″ Program|accessdate=2008-03-12|date=2007-06-29
|publisher=chumblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed, in September, with an ''Insiders Release''. Interested parties could send e-mail to Chumby requesting release information, and were given the opportunity to join in the ''Insiders Release''.&lt;ref name="insiders release"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://chumby.wordpress.com/2007/09/11/chumbys-insiders-launch/
|title=Chumby’s "Insider’s Release"|accessdate=2008-03-12|date=2007-09-11
|publisher=chumblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in February 2008, the commercial release was made public on the Chumby Store.&lt;ref name="public release"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://chumby.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/chumby-launches-to-the-public-today/
|title=Chumby launches to the public today|accessdate=2008-03-12|date=2008-02-25
|publisher=chumblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2008, the price was $179.95&lt;ref name="chumby store"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.chumby.com/|title=chumby store|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; for any one of three colors, latte, basic black, and pearl. In Japan, Chumby was available through Zyyx, Inc. as www.chumby.jp since October 23, 2008. In Australia, the Chumby was available through ISP [[Internode Systems|Internode]].

In November 2009 the Chumby One was released: a similar, all-plastic version of the original in white with blue trim. The major difference was the hard plastic case replacing the soft leather. Other changes include a slightly faster processor, only one USB port on the rear of the device, and inclusion of an FM tuner and physical volume knob. The hard plastic case allowed Chumby Industries to offer the Chumby One at a reduced price of $119.95.

In April 2012, Chumby announced the cessation of hardware sales, having ceased manufacture of their own hardware the previous year and exhausted their inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murph |first=Darren |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/04/19/chumby-halts-hardware-sales-out-of-business/ |title=Chumby halts hardware sales, long-term support looking mighty unlikely |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2012-04-19 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20 it was confirmed that the company itself was being broken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nilay Patel |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/20/2963003/chumby-broken-up-employees-at-technicolor-technology-sold |title=Chumby no more: employees at Technicolor, technology waiting to be sold |publisher=The Verge |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/04/20/chumby-kaput/ |title=Chumby calls it quits after tricky move from hardware to software |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated fans managed to keep the service running for a period following the company's demise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Welch |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/14/3875198/chumby-platform-could-die-in-february-as-funding-dries-up |title=Chumby platform could die in February as funding for open source project dries up |publisher=The Verge |date=2013-01-14 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 20 February 2013 Chumby shut down its servers, leaving users with a simple clock that shows time, calendar, and date. A brief message appears on the Chumby Web site, explaining the suspension of service. Alternative open source firmware prepared for such an eventuality became available at this point. 

{{As of|January 2013}}, Blue Octy was in the process of reviving the chumby technology, with one of the original chumby developers working on the project.  Visiting www.chumby.com shows details.

Towards the end of March 2014, Blue Octy began beta testing the soon to be revived chumby service.

On July 1, 2014, Blue Octy relaunched the chumby service as a sustainable, subscription based platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/remember-chumby-cute-touchscreen-gadget-returns-from-the-dead|title=Remember Chumby?

In July 2017, Blue Octy and Chumby undertook an effort to rescue the Sony Dash after Sony discontinued support for it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.chumby.com/viewforum.php?id=19|author=duane maxwell|title=Dash news|publisher=blue octy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Blue Octy and Chumby released a patch for the Sony Dash HID-C10 models to allow them to connect to the Chumby servers, thus extending their useful life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.chumby.com/viewtopic.php?id=9843|author=duane maxwell|title=Dash news|publisher=blue octy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hacks ====
[[Hacker (hobbyist)|Hack]]ing the Chumby hardware was encouraged by the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wiki.chumby.com/mediawiki/index.php/Hacking_hardware_for_chumby | title=Hacking hardware for chumby | accessdate=2008-06-08 | publisher=Chumby Industries, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schematics and other hardware information may be downloaded after the user agrees to the Chumby HDK License.&lt;ref name=license&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chumby.com/developers/agreement | title=Chumby HDK License Agreement | accessdate=2008-06-08 | publisher=Chumby Industries, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, users on the Chumby Forums have experimented with and documented some battery hacks, allowing the Chumby to be operated without AC power for short periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forum.chumby.com/viewtopic.php?id=1402| accessdate=2008-06-08 | date=2007-12-31 | title=Please clarify 9 Volt issue | publisher=Chumby Industries, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forum.chumby.com/viewtopic.php?id=2452 | accessdate=2008-06-08 | date=2008-05-20 | title=DIY 5 hour battery pack-$25 | publisher=Chumby Industries, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exists a Chumby Hacker Board that mostly resembles a Chumby One motherboard. There are some differences to hardware connectivity. Chumby Industries did not officially support the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladyada.net/learn/chumby/ |title=Sensor tutorials |publisher=Ladyada.net |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.chumby.com/viewtopic.php?pid=34841#p34841 |title=Chumby One vs. Chumby Hacker Board? (Page 1) — Chumby Hacker/OEM boards — chumbysphere forum |publisher=Forum.chumby.com |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
[[Image:Chumby in hand.jpg|thumb|A Chumby being held and displaying a [[Google News]] story]]
Chumby units run a modified [[Linux kernel]]. The software originally installed on the device was designed to play a set of user-customizable widgets, small [[Adobe Flash]] animations that deliver real-time information. This is possible, because an embedded version of [[Adobe Flash Player]] is installed. The animations have the ability to control and interact with the low-level hardware, thereby enabling functionality such as smart alarm clocks that bring the hardware out of sleep, a Web-based picture viewer, a Web-based camera, online [[RSS]] feeds, and physical user interface features, such as gesture recognition by squeezing the soft housing.

The software for the Chumby automatically updated when something new became available. The updates came from the free access to the Chumby network, and a modified [[BitTorrent client]] was used to upgrade the [[open-source license|open-source]] portions of its [[firmware]].

====Multimedia limitations====
Although the prototypes did not support video playback,&lt;ref name="katamari"&gt;{{cite web

A '''Dalén light''' is a [[light]] produced from burning of [[carbide gas]] (acetylene), combined with a solar sensor which automatically operates the light only during darkness.

==Overview==
The technology was the predominant form of light source in [[lighthouses]] from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant. The system was invented by [[Gustaf Dalén]] and marketed by his company [[AGA AB|AGA]]. Dalén later invented the [[AGA cooker]] in 1922. The Dalén light is notable because of its  [[sun valve]] (a.k.a. solar valve), which earned its inventor the [[Nobel prize in physics]]. The [[Carbide lamp]] was developed in the early 1900s. While the lamps proved useful in many applications, the problem of safely storing [[acetylene]] meant they needed regular refilling which constrained their use in applications such as lighthouses.

==Examples==
Lighthouses using Dalén lighting have included:
*[[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|Barrenjoey Lighthouse, New South Wales]] (1932–1972)
*[[Peninsula Point Light]] (1922–1936) [[Upper Peninsula]] [[Michigan]] United States
*[[Point Stephens Light]], [[New South Wales]]  (1922–1960)
*[[Punta Sur|Celarain]] Lighthouse, Mexico (1934 –    )
*[[Skerryvore]] Lighthouse, the [[Hebrides]]  (    –1959)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12186">'''Dark fermentation''' is the [[Fermentative hydrogen production|fermentative]] conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen. It is a complex process manifested by diverse groups of [[bacteria]], involving a series of [[biochemical]] reactions using three steps similar to [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]. Dark fermentation differs from [[photofermentation]] in that it proceeds without the presence of [[light]].

Fermentative/hydrolytic microorganisms hydrolyze complex organic polymers to monomers which are further converted to a mixture of lower-molecular-weight organic acids and alcohols by obligatory producing acidogenic bacteria.

Utilization of [[wastewater]] as a potential substrate for [[biohydrogen]] production has been drawing considerable interest in recent years especially in the dark fermentation process. Industrial wastewater as a fermentative [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production addresses most of the criteria required for substrate selection viz., availability, cost and [[biodegradability]] (Angenent, ''et al.'', 2004; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Chemical wastewater (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2007a,b), cattle wastewater (Tang, ''et al.'', 2008), dairy process wastewater (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'' 2007c, Rai et al. 2012), starch hydrolysate wastewater (Chen, ''et al.'', 2008) and designed synthetic wastewater (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2007a, 2008b) have been reported to produce biohydrogen apart from [[wastewater treatment]] from dark fermentation processes using selectively enriched [[Growth medium|mixed culture]]s under acidophilic conditions. Various wastewaters viz., paper mill wastewater (Idania, ''et al.'', 2005), starch effluent (Zhang, ''et al.'', 2003), food processing wastewater (Shin ''et al.'', 2004, van Ginkel, ''et al.'', 2005), [[Home|domestic]] wastewater (Shin, ''et al.'', 2004, 2008e), rice winery wastewater (Yu ''et al.'', 2002), distillery and molasses based wastewater (Ren, ''et al.'', 2007,  Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2008a), wheat straw wastes (Fan, ''et al.'', 2006) and palm oil mill wastewater (Vijayaraghavan and Ahmed, 2006) have been studied as fermentable substrates for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production along with wastewater treatment. Using wastewater as a fermentable substrate facilitates both wastewater treatment apart from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The efficiency of the dark fermentative H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production process was found to depend on pre-treatment of the mixed consortia used as a [[biocatalyst]], operating pH, and organic loading rate apart from wastewater characteristics (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2007d, 2008c, d, Vijaya Bhaskar, ''et al.'', 2008d).

In spite of its advantages, the main challenge observed with fermentative H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production processes is the relatively low energy conversion efficiency from the organic source. Typical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields range from 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mol of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol of glucose, which results in 80-90% of the initial [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] remaining in the wastewater in the form of various volatile organic acids (VFAs) and solvents, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol. Even under optimal conditions about 60-70% of the original organic matter remains in solution. [[Bioaugmentation]] with selectively enriched [[Acidogenesis|acidogenic]] consortia to enhance H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production was also reported (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'', 2007b). Generation and accumulation of soluble acid metabolites causes a sharp drop in the system pH and inhibits the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production process. Usage of unutilized [[carbon]] sources present in acidogenic process for additional biogas production sustains the practical applicability of the process. One way to utilize/recover the remaining organic matter in a usable form is to produce additional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by terminal integration of [[photo-fermentative]] processes of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (Venkata Mohan, ''et al.'' 2008e, Rai et al. 2012) and methane by integrating acidogenic processes to terminal [[methanogenic]] processes.

'''Digital cinematography''' is the process of capturing (recording) a [[film|motion picture]] using [[digital image sensor]]s rather than through [[film stock]]. As digital technology has improved in recent years, this practice has become dominant. Since the mid-2010s, most of the movies across the world are captured as well as [[Digital cinema|distributed]] digitally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qubecinema.com/events/news/2013/qube-cinema-supports-cinecolor-its-transition-digital-cinema-latin-america|title=Qube Cinema Supports Cinecolor in Its Transition to Digital Cinema in Latin America|work=qubecinema.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/how-digital-conversion-is-killing-independent-movie-theaters-20130904|title=How Digital Conversion Is Killing Independent Movie Theaters|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital |title=Studios Abandon Film, Small Theaters Struggle -- And Ther - Indiewire |author=Michael Hurley |date=2 January 2014 |work=Indiewire |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064107/http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital |archivedate=2016-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many vendors have brought products to market, including traditional film camera vendors like [[Arri]] and [[Panavision]], as well as new vendors like [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED]], [[Blackmagic Design|Blackmagic]], [[Silicon Imaging]], [[Vision Research Phantom|Vision Research]] and companies which have traditionally focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like [[Sony]], [[GoPro]], and [[Panasonic]].

{{As of|2017}}, professional 4K digital film cameras are approximately equal to 35mm film in their resolution and dynamic range capacity, however, digital film still has a slightly different look to analog film. Some filmmakers still prefer to use analogue picture formats to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film vs. Digital: A Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages|url=http://petapixel.com/2015/05/26/film-vs-digital-a-comparison-of-the-advantages-and-disadvantages/|website=PetaPixel|accessdate=2016-06-28|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning in the late 1980s, Sony began marketing the concept of "electronic cinematography," utilizing its analog Sony HDVS professional video cameras. The effort met with very little success. However, this led to one of the earliest high definition video shot feature movies, ''[[Julia and Julia]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093092/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|title=Julia and Julia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[imdbtitle:0114228|Rainbow]]'' (1996) was the world's first film utilizing extensive digital post production techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Filmmaking: The Changing Art and Craft of Making Motion Pictures|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=1136053549|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shot entirely with Sony's first Solid State Electronic Cinematography cameras and featuring over 35 minutes of digital image processing and visual effects, all post production, sound effects, editing and scoring were completed digitally. The Digital High Definition image was transferred to 35mm negative via electron beam recorder for theatrical release.

The first digitally filmed and post produced feature film was ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169388/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Windhorse]'', shot in Tibet and Nepal in 1996 on a prototype of the digital-beta Sony DVW-700WS and the prosumer Sony DCE-VX1000. The offline editing (avid) and the online post and color work (Roland House / da Vinci) were also all digital. The film, transferred to 35mm negative for theatrical release, won Best U.S. Feature at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1998.

In 1998, with the introduction of [[HDCAM]] recorders and 1920 × 1080 pixel digital professional video cameras based on [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] technology, the idea, now re-branded as "digital cinematography," began to gain traction in the market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Shot and released in 1998, ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'' is believed by some to be the first feature-length video shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Broadcast is A First: The Making of a Digital Feature http://www.thelastbroadcastmovie.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1999 [[George Lucas]] challenged the supremacy of the movie-making medium of film for the first time by including footage filmed with high-definition digital cameras in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. The digital footage blended seamlessly with the footage shot on film and he announced later that year he would film its sequels entirely on hi-def digital video. Also in 1999, [[digital projectors]] were installed in four theaters for the showing of ''The Phantom Menace''. In June 2000, ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' began principal photography shot entirely using a Sony [[HDW-F900]] camera as Lucas had previously stated. The film was released in May 2002. In May 2001 ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' was also shot in 24 frame-per-second high-definition [[digital video]], partially developed by George Lucas using a Sony HDW-F900 camera,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writework.com/essay/robert-rodriguez-film-once-upon-time-mexico-structural-rev|title=Robert Rodriguez Film Once Upon a Time in Mexico This is a structural review.|publisher=WriteWork|date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; following Robert Rodriguez's introduction to the camera at Lucas' [[Skywalker Ranch]] facility whilst editing the sound for ''[[Spy Kids]]''. Two lesser-known movies, ''[[Vidocq (2001 film)|Vidocq]]'' (2001) and ''[[Russian Ark]]'' (2002), had also been shot with the same camera, the latter notably consisting of a single [[long take]].

Today, cameras from companies like [[Sony]], [[Panasonic]], [[JVC]] and [[Canon (company)|Canon]] offer a variety of choices for shooting high-definition video. At the high-end of the market, there has been an emergence of cameras aimed specifically at the digital cinema market. These cameras from [[Sony]], [[Vision Research Phantom|Vision Research]], [[Arri]], [[Silicon Imaging]], [[Panavision]], [[Grass Valley (company)|Grass Valley]] and [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red]] offer resolution and [[dynamic range]] that exceeds that of traditional video cameras, which are designed for the limited needs of [[broadcast television]].

In 2009, ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' became the first movie shot mainly in digital to be awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconimaging.com/DigitalCinema/News/PR_01_31_09_Slumdog.html|title=Silicon Imaging|work=siliconimaging.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest-grossing movie in the history of cinema, ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', not only was shot on digital cameras as well, but also made the main revenues at the box office no longer by film, but [[digital cinema|digital projection]].

In late 2013, Paramount became the first major studio to distribute movies to theaters in digital format eliminating 35mm film entirely.&lt;ref name=geuss/&gt; ''[[Anchorman 2]]'' was the last Paramount production to include a 35mm film version, while ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' was the first major movie distributed entirely digitally.&lt;ref name=geuss&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/anchorman-2-was-paramounts-final-release-on-35mm-film/ |title=Anchorman 2 was Paramount’s final release on 35mm film |work=Ars Technica (via Los Angeles Times) |author=Megan Geuss |date=January 18, 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Digital cinematography captures motion pictures digitally in a process analogous to [[digital photography]]. While there is no clear technical distinction that separates the images captured in digital cinematography from [[video]], the term "digital cinematography" is usually applied only in cases where digital acquisition is substituted for film acquisition, such as when shooting a [[feature film]]. The term is seldom applied when digital acquisition is substituted for video acquisition, as with [[live television|live broadcast]] television programs.

===Recording===

====Cameras====
{{Main article|Digital movie camera}}
[[File:Arriflex D 21 a.jpg|thumb|left|Arriflex D-21]]
Professional cameras include the Sony CineAlta(F) Series, [[Blackmagic Cinema Camera]], [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED]] ONE, [[Arri]]flex [[Arriflex D-20|D-20]], [[Arriflex D-21|D-21]] and [[Arriflex Alexa|Alexa]], Panavisions Genesis, Silicon Imaging SI-2K, Thomson Viper, [[Vision Research Phantom]], IMAX 3D camera based on two [[Vision Research Phantom]] cores, [[Weisscam]] HS-1 and HS-2, GS Vitec noX, and the Fusion Camera System. Independent filmmakers have also pressed low-cost consumer and prosumer cameras into service for digital filmmaking.

====Sensors====
Digital cinematography cameras capture images using [[CMOS]] or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensors, usually in one of two arrangements.

Single chip cameras designed specifically for the digital cinematography market often use a single sensor (much like [[Digital camera|digital photo cameras]]), with dimensions similar in size to a 16 or 35&amp;nbsp;mm film frame or even (as with the Vision 65) a 65&amp;nbsp;mm film frame. An image can be projected onto a single large sensor exactly the same way it can be projected onto a film frame, so cameras with this design can be made with [[Arri PL|PL]], [[PV mount|PV]] and similar mounts, in order to use the wide range of existing high-end cinematography lenses available. Their large sensors also let these cameras achieve the same shallow [[depth of field]] as 35 or 65&amp;nbsp;mm motion picture film cameras, which many cinematographers consider an essential visual tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal-view.com/talks/discussion/4001/putting-the-full-frame-confusion-to-bed/p1|title=Putting the FULL FRAME confusion to bed – Personal View Talks|publisher=Personal-view.com|date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video formats====
Unlike [[Display resolution#Current standards|other video formats]], which are specified in terms of vertical resolution (for example, [[1080p]], which is 1920×1080 pixels), digital cinema formats are usually specified in terms of horizontal resolution. As a shorthand, these resolutions are often given in "'''''n''K'''" notation, where ''n'' is the multiplier of 1024 such that the horizontal resolution of a corresponding ''full-aperture'', [[digital film|digitized film]] frame is exactly &lt;math&gt;1024n&lt;/math&gt; pixels. Here the "K" has a customary meaning corresponding to the [[binary prefix]] "[[IEC binary prefixes|kibi]]" (ki).

For instance, a 2K image is 2048 pixels wide, and a 4K image is 4096 pixels wide. Vertical resolutions vary with [[aspect ratios]] though; so a 2K image with an [[HDTV]] (16:9) aspect ratio is 2048×1152 pixels, while a 2K image with a [[Standard Definition|SDTV]] or [[Academy ratio]] (4:3) is 2048×1536 pixels, and one with a [[Panavision]] ratio (2.39:1) would be 2048×856 pixels, and so on. Due to the "''n''K" notation not corresponding to specific horizontal resolutions per format a 2K image lacking, for example, the typical [[35mm film]] soundtrack space, is only 1828 pixels wide, with vertical resolutions rescaling accordingly. This led to a plethora of motion-picture related video resolutions, which is quite confusing and often redundant with respect to nowadays few projection standards.

All formats designed for digital cinematography are [[progressive scan]], and capture usually occurs at the same 24 frame per second rate established as the standard for 35mm film. Some films such as ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' have a [[High Frame Rate]] of 48 fps, although in some theatres it was also released in a 24 fps version which many fans of traditional film prefer.

The [[Digital Cinema Initiatives|DCI]] standard for cinema usually relies on a 1.89:1 aspect ratio, thus defining the maximum container size for 4K as 4096×2160 pixels and for 2K as 2048×1080 pixels. When distributed in the form of a Digital Cinema Package (DCP), content is [[letterbox]]ed or [[pillarbox]]ed as appropriate to fit within one of these container formats.

[[Image:Digital cinema formats.svg|center]]
In the early years of digital cinematography, 2K was the most common format for digitally acquired major motion pictures however, as new camera systems gain acceptance, 4K is becoming more prominent. The [[Arri Alexa]] captured a 2.8k image. During 2009 at least two major Hollywood films, [[Knowing (film)|''Knowing'']] and ''[[District 9]]'', were shot in 4K on the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED ONE]] camera, followed by ''[[The Social Network]]'' in 2010. {{As of|2017}}, 4k cameras are now commonplace, with most high-end films being shot at 4k resolution.

===Data storage===
Broadly, two [[workflow]] paradigms are used for data acquisition and storage in digital cinematography.

====Tape-based workflows====
With [[video tape|video-tape]]-based workflow, video is recorded to tape on set. This video is then ingested into a computer running [[non-linear editing]] software, using a [[Video tape recorder|deck]]. Upon ingestion, a digital video stream from tape is converted to computer files. These files can be edited directly or converted to an intermediate format for editing. Then video is output in its final format, possibly to a film recorder for theatrical exhibition, or back to video tape for broadcast use. Original video tapes are kept as an archival medium. The files generated by the non-linear editing application contain the information necessary to retrieve footage from the proper tapes, should the footage stored on the computer's hard disk be lost. With increasing convenience of file-based workflows, the tape-based workflows have become marginal in recent years.

====File-based workflows====
Digital cinematography has mostly shifted towards "tapeless" or "file-based" workflows. This trend has accelerated with increased capacity and reduced cost of non-linear storage solutions such as hard disk drives, optical discs, and solid-state memory. With tapeless workflows digital video is recorded as digital files onto random-access media like optical discs, [[hard disk drives]] or flash memory-based digital "magazines". These files can be easily copied to another storage device, typically to a large [[RAID]] (array of computer disks) connected to an editing system. Once data is copied from the on-set media to the storage array, they are erased and returned to the set for more shooting.

Such RAID arrays, both of "managed" (for example, [[Storage Area Network|SAN]]s and [[Network Attached Storage|NAS]]s) and "unmanaged" (for example, [[Just a Bunch of Disks|JBoD]]s on a single computer workstation), are necessary due to the throughput required for real-time (320 MB/s for 2K @ 24fps) or near-real-time playback in [[post-production]], compared to throughput available from a single, yet fast, hard disk drive. Such requirements are often termed as "on-line" storage. Post-production not requiring real-time playback performances (typically for lettering, subtitling, versioning and other similar visual effects) can be migrated to slightly slower RAID stores.

Short-term archiving, "if ever", is accomplished by moving the digital files into "slower" RAID arrays (still of either managed and unmanaged type, but with lower performances), where playback capability is poor to non-existent (unless via proxy images), but minimal editing and [[metadata]] harvesting still feasible. Such intermediate requirements easily fall into the "mid-line" storage category.

Long-term archiving is accomplished by backing up the digital files from the RAID, using standard practices and equipment for data backup from the [[Information Technology|IT]] industry, often to [[Tape drive|data tapes]] (like [[Linear Tape Open|LTO]]s).

====Chroma subsampling====
{{Main article|Chroma subsampling}}
Most digital cinematography systems further reduce data rate by subsampling color information. Because the human visual system is much more sensitive to luminance than to color, lower resolution color information can be overlaid with higher resolution luma (brightness) information, to create an image that looks very similar to one in which both color and luma information are sampled at full resolution. This scheme may cause pixelation or color bleeding under some circumstances. High quality digital cinematography systems are capable of recording full resolution color data (4:4:4) or [[raw image format|raw sensor data]].

====Intra- vs. Inter-frame compression====
Most compression systems used for acquisition in the digital cinematography world compress footage one frame at a time, as if a video stream is a series of still images. This is called [[intra-frame]] compression. [[Inter frame]] compression systems can further compress data by examining and eliminating redundancy between frames. This leads to higher compression ratios, but displaying a single frame will usually require the playback system to decompress a number of frames from before &amp; after it. In normal playback this is not a problem, as each successive frame is played in order, so the preceding frames have already been decompressed. In editing, however, it is common to jump around to specific frames and to play footage backwards or at different speeds. Because of the need to decompress extra frames in these situations, inter-frame compression can cause performance problems for editing systems. Inter-frame compression is also disadvantageous because the loss of a single frame (say, due to a flaw writing data to a tape) will typically ruin all the frames until the next keyframe occurs. In the case of the [[HDV]] format, for instance, this may result in as many as 6 frames being lost with 720p recording, or 15 with 1080i.&lt;ref&gt;recording [http://www.adamwilt.com/HDV/ adamwilt.com]&lt;/ref&gt; An inter-frame compressed video stream consists of [[group of pictures|groups of pictures]] (GOPs), each of which has only one full frame, and a handful of other frames referring to this frame. If the full frame, called [[I-frame]], is lost due to transmission or media error, none of the [[P-frame]]s or [[B-frame]]s (the referenced images) can be displayed. In this case, the whole GOP is lost.

===Digital distribution===
{{Main article|Digital cinema}}

For theaters with digital projectors, digital films may be distributed digitally, either shipped to theaters on hard drives or sent via the Internet or satellite networks. [[Digital Cinema Initiatives|Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC]], a joint venture of Disney, Fox, MGM, Paramount, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Universal and Warner Bros. Studios, has established standards for digital cinema projection. In July 2005, they released the first version of the Digital Cinema System Specification,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcimovies.com/specification/index.tt2 Digital Cinema System Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; which encompasses 2K and 4K theatrical projection. They also offer compliance testing for exhibitors and equipment suppliers.

Theater owners initially balked at installing digital projection systems because of high cost and concern over increased technical complexity. However new funding models, in which distributors pay a "digital print" fee to theater owners, have helped to alleviate these concerns. Digital projection also offers increased flexibility with respect to showing trailers and pre-show advertisements and allowing theater owners to more easily move films between screens or change how many screens a film is playing on, and the higher quality of digital projection provides a better experience to help attract consumers who can now access high-definition content at home. These factors have resulted in digital projection becoming an increasingly attractive prospect for theater owners, and the pace of adoption has been rapidly increasing.

Since some theaters currently don't have digital projection systems, even if a movie is shot and post-produced digitally, it must be transferred to film if a large theatrical release is planned. Typically, a [[film recorder]] will be used to print digital image data to film, to create a 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[internegative]]. After that the duplication process is identical to that of a traditional negative from a film camera.

==Comparison with film cinematography==
{{Main article|Digital versus film photography}}

===Resolution===
Unlike a digital sensor, a film frame does not have a regular grid of discrete pixels.

Determining resolution in digital acquisition seems straightforward, but it is significantly complicated by the way digital camera sensors work in the real world. This is particularly true in the case of high-end digital cinematography cameras that use a single large [[bayer pattern]] CMOS sensor. A bayer pattern sensor does not sample full RGB data at every point; instead, each pixel is biased toward red, green ''or'' blue, and a full color image is assembled from this checkerboard of color by processing the image through a [[demosaicing]] algorithm. Generally with a bayer pattern sensor, actual resolution will fall somewhere between the "native" value and half this figure, with different [[demosaicing]] algorithms producing different results. Additionally, most digital cameras (both bayer and three-chip designs) employ [[optical low-pass filter]]s to avoid [[aliasing]]; suboptimal antialiasing filtering can further reduce system resolution.

===Grain and noise===
Film has a characteristic [[Film grain|grain]] structure. Different film stocks have different grain.

Digitally acquired footage lacks this grain structure. It has electronic [[Image noise|noise]].

===Digital intermediate workflow and archiving===
The process of using [[digital intermediate]] workflow, where movies are [[Color grading|color graded]] digitally instead of via traditional photochemical finishing techniques, has become common.

In order to utilize digital intermediate workflow with film, the camera negative must first be processed and then scanned to a digital format. Some filmmakers have years of experience achieving their artistic vision using the techniques available in a traditional photochemical workflow, and prefer that finishing/editing process.

Digitally shot movies can be printed, transferred or archived on film. Large scale digital productions are often archived on film, as it provides a safer medium for storage, benefiting insurance and storage costs.&lt;ref name="kodak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Products/Lab_And_Post_Production/Archival_Films/2332.htm |title=KODAK Color Asset Protection Film 2332 |publisher=Motion.kodak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521164844/http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Products/Lab_And_Post_Production/Archival_Films/2332.htm |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the negative does not completely degrade, it will always be possible to recover the images from it in the future, regardless of changes in technology, since all that will be involved is simple photographic reproduction.

In contrast, even if digital data is stored on a medium that will preserve its integrity, highly specialized digital equipment will always be required to reproduce it. Changes in technology may thus render the format unreadable or expensive to recover over time. For this reason, film studios distributing digitally-originated films often make film-based separation masters of them for archival purposes.&lt;ref name="kodak"/&gt;

===Reliability===
Film proponents have argued that digital cameras lack the reliability of film, particularly when filming sequences at high speed or in chaotic environments, due to digital cameras' technical [[glitch]]es. Cinematographer [[Wally Pfister]] noted that for his shoot on the film ''[[Inception]]'', "Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie."&lt;ref name="Kodak"&gt;{{Cite news|title=From The Dark Knight to Inception, Wally Pfister, ASC refuses to compromise |publisher=kodak |url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Products/Customer_Testimonials/Wally_Pfister/index.htm#ixzz2Ti47T2NZ |accessdate=2013-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523095937/http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Products/Customer_Testimonials/Wally_Pfister/index.htm |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Bay]] stated that when filming ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', 35mm cameras had to be used when filming in slow-motion and sequences where the digital cameras were subject to [[strobing]] or electrical damage from dust.&lt;ref name=collider&gt;{{cite web|title=TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON Edit Bay Visit!

==Criticism and concerns==
Some film directors such as [[Christopher Nolan]],&lt;ref name="Nolan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merchan|first=George| url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/christopher-nolan-discusses-why-he-prefers-film-to-digital-his-approach-to-cgi-and-much-more|title=Christopher Nolan talks film vs. digital, his take on CGI, his disinterest in 3D, and much more in insightful DGA interview – Movie News|publisher=JoBlo.com|date=2012-04-15|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7npmu9Ge_OY|title=pta on digital vs. film|publisher=YouTube|date=2006-08-10| accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quentin Tarantino]] have publicly criticized digital cinema, and advocated the use of film and film prints. Tarantino has suggested he may retire because he will no longer be able to have his films projected in 35mm in most American cinemas. Tarantino considers digital cinema to be simply "television in public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published Friday, Nov 30, 2012, 09:34 GMT|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a441960/quentin-tarantino-i-cant-stand-digital-filmmaking-its-tv-in-public.html|title=Quentin Tarantino: 'I can't stand digital filmmaking, it's TV in public' – Movies News|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2012-11-30|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Nolan has speculated that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film: "I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [a production] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo."&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt;

Another concern with digital image capture is how to archive all the digital material. Archiving digital material is turning out to be extremely costly, and it creates issues in terms of long-term preservation. In a 2007 study, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] found that the cost of storing 4K [[digital master]]s is "enormously higher – 1100% higher – than the cost of storing film masters." Furthermore, digital archiving faces challenges due to the insufficient longevity of today's digital storage: no current media, be it magnetic [[hard drive]]s or digital tape, can reliably store a film for a hundred years, something that properly stored and handled film can do.&lt;ref name="digital_dilemma"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Digital Dilemma. Strategic issues in archiving and accessing digital motion picture materials.|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|year=2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this also used to be the case with optical disc, in 2012 Millenniata, Inc. a digital storage company based in Utah, released [[M-DISC]], an optical storage solution, designed to last up to 1,000 years, thus, offering a possibility of digital storage as a viable storage solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdisc.com/what-is-mdisc/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129174722/http://www.mdisc.com/what-is-mdisc/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-29 |title=What is M-Disc™? » The M-DISC™ |publisher=Mdisc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Robin|url=http://www.zdnet.com/the-1000-year-dvd-is-here-7000009771/|title=The 1,000 year DVD is here| publisher=ZDNet|date=2013-01-14|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed assembly allows the accurate control of assembly of micro and nano particles to form even the most intricate and highly functional devices or materials.&lt;ref&gt;Bachand, M., N. F.

== Directed self-assembly ==
Directed self-assembly (DSA) is a type of directed assembly which utilizes block co-polymer morphology to create lines, space and hole patterns, facilitating for a more accurate control of the feature shapes. Then it uses surface interactions as well as polymer thermodynamics to finalize the formation of the final pattern shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Bachand, M., N. F. Bouxsein, S. Cheng, S. J. Von Hoyningen-Huene, M. J. Stevens, and G. D. Bachand. "Directed Self-assembly of 1D Microtubule Nano-arrays." RSC Adv. 4.97 (2014): 54641-4649. Web. 16 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; To control the surface interactions enabling sub-10&amp;nbsp;nm resolution, a team of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Chicago, and Argonne National Laboratory developed a way to use vapor-phase deposited polymeric top layer on the block co-polymer film in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suh|first=Hyo Seon|last2=Kim|first2=Do Han|last3=Moni|first3=Priya|last4=Xiong|first4=Shisheng|last5=Ocola|first5=Leonidas E.|last6=Zaluzec|first6=Nestor J.|last7=Gleason|first7=Karen K.|last8=Nealey|first8=Paul F.|date=July 2017|title=Sub-10-nm patterning via directed self-assembly of block copolymer films with a vapour-phase deposited topcoat|url=https://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v12/n6/abs/nnano.2017.34.html|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|language=en|volume=12|issue=6|pages=575–581|doi=10.1038/nnano.2017.34|issn=1748-3387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSA is not a standalone process, but rather are integrated with traditional manufacturing processes in order to mass-produce micro and nano structures at a lower cost. Directed self-assembly is mostly used in the semiconductor and hard drive industries. Semiconductors industries uses this assembly method in order to be able increase the resolution (trying to fit in more gates), while the hard drive industry uses DSA to manufacture “bit patterned media” according to the specified storage densities.&lt;ref&gt;"The Promise of DSA Technology for Nanoscale Manufacturing."

== Micro-structures ==
There are many applications of directed assembly in the micro-scale, from tissue engineering to polymer thin-films. In tissue engineering, directed assembly have been able to replace scaffolding approach of building tissues. This happens by controlling the position and organisation of different cells, which are the “building-blocks” of the tissue, into different desired micro-structures. This eliminates the error of not being able to reproduce the same tissue, which is a major issue in the scaffolding approach.&lt;ref&gt;Kachouie, Nezamoddin N et al. “Directed Assembly of Cell-Laden Hydrogels for Engineering Functional Tissues.” Organogenesis 6.4 (2010): 234–244. PMC. Web. 15 Feb. 2016.�&lt;/ref&gt;

Nano-imprint lithography is a popular method to fabricate nano-meter scale pattern. The patterns are made by mechanical deformation of imprint resist (monomer or polymer formulation) and subsequent processes. Then, it is cured by heat or ultraviolet light, and tight level of the resist and template is controlled at appropriate conditions depend on our purposes. In addition, nano-imprint [[lithography]] has high resolution and throughput with low cost.&lt;ref&gt;Writer, Public .. "Nanoimprint Lithography." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Feb.-Mar. 2011. Web. 17 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Disadvantages include increased time for templating procedures, a lack of standard procedures results in multiple fabrication methods, and the patterns that are able to be formed are limited.

With the goal of mitigating these advantages while applying nanotechnology to electronics, researchers at the [[National Science Foundation]]’s Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center for High-Rate Nanomanufacturing (CHN) at [[Northeastern University]] with partners [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|UMass Lowell]] and [[University of New Hampshire]] have developed a directed assembly process of single-walled carbon nano tube (SWNT) networks to create a circuit template that can be transfer from one substrate to another.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Dexter. "High-rate, Directed Assembly of Nanostructures Promises Big Changes in Electronics." N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-assembled monolayers on solid substrates ==
[[Self-assembled monolayer]]s (SAMs) are made of a layer of organic molecules which forms naturally as an ordered lattice on the surface of a desired substrate. Their molecules in the lattice have connections chemically at one end (head group), while the other end (end group) creates the exposed surface of the SAM.

Many types of SAMs can be formed. For example: [[thiol]]s form SAMs on gold, silver, copper, or on some compound semiconductors such as [[Indium phosphide|InP]] and [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]]. By changing the tail group of the molecules, different surface properties can be obtained; therefore SAMs can be used to render surfaces hydrophobic or hydrophilic as well as change surface states of semiconductor. With [[self-assembly]], positioning of SAMs is used to define chemical system precisely to find the target location in a molecular-inorganic device. With this characteristic, SAMs is a good candidates for molecular electronic devices such as use SAMs to build electronic devices and maybe the circuits is an intriguing prospect. Because of their ability to provide the basis for very high-density data storage and high-speed devices.&lt;ref&gt;Babak Amir Parviz, “Using Self-Assembly for the Fabrication of Nano-Scale Electronic and Photonic Devices”, Web- August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acoustic methods ===
Directed assembly using the acoustic methods manipulate waves in order to allow non-invasive assembling of micro and nano structures. Due to this, acoustics are especially widely used in the biomedical industry to manipulate droplets, cells and other molecules.

Acoustic waves are generated by a [[piezoelectric transducer]] controlled from the pulse generator. These waves are able to then manipulate droplets of liquid and move them together, in order to form a packed assembly. Moreover, the frequency and amplitude of the waves can be modified in order to achieve a more accurate control of the particular behavior of the droplet or cell.&lt;ref&gt;F. Xu, T. D. Finley, M. Turkaydin, Y. Sung, U. A. Gurkan, A. S. Yavuz, R. O. Guldiken, U. Demirici. “The assembly of cell-encapsulating microscale hydrogels using acoustic waves.” Biomaterials 32.31 (2011): 7847-7855. ScienceDirect. Web. 16 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical methods ===
Directed assembly or more specifically directed self-assembly, can produce a high pattern resolution (~10&amp;nbsp;nm) with high efficiency and compatibility. However, when using DSA in high volume manufacturing, one must have a way to quantify the degree of order of line/space patterns formed by DSA in order to reduce defect.&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, Dhairya J. “Optical Metrology for Directed Self-assembly Patterning Using Mueller Matrix Spectroscopic Ellipsometry Based Scatterometry.” ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global (2015): 3718824. ProQuest. Web. 3 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normal approach such as critical dimension-[[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (CD-SEM) to obtain data for pattern quality inspection takes too much time and is also labor-intensive. On the other hand, the optical scatterometer-based metrology is a non-invasive technique and has very high throughput due to its larger spot size. These results in the collection of more statistical data than by using SEM, and that data processing is also automated with the optical technique making it more feasible than traditional CD-SEM.&lt;ref&gt;Van Look, L., Rincon Delgadillo, P., Yu-tsung Lee, Pollentier, I., Gronheid, R., Yi Cao, Guanyang Lin, Nealey, P.F. “High Throughput Grating Qualification of Directed Self-Assembly Patterns using Optical Metrology.” Microelectronic Engineering 123 (2014): 175-179. ScienceDirect. Web. 3 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetic methods ===
Magnetic field directed self-assembly (MFDSA) allows the manipulation of dispersion and subsequent assembly of magnetic nanoparticles. This is widely used in the development of advanced materials whereby inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) are dispersed in polymers, in order to enhance the properties of the materials.

The magnetic field technique allows the assembling of particles in 3D by doing the assembly in a dilute suspension where the solvent does not evaporate. It also does not need to use a template, and the approach also improve the magnetic anisotropy along the chain direction.&lt;ref&gt;Krommenhoek, Peter John. “Magnetic Field-Directed Self-Assembly of Magnetic Nanoparticle Chains in Polymers.” ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global (2013): 3690306. ProQuest. Web. 3 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dielectrophoretic methods ===
Dielectrophoretic directed self-assembly utilizes an electric field that controls metal particles, such as [[gold nanorods]], by inducing a dipole in the particles. By varying the polarity and strength of the electric field, the polarized particles are either attracted to positive regions or repelled from negative regions where the electric field has higher strength. This direct manipulation method transports the particles to position and orient them into a nano-structure on a receptor substrate.&lt;ref&gt;Pescaglini, A., U. Emanuele, A. O’Riordan, and Daniela Iacopino. "Dielectrophoretic Self-Assembly of Au Nanorods for Sensing Applications." Iopscience.iop.org. IOP Publishing, 4 Mar. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquarters of DuPont Pioneer are located in [[Johnston, Iowa]], with additional offices around the world. Pioneer produces, markets and sells hybrid seed corn in nearly 70 countries worldwide.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The company also markets and sells hybrids or improved {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} varieties of [[sorghum]], [[sunflower]], [[soybean]], [[alfalfa]], [[canola]], [[rice]] and [[wheat]], as well as [[Fodder|forage]] and grain additives. Worldwide, Pioneer sells products through a variety of organizations, including wholly owned subsidiaries( Curry Seed, NuTech Seed, Hoegemeyer Hybrids, Doeblers Seed, Seed Consultants Inc, Terral Seeds, AgVenture Inc) joint ventures, sales representatives, and independent dealers (Burrus Hybrids, Beck's Superior Hybrids).

Pioneer makes and sells [[hybrid seed]] and [[Genetically modified plant|genetically modified seed]], some of which goes on to become [[genetically modified food]].  Genes engineered into their products include the LibertyLink gene, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects;  the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.  In 2010 Dupont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75%".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmchemicalsinternational.com/article/14999/us-approves-dupont-plenish-soybeans US Approves DuPont Plenish Soybeans - Farm Chemicals International Website - Farm Chemicals International - Article]. Farm Chemicals International (2010-06-08). Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cen.acs.org/articles/90/i11/Replacing-Trans-Fat.html Replacing Trans Fat | March 12, 2012 Issue - Vol. 90 Issue 11 | Chemical &amp; Engineering News].

A lawsuit was filed in 2011 by 150 residents of Waimea, Kauai against Pioneer. The 58-page lawsuit alleges that Pioneer's practices in the farming of genetically modified seed crops on fields next to Waimea unlawfully allowed pesticides and pesticide-laden [[fugitive dust]] to blow into residents’ homes on almost a daily basis for more than 10 years.&lt;ref name="thegardenisland1"/&gt;

'''Elastic interface buses''', abbreviated as '''EI bus connections''', can be generalized as [[bus (computer)|bus connections]] which are high speed interfaces that send [[clock signal]]s with data. 

==Description==
The data bits that are sent through EI bus connections are aligned to the clock so that they latch to the data at the high speeds. EI bus connections require that the [[Topology|net topology]] and timing characteristics for each [[Net (mathematics)|net]] on the bus are at least similar to each other in order to make lining up the edges of the data to the clock signals possible. In this environment, re-working connections in the connection module was not easily possible because all nets needed to have similar topology and timing characteristics. This increased the difficulty of a re-work solution or made it impossible and increased the [[Multi-Chip Module|modules]] that needed to be scrapped as unusable.

==Repair==
Elastic Interface repair involves a spare wire that is built into the bus interface in the connection module that has the same topology and characteristics of the rest of the nets in the bus. It includes hardware that is able to switch from the bad net in the interface to the spare net (as of now, this operation must be supported by the original manufacturer of the EI bus connector). The connection module is tested at several different process corners such as low and high temperature and low and high voltages. When a net on the interface is known to be bad, the spare net is used on the bus for testing and the bad net is not tested. When the bus does not have a defect, the spare net is tested with the functional nets. In the original design specification for the EI spare, the wire was driven with a constant zero when not used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peertopatent.org/patent/20080082878/activity [[Peer to Patent]] activity on US Pre-Grant [[Patent]] Publication Number: US20080082878 “System and method to support use of bus spare wires in connection modules” July 20, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
* [[IBM]], inventor of the elastic interface bus, uses it in many high end processors:
**Elastic Interface (EI-1): [[POWER4]], [[PowerPC 970]] and [[IBM System z|Z900]]
**Elastic Interface 2 (EI-2): [[POWER5]] and [[IBM System z9|Z9]]
**Elastic Interface 3 (EI-3): [[POWER6]], [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|Z10]], [[POWER7]], [[IBM A2|PowerEN]]

FICO was founded in 1956 as Fair, Isaac and Company by engineer [[Bill Fair|William Fair]] and mathematician [[Earl Isaac]].&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-02-06/credit-scores-not-so-magic-numbers|title=Credit Scores: Not-So-Magic Numbers|date=2008-02-06|author=Dean Foust|author2=Aaron Pressman|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two met while working at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref name="startribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/185665572.html|title=Fair Isaac moving its HQ back to California|date=2013-01-04|author=Jennifer Bjorhus|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selling its first credit scoring system two years after the company's creation,&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.fico.com/en/Company/Pages/history.aspx History] FICO Official Site&lt;/ref&gt; FICO pitched its system to fifty American [[creditor|lenders]].&lt;ref name="marketplace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/your-money/how-i-learned-stop-worrying/brief-history-credit-score|title=A brief history of the credit score|date=2014-04-22|author=Adriene Hill|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FICO went [[public company|public]] in 1986 and is traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=businessweek/&gt; The company debuted its first general-purpose FICO score in 1989.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; FICO scores are based on credit reports and "base" FICO scores range from 300 to 850,&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; while industry-specific scores range from 250 to 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfico.com/credit-education/credit-report-credit-score-articles/ |title=What is a FICO score? |website=MyFICO.com official website |publisher=Fair Isaac Corporation |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''French Aerostatic Corps''' or '''Company of Aeronauts''' ({{lang-fr|compagnie d'aérostiers}}) was the world's first [[air force]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Beadle]] and Ian Harrison, ''First, Lasts &amp; Onlys: Military'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1794 to use [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], primarily for [[reconnaissance]].

==Experimentation==
[[File:Jean-Marie-Joseph Coutelle.jpg|thumb|right|Coutelle in 1794.]]
Numerous suggestions had been made for the use of balloons during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and in 1793 the [[Committee of Public Safety]] began testing their potential.  Initial tests of [[airship]] designs proved unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="haydon"&gt;F. Stansbury Haydon, ''Military Ballooning During the Early Civil War'', pp.5-15&lt;/ref&gt;  However, experiments conducted near the [[Tuileries]] from September to October 1793 to produce the required [[hydrogen]] without the use of [[sulphuric acid]], which was in short supply, were successful, producing more than 20 cubic metres.&lt;ref name="coulston"&gt;Charles Coulston Gillispie, ''Science and Polity in France: The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Years'', pp. 372-373&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the Committee determined to use this technique to float tethered balloons.

At the end of October 1793, chemist [[Jean-Marie-Joseph Coutelle]] and his assistant, the engineer [[Nicolas Lhomond]], were sent to join the [[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North]],&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt; with 50,000 [[French livre|livre]] to acquire equipment.&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;  They were given a letter from [[Lazare Carnot]] commending them to General [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] and representative [[Ernest Dominique François Joseph Duquesnoy]], which informed them that "Citizen Coutelle is not a charlatan".&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;  However, on arrival, Jourdan ridiculed the project, ordering Coutelle back to [[Paris]], with the message that an Austrian attack was imminent, and a battalion was required, not a balloon.&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;

==Formation==
Back in Paris, the Committee of Public Safety ordered further tests on the balloon technology,&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt; to be conducted at the [[Chateau de Meudon]], where the Aerostatic Development Centre was founded.  [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]] led the research, refining balloon shapes and materials, and also improving the [[hydrogen production]] process.  This culminated in a series of ascensions, viewed by leading figures on the Committee, who passed an Act creating the Aerostatic Corps on 2 April 1794.&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;  The corps consisted of a captain and a lieutenant, a sergeant-major and sergeant, two corporals and twenty privates.  All these men were required to have skills relevant to ballooning, such as [[chemistry]] or [[carpentry]].  The Act creating the corps envisaged three roles: reconnaissance, signalling and the distribution of [[propaganda]].  Coutelle was created captain, and Lhomond lieutenant.&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;

==Battle of Fleurus==
[[File:Early flight 02562u (9).jpg|thumb|right|The corps transporting the balloon to Fleurus.]]
In May 1794, the new corps joined Jourdan's troops at [[Mauberge]], bringing one balloon: ''L'Entreprenant''.  They began by constructing a [[furnace]], then extracting hydrogen.&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;  The first military use of the balloon was on 2 June, when it was used for reconnaissance during an enemy bombardment.&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;  On 22 June, the corps received orders to move the balloon to the plain of Fleurus, in front of the Austrian troops at [[Charleroi]].  This was achieved by twenty soldiers who dragged the inflated balloon across thirty miles of ground.&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;  For the three following days, an officer ascended to make further observations.  On 26 June, the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] was fought, and the balloon remained afloat for nine hours, during which Coutelle and [[Antoine Morlot]] took notes on the movements of the Austrian Army, dropping them to the ground for collection by the French Army,&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt; and also signalled messages using [[semaphore]].&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;

The French won the Battle of Fleurus, but reports of the usefulness of the balloon corps varied.  [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], who had been present throughout the battle, strongly supported it, but Jourdan believed that it had contributed little.&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;  Guyton had already supervised the construction at Meudon of the ''Martial'', a cylindrical balloon, which was supplied to the corps soon after the battle, but it proved too unstable for use.  The corps followed the Army of the North into Belgium and was present at battles in [[Liège|Liege]] and [[Brussels]],&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt; although they did not see action.&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;  With winter approaching, they constructed a balloon depot at [[Borcette]] near [[Aachen]].&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;

==Second company==
[[File:Early flight 02561u (1).jpg|thumb|right|Observations by the second company at the Battle of Mainz]]
On 23 June, an Act creating a second aerostatic company had been passed, to be trained at Meudon by Conté.  It was provided with two new balloons, ''Hercule'' and ''[[L'Intrépide]]'',&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt; and in March 1795 it was attached to the [[Army of the Rhine]].&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;  Coutelle was recalled in order to head the new company, Lhomond being promoted to captain of the first company, while Conté remained at Meudon.&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;  In October, he was made head of a new school of ballooning, where replacement soldiers for the two companies were trained.&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt;

The second company conducted ascensions at the [[Battle of Mainz]], and were also active during the evacuation of [[Mannheim]].  For the winter, they established a base at [[Frankheim]], then followed the Army north and conducted observations at [[Stuttgart]], [[Rastatt]] and [[Donauwörth]].&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;

==Decline and disbanding==
[[File:HGM L'Intrépide.jpg|thumb|upright|''L'Intrépide'' on display at the ''Heeresgeschichtliches Museum''.]]
Meanwhile, in 1795, the first company was transferred to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]], which was now led by Jourdan.  They were not directly involved in any action,&lt;ref name="coulston" /&gt; but Jourdan appears to have warmed to the balloonists, printing official correspondence forms depicting a balloon above his army.  In September 1796, they were at the [[Battle of Würzburg]] when the French Army was defeated, and the entire company was taken captive with its balloon ''[[L'Intrépide]]'', which is now on display at the ''[[Heeresgeschichtliches Museum]]'' in Vienna.

Following this disaster, the second company was attached to the reconstructed Army of Sambre-et-Meuse.  Coutelle withdrew to Meudon, overcome by fever, and new commander Delaunay was unable to work with the new General, [[Lazare Hoche]], who refused to let them participate in any action.&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;

The first company were released in April 1797, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Leoben]], and petitioned for the reinstatement of Coutelle as their commander.  This was permitted; Coutelle was made a colonel, while Lhomond was promoted to major and permitted to remain second-in-command.  In 1798, the company joined the [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt]].  On arrival, they decided to initially leave the ballooning equipment on their ship.  This was destroyed in the [[Battle of the Nile]], and the company was assigned to other duties.  They were able to conduct a few demonstrations of more basic balloons for entertainment purposes.&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;

On 15 January 1799, the [[French Directory|Directory]] passed an act disbanding the balloon corps.  The second company was immediately disbanded, but the first was still in action in Egypt and remained in existence until its return to France in 1802.&lt;ref name="haydon" /&gt;

'''GADM''', the '''Database of Global Administrative Areas''', is a [[high-resolution]] [[database]] of country administrative areas, with a goal of "all countries, at all levels, at any time period."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadm.org/ Main GADM website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The database is available in a few [[Import and export of data|export format]]s, including [[shapefiles]] that are used in most common [[GIS]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comlmaps.org/how-to/layers-and-resources/boundaries/global-administrative-areas Marine Life Mapping &amp; Visualisation]&lt;/ref&gt; Files for use with the data analysis language [[R (programming language)|R]] are also available. 

The files allow for data analysis as well as the easy creation of descriptive [[Plot (graphics)|data plots]] that include geographical maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pvanb.wordpress.com/2010/02/27/a-map-of-deforestation-in-africa-using-r-2/ chloropleth map of deforestation in Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/10/geographic-maps-in-r.html Swiss canton languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is a public database, GADM has a higher [[spatial resolution]] than other free databases,&lt;ref&gt;[http://freegeographytools.com/2009/free-vector-country-borders-administrative-boundaries-and-soon-more Free Geography Tools website]&lt;/ref&gt; and also higher than commercial software such as [[ArcGIS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricegisinfo.blogspot.com/2009/12/thursday-data-gadm-database-of-global.html Kelly Center blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

GADM is not freely available for commercial use. The GADM project created the [[Spatial analysis|spatial data]] for many countries from spatial databases provided by national governments, [[NGO]], and/or from maps and lists of names available on the Internet (e.g. from Wikipedia).

The [[heat dissipation]] in [[integrated circuits]] problem has gained an increasing interest in recent years due to the miniaturization of [[semiconductor]] devices. The temperature increase becomes relevant for cases of relatively small-cross-sections wires, because such temperature increase may affect the normal behavior of semiconductor devices.

==Joule Heating==
[[Joule Heating]] is a predominant heat mechanism for heat generation in integrated circuits &lt;ref name="test"&gt;T. Bechtold, E. V. Rudnyi and J. G Korvink, "Dynamic electro-thermal simulation of microsystems—a review," Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering. vol. 15, pp. R17–R31, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and is an undesired effect.

==Propagation==

The governing equation of the physics of the problem to be analyzed is the heat diffusion equation. It relates the flux of heat in space, its variation in time and the generation of power.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\left(\kappa\nabla T\right)+g=\rho C\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal conductivity]], &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the medium, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat
: &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{\kappa}{\rho C} \,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[thermal diffusivity]] and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of heat generation per unit volume. Heat diffuses from the source following equation ([eq:diffusion]) and solution in an [[homogeneous]] medium of ([eq:diffusion]) has a [[Gaussian distribution]].

'''IBM Docs''' is an interactive software product from [[IBM]] for online editing of office documents. The purpose of IBM Docs is to simplify the way individual users or teams edit and review office documents. Users can create word documents, spreadsheets, and presentations independently or in teams, and they can also leverage professional templates to create new documents, or upload existing [[Microsoft Office]] and [[IBM Lotus Symphony|Lotus Symphony]] files to edit and share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM Docs- A Cloud Based Social Office Productivity Suite|url=http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/docswiki.nsf|work=IBM Docs Wiki|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple users are able to edit and review a document simultaneously using co-editing.&lt;ref name=IID&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing IBM Docs|url=http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/docswiki.nsf/dx/Introducting_IBM_Docs|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM Docs also enables users to view comments that their colleagues, assigned as Editors, have made on a document.&lt;ref name=IID/&gt;

== Functionality ==
IBM Docs was developed to support use cases where real time collaboration is needed. It allows up to five editors to simultaneously co-edit a document. For example, if you work with a team on one presentation different colors are assigned to the editors and they can all collaborate on the same document.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/docswiki.nsf/dx/Co-editing_with_others IBM Docs - Co-editing with others], IBM, accessdate=12 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
When you need to work on a document together but at different times, IBM Docs supports commenting and discussion services allowing conversations to take place inside the document and in context. Comments are anchored to the text, spreadsheet cell, or presentation artifact allowing easy navigation to the context of the comment. Comments can be general comments or directed at a user by using the @ symbol (@userid). Furthermore, it is possiblte to filter comments by author and recipient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/docswiki.nsf/dx/Collaborating_using_comments IBM Docs - Collaborating using comments], IBM, accessdate=12 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM Docs provides capabilities to edit and view documents, spreadsheets and presentations in Microsoft Office binary formats like .ppt, .doc, [[OpenDocument]] format like .odt, .ods, as well as Microsoft Office XML based formats like .docx or .xlsx. It is also possible to upload a template in order to create a document, a spreadsheet or presentation from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/docswiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=Using+IBM+Docs+1.0.4+documentation#action=openDocument&amp;res_title=File_formats_that_are_supported_in_documents_docs104&amp;content=pdcontent Supported File Formats - Documents V.1.0.4], IBM, accessdate=12 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/docswiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=Using+IBM+Docs+1.0.4+documentation#action=openDocument&amp;res_title=File_formats_supported_in_spreadsheets_docs104&amp;content=pdcontent Supported File Formats - Spreadsheets V.1.0.4], IBM, accessdate=12 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/docswiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=Using+IBM+Docs+1.0.4+documentation#action=openDocument&amp;res_title=File_formats_that_are_supported_in_presentations_docs104&amp;content=pdcontent Supported File Formats - Presentations V.1.0.4], IBM, accessdate=12 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14704">'''James Julius Spilker Jr.''' (August 4, 1933) is an American engineer and a Consulting Professor in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at [[Stanford University]].  He was one of the principle architects of the Global Positioning System ([[GPS]]), and founder of the space communications company [[Stanford Telecommunications]] and is currently executive chairman of AOSense Inc., Sunnyvale, CA.

James Spilker is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering (1998) and was inducted to the Air Force GPS Hall of Fame (2000) and the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame (2007).  He is a Life Fellow of the IEEE and a Fellow of the Institute of Navigation (ION). As one of the originators of GPS, James Spilker shared in the Goddard Memorial Trophy (2012).  He won the Arthur Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 1987, the ION Kepler Award (the highest award of the ION) in 1999 and Burka Award in 2002, and the US Air Force Space Command Recognition Award for 9 years of service on GPS Independent Review Team in 2000. In 2015, he received the IEEE Edison Gold Medal for contributions to the technology and implementation of the GPS civilian navigation system.

The James and Anna Marie Spilker Engineering and Applied Sciences Building at Stanford, and in 2005 co-founded the Stanford University Center for Position, Navigation and Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.stanforddaily.com/tag/james-j-spilker-jr/ | title = GPS pioneer pledges $28 million| work = Stanford Daily | date = 16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
James J. Spilker Jr. attended Stanford University for 5 years under scholarships, obtained Deans Honors and Hewlett Packard Fellowship, and received BS Degree in 1955, MS Degree in 1956, and Ph.D. in 1958 all in Electrical Engineering.  He completed the Senior Management Program at UCLA in 1985.

== Career ==
From 1958 to 1963, Spilker worked as a research supervisor at Lockheed Research Labs in Palo Alto, California, where he invented an optimal tracking device for spread-spectrum signals and devised technology to communicate with aircraft flying to/from Berlin when Russia blockaded Berlin.

In 1963 he became manager of the Communications Sciences Department of Ford Aerospace Corporation where he led and managed efforts on both satellite communications ground terminals and military communications satellite payloads for the first quasi-stationary communications satellites, and developed multiple access technologies for various satellite communications and became Director of Communications Systems.

In 1973 he co-founded Stanford Telecommunications Inc., the first of his three Silicon Valley startup companies, with three people and no VC funding.  As the company’s Executive Chairman, he grew the military satellite communications and GPS company to over 1,300 employees in 5 states when he sold it in 1999.

During Spilker’s leadership at Stanford Telecommunications Inc., he also designed semiconductor ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) for error correction, number-controlled oscillators, and quadrature amplitude modulation.  Aviation Week and Space Technology in 1997 ranked Stanford Telecom as the #2 most competitive aerospace company in the world and top 100 fastest growing companies.

Since 2001, Spilker has been a consulting professor at Stanford University in the Electrical Engineering and Aeronautics and Astronautics Department.

In 2005, Prof. Spilker co-founded the Stanford University Research Center for Position, Navigation and Time, which continues today and has an annual International Symposium at Stanford University with invited speakers from around the world.

In 2005, Spilker also co-founded AOSense Inc., an atomic physics company specializing in inertial navigation using cold atom interferometry. He is Executive Chairman at AOSense Inc.

He was also co-founder and chairman of Rosum, a high-tech company using digital and analog television signals for indoor positioning services and augmentation of GPS.

In 2012, Spilker and his wife, Anna Marie Spilker, a real estate broker and investor, donated $28 million to Stanford University to gift The James and Anna Marie Spilker Engineering and Applied Sciences Building and endow a professorship in the School of Engineering. The building is one of four new structures in Stanford Science and Engineering Quad.

Spilker has been a member of the Stanford University Engineering advisory board, a member of the University of Southern California (USC) Communication Sciences Institute, a member of the US Defense Science Board GPS Task Force, and the Air Force Space Command GPS Independent Review Team. Spilker was an invited lecturer and keynote speaker at Samsung Corporation in Korea (2003), Tsinghua University in Beijing, China (2010), the Marconi lab near Bologna, Italy (1970s), and in Munich and Berlin, Germany (2011).

Spilker is a Member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), a member of the NAE Peer Review Committee of the NAE for Electronics, a Life Fellow of the IEEE, and has been the Chairman of the IEEE Technical Advisory Committee.

== Technical contributions ==

=== Delay-lock discriminator – an optimal tracking system ===
In 1961, Spilker published an IRE paper (the predecessor of the IEEE) showing that the optimal tracking system was the delay lock loop (DLL), not the early-late-gate type of delay discriminator. Instead the optimal DLL uses the differentiated signal as the reference and the conventional early-late-gate discriminator is only optimal for a trapezoidal pseudonoise wave shape.

=== Civil navigation and time – GPS signal structure ===
Absolutely critical to the success of GPS for the civil community, which is by far the largest user of GPS navigation, is its ability to operate in a multiple-access environment.  This is achieved by allowing all GPS satellites broadcasting to users on the Earth at the same frequency without interfering with one another using code-division multiple access (CDMA).  With CDMA, each satellite transmits in a common spectral band with a noise-like pseudorandom signal.  Each satellite transmits a different code with properties that its code has little interference with codes from other satellites.

The US Air Force GPS Joint Program Office gave Spilker and his small team of two the contract to recommend the GPS satellite signal structure, especially the civil signal called the clear/acquisition (CA) signal for the civil community.  The same signal architecture is also used as the acquisition signal for the GPS military signal.

Code families with this low crosscorrelation property have been used for years in fixed point-to-point ground or geostationary satellites and today in cellphones with negligible Doppler shift. These can be easily analyzed using Galois field theory.

However, as Spilker pointed out, that zero-Doppler analysis does not apply to GPS with its rapidly moving satellites, and does not reveal the worst case limits of performance. Therefore, critical to the success of GPS is the use of relatively short CDMA codes.  Spilker and his team analyzed the worst-case cross-correlation between codes for the L band GPS signals with their +/- 5 KHz Doppler offsets and clearly show that the codes with Doppler offset indeed were the worst case, and he recommended the 1023-period codes even though with no Doppler they were no better than the 511-period codes.  Those 1023-period codes are the C/A codes now supporting more than 2 billion users.

Spilker’s results were first published in the Stanford Telecom document for the Air Force, "Defense Navigation Satellite Special Study", 130 page Report, April, 1974.

=== Precision satellite test receiver for testing C/A and P code satellite transmissions ===
Upon initial launch of the first GPS satellites, there was the need to assure that the precise signal modulation matched bit-by-bit and chip-by-chip with the desired signal. This measurement required a large tracking antenna and special receiver. Since the satellites are exposed to Van Allen belt radiation and vibration effects at launch, these were important tests. Spilker and his team at Stanford Telecommunications successfully designed, implemented, and carried our these GPS in-orbit tests to assure that the P-code chips and other signals were precisely correct.

=== Time-gated GPS pseudolite transmitter with rubidium clock and a calibration receiver ===
Even though at the time there were four GPS satellites in orbit, plus on-orbit spares, one of the initial operational tests was to track a navy missile precisely. For this reason, there was an advantage to have a ground-based pseudolite at a fixed site that transmitted the GPS signals in a time-gated manner so as not to interfere with satellite transmissions most of the time. Spilker and his team developed a precision GPS pseudolite that also included a rubidium standard clock for this signal generator and a calibration receiver to assure that the signal matched a selected GPS satellite code. This time-gated pseudolite signal along with the in-orbit GPS satellites permitted precisely tracking of the navy missile and the program was a success.

=== GPS initial operational control segment ===
The operational GPS control segment is crucial to GPS to compute precision orbits and clock errors for each of the GPS satellites – information that must be transmitted to each and every GPS receiver with precision. Spilker proposed, designed, and implemented special monitor station receivers, part of the new IBM/Stanford Telecom control segment that performed precision coherent code/carrier satellite tracking from horizon to horizon with GPS pseudorange rms error of only 7&amp;nbsp;mm.  This performance is described by IBM in the Parkinson/Spilker GPS book.&lt;ref name=book&gt;Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications, B. Parkinson and J. J. Spiker Jr., editors, AIAA, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precision civil signal at L5 frequency band – GPS modernization ===
The initial GPS civil signal operated only on one frequency at L1 band (1.57542&amp;nbsp;GHz).  It did not permit computation of the excess delay of the ionosphere and only operated at the lower clock rate of 1.023 M chip/s.  The modernized GPS civil signal was designed by Spilker and A. J. van Dierendonck, who received the ION Burka award for their contribution.  This so called L5 signal operates on a lower L band frequency and has a 10 times higher clock rate and a longer period thus permitting ionospheric delay correction when used with the L1 frequency and a greater accuracy with the higher chip rate. It further operates in an aeronautical navigation protected frequency band L5. The new GPS/GNSS L5 civil signal will be used for precision navigation by the world’s airliners and many new precision navigation applications.

=== GPS vector-processing receivers in an era of multi-GNSS ===
The 21st century world of satellite navigation includes not only a modernized GPS but also global navigation satellite constellations from Russia (GLONASS), China (BDS), Europe (Galileo), and regional systems from Japan (QZSS), and India (IRNSS). With these GNSS and RNSS constellations plus GPS, the world will have more than 132 satellites in orbit and if each has at least 2 civil signals there will be more than 264 navigation signals being broadcast.

Spilker pointed out that from a communication theory point of view there is an alternative to tracking each satellite one at a time as separate estimates.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; Instead he considers the composite of all signals as a single composite signal which is now simply a function of the user's state vector which includes at least the user's position and velocity vectors. The receiver for such a system he defines as the vector delay-lock loop. This receiver operates on the total power received from the entire set of satellites of satellite constellation, not just the power of a single satellite. The gain of the vector processing which tracks the user state vector in a single step is greater than would have been feasible years ago but now computer chips are many times faster. Vector processing can have many advantages for disadvantaged users in challenging environments such as in urban canyons, under forest canopy, during space weather disturbances.

=== Vector-processing anti-spoof techniques for civil users ===
The civil signals are based on clear unencrypted codes published and available to all.  A terrorist or other troublemakers can attempt to jam or spoof the true signal. The spoofer would attempt to transmit a similar signal so that it is received by the user with a similar delay and Doppler shift to the true signal.  This is a very simple operation if the user is employing a conventional receiver that tracks each satellite signal separately one at a time with a separate correlator for each satellite.

However with vector processing the problem is quite different – we are now tracking the composite of all 134 satellites in parallel. The spoofer now must generate spoofing signals that match the user state vector delay for all or most of the satellites – a task of enormous difficulty. For example if the signal has a 10 Mcps chip rate, the user state vector position estimate in 3D must be matched the spoofer to less than roughly 20 meters in all 3 dimensions and also very precisely in the velocity vector especially if the user has a good clock. Thus vector processing can provide enormous benefits to protect the user from spoofing attacks.

A '''kitchen utensil''' is a small hand held [[tool]] used for food preparation.  Common kitchen tasks include cutting food items to size, heating food on an open fire or on a stove, baking, grinding, mixing, blending, and measuring; different utensils are made for each task. A general purpose utensil such as a chef's knife may be used for a variety of foods; other kitchen utensils are highly specialized and may be used only in connection with preparation of a particular type of food, such as an [[Separating eggs|egg separator]] or an [[apple corer]].  Some specialized utensils are used when an operation is to be repeated many times, or when the cook has limited dexterity or mobility. The number of utensils in a household kitchen varies with time and the style of cooking.

A '''cooking utensil''' is a utensil for cooking.  Utensils may be categorized by use with terms derived from the word "[[wikt:ware#English|ware]]": '''kitchenware''', wares for the kitchen; '''ovenware''' and '''bakeware''', kitchen utensils that are for use inside ovens and for baking; '''cookware''', merchandise used for cooking; and so forth.

A partially overlapping category of tools is that of [[eating utensil]]s, which are tools used for eating (c.f. the more general category of [[tableware]]).  Some utensils are both kitchen utensils and eating utensils.  [[Cutlery]] (i.e. knives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kitchen utensils|url=http://www.getbeststuff.com/category/kitchen|website=GBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other cutting implements) can be used for both food preparation in a kitchen and as eating utensils when dining.  Other [[cutlery]] such as forks and spoons are both kitchen and eating utensils.

Other names used for various types of kitchen utensils, although not strictly denoting a utensil that is specific to the kitchen, are according to the materials they are made of, again using the "[[wikt:-ware#English|-ware]]" suffix, rather than their functions: [[earthenware]], utensils made of clay; [[silver (household)|silverware]], utensils (both kitchen and dining) made of silver; [[glassware]], utensils (both kitchen and dining) made of glass; and so forth.  These latter categorizations include utensils — made of glass, silver, clay, and so forth — that are not necessarily kitchen utensils.

== Materials ==
[[Benjamin Thompson]] noted at the start of the 19th century that kitchen utensils were commonly made of copper, with various efforts made to prevent the copper from reacting with food (particularly its acidic contents) at the temperatures used for cooking, including [[tinning]], [[enamelling]], and [[varnishing]].  He observed that iron had been used as a substitute, and that some utensils were made of earthenware.{{sfn|Thompson|1969|p=232–239}}  By the turn of the 20th century, [[Maria Parloa]] noted that kitchen utensils were made of (tinned or enamelled) iron and steel, copper, nickel, silver, tin, clay, earthenware, and aluminium.{{sfn|Parloa|1908|p=xxvi}}  The latter, aluminium, became a popular material for kitchen utensils in the 20th century.{{sfn|Vargel|2004|p=579}}

=== Copper ===
[[Copper]] has good [[thermal conductivity]] and copper utensils are both durable and attractive in appearance.  However, they are also comparatively heavier than utensils made of other materials, require scrupulous cleaning to remove poisonous [[tarnish]] compounds, and are not suitable for acidic foods.{{sfn|van Rensselaer|Rose|Canon|1919|p=233–234}} Copper pots are lined with tin to prevent discoloration or altering the taste of food. The tin lining must be periodically restored, and protected from overheating.

=== Iron ===
{{see also|Cast-iron cookware}}
[[Iron]] is more prone to rusting than (tinned) copper.  [[Cast iron]] kitchen utensils, in particular, are however less prone to rust if, instead of being scoured to a shine after use, they are simply washed with detergent and water and wiped clean with a cloth, allowing the utensil to form a coat of (already corroded iron and other) material that then acts to prevent further corrosion (a process known as [[seasoned pan|seasoning]]).  Furthermore, if an iron utensil is solely used for frying or cooking with fat or oil, corrosion can be reduced by never heating water with it, never using it to cook with water, and when washing it with water to dry it immediately afterwards, removing all water.  Since oil and water are immiscible, since oils and fats are more [[covalent compound]]s, and since it is [[ionic compound]]s such as water that promote corrosion, eliminating as much contact with water reduces corrosion.{{sfn|Thompson|1969|p=232–233}}  For some iron kitchen utensils, water is a particular problem, since it is very difficult to dry them fully.  In particular, iron egg-beaters or ice cream freezers are tricky to dry, and the consequent rust if left wet will roughen them and possibly clog them completely.  When storing iron utensils for long periods, van Rensselaer recommended coating them in non-salted (since salt is also an ionic compound) fat or paraffin.{{sfn|van Rensselaer|Rose|Canon|1919|p=235–236}}

Iron utensils have little problem with high cooking temperatures, are simple to clean as they become smooth with long use, are durable and comparatively strong (i.e. not as prone to breaking as, say, earthenware), and hold heat well.  However, as noted, they rust comparatively easily.{{sfn|van Rensselaer|Rose|Canon|1919|p=235–236}}

===Stainless steel===
[[Stainless steel]] finds many applications in the manufacture of kitchen utensils. Stainless steel is considerably less likely to rust in contact with water or food products, and so reduces the effort required to maintain utensils in clean useful condition. Cutting tools made with stainless steel maintain a usable edge while not presenting the risk of rust found with iron or other types of steel.

=== Earthenware and enamelware ===
[[Earthenware]] utensils suffer from brittleness when subjected to rapid large changes in temperature, as commonly occur in cooking, and the glazing of earthenware often contains [[lead]], which is poisonous.  Thompson noted that as a consequence of this the use of such glazed earthenware was prohibited by law in some countries from use in cooking, or even from use for storing acidic foods.{{sfn|Thompson|1969|p=236–239}}  Van Rensselaer proposed in 1919 that one test for lead content in earthenware was to let a beaten egg stand in the utensil for a few minutes and watch to see whether it became discoloured, which is a sign that lead might be present.{{sfn|van Rensselaer|Rose|Canon|1919|p=234–235}}

In addition to their problems with [[thermal shock]], enamelware utensils require careful handling, as careful as for glassware, because they are prone to chipping.  But enamel utensils are not affected by acidic foods, are durable, and are easily cleaned.  However, they cannot be used with strong alkalis.{{sfn|van Rensselaer|Rose|Canon|1919|p=234–235}}

Earthenware, porcelain, and pottery utensils can be used for both cooking and serving food, and so thereby save on washing-up of two separate sets of utensils.  They are durable, and (van Rensselaer notes) "excellent for slow, even cooking in even heat, such as slow baking".  However, they are comparatively ''un''suitable for cooking using a direct heat, such as a cooking over a flame.{{sfn|van Rensselaer|Rose|Canon|1919|p=236}}

=== Aluminium ===
James Frank Breazeale in 1918 opined that [[aluminium]] "is without doubt the best material for kitchen utensils", noting that it is "as far superior to enamelled ware as enamelled ware is to the old-time iron or tin".  He qualified his recommendation for replacing worn out tin or enamelled utensils with aluminium ones by noting that "old-fashioned black iron frying pans and muffin rings, polished on the inside or worn smooth by long usage, are, however, superior to aluminium ones".{{sfn|Breazeale|1918|p=36–37}}

Aluminium's advantages over other materials for kitchen utensils is its good thermal conductivity (which is approximately an order of magnitude greater than that of [[steel]]), the fact that it is largely non-reactive with foodstuffs at low and high temperatures, its low [[toxicity]], and the fact that its corrosion products are white and so (unlike the dark corrosion products of, say, iron) do not discolour food that they happen to be mixed into during cooking.{{sfn|Vargel|2004|p=579}}  However, its disadvantages are that it is easily discoloured, can be dissolved by acidic foods (to a comparatively small extent), and reacts to alkaline soaps if they are used for cleaning a utensil.{{sfn|van Rensselaer|Rose|Canon|1919|p=232–233}}

[[File:IDF Equipment IMG 0891.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An exhibit of [[Israeli Defence Forces]] kitchen utensils at the Batey ha-Osef Museum in [[Tel Aviv]].|alt=A museum mannequin standing in front of a table set with various kitchen utensils, with more kitchen utensils hanging from the wall behind]]
In the [[European Union]], the construction of kitchen utensils made of aluminium is determined by two European standards: EN 601 (''Aluminium and aluminium alloys — Castings — Chemical composition of castings for use in contact with foodstuffs'') and EN 602 (''Aluminium and aluminium alloys — Wrought products — Chemical composition of semi-finished products used for the fabrication of articles for use in contact with foodstuffs'').

=== Clay ===

A great feature of non-enameled ceramics is that clay does not come into a reaction with food, does not contain toxic substances, and it is safe for food use because it does not give off toxic substances when heated. 

There are several types of ceramic utensils.
Terracotta utensils, which are made of red clay and black ceramics.   The clay utensils for preparing food can also be used in electric ovens, microwaves and stoves,
we can also place them in fireplaces. It is not advised to put the clay utensil in the 220-250
temperature oven directly, because it will break. It also is not recommended to place the clay pot over an open fire.
Clay utensils do not like sharp change in temperature.  The dishes prepared in clay pots come to be
particularly juicy and soft – this is due to the clay’s porous surface. Due to this porous nature of the surface the clay utensils inhale aroma and grease.  The coffee made in  clay coffee boilers is very aromatic, but such pots need special care.  It is not advised to scrub the pots with metal scrubs, it is better to pour soda water in the pot and let it stay there and afterwards to wash the pot with warm water.   The clay utensils must be kept in a dry place, so that they will not get damp.

===Plastics===
[[File:BiodegradablePlasticUtensils1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Biodegradation|Biodegradable]] plastic utensils made from [[bioplastic]]]]
Plastics can be readily formed by molding into a variety of shapes useful for kitchen utensils. Transparent plastic measuring cups allow ingredient levels to be easily visible, and are lighter and less fragile than glass measuring cups. Plastic handles added to utensils improve comfort and grip. While many plastics deform or decompose if heated, a few silicone products can be used in boiling water or in an oven for food preparation. Non-stick plastic coatings can be applied to frying pans; newer coatings avoid the issues with decomposition of plastics under strong heating.

===Glass===
Heat-resistant glass utensils can be used for baking or other cooking. Glass does not conduct heat as well as metal, and has the drawback of breaking easily if dropped. Transparent glass measuring cups allow ready measurement of liquid and dry ingredients.

=== Before the 19th century ===

"Of the culinary utensils of the ancients", wrote [[Mrs Beeton]], "our knowledge is very limited; but as the art of living, in every civilized country, is pretty much the same, the instruments for cooking must, in a great degree, bear a striking resemblance to one another".{{sfn|Beeton|1861|p=28}}

Archaeologists and historians have studied the kitchen utensils used in centuries past. For example: In the Middle Eastern villages and towns of the middle first millennium [[Anno Domini|AD]], historical and archaeological sources record that Jewish households generally had stone measuring cups, a ''meyḥam'' (a wide-necked vessel for heating water), a ''kederah'' (an unlidded pot-bellied cooking pot), a ''ilpas'' (a lidded stewpot/casserole pot type of vessel used for stewing and steaming), ''yorah'' and ''kumkum'' (pots for heating water), two types of ''teganon'' (frying pan) for deep and shallow frying, an ''iskutla'' (a glass serving platter), a ''tamḥui'' (ceramic serving bowl), a ''keara'' (a bowl for bread), a ''kiton'' (a canteen of cold water used to dilute wine), and a ''lagin'' (a wine decanter).{{sfn|Schwartz|2006|p=439–441}}

Ownership and types of kitchen utensils varied from household to household.  Records survive of inventories of kitchen utensils from [[London]] in the 14th century, in particular the records of possessions given in the coroner's rolls.  Very few such people owned any kitchen utensils at all.  In fact only seven convicted felons are recorded as having any.  One such, a murderer from 1339, is recorded as possessing only the one kitchen utensil: a brass pot (one of the commonest such kitchen utensils listed in the records) valued at three shillings.{{sfn|Carlin|Rosenthal|1998|pp=42–32}}  Similarly, in [[Minnesota]] in the second half of the 19th century, John North is recorded as having himself made "a real nice rolling pin, and a pudding stick" for his wife; one soldier is recorded as having a Civil War bayonet refashioned, by a blacksmith, into a bread knife; whereas an immigrant Swedish family is recorded as having brought with them "solid silver knives, forks, and spoons &amp;#91;...&amp;#93; Quantities of copper and brass utensils burnished until they were like mirrors hung in rows".{{sfn|Kreidberg|1975|pp=164}}

=== 19th century growth ===
[[File:Fireproof Ware.JPG|thumb|The up-to-date kitchen fireproof ware in 1894]]
The 19th century, particularly in the United States, saw an explosion in the number of kitchen utensils available on the market, with many labour-saving devices being invented and patented throughout the century.  Maria Parloa's ''Cook Book and Marketing Guide'' listed a ''minimum'' of 139 kitchen utensils without which a contemporary kitchen would not be considered properly furnished.  Parloa wrote that "the homemaker will find &amp;#91;that&amp;#93; there is continually something new to be bought".{{sfn|Volo|Volo|2007|p=245}}

A growth in the range of kitchen utensils available can be traced through the growth in the range of utensils recommended to the aspiring householder in cookbooks as the century progressed.  Earlier in the century, in 1828, Frances Byerley Parkes {{harv|Parkes|1828}} had recommended a smaller array of utensils.  By 1858, Elizabeth H. Putnam, in ''Mrs Putnam's Receipt Book and Young Housekeeper's Assistant'', wrote with the assumption that her readers would have the "usual quantity of utensils", to which she added a list of necessary items:{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=67–69}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Copper saucepans, well lined, with covers, from three to six different sizes; a flat-bottomed soup-pot; an upright [[gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]]; sheet-iron breadpans instead of tin; a [[griddle]]; a tin kitchen; Hector's [[double boiler]]; a tin coffee-pot for boiling coffee, or a filter — either being equally good; a tin canister to keep roasted and ground coffee in; a canister for tea; a covered tin box for bread; one likewise for cake, or a drawer in your store-closet, lined with zinc or tin; a [[bread knife|bread-knife]]; a board to cut bread upon; a covered jar for pieces of bread, and one for fine crumbs; a knife-tray; a spoon-tray; — the yellow ware is much the stringest, or tin pans of different sizes are economical; — a stout tin pan for mixing bread; a large earthen bowl for beating cake; a stone jug for yeast; a stone jar for soup stock; a meat-saw; a [[cleaver (knife)|cleaver]]; iron and wooden spoons; a wire sieve for sifting flour and meal; a small hair sieve; a [[bread board|bread-board]]; a meat-board; a [[lignum vitae mortar]], and [[rolling pin|rolling-pin]], &amp;amp;c.

— {{harvnb|Putnam|1858|p=318}}{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=68}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mrs Beeton, in her ''Book of Household Management'', wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The following list, supplied by Messrs Richard &amp;amp; John Slack, 336, Strand, will show the articles required for the kitchen of a family in the middle class of life, although it does not contain all the things that may be deemed necessary for some families, and may contain more than are required for others.  As Messrs Slack themselves, however, publish a useful illustrated catalogue, which may be had at their establishment gratis, and which it will be found advantageous to consult by those about to furnish, it supersedes the necessity of our enlarging that which we give:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Parloa, in her 1880 cookbook, took two pages to list all of the essential kitchen utensils for a well-furnished kitchen, a list running to 93 distinct sorts of item.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=68}}  The 1882 edition ran to 20 pages illustrating and describing the various utensils for a well-furnished kitchen.  [[Sarah Tyson Rorer]]'s 1886 ''Philadelphia Cook Book'' {{harv|Rorer|1886}} listed more than 200 kitchen utensils that a well-furnished kitchen should have.{{sfn|Quinzio|2009|p=133}}

=== "Labour-saving" utensils generating more labour ===

However, many of these utensils were expensive and not affordable by the majority of householders.{{sfn|Volo|Volo|2007|p=245}}  Some people considered them unnecessary, too.  James Frank Breazeale decried the explosion in patented "labour-saving" devices for the modern kitchen—promoted in exhibitions and advertised in "Household Guides" at the start of the 20th century—, saying that "the best way for the housewife to peel a potato, for example, is in the old-fashioned way, with a knife, and not with a patented potato peeler".  Breazeale advocated simplicity over dishwashing machines "that would have done credit to a moderate sized hotel", and noted that the most useful kitchen utensils were "the simple little inexpensive conveniences that work themselves into every day use", giving examples, of utensils that were simple and cheap but indispensable once obtained and used, of a stiff brush for cleaning saucepans, a sink strainer to prevent drains from clogging, and an ordinary wooden spoon.{{sfn|Breazeale|1918|p=36}}

The "labour-saving" devices didn't necessarily save labour, either.  While the advent of mass-produced standardized measuring instruments permitted even householders with little to no cooking skills to follow recipes and end up with the desired result and  the advent of many utensils enabled "modern" cooking, on a stove or range rather than at floor level with a hearth, they ''also'' operated to raise expectations of what families would eat.  So while food was easier to prepare and to cook, ordinary householders at the same time were expected to prepare and to cook more complex and harder-to-prepare meals on a regular basis.  The labour-saving effect of the tools was cancelled out by the increased labour required for what came to be expected as the culinary norm in the average household.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=53}}

The '''Lee algorithm''' is one possible solution for [[maze router|maze routing problems]] based on [[Breadth-first search]].
It always gives an optimal solution, if one exists, but is slow and requires considerable memory.

==Algorithm==
1) Initialization
  - Select start point, mark with 0
  - i := 0
2) Wave expansion
  - REPEAT
      - Mark all unlabeled neighbors of points marked with i with i+1
      - i := i+1
    UNTIL ((target reached) or (no points can be marked))

[[Image:lee waveprop.png|thumb|Wave Expansion step]]

3) Backtrace
    - go to the target point
    REPEAT
      - go to next node that has a lower mark than the current node
      - add this node to path
    UNTIL (start point reached)
4) Clearance
  - Block the path for future wirings
  - Delete all marks

Of course the wave expansion marks only points in the routable area of the chip, not in the blocks or already wired parts, and to minimize segmentation you should keep in one direction as long as possible.

[[Pyrotechnics]] have been the proximate cause of many accidents and incidents over time, which have resulted in property damage, injury and in severe cases loss of life.  These incidents can be the results of poorly manufactured product, unexpected or unforeseen events, or in many cases, operator error.

This page contains a list of incidents involving pyrotechnic substances.

== Sporting events ==

In August 2006, when [[TNA Wrestling]] held its annual Pay Per View [[Hard Justice#2006|Hard Justice]], a fire ignited in the rafters where the pyrotechnics were held. Everybody was evacuated from the building. The fire lasted about 20 minutes and the show was continued.

On March 30, 2008, [[WWE]] had pyrotechnics go off for the ending of [[WrestleMania XXIV]], but the pyrotechincs cable snapped and sparks flew down from the upper decks to the lower and middle decks. 45 fans were injured, but only 3 needed medical attention from a doctor.

At the [[Elimination Chamber (2010)|2010 Elimination Chamber]] Pay Per View, Professional Wrestler [[The Undertaker]] suffered burns to the chest and neck area as a result of a pyrotechnic accident. A mistake allowed a huge burst of fire to erupt directly under his feet, burning The Undertaker's leather coat. Remarkably, he completed his match despite suffering second and third-degree burns. The pyrotechnician responsible for the accident was fired on the spot and escorted from the building at the behest of The Undertaker himself.

== Concerts ==
{{see also|List of nightclub fires}}
*In 2003, improper use of pyrotechnics caused a fire in a [[Rhode Island]] nightclub called The Station. [[The Station nightclub fire]] was started when the fireworks the band [[Great White]] were using accidentally ignited flammable soundproofing foam. The pyrotechnics in question were not appropriate. The foam caused combustion to spread rapidly and the resulting fire led to 100 deaths, apparently because their quick escape was blocked by ineffective exit doors. While the type of foam used and the lack of a sprinkler system were important factors in the fire, the Great White fire could have been prevented had those involved paid attention to standard safety practices around the use of pyrotechnics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/ncst/upload/Vol_I_NCSTAR2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622110448/https://www.nist.gov/ncst/upload/Vol_I_NCSTAR2.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Metallica]]'s [[James Hetfield]] suffered burns during a performance of "Fade to Black". He suffered from second and third degree burns. This concert is also infamous because it subsequently led to a riot occurring due to [[Guns N' Roses]] frontman [[Axl Rose]] walking off stage after complaining of a throat problem.
*[[Mötley Crüe]] drummer [[Tommy Lee]] was hospitalized in 2005 when he was hit by sparks from a [[pyrotechnic]] stunt while he was swinging on a wire between [[drum set]]s suspended several feet above the stage.
*July 8, 2011 A follow spot operator's truss chair caught on fire at a [[Rihanna]] concert. It was caused by the shows pyrotechnics.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/09/rihanna-concert-fire_n_893766.html]"&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2015, Michael Clifford and Calum Hood from [[5 seconds of summer|5 Seconds of Summer]] suffered burns while playing their show in Wembley Arena, [[London]] .

== Film==

[[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] was badly burned during a scene in which her character 'vanished' in a burst of flame and smoke, a delay in activating a trap-door catching her in the pyrotechnic device during the filming of [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)]]. Her stuntwoman was also injured in a scene involving a smoking broomstick.

== Manufacturing and retail ==

A powerful blast razed a fireworks factory 50 kilometers south of the Philippines capital Manila in January 2009, killing at least eight people and injuring more than 70 others.

*[[December 2007 Bocaue fire]]

== Broadcast  ==

[[Keith Moon]] and [[Pete Townshend]] were injured during the taping of an episode of ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' in 1967.

[[Anthea Turner]] was set alight by a pyrotechnic display in 1989 during the filming of an episode of the program ''[[UP2U (BBC TV series)|UP2U]]''.

[[Michael Jackson]] had suffered from injuries sustained when a pyrotechnic went wrong during filming for a Pepsi advertisement on January 27, 1984, when they went off too early and caused him to suffer from burns to his hair and scalp.

== Public events ==

A pyrotechnic-induced fire incident similar to [[The Station nightclub fire]] in 2003 destroyed the [[Republica Cromagnon]] nightclub in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], killing 194 people.

Another [[Perm Lame Horse club fire|incident in Russia]] saw the roof catch fire of the Lame Horse nightclub in the Ural mountain city of Perm. Smoke inhalation and stampede caused 112 deaths.

An incident involving highly explosive fireworks [[Beijing Television Cultural Center fire|burned]] the [[Beijing Television Cultural Center|Television Cultural Center]] in  [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 2009 on the final day of [[Chinese New Year]] celebrations. One person died of smoke inhalation and 7 people were injured.

[[Image:Mass-airflow.jpg|thumb|A mass airflow sensor]]
A '''mass (air) flow sensor''' ('''MAF''') is a [[sensor]] used to determine the [[mass flow rate]] of [[air]] entering a [[fuel-injected]] [[internal combustion engine]].

The air mass information is necessary for the [[engine control unit]] (ECU) to balance and deliver the correct fuel mass to the engine. Air changes its density with temperature and pressure. In automotive applications, [[air density]] varies with the ambient [[temperature]], [[altitude]] and the use of [[forced induction]], which means that mass flow sensors are more appropriate than [[volumetric flow]] sensors for determining the quantity of [[intake]] air in each cylinder.

There are two common types of mass airflow sensors in use on automotive engines. These are the vane meter and the hot wire. Neither design employs technology that measures air mass directly. However, with additional sensors and inputs, an engine's ECU can determine the [[mass flow rate]] of intake air.

Both approaches are used almost exclusively on [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI) engines. Both sensor designs output a 0.0–5.0 volt or a [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) signal that is proportional to the air mass flow rate, and both sensors have an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor incorporated into their housings for most post [[on-board diagnostics]] (OBDII) vehicles. Vehicles prior to 1996 could have MAF without an IAT. An example is 1994 [[Infiniti Q45]].

When a MAF sensor is used in conjunction with an [[oxygen sensor]], the engine's air/fuel ratio can be controlled very accurately. The MAF sensor provides the [[open-loop controller]] predicted air flow information (the measured air flow) to the ECU, and the oxygen sensor provides [[electronic feedback loops|closed-loop]] feedback in order to make minor corrections to the predicted air mass. Also see manifold absolute pressure sensor ([[MAP sensor]]).

==Moving vane meter==
The VAF (volume air flow) sensor measures the air flow into the engine with a [[Spring (device)|spring]]-loaded air vane (flap/door) attached to a variable resistor ([[potentiometer]]). The vane moves in proportion to the airflow. A voltage is applied to the potentiometer and a proportional voltage appears on the output terminal of the potentiometer in proportion to the angle the vane rotates, or the movement of the vane may directly regulate the amount of [[Fuel injection|fuel injected]], as in the [[Jetronic#K|K-Jetronic]] system.

Many VAF sensors have an air-fuel adjustment screw, which opens or closes a small air passage on the side of the VAF sensor. This screw controls the air-fuel mixture by letting a metered amount of air flow past the air flap, thereby leaning or richening the mixture. By turning the screw clockwise the mixture is enriched and counterclockwise the mixture is leaned.

The vane moves because of the [[Drag (physics)|drag force]] of the air flow against it; it does not measure volume or mass directly. The drag force depends on air density (air density in turn depends on air temperature), air velocity and the shape of the vane, see [[drag equation]]. Some VAF sensors include an additional intake air temperature sensor (IAT sensor) to allow the engines ECU to calculate the density of the air, and the fuel delivery accordingly.

The vane meter approach has some drawbacks: 
*it restricts airflow which limits engine output
*its moving electrical or mechanical contacts can wear
*finding a suitable mounting location within a confined engine compartment is problematic
*the vane has to be oriented with respect to gravity.
*in some manufacturers fuel pump control was also part on the VAF internal wiring.

==Hot wire sensor (MAF)==
A ''hot wire mass airflow sensor'' determines the mass of air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of operation of the hot wire mass airflow sensor is similar to that of the [[anemometer#Hot-wire anemometers|hot wire anemometer]] (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a [[Voltage regulator|constant voltage]] over the wire or a [[constant current]] through the wire. The wire's [[electrical resistance]] increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the [[electrical current]] flowing through the circuit, according to [[Ohm's law]]. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.

If air density increases due to pressure increase or temperature drop, but the air volume remains constant, the denser air will remove more heat from the wire indicating a higher mass airflow. Unlike the vane meter's paddle sensing element, the hot wire responds directly to air density. This sensor's capabilities are well suited to support the gasoline combustion process which fundamentally responds to air mass, not air volume. (See [[stoichiometry]].)

This sensor sometimes employs a mixture screw, but this screw is fully electronic and uses a variable resistor (potentiometer) instead of an air bypass screw. The screw needs more turns to achieve the desired results. A hot wire burn-off cleaning circuit is employed on some of these sensors. A burn-off relay applies a high current through the platinum hot wire after the vehicle is turned off for a second or so, thereby burning or vaporizing any contaminants that have stuck to the platinum hot wire element.

The hot film MAF sensor works somewhat similar to the hot wire MAF sensor, but instead it usually outputs a frequency signal. This sensor uses a hot film-grid instead of a hot wire. It is commonly found in late 80’s early 90’s fuel-injected vehicles. The output frequency is directly proportional to the air mass entering the engine. So as mass flow increases so does frequency. These sensors tend to cause intermittent problems due to internal electrical failures. The use of an oscilloscope is strongly recommended to check the output frequency of these sensors. Frequency distortion is also common when the sensor starts to fail. Many technicians in the field use a tap test with very conclusive results. Not all HFM systems output a frequency. In some cases, this sensor works by outputting a regular varying voltage signal.

Some of the benefits of a hot-wire MAF compared to the older style vane meter are:
*responds very quickly to changes in air flow
*low airflow restriction
*smaller overall package
*less sensitive to mounting location and orientation
*no moving parts improve its durability
*less expensive
*separate temperature and pressure sensors are not required to determine air mass, even though the intake air temperature sensor is still sometimes included inside the MAF assembly.

There are some drawbacks:
*dirt and oil can contaminate the hot-wire deteriorating its accuracy
*installation requires a [[laminar flow]] across the hot-wire
*the sensor contains a thin platinum wire, which can break if handled incorrectly

The [[GM LS engine]] series (as well as others) use a coldwire MAF system (produced by AC Delco) that works similarly to the hot-wire MAF system; however, it uses an additional "cold" resistor to measure the ambient air and provide a reference for the "hot" resistor element used to measure the air flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0K9VcWtj80C&amp;pg=PA674 |title=Automotive Service: Inspection, Maintenance, Repair |first=Tim |last=Gilles |isbn=978-1-1111-2861-6 |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=2011 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mesh on the MAF is used to smooth out airflow to ensure the sensors have the best chance of a steady reading.  It is not used for measuring the air flow per se.  In situations where owners use oiled-gauze air filters, it is possible for excess oil to coat the MAF sensor and skew its readings.  Indeed, General Motors has issued a Technical Service Bulletin, indicating problems from rough idle all the way to possible transmission damage resulting from the contaminated sensors.  To clean the delicate MAF sensor components, a specific MAF sensor cleaner or [[electronics]] cleaner should be used, ''not'' carburetor or brake cleaners, which can be too aggressive chemically.  Instead, the liquid phase of MAF sensor cleaners and electronics cleaners is typically based on [[hexane]]s or [[heptane]]s with little to no [[alcohol]] content and use either [[carbon dioxide]] or [[HFC-152a]] as aerosol [[propellants]].  The sensors should be gently sprayed from a careful distance to avoid physically damaging them and then allowed to thoroughly dry before reinstalling.  Manufacturers claim that a simple but extremely reliable test to ensure correct functionality is to tap the unit with the back of a screwdriver while the car is running, and if this causes any changes in the output frequency then the unit should be discarded and an OEM replacement installed.

==Kármán vortex sensor==
[[Image:Vortex-street-animation.gif|thumb|A von Kármán vortex street]]
A [[Kármán vortex street|Kármán vortex]] sensor works by disrupting the air stream with a perpendicular bow.  Providing that the incoming flow is [[laminar flow|laminar]], the [[wake]] consists of an oscillatory pattern of Kármán vortices.  The frequency of the resulting pattern is proportional to the air velocity.

These vortices can either be read directly as a pressure pulse against a sensor, or they can be made to collide with a mirror which will then interrupt or transmit a reflected light beam to generate the pulses in response to the vortices.  The first type can only be used in pull-thru air (prior to a turbo- or [[supercharger]]), while the second type could theoretically be used push- or pull-thru air (before or after a forced induction application like the previously mentioned super- or [[turbocharger]]).  Instead of outputting a constant voltage modified by a resistance factor, this type of MAF outputs a frequency which must then be interpreted by the ECU.  This type of MAF can be found on all [[Diamond-Star Motors|DSM]]s (Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eagle Talon, Plymouth Laser), many Mitsubishis, some Toyotas and Lexus, and some BMWs, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoshop101.com/forms/h34.pdf|title=Air Flow Sensors|accessdate=15 September 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114072836/http://autoshop101.com/forms/h34.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membrane sensor==
An emerging technology utilizes a very thin electronic membrane placed in the air stream. The membrane has a [[thin film]] temperature sensor printed on the upstream side, and one on the downstream side. A heater is integrated in the center of the membrane which maintains a constant temperature similar to the hot-wire approach. Without any airflow, the temperature profile across the membrane is uniform. When air flows across the membrane, the upstream side cools differently from the downstream side. The difference between the upstream and downstream temperature indicates the mass airflow. The thermal membrane sensor is also capable of measuring flow in both directions, which sometimes occur in pulsating situations. Technological progress allows this kind of sensor to be manufactured on the [[microscopic]] scale as microsensors using [[microelectromechanical systems]] technology.  Such a ''microsensor'' reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity compared with [[macroscopic]] approaches.  See also [[MEMS sensor generations]].

==Laminar flow elements==
Laminar flow elements measure the volumetric flow of gases directly.  They operate on the principle that, given laminar flow, the pressure difference across a pipe is linear to the flow rate.  [[Laminar flow]] conditions are present in a gas when the [[Reynolds number]] of the gas is below the critical figure.  The viscosity of the fluid must be compensated for in the result.  Laminar flow elements are usually constructed from a large number of parallel pipes to achieve the required flow rating.

[[File:NNPTC_Goose_Creek.JPG|thumb|250px|Naval Nuclear Power Training Command Nuclear Power School]]
A '''Moored training ship (MTS)''' is a [[United States Navy]] designation for [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear powered]] [[submarine]]s that have been converted to [[training ship]]s for the [[Naval Nuclear Power Training Command]]'s [[Nuclear_Power_School#Nuclear_Power_Training_Unit|Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU)]] at [[Naval Support Activity Charleston]] in [[South Carolina]]. The NPTU is part of the Navy's [[Nuclear Power School]] at [[Goose Creek, South Carolina|Goose Creek, S.C.]]. The Navy uses decommissioned nuclear submarines and converts them to MTSs to train personnel in the operation and maintenance of submarines and their nuclear reactors. The first moored training ship was {{USS|Sam Rayburn|SSBN-635}} a {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|0}} [[fleet ballistic missile submarine]], redesignated as (MTS-635) in 1989, followed a year later by {{USS|Daniel Webster|SSBN-626}}, a {{sclass-|Lafayette|submarine|0}} [[ballistic missile]] submarine, redesignated as (MTS-626). Conversion of these two boats took place at the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] and modifications included special mooring arrangements with a mechanism to absorb power generated by the main propulsion shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/mts.htm|title=MTS|publisher=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Navy plans to add two more moored training ships to this facility, {{USS|La Jolla|SSN-701}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvr.navy.mil/SHIPDETAILS/SHIPSDETAIL_SSN_701_2195.HTML|title=SSN-701|publisher=nvr.navy.mil|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{USS|San Francisco|SSN-711}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvr.navy.mil/SHIPDETAILS/SHIPSDETAIL_SSN_711_2205.HTML|title=SSN-711|publisher=nvr.navy.mil|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pair of {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} [[attack submarines]]. The conversions for these two will take place at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]]&lt;ref name="MTS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naval-technology.com/news/us-navys-norfolk-shipyard-undocks-uss-la-jolla-submarine/|title=US Navy's Norfolk shipyard undocks USS ''La Jolla'' submarine|publisher=naval-technology.com|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they will then be taken to NSA Charleston. ''La Jolla'' became inactive in early 2015 and began the 32 month conversion to a training ship. Changes include having the hull cut into three sections, with the center section being recycled and the other two joined with three new sections, manufactured by [[Electric Boat]], extending the length on the boat by 23 m (76 ft). The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://navaltoday.com/2017/12/01/uss-la-jolla-reaches-moored-training-ship-conversion-milestone/|title=USS ''La Jolla'' reaches moored training ship conversion milestone|publisher=navaltoday.com|date=1 December 2017|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''San Francisco'' arrived at Norfolk to begin her conversion in January 2018&lt;ref name=MTS /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8067">[[File:ShockleyQueisserBreakdown2.svg|thumb|Breakdown of the causes for the [[Shockley-Queisser limit]]. The black height is Shockley-Queisser limit for the maximum energy that can be extracted as useful electrical power in a [[Crystalline silicon|conventional]] solar cell. However, a multiple-exciton-generation solar cell can also use some of the energy in the green area (and to a lesser extent the blue area), rather than wasting it as heat. Therefore it can theoretically exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit.]]

In [[solar cell]] research, '''carrier multiplication''' is the phenomenon wherein the absorption of a single [[photon]] leads to the excitation of multiple electrons from the valence band to conduction band. In the [[Theory of solar cells|theory of a conventional solar cell]], each photon is only able to excite one electron across the [[band gap]] of the semiconductor, and any excess energy in that photon is dissipated as heat. In a material with carrier multiplication, high-energy photons excite on average more than one electron across the band gap, and so in principle the solar cell can produce more useful work.

In [[quantum dot solar cell]]s, the excited electron in the conduction band interacts with the hole it leaves behind in the valence band, and this composite uncharged object is known as an [[exciton]]. The carrier multiplication effect in a dot can be understood as creating multiple excitons, and is called '''multiple exciton generation''' (MEG). MEG may considerably increase the [[energy conversion]] efficiency of [[nanocrystal]] based [[solar cells]], though extracting the energy may be difficult because of the short lifetimes of the multiexcitons.

The quantum mechanical origin of MEG is still under debate and several possibilities have been suggested:&lt;ref name="Nature Photonics (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timmerman| first1 =  D.| last2 =  Izeddin| first2 =  I.| last3 =  Stallinga| first3 =  P.| last4 =  Yassievich| first4 =  I.

*1) [[Impact ionization]]: light excites a high-energy exciton (X) which decays irreversibly into a quasi-continuum of multiexciton (multi-X) states available at this energy. The model requires only the [[density of states]] of multiexcitons being very high, while the Coulomb coupling between X and multi-X can be quite small.
*2) Coherent [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of single and multiexciton states: the very first suggested model but oversimplified (high density of states of multi-X is not taken into account). Light excites an X (which is not a true [[eigenstate]] of the system) which can then coherently covert to multi-X and back to X many times ([[quantum beats]]). This process requires Coulomb coupling between them to be much stronger than the decay rate via [[phonons]] (which is usually not the case). The excitation will finally decay via phonons to a lower energy X or multi-X, depending on which of the decays is faster. 
*3) Multiexciton formation through a virtual exciton state. Light directly excites the [[eigenstate]] of the system (in this case, a coherent mixture of X and multi-X). The term "virtual" relates here to a pure X, because it is not a true eigenstate of the system (same for model 2).

All of the above models can be described by the same mathematical model (density matrix) which can behave differently depending on the set of initial parameters (coupling strength between the X and multi-X, density of states, decay rates).

MEG was first observed in 2004 using colloidal [[Lead(II) selenide|PbSe]] [[quantum dots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaller|first1=R.|last2=Klimov|first2=V.|title=High Efficiency Carrier Multiplication in PbSe Nanocrystals: Implications for Solar Energy Conversion|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=92|year=2004|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.186601|pmid=15169518|bibcode=2004PhRvL..92r6601S|arxiv = cond-mat/0404368|issue=18|pages=186601}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later was found in quantum dots of other compositions including [[Lead(II) sulfide|PbS]], [[Lead(II) telluride|PbTe]], [[Cadmium sulfide|CdS]], [[Cadmium selenide|CdSe]], [[Indium arsenide|InAs]], [[Silicon|Si]],&lt;ref name="Nano Letters (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2007 | title = MEG in colloidal silicon nanocrystals | journal = Nano Letters | volume = 7 | issue = 8| pages = 2506–12 | doi=10.1021/nl071486l | pmid=17645368 | last1 = Beard | first1 = MC | last2 = Knutsen | first2 = KP | last3 = Yu | first3 = P | last4 = Luther | first4 = JM | last5 = Song | first5 = Q | last6 = Metzger | first6 = WK | last7 = Ellingson | first7 = RJ | last8 = Nozik | first8 = AJ| bibcode = 2007NanoL...7.2506B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indium Phosphide|InP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Efficient carrier multiplication in InP nanoparticles |journal=Physical Review B|volume=81|issue=8|pages=081303|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.81.081303|bibcode=2010PhRvB..81h1303S|year=2010|last1=Stubbs|first1=Stuart K.|last2=Hardman|first2=Samantha J.

The multiple exciton generation threshold in SWNTs can be close to the limit defined by energy conservation.

[[Image:Safeplacelogo.svg|thumb|This original Safe Place logo was retired in 2012. The new version of the sign is displayed on business, organizations, and public transportation vehicles throughout the U.S., providing immediate help and support for youth in crisis.]]

'''National Safe Place''' (doing business as National Safe Place Network) is a non-profit organization based out of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. It originated in 1983 from an initiative known as "Project Safe Place",&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalsafeplace.org/aboutus/?pageid=about-history National Safe Place - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; established by a short-term residential and counseling center for youth 12 to 17.&lt;ref&gt;''http://nationalsafeplace.org/what-is-safe-place.''&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is intended to provide access to immediate help and support for children and adolescents who are "at risk" or in crisis situations.&lt;ref&gt;That includes, for example, children who are [[Runaway youth|runaway]]s or those experiencing homelessness.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose is to both defuse a potential crisis situation as well as provide immediate counsel and support so the child in crisis may be directed to an appropriate shelter or accredited care facility.

Businesses and community buildings such as fire stations and libraries are designated as "Safe Place" sites. Any youth in crisis can walk into one of the nearly 20,000 Safe Places across the country and ask an employee for help. These locations display the yellow, diamond-shaped Safe Place sign on their location. Inside, employees are trained and prepared to assist any young person asking for help. Youth who go to a Safe Place location are quickly connected to the nearby youth shelter. The shelter then provides the counseling and support necessary to reunify family members and develop a plan to address the issues presented by the youth and family.

In October 2009, National Safe Place launched the TXT 4 HELP initiative, which provides youth immediate access to help and resources through texting. Youth can text the word "safe" and their current location (address/city/state) to 69866 and receive an immediate text response with the location of the closest Safe Place site or youth shelter and the youth shelter phone number. If a site or shelter is not within a 50-mile range, the youth receives the number to the National Runaway Safeline (1-800-RUNAWAY). In 2012, National Safe Place added the option for live, interactive texting with a trained mental health professional. With this addition, youth can immediately connect with Master's-level mental health professionals by text.

In 2013, National Safe Place merged with the Youth &amp; Family Services Network (YFSN) to create the National Safe Place Network. NSPN provides training and technical assistance to licensed Safe Place agencies and NSPN member organizations across the country. More information about NSPN is available at www.nspnetwork.org.

The National Safe Place Network also operates the Runaway and Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center (RHYTTAC), a national training resource for FYSB-funded Runaway and Homeless Youth grantees, as well as several other federally funded projects focused on human trafficking and other issues critical to youth service providers.

'''Nikolaus August Otto''' (14 June 1832, [[Holzhausen an der Haide]], Nassau – 26 January 1891, [[Cologne]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[engineer]] who successfully developed the compressed charge internal combustion engine which ran on petroleum gas and led to the modern internal combustion engine. The [[Association of German Engineers]] (VDI) created DIN standard 1940 which says "Otto Engine: internal combustion engine in which the ignition of the compressed fuel-air mixture is initiated by a timed spark", which has been applied to all engines of this type since.&lt;ref name="Otto Deutz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottomotor|url=http://www.deutz.com/file/chronik_en/app.html|website=Deutz AG|accessdate=12 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704171740/http://www.deutz.com/file/chronik_en/app.html|archivedate=4 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Otto LVR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolaus August Otto (1832-1891), Erfinder|url=http://www.rheinische-geschichte.lvr.de/persoenlichkeiten/O/Seiten/NicolausAugustOtto.aspx|website=LVR Fur Mensch|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:DBP 1952 150 Otto.jpg|thumb|[[Postage stamps and postal history of Germany|Deutsche Bundespost stamp]]]]
Nikolaus August Otto was born on 14 June 1832&lt;ref name="Otto Oldtimers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolaus August Otto Museum|url=http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/?q=node/1|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Holzhausen an der Haide]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ich-geh-wandern.de/holzhausen-an-der-haide|title=Holzhausen an der Haide {{!}} GPS Wanderatlas|website=www.ich-geh-wandern.de|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of six children. His father died in 1832. He began school in 1838. After six years of good performance he moved to the high school in [[Bad Schwalbach|Langenschwalbach]] &lt;ref&gt;Bad Schwalbach|Langenschawalbach&lt;/ref&gt; until 1848. He did not complete his studies but was cited for good performance.

His main interest in school had been in science and technology but he graduated after three years as a business apprentice in a small merchandise company. After completing his apprenticeship he moved to Frankfurt where he worked for Philipp Jakob Lindheimer as a salesman of "[[colonial goods]]" and agricultural products (he was a grocery salesman). Otto worked for various companies, first for IC Alpeter and then in 1860 for Carl Mertens. He traveled throughout Western Germany and sold colonial goods - coffee, tea, rice, and sugar.&lt;ref name="Otto LVR"/&gt;

==Lenoir engine== 
In late autumn of 1860 Otto and his brother learned of a novel gas ([[History of manufactured gas#Philippe Lebon and the Thermolamp|illuminating gas]]) engine that [[Étienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]] had built in Paris.&lt;ref name="Otto LVR"/&gt; The brothers built a copy of the Lenoir engine and applied for a patent in January 1861 for a liquid fueled engine based on the Lenoir (Gas) engine with the Prussian Ministry of Commerce, but it was rejected.

==First four stroke engine, 1861==
Otto was aware of the concept of compressed fuel charge and tried to make an engine using this principle in 1861. It ran for just a few minutes before breaking.  Otto's brother gave up on the concept, resulting in Otto looking for help elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Otto LVR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Otto Oldtimers"/&gt;

From 1862 to 1863 Otto experimented with the help of Cologne Mechanic Michael J. Zons in an effort to improve the engine. Running low on funds, in 1862 Otto worked for Carl Mertens in order to continue work on his engine.&lt;ref name="Otto LVR"/&gt;

==Enter Eugen Langen==
Early in 1864, Otto sought investors to fund his research. He found Eugen Langen, whose father was a sugar industrialist.  Together they entered into a partnership on 31 March 1864 and named it NA Otto &amp; Cie in Cologne. This was the world's first company focused entirely on the design and production of internal combustion engines.&lt;ref name="Otto LVR"/&gt;

The 1864 Otto &amp; Langen engine was a free piston [[atmospheric engine]] (the explosion of gas was used to create a vacuum and the power came from atmospheric pressure returning the piston). It consumed less than half the gas of the Lenoir and Hugon atmospheric engines and so was a commercial success. The Lenoir engine was a double acting engine.  In essence these engines are a steam engine altered to run on illuminating gas. The engines of Italian inventors [[Eugenio Barsanti]] and [[Felice Matteucci]] in their British Patent no 1625 of 1857, were built and are in a museum. Unlike Otto's engine these are two stroke atmospheric engines which are not in any way comparable.

Lenoir's engines were the first to be put into serial production with numbers sold being around 700.

The Otto engine which is the predecessor of the modern engine as specified by the VDI is Otto's fourth design.  He built the following engines:
*1861: a copy of Lenoir's atmospheric engine
*1862: a [[four cycle]] compressed charge engine (prior to Rochas's patent) which failed as it broke almost immediately
*1864: the first successful atmospheric engine
*1876: the [[four stroke]] compressed charge engine which is acknowledged as the "Otto" cycle engine. The term "Otto cycle" is applied to all compressed charge, four cycle engines.&lt;ref name="Otto Deutz"/&gt;

For all its commercial success, with the company producing 634 engines a year by 1875,&lt;ref&gt;Wise, David Burgess. "Daimler: Founder of the Four-Wheeler", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.482.&lt;/ref&gt; the Otto and Langen engine had hit a technical dead end: it produced only {{convert|3|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|lk=on}}, yet required {{convert|10|-|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} headroom to operate.&lt;ref name="Wise, p.482"&gt;Wise, p.482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto turned his attention to the four stroke cycle which he had failed at in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Dugald Clerk, "Gas and Oil Engines", Longman Green &amp; Co, 1897, pp.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Largely due to the efforts of Franz Rings and Herman Schumm, who were brought into the company by [[Gottlieb Daimler]] Otto succeeds in making the Four Stroke, Compressed Charge engine.&lt;ref name="Wise, p.482"/&gt; It is this engine (the Otto Silent Engine), and not the Otto &amp; Langen engine, to which the "Otto cycle" refers. This was the first commercially successful engine to use in-cylinder compression. The Rings-Schumm engine appeared in autumn 1876 and was immediately successful.&lt;ref name="Wise, p.482"/&gt;

Otto married Anna Gossi and the couple had seven recorded children. His son [[Gustav Otto]] grew up to become an aircraft builder.

==The Otto cycle==
{{main|Otto cycle}}
The [[Otto engine]] was designed as a stationary engine and in the action of the engine, the stroke is an upward or downward movement of a piston in a cylinder. Used later in an adapted form as an [[automobile]] [[engine]], four strokes are involved:

*(1) downward ''intake'' stroke—[[coal-gas]] and air enter the piston [[combustion chamber]], 
*(2) upward ''compression'' stroke—the [[piston]] compresses the mixture, 
*(3) downward ''power'' stroke—ignites the [[fuel mixture]] by flame and later [[electric spark]], 
*(4) upward ''exhaust'' stroke—releases [[exhaust gas]] from the piston chamber. Otto only sold his engine as a stationary motor.

==Earlier patents==
[[Image:Otto Engines - WMSTR Montage 2.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=13|320px|This is a video montage of the [[Otto engines]] running at the Western Minnesota Steam Threshers Reunion ([[WMSTR]]), in Rollag, Minnesota, USA (2min 16sec, 320x240, 340kbit/s video).]]

Otto had obtained many patents from several different nations and for several different features. When his former manager Gottlieb Daimler wanted to build small engines for transportation Otto showed no interest. Daimler left and took Maybach with him. Daimler had no desire to pay royalties to Otto ([[Deutz AG]]) and so hired a lawyer to find a solution. What the lawyer found was a patent for the concept of a four cycle engine that had been issued to [[Beau De Rochas]], a French engineer, in 1862. This resulted in Otto losing one of his patents and allowed Daimler to sell his engines in Germany without paying royalties. Neither Otto nor Daimler were aware of the Rochas patent. Rochas never built an engine. It is likely he could not have done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Scientist|date=9 September 1982|pages=714|edition=Vol 95 No 1322|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the inventions that are sometimes mentioned as having preceded the Otto engine, such as Marcus, Barsanti, etc. are for two cycle (two stroke) atmospheric engines which do not compress the fuel charge. Otto's atmospheric engine is not the VDI (and other associations) Otto engine type. The only significant engines were those from Lenoir. His engines were the first to go into serial production. Lenoir eventually sold approximately 700 engines.

==Production==
Over 50,000 engines were produced in the 17 years following introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyofscience2014.blogspot.com/2014/02/richard-jordan-gatling-inventor-of.html|title=History of Science 2014: Nikolaus August Otto|first=Da'vel|last=Johnson|date=17 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/inventorbios/76/Nikolaus-August-Otto.html|title=Nikolaus August Otto Biography (1832-1891)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Otto received numerous honors for his engines.  
*The 1864 atmospheric engine won the Gold Medal in the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|1867 World Exhibition in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=flvS-nJga8QC|title=Ways of the World: A History of the World's Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them|first=M. G.|last=Lay|date=24 October 1992|publisher=Rutgers University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1882 Otto received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of Würzburg]].&lt;ref name="Otto Deutz"/&gt;
*His home has been turned into a museum which is promoted by the local government.
*in 1936 Professor Nagël, head of the Association of German Engineers, decreed that DIN Standard 1940 specify that "Ottomotor" applies to all engines that draw in a fuel mix, compress it and ignite it by special device, thus replacing the terms such terms as "explosion motor", "detonation engine", "benzine engine", and "ignition engine."&lt;ref name="Otto Deutz"/&gt;

'''Open Course Library''' ('''OCL''') is an effort by the [[Washington (state)|State of Washington]] to identify and make available digitally, to community and technical college instructors and students across that state, free textbooks, interactive assignments, and videos. Instructional materials can be "a smorgasbord of teaching modules and exercises developed by other open-learning projects. . .

It emerged from a two-year discussion that ultimately produced a [http://www.sbctc.edu/docs/strategicplan/strategic_technology_plan.pdf Strategic Technology Plan].  The plan outlines a unified vision known as [http://opencourselibrary.wikispaces.com/file/view/Washington+State+Student+Completion+Initiative+final+7-17-09.pdf Washington Student Completion Initiative].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828 | title=The Open Course Library Project -- Creative Commons | publisher=Creative Commons | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Park, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process and organizational structure==

OCL participants were selected from a grant proposal competition.  The process, which led to production of the materials, was open and several preliminary Town Meetings were used employing Eluminate Live.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}  All participants were welcome.  The meetings are [http://opencourselibrary.wikispaces.com/Town+Hall+Meetings archived]. Topics for discussion included interactions with publishers, content presentation, copyright policies, and various [[Creative Commons|Creative Commons licenses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828 | title=The Open Course Library Project -- Creative Commons | publisher=Creative Commons | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Park, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful applicants received $15,000 to complete a course redesign.  Librarians, instructional designers and institutional researchers were also asked to apply.  Like faculty, these successful applicants also received grants of $15,000.  Each winning faculty member or team designed a ready-to-use digital course module. Teams were composed of community college instructors, librarians, and web-designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Open Course Library: Using Open Educational Resources to Improve Community College Access | publisher=Doctoral Dissertation, Washington State University | author=Goodwin, Mary Ann Lund | year=2011 | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2011 the first 42 courses created were released.  The use of OCL materials is not mandated for Washington's community colleges and technical schools.  Faculty course designers, however, are asked to adopt what they have designed.  There were over 25,000 visits from 125 countries over the first four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=State of Washington to Offer Materials as Texts: Money-saving effort at 2-year colleges faces vexing problems | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=9 January 2011 | author=Oberland, Martha Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, there have been challenges: good material is not always available online for adoption  and sometimes the best materials (for instance translations of primary sources published in foreign languages) are not available free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=State of Washington to Offer Online Materials, Instead of Textbooks, for 2-Year Colleges | author=Overland, Martha Ann | journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=14 January 2011 | volume=57 | issue=19 | pages=A12–A13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resource availability==
Courses are made accessible using the WashingtonOnline learning system.  Externally, OCL partners with the [[Saylor Foundation]], the [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions Consortium]], and the Open Courseware Consortium.  The Saylor site can be used access course content by self-learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/case-study-2-open-course-library-washington-state-colleges | title=Case Study 2: The Open Course Library of the Washington State Colleges | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=2 May 2012 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open Course Library and Open Educational Resources==

A goal of the project requires instructors to become aware of the o[[Open educational resources|pen educational resources]] (OERs) that are already available.  A complementary  goal is to share their content and adaptation by contributing to a global effort.  Both directly and indirectly, Cable Green, the project's then director, observed that it has resulted in the building of networks with like-minded individuals and institutions irrespective of geography.  An interest was also expressed in gauging use of materials and modules for the tenure and advancement of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828 | title=The Open Course Library Project -- Creative Commons | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for the effort==

A 2009 ''New York Times'' article reported that college students spend between $700 and $1,000 annually on textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/education/edlife/01spending-t.html?_r=0 Bookstores and Beyond] | work=The New York Times | date=1 November 2009 | author=Lewin, Tamar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-time tuition in the Washington system is approximately $3,000 annually, with textbooks costing approximately $1,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://education-portal.com/articles/Tom_Caswell_and_the_Open_Course_Library_Making_Education_Truly_Accessible.html | title=Tom Caswell and the Open Course Library: Making Education Truly Accessible | work=Education Insider News Blog | date=24 May 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Redd, Stacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community college tuition is lower than at most traditional four year institutions, and, therefore, textbook costs may be proportionally higher. Any number of digital copies of a free textbook can be made for the price of one.  Print-on demand copies generally cost under $10. Representative [[Reuven Carlyle]] (D-Seattle, Washington House of Representatives) estimates that because of OCL community college students saved over $1.25 million in textbook costs during the 2011-2012 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Legislative Taxes Aim at $9 Billion Textbook Industry | work=States News Service | date=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  OCL seeks to contribute to the creation of better courses and to reduce costs for students.  In this way it seeks to respond positively to the "completion" concerns outlined in the state's tipping point research report  of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828 | title=The Open Course Library Project -- Creative Commons | publisher=Creative Commons | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Park, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 2010 the Washington State Board for Community &amp; Technical Colleges (SBCTC) approved a state-level open licensing policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/case-study-2-open-course-library-washington-state-colleges | title=Case Study 2: The Open Course Library of the Washington State Colleges | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=2 May 2012 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All digital works created using grant funds administered by SBCTC must now carry a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution-only (CC BY)]] license.  This license allows materials created by one institution to be updated by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/case-study-2-open-course-library-washington-state-colleges | title=Case Study 2: The Open Course Library of the Washington State Colleges | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=2 May 2012 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was within this context that OCL was launched in 2010.  Nicole Allen, a textbook advocate for the national Student Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) commended the state for putting its money where its mouth is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2013373872_textbooks08m.html | title=Washington's 2-year colleges out to beat the high cost of textbooks | work=The Seattle Times | date=7 November 2010 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Long, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness assessment==

The results are reported  in [http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/PIRG%20OCL.pdf Affordable Textbooks for Washington Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library (2013)],&lt;ref name="http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/PIRG%20OCL.pdf"&gt;{{cite web | title=Affordable Textbooks For Washington's Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library | publisher=Student Public Interest Research Groups | year=2013 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt; an update of [http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/Affordable-Textbooks-For-Washingtons-Students.pdf Affordable Textbooks for Washington's Students: A Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library (2011)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/Affordable-Textbooks-For-Washingtons-Students.pdf | title=Affordable Textbooks For Washington's Students: A Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library | publisher=Student Public Interest Research Groups | author=Allen, Nicole | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter reported on the first phase of courses in October 2011.  In April 2013 the State Board announced the completion of all 81 courses and the updated report was released.  The report concluded:
* OCL has saved students $5,500,000 since inception.
* OCL materials cost 90% less than previously used materials.  The average OCL material costs $12, replacing the average priced $135 traditional item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Updated Cost Analysis of Open Course Library | work=Student PIRGs | date=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Students taking OCL courses save on average $96 per course.
* Student savings are more than three times  the original $1,800,000 invested.
* Two examples: By switching over to OCL material two community colleges have saved students $197,395 and $162,848 respectively. 
* Future Savings: A 2011 analysis projects savings as much as $41.6 if materials are adopted by all 410,000 enrolled students.

On the other hand, in January 2014 [[Chronicle of higher education|''The Chronicle of Higher Ed]]ucation'' ''reported that the effort to make free or low cost materials available in 42 courses was making little progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/open-course-library-sees-little-use-in-washingtons-community-colleges/50017 Open Course Library Sees Little Use in Washington Community Colleges] | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=31 January 2014 | author=Biemiller, Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a survey of community-college stores, with responses from 25 campuses, only nine said that any materials had been used in 17 of the 42 courses.  Only 2,386 of the 98,130 students enrolled in these courses, in 75 of the eligible 2,722 sections, used the materials. In 16 of the 75 sections students paid nothing; in the other 59 sections the average cost was $25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/open-course-library-sees-little-use-in-washingtons-community-colleges/50017 | title=Open Course Library Sees Little Use in Washington's Community Colleges | author=Biemiller, Lawrence | journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers reported the work of OnCampus Research, an arm of the National Association of College Stores,  which in fall 2013 sent a [http://www.nacs.org/Portals/NACS/Uploaded_Documents/PDF/Research/OCLresults2014.pdf survey] to 34 campus stores in the Washington Community and Technical College system.  The survey focused on the first 42, or phase one, courses.  It showed, according to the director of OnCampus Research, "that the recommendation of specific free or lower-priced course materials for popular courses did not equate to significant use of these materials by faculty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Use of Free or Low-Cost Materials Slow to Catch On | work=Education Letter | date=12 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Marty Brown, executive director of the Washington State Board of Community and Technical Colleges, took exception in a ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' piece he explained: "The study analyzes the use of OCL materials based on adoption information from campus bookstores. This methodology provides an incomplete picture, as bookstores are not always aware when faculty members assign free, digital resources. Therefore, the study's findings do not justify its conclusion that OCL has resulted in "insignificant" savings to students. The Student PIRGs estimates the OCL has saved students more than $5.5-million, more than triple the original investment. We believe this is very significant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bookstores' Study Mischaracterizes Washington State Open-Text Effort [letter] | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=6 February 2014 | author=Brown, Marty}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SPARC referred to the same presumed misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/blog/back-facts-washingtons-open-course-library | title=Back to Facts: Washington's Open Course Library | work=SPARC | date=18 February 2014 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reviewer states that OCL is best at "presenting introductory college course material in a condensed, simple manner via Google  docs or presentations."  It is noted, however, that the materials are not highly refined.  Further observing that "there's something to be said about grabbing an algebra quiz or those French vocabulary words quickly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opensource.com/education/13/7/open-course-library-review | title=Open Course Library's best resource: introductory college course materials | work=OpenSource.com | date=11 July 2012 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Fox, Carolyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctoral dissertation focused specifically on the project concludes in its abstract: ". . . that while faculty may be motivated to adopt new innovations like OER, for some, the time it takes to identify and integrate OER into courses presents a significant barrier to adoption." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Open Course Library: Using Open Educational Resources to Improve Community College Access -- Abstract | publisher=Doctoral dissertation, Washington State University | author=Goodwin, Mary Ann Lund | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term impact==

Washington State communities have integrated OCL into educational efforts in innovative ways.  For instance, [[Bellevue College]], Washington, the state's largest community college,  with help with a grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]], purchased 500 inexpensive netbook laptops in November 2011 for its students to rent for $35 per quarter to "download and read Internet material."  The anticipation was that the machines would also be used with OCL material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Textbooks? So Last Century, Rent a Netbook Instead | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=9 January 2011 | author=Overland, Martha Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its initiation, OCL is credited with inspiring open textbook initiatives by the legislatures of California (2012), British Columbia (2012) and actions by the legislatures of Illinois, Minnesota, and Virginia all similar to California's.  North Dakota proposed a resolution asking faculty and college administrations to support the use of open textbooks. Further, the [http://www.doleta.gov/taaccct/ Trade Adjustment Community College and Career Training grants program] requires that all material created using federal funds be available to the public through an open license.  Materials produced through this vehicle will be added to the OCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/PIRG%20OCL.pdf | title=Affordable Textbooks for Washington's College Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library | publisher=Student Public Interest Research Groups | date=30 April 2013 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saylor Foundation will create modular versions of the courses.  Project Kaleidoscope intends to modify OCL materials to meet the needs of California's community college students.  The department of education in São Paulo Brazil plans Portuguese translations of the courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/PIRG%20OCL.pdf | title=Affordable Textbooks for Washington's College Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library | publisher=Student Public Interest Research Groups | date=30 April 2013 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Packet Digital LLC''', headquartered in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], designs [[Power management integrated circuit|power management integrated circuits (PMICs)]] to reduce power consumed and heat produced by [[Server (computing)|computer servers]], [[mobile device]]s and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inforum.com/business/3688271-former-hewlett-packard-executive-using-experience-grow-fargo-packet-digital |title=Former Hewlett Packard executive using  experience to grow Fargo Packet Digital - INFORUM | publisher = Fargo Forum | date=February 26, 2015 | accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) ==

Packet Digital is designing circuitry for solar-powered UAS to more efficiently use electrical output from [[solar panel]]s on the aircraft wings and [[fuselage]] to power [[avionics]] and charge on-board [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. By reducing wasteful power dissipation, the company aims to increases flight times.

Packet Digital is designing [[power electronics]] to be used conjointly with advanced [[photovoltaics]] being developed by the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]], [[Washington, D.C.]] Ultimately, the two organizations want to help the Navy achieve unlimited flight times for its solar-powered UAS. The circuitry will implement high-frequency power tracking algorithms to accommodate dynamic movements of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or clouds that could change how much sunlight is absorbed and converted by the solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uasmagazine.com/articles/967/packet-digitals-technology-could-change-uas-perceptions |title=UAS Magazine – The Latest News on Unmanned Aerial Systems - Packet Digital's technology could change UAS perceptions | publisher = UAS Magazine | date=January 28, 2015 | accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Packet Digital announced in June 2015 that it would create Botlink LLC as a joint venture with drone app developer Aerobotic Innovations LLC. Botlink will develop and market a hardware-software platform combining Packet Digital's power management circuits for improved drone endurance and Aerobotic Innovation's cloud-based operations platform for safety, communications, data processing and control of a drone from a drag-and-drop app on a tablet or smartphone—a feature known as "Drag. Drop. Drone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inforum.com/business/3758895-botlink-packet-digital-join-forces-drone-platform |title=Botlink, Packet Digital join forces for drone platform | publisher = Fargo Forum | date=June 4, 2015 | accessdate=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership ==
In February 2015, it was announced Peter Lindgren, president and CEO of [[OtterBox|Otter Products]], and Linda Pancratz, retired chairman of the board and CEO of [[Thomson Directories|TDL Infomedia Limited]] in the United Kingdom, joined the Packet Digital board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prairiebizmag.com/event/article/id/22567/group/Prairie%20People/ |title=Packet Digital appoints board members | publisher= Prairie Business Journal | date=January 20, 2015 | accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Park Systems Corporation ==

'''Power History''' refers to the power of a [[nuclear reactor]] over an extended period of time.  Power history is important for calculations and operations that involve [[decay heat]] and [[Neutron poison#Fission Product Poison|fission product poisons]] and to avoid the [[iodine pit]] during reactor shutdowns.

For example, a nuclear reactor that has operated at 100% power for 100 hours and then has dropped down to 20% power for 5 hours will have a different amount of decay heat and fission product poisons than the same nuclear reactor operating at 20% power for 105 hours.  This is because the second reactor has a different power history.

In [[integrated circuit]]s, electrical power is distributed to the components of the chip over a network of conductors on the chip. '''Power network design''' includes the analysis and design of such networks. As in all engineering, this involves tradeoffs - the network must have adequate performance, be sufficiently reliable, but should not use more resources than required.

==Introduction==
The power distribution network distributes power and ground voltages from [[Wire bonding|pad]] locations to all devices in a design. [[Moore's law|Shrinking device dimension]]s, faster switching frequencies and increasing power consumption in deep sub-micrometer technologies cause large switching currents to flow in the power and ground networks which degrade performance and reliability. A robust power distribution network is essential to ensure reliable operation of circuits on a chip. Power supply integrity verification is a critical concern in high-performance designs. Due to the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the interconnects constituting the network, there is a voltage drop across the network, commonly referred to as the ''IR-drop''. The package supplies currents to the pads of the power grid either by means of package leads in wire-bond chips or through ''C4 bump arrays'' in [[flip chip]] technology. Although the resistance of package is quite small, the [[inductance]] of package leads is significant which causes a voltage drop at the pad locations due to the time varying current drawn by the devices on die. This voltage drop is referred to as the '' di/dt-drop''. Therefore, the voltage seen at the devices is the supply voltage minus the IR-drop and di/dt-drop.

Excessive voltage drops in the power grid reduce [[Delay calculation|switching speeds]] and noise margins of circuits, and inject [[Signal integrity|noise which might lead to functional failures]]. High average current densities lead to undesirable wearing out of metal wires due to [[electromigration]] (EM). Therefore, the challenge in the design of a power distribution network is in achieving excellent voltage regulation at the consumption points notwithstanding the wide fluctuations in power demand across the chip, and to build such a network using minimum area of the metal layers. These issues are prominent in high performance chips such as [[microprocessor]]s, since large amounts of power have to be distributed through a hierarchy of many metal layers. A robust power distribution network is vital in meeting performance guarantees and ensuring reliable operation.

Capacitance between power and ground distribution networks, referred to as [[decoupling capacitor]]s or ''decaps'', acts as local charge storage and is helpful in mitigating the voltage drop at supply points. Parasitic capacitance between metal wires of supply lines, device capacitance of the non-switching devices, and capacitance between N-well and substrate, occur as implicit decoupling capacitance in a power distribution network. Unfortunately, this implicit decoupling capacitance is sometimes not enough to constrain the voltage drop within safe bounds and designers often have to add intentional explicit decoupling capacitance structures on the die at strategic locations. These explicitly added decoupling capacitances are not free and increase the area and leakage power consumption of the chip. Parasitic interconnect [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], decoupling [[capacitance]] and package/interconnect [[inductance]] form a complex [[RLC circuit]] which has its own resonance frequency. If the resonance frequency lies close to the operating frequency of the design, large voltage drops can develop in the grid.

The crux of the problem in designing a power grid is that there are many unknowns until the very end of the design cycle. Nevertheless, decisions about the structure, size and layout of the power grid have to be made at very early stages when a large part of the chip design has not even begun. Unfortunately, most commercial tools focus on post-layout verification of the power grid when the entire chip design is complete and detailed information about the parasitics of the power and ground lines and the currents drawn by the transistors are known. Power grid problems revealed at this stage are usually very difficult or expensive to fix, so the preferred methodologies help to design an initial power grid and refine it progressively at various design stages.

Due to the growth in power consumption and switching speeds of modern high performance microprocessors, the '' di/dt'' effects are becoming a growing concern in high speed designs. [[Clock gating]], which is a preferred scheme for power management of high performance designs, can cause rapid surges in current demands of macro-blocks and increase ''di/dt'' effects. Designers rely on the on-chip parasitic capacitances and intentionally added decoupling capacitors to counteract the ''di/dt'' variations in the voltage. But it is necessary to model accurately the inductance and capacitance of the package and chip and analyze the grid with such models, as otherwise the amount of decoupling to be added might be underestimated or overestimated. Also it is necessary to maintain the efficiency of the analysis even when including these detailed models.

A critical issue in the analysis of power grids is the large size of the network (typically millions of nodes in a state-of-the-art microprocessor). Simulating all the non-linear devices in the chip together with the power grid is computationally infeasible. To make the size manageable, the simulation is done in two steps. First, the non-linear devices are simulated assuming perfect supply voltages and the currents drawn by the devices are measured. Next, these devices are modeled as independent time-varying current sources for simulating the power grid and the voltage drops at the transistors are measured. Since voltage drops are typically less than 10% of the power supply voltage, the error incurred by ignoring the interaction between the device currents and the supply voltage is small. By doing these two steps, the power grid analysis problem reduces to solving a linear network which is still quite large. To further reduce the network size, we can exploit the hierarchy in the power distribution models.

Note that the circuit currents are not independent due to signal correlations between blocks. This is addressed by deriving the inputs for individual blocks of the chip from the results of [[logic simulation]] using a common set of chip-wide input patterns. An important issue in power grid analysis is to determine what these input patterns should be. For IR-drop analysis, patterns that produce maximum instantaneous currents are required, whereas for electromigration purposes, patterns producing large sustained (average) currents are of interest.

Power grid analysis can be classified into ''input vector dependent''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allabouteda.com/voltage-drop-analysis-and-verification-piecewise-constant-current-sources AllAboutEDA: Voltage Drop analysis with piecewise constant current sources]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allabouteda.com/voltage-drop-analysis-and-verification-the-two-step-or-decoupled-approach/ AllAboutEDA: Voltage Drop analysis employing the two-step approach]&lt;/ref&gt; methods and ''vectorless''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allabouteda.com/voltage-drop-analysis-and-verification-static-constant-current-sources/ AllAboutEDA: Static voltage drop analysis and constant currents]&lt;/ref&gt; methods. The input vector pattern dependent methods employ search techniques to find a set of input patterns which cause the worst drop in the grid. A number of methods have been proposed in literature which use genetic algorithms or other search techniques to find vectors or a pattern of vectors that maximize the total current drawn from the supply network. Input vector-pattern dependent approaches are computationally intensive and are limited to circuit blocks rather than full-chip analysis. Furthermore, these approaches are inherently optimistic, underestimating the voltage drop and thus letting some of the supply noise problems go unnoticed. The vectorless approaches, on the other hand, aim to compute an upper bound on the worst-case drop in an efficient manner. These approaches have the advantage of being fast and conservative, but are sometimes too conservative, leading to overdesign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allabouteda.com/vectorless-methods-for-deriving-instantaneous-current/ AllAboutEDA: Vectorless methods for deriving instantaneous current values]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the literature on power network analysis deals with the issue of computing the worst voltage drops in the power network. Electromigration is an equally serious concern, but is attacked with almost identical methods. Instead of the voltage at each node, EM analysis solves for current in each branch, and instead of a voltage limit, there is a current limit per wire, depending on its layer and width.

Other IC applications may use only a portions of the flows mentioned here. A [[gate array]] or [[field programmable gate array]] (FPGA) designer, for example, will only do the design stages, since the detailed usage of these parts is not known when the power supply must be designed. Likewise, a user of FPGAs or gate arrays will only use the analysis portion, as the design is already fixed.

[[Image:Quantum efficiency graph for WFPC2-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|A graph showing variation of quantum efficiency with wavelength of a CCD chip in the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 3]].]]
The term '''quantum efficiency''' ('''QE''') may apply to '''incident photon to converted electron (IPCE) ratio''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Sean|title=2.5% efficient organic plastic solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=2001|volume=78|issue=6|doi=10.1063/1.1345834|url=http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v78/i6/p841_s1?bypassSSO=1|accessdate=20 May 2012|bibcode = 2001ApPhL..78..841S }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[photosensitivity|photosensitive device]] or it may refer to the [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|TMR effect]] of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction.

This article deals with the term as a measurement of a device's electrical sensitivity to light. In a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) it is the percentage of [[photon]]s hitting the device's photoreactive surface that produce [[charge carrier]]s. It is measured in [[electron]]s per photon or [[ampere|amps]] per [[watt]]. Since the energy of a photon is [[proportionality (mathematics)#Inversely proportional|inversely proportional]] to its [[wavelength]], QE is often measured over a range of different wavelengths to characterize a device's [[efficiency]] at each photon energy level. The QE for photons with energy below the [[band gap]] is zero. Photographic film typically has a QE of much less than 10%,&lt;ref name=Trager200&gt;{{cite book|last=Träger|first=Frank|title=Handbook of Lasers and Optics|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642194092|pages=601, 603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad5G1HWtDRgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA603#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; while CCDs can have a QE of well over 90% at some wavelengths.

==Of solar cells==
[[Image:Solarcellige-en.svg|thumb|right|400px|A graph showing variation of internal quantum efficiency, external quantum efficiency, and reflectance with wavelength of a crystalline silicon solar cell.]]

A [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell|solar cell's quantum efficiency]] value indicates the amount of current that the cell will produce when irradiated by photons of a particular wavelength. If the cell's quantum efficiency is [[integral|integrated]] over the whole [[sunlight|solar electromagnetic spectrum]], one can evaluate the amount of current that the cell will produce when exposed to sunlight. The ratio between this energy-production value and the highest possible energy-production value for the cell (i.e., if the QE were 100% over the whole spectrum) gives the cell's overall [[solar cell efficiency|energy conversion efficiency]] value. Note that in the event of [[multiple exciton generation]] (MEG), quantum efficiencies of greater than 100% may be achieved since the incident photons have more than twice the [[band gap]] energy and can create two or more electron-hole pairs per incident photon.

===Types===
Two types of quantum efficiency of a solar cell are often considered:

*'''External Quantum Efficiency (EQE)''' is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy ''shining on the solar cell from outside'' (incident photons).
*'''Internal Quantum Efficiency (IQE)''' is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy that shine on the solar cell from outside ''and'' are absorbed by the cell.

The IQE is always larger than the EQE. A low IQE indicates that the active layer of the solar cell is unable to make good use of the photons. To measure the IQE, one first measures the EQE of the solar device, then measures its transmission and reflection, and combines these data to infer the IQE.

:&lt;math&gt; \text{EQE} = \frac{\text{electrons/sec}}{\text{photons/sec}}= \frac{\text{(current)}/\text{(charge of one electron)}}{(\text{total power of photons})/(\text{energy of one photon})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{IQE} = 
\frac{\text{electrons/sec}}{\text{absorbed photons/sec}}= 
\frac{\text{EQE}}{\text{1-Reflection}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The external quantum efficiency therefore depends on both the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light and the collection of charges. Once a photon has been absorbed and has generated an electron-hole pair, these charges must be separated and collected at the junction. A "good" material avoids charge recombination. Charge recombination causes a drop in the external quantum efficiency.

The ideal quantum efficiency graph has a [[Boxcar function|square shape]], where the QE value is fairly constant across the entire spectrum of wavelengths measured. However, the QE for most solar cells is reduced because of the effects of recombination, where charge carriers are not able to move into an external circuit. The same mechanisms that affect the collection probability also affect the QE. For example, modifying the front surface can affect carriers generated near the surface. And because high-energy (blue) light is absorbed very close to the surface, considerable recombination at the front surface will affect the "blue" portion of the QE. Similarly, lower energy (green) light is absorbed in the bulk of a solar cell, and a low diffusion length will affect the collection probability from the solar cell bulk, reducing the QE in the green portion of the spectrum. Generally, solar cells on the market today do not produce much electricity from [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] light (&lt;400&amp;nbsp;nm and &gt;1100&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths, respectively); these wavelengths of light are either filtered out or are absorbed by the cell, thus heating the cell. That heat is wasted energy, and could damage the cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/08/21/silicon-nanoparticle-film-can-increase-solar-cell-performance/ Silicon nanoparticle film can increase solar cell performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantum efficiency of Image Sensors''' :
Quantum efficiency (QE) is the fraction of photon flux that contributes to the photocurrent in a photodetector or
a pixel. Quantum efficiency is one of the most important parameters used to evaluate the quality of a detector and is often called the spectral response to reflect its wavelength dependence. It is defined as the number of signal electrons created per incident photon. In some cases it can exceed 100% (i.e. when more than one electron is created per incident photon).

'''EQE mapping''' :
Conventional measurement of the EQE will give the efficiency of the overall device. However it is often useful to have a map of the EQE over large area of the device. This mapping provides an efficient way to visualize the homogeneity and/or the defects in the sample. It was realized by researchers from the Institute of Researcher and Development on Photovoltaic Energy (IRDEP) who calculated the EQE mapping from electroluminescence measurements taken with an [[hyperspectral]] imager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delamarre |display-authors=etal  |title=Evaluation of micrometer scale lateral fluctuations of transport properties in CIGS solar cells |journal=Proc. SPIE  |volume=100 |date=2013 | doi=10.1117/12.2004323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Delamarre |display-authors=etal |title=Quantitative luminescence mapping of Cu(In,Ga)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin-film solar cells |journal=Progress in Photovoltaics |date=2014 | doi=10.1002/pip.2555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectral responsivity==
[[responsivity|Spectral responsivity]] is a similar measurement, but it has different units: [[ampere]]s per [[watt]] (A/W); (i.e. how much [[electric current|current]] comes out of the device per incoming photon of a given energy and wavelength). Both the quantum efficiency and the responsivity are functions of the photons' wavelength (indicated by the subscript λ).

To convert from responsivity (''R&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'', in A/W) to QE&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rogalski, K. Adamiec and J. Rutkowski, ''Narrow-Gap Semiconductor Photodiodes'', SPIE Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; (on a scale 0 to 1):

:&lt;math&gt;QE_\lambda=\frac{R_\lambda}{\lambda}\times\frac{h c}{e}\approx\frac{R_\lambda}{\lambda} {\times} (1240\;{\rm W}\cdot {\rm nm/A})  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ'' is the wavelength in [[nanometre|nm]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, and ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]].

===Determination===
:&lt;math&gt;QE_\lambda=\eta =\frac{N_e}{N_\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_e&lt;/math&gt; = number of electrons produced, &lt;math&gt;N_\nu&lt;/math&gt; = number of photons absorbed.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_\nu}t = \Phi_o \frac{\lambda}{hc}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming each photon absorbed in the depletion layer produces a viable electron-hole pair, and all other photons do not,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_e}t = \Phi_{\xi}\frac{\lambda}{hc}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the measurement time (in seconds), 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_o&lt;/math&gt; = incident optical power in watts, 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; = optical power absorbed in depletion layer, also in watts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4440">'''RTCA, Inc.''', formerly known as ('''Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics'''), is a [[United States]] volunteer organization that develops technical guidance for use by government regulatory authorities and by industry. It was founded in 1935, and was re-incorporated in 1991 as a private not-for-profit corporation.  It has over 200 committees and overall acts as an advisory body to the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]. In 1948 [[Special Committee 31]] recommended that a common air traffic control system be developed for all aircraft flown in the United States. 

Requirements for membership include a fee that is based on information in the application for membership, and an interest in aviation.  RTCA is sponsored as a [[Federal Advisory Committee]] by the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA).  Guidance documents are developed and drafted by Special Committee (SC) and are based on a [[consensus]] developed within the SC charged with responsibility for the given document.  Despite the loosely defined requirements of membership in RTCA, the guidance documents are based on expert technical opinion.

RTCA's objectives include but are not limited to:
* ensuring the safety and reliability of airborne systems;
* developing minimum operational performance requirements for document-specific systems; 
* developing guidelines for use by a regulatory authority, the given authority determines appropriate; 
* providing administrative and logistics resources that enable teamwork among the worldwide aviation community (e.g., [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] and the [[International Telecommunication Union]] and others).

Although RTCA is sponsored by the FAA, RTCA is not an agency of the United States government.  Hence the documents it publishes are treated as guidelines, not as requirements.

==Special Committee 31==
'''Special Committee 31''' was formed by members of the RTCA to predict the future needs of the United States' air traffic control system. This report recommended a common air traffic control system be developed that would serve the needs of both military and civilian aircraft. &lt;ref name="Nolan, 1999"&gt;Nolan, M.S. (1999).

Brooks/Cole Publishing Company: Pacific Grove, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  They released a final report of their recommendations on May 12, 1948; this report made several requirements of future air traffic control systems (as listed in &lt;ref name="Nolan, 1999"/&gt;): 

#The new system must permit aircraft to be flown safely.
#It must improve the flow of air traffic.
#Any airborne equipment must be both simple and lightweight.
#Any new system must impose a minimum burden on the pilot or ground personnel.
#The installed equipment must require a minimum of funding from taxpayers, airlines, or private pilots.

To meet these requirements the report recommended installation of airport surveillance radar and installation of [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR)/[[distance measuring equipment]] (DME) on aircraft. In addition the report made several other recommendations such as installing [[transponders]] to aircraft to provide altitude and identification information to ground-based radar and to install precision approach radar to improve the capability of aircraft to land in poor weather conditions.

In 1948 the Air Navigation Development Board (ANDB) was formed to oversee the implementation of the ATC system described in SC-31.  There were immediate problems such as budgetary restraints (from the ongoing war) and a concurrent effort by the military to pursue an incompatible system ([[Tactical Air Navigation]]; TACAN). In general though, the SC-31 was instrumental in laying the groundwork for the next-generation air traffic system.

[[File:Realtimeclock Motherboard Baby AT crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dallas Semiconductor]] (DS1387) real-time clock from an older PC. This version also contains a battery-backed SRAM.]]
A '''real-time clock''' ('''RTC''') is a [[computer]] [[clock]] (most often in the form of an [[integrated circuit]]) that keeps track of the current [[time]].

Although the term often refers to the devices in [[personal computer]]s, [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[embedded system]]s, RTCs are present in almost any electronic device which needs to keep accurate time. A common RTC used in [[single-board computer]]s is the [[Maxim Integrated]] DS1307.

==Terminology==
The term ''real-time clock'' is used to avoid confusion with ordinary [[clock signal|hardware clocks]] which are only [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] that govern [[digital electronics]], and do not count time in human units. RTC should not be confused with [[real-time computing]], which shares its [[three-letter acronym]] but does not directly relate to time of day.

==Purpose==
Although keeping time can be done without an RTC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Frees the main system for time-critical tasks
* Sometimes more accurate than other methods

A [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver can shorten its startup time by comparing the current time, according to its RTC, with the time at which it last had a valid signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|5893044|Real time clock apparatus for fast acquisition or GPS signals}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it has been less than a few hours, then the previous [[ephemeris]] is still usable.

==Power source==
[[File:Inside the Real-time clock IC vnutri u nei neonka.jpg|thumb|Lithium battery inside the real-time clock IC]]
RTCs often have an alternate source of power, so they can continue to keep time while the primary source of power is off or unavailable. This alternate source of power is normally a [[lithium battery]] in older systems, but some newer systems use a [[supercapacitor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Most RTCs use a [[crystal oscillator]],&lt;ref name="ST_AN10337"&gt;{{Citation

Many commercial RTC ICs are accurate to less than 5 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highly Accurate Real-Time Clocks|url=https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/digital/real-time-clocks/highly-accurate-real-time-clocks.html|publisher=Maxim Semiconductors|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practical terms, this is good enough to perform [[celestial navigation]], the classic task of a [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]]. In 2011, [[Chip-scale atomic clock]]s were invented. Although more expensive, they keep time within 100 nanoseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chip Scale Atomic Clock|url=https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/clocks-frequency-references/3824-chip-scale-atomic-clock-csac|website=Microsemi|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:AT Motherboard RTC and BIOS.jpg|thumb|right|This chip, labeled ODIN, is a generic equivalent to a particular Dallas RTC.]]
Many [[integrated circuit]] manufacturers make RTCs, including [[Epson]], [[Intersil]], [[Integrated Device Technology|IDT]], [[Maxim Integrated Products|Maxim]], [[NXP Semiconductors]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[STMicroelectronics]] and [[Ricoh]].

The RTC was introduced to PC compatibles by the [[IBM PC/AT]] in 1984, which used a [[Motorola]] MC146818 RTC. Later, [[Dallas Semiconductor]] made compatible RTCs, which were often used in older [[personal computer]]s, and are easily found on [[motherboard]]s because of their distinctive black battery cap and [[silkscreen]]ed logo.

In newer systems, the RTC is integrated into the [[Southbridge (computing)|southbridge]] chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some [[microcontroller]]s have a real-time clock built in, generally only the ones with many other features and [[peripheral]]s.

===Radio-based RTCs===
Some modern computers receive clock information by digital radio and use it to promote time-standards. There are two common methods: Most cell phone protocols (e.g. [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) directly provide the current local time.  If an internet radio is available, a computer may use the [[Network Time Protocol|network time protocol]]. Computers used as local time servers occasionally use [[GPS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS Clock Synchronization|url=https://spectracom.com/resources/essential-education/gps-clock-synchronization|publisher=Spectracom|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ultra-low frequency radio transmissions broadcast by a national standards organization (i.e. a [[radio clock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Product: USB Radio Clock|url=https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/products/usb-wwvb-clock.htm|publisher=Meinburg|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Historic RTCs===
Some older [[computer]] designs such as [[Data General Nova|Nova]]s and [[PDP-8]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Digital Equipment Corp.|title=PDP-8/E Small Computer Handbook, 19|url=https://www.grc.com/pdp-8/docs/PDP-8_Small_Computer_Handbook_1972.pdf|publisher=Gibson Research|accessdate=12 November 2016|pages=7-25, the DK8EA}}&lt;/ref&gt; used a real-time clock that was notable for its high accuracy, simplicity, flexibility and low cost. The computer's power supply produces a pulse at logic voltages for either each half-wave or each zero crossing of AC mains. A wire carries the pulse to an interrupt. The interrupt handler software counts cycles, seconds, etc. In this way, it can provide an entire clock and calendar.

The clock also usually formed the basis of computers' software timing chains; e.g. it was usually the timer used to switch tasks in an operating system. Counting timers used in modern computers provide similar features at lower precision, and may trace their requirements to this type of clock. (e.g. in the PDP-8, the mains-based clock, model DK8EA, came first, and was later followed by a crystal-based clock, DK8EC.) 

A software-based clock must be set each time its computer is turned on. Originally this was done by computer operators. When the Internet became commonplace, [[network time protocol]]s were used to automatically set clocks of this type.

In Europe, North America and some other grids, this RTC works because the frequency of the AC mains is adjusted to have a long-term frequency accuracy as good as the national standard clocks.  That is, in those grids this RTC is superior to quartz clocks and less costly. 

This design of RTC is not practical in portable computers or grids (e.g. in South Asia) that do not regulate the frequency of AC mains. Also it might be thought inconvenient without Internet access to set the clock.

== Clockless CPUs ==
Some motherboards are made without real time clocks. The real time clock is omitted either out of the desire to save money (as in the [[Raspberry Pi]] system architecture) or because real time clocks may not be needed at all (as in the [[List of Arduino boards and compatible systems|Arduino]] system architecture).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1743">The '''Runway Awareness and Advisory System (RAAS)''' is an electronic detection system that notifies aircraft flight crews on the ground of their position relative to their allocated [[runway]].

==Operation==
[[File:SmartRunway.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A view from the SmartRunway system that is often added to RAAS.]] RAAS functions by providing audible alerts to confirm runway identification, and also provides an aural alarm if it detects undue acceleration (indicating an attempt to [[takeoff|take off]]) while the aircraft is on any [[taxiway]] instead of a designated runway.  Its function is possible by a software enhancement to the aircraft's [[terrain awareness and warning system]] (TAWS) or [[Ground proximity warning system|enhanced ground proximity warning system]] (EGPWS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/categories/commercial/853.html&lt;/ref&gt; The system was developed by [[Honeywell Aerospace|Honeywell]].

==Entrance into service==
[[Alaska Airlines]] announced in September 2008 that its entire airline fleet of [[Boeing 737]]s will be equipped with RAAS by the end of September.  That will be the first airline fleet to be completely equipped with this system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]], Vol. 169 No. 10, 15 September 2008, "RAAS-Ready", p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the largest European low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] announced it would equip their entire fleet by the end of 2016 with RAAS as an investment in its commitment to safety.

The '''S-procedure''' or '''S-lemma''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] result that gives conditions under which a particular quadratic inequality is a consequence of another quadratic inequality. The S-procedure was developed independently in a number of different contexts&lt;ref&gt;Frank Uhlig, ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0024-3795(79)90020-X A recurring theorem about pairs of quadratic forms and extensions: a survey]'', Linear Algebra and its Applications, Volume 25, 1979, pages 219–237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imre Pólik and Tamás Terlaky, ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1137/S003614450444614X A Survey of the S-Lemma]'', SIAM Review, Volume 49, 2007, Pages 371–418.&lt;/ref&gt; and has applications in [[control theory]], [[linear algebra]] and [[mathematical optimization]].

== Statement of the S-procedure == 
Let F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be symmetric matrices, g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be vectors and h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be real numbers. Assume that there is some x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that the strict inequality &lt;math&gt;x_0^T F_1 x_0 + 2g_1^T x_0 + h_1 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; holds. Then the implication 
::&lt;math&gt;x^T F_1 x + 2g_1^T x + h_1 \le 0 \Longrightarrow x^T F_2 x + 2g_2^T x + h_2 \le 0&lt;/math&gt;
holds if and only if there exists some nonnegative number λ such that 
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda \begin{bmatrix} F_1 &amp; g_1 \\ g_1^T &amp; h_1 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} F_2 &amp; g_2 \\ g_2^T &amp; h_2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

An automotive '''scan tool''' (scanner) is an electronic tool used to interface with, diagnose and, sometimes, reprogram [[Electronic Control Unit|vehicle control modules]].

There are many types from just as many manufacturers, one of the most familiar being the [[Snap-On]] "brick", or MT2500/MTG2500.  Snap-On, OTC/SPX, Autel, Launch, Vetronix/Bosch and a number of other companies produce various types of scan tools, from simple code readers to highly capable bi-directional computers with programming capabilities.
The scan tool is connected to the vehicle's [[Data link connector (automotive)|data link connector]] (DLC) and, depending on the particular tool, may only read out diagnostic trouble codes or DTC's (this would be considered a "code reader") or may have more capabilities. Actual scan tools will display live data stream (inputs and outputs), have bi-directional controls (the ability to make the controllers do things outside of normal operations) and may even be able to calibrate/program modules within certain parameters.  However, a typical scan tool does not have the ability to fully reprogram modules because it requires a [[pass through device (automotive)|pass-through device]] and specific software.

In [[telecommunications]], '''squelch''' is a [[Telecommunication circuit|circuit]] function that acts to suppress the [[sound reproduction|audio]] (or [[video]]) output of a [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] in the absence of a sufficiently strong desired input [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]].  Squelch is widely used in [[two-way radio]]s and [[radio scanner]]s to suppress the sound of channel [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] when the radio is not receiving a transmission. Squelch can be 'opened', which allows all signals entering the receiver to be heard. This can be useful when trying to hear distant or otherwise weak signals (also known as [[DXing]]).

==Carrier squelch==
A '''carrier squelch''' or '''noise squelch''' is the most simple variant of all. It operates strictly on the [[signal strength]], such as when a [[television]] [[Silence|mute]]s the audio or blanks the video on "empty" [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]], or when a [[walkie-talkie]] mutes the audio when no signal is present. In some designs, the squelch threshold is preset. For example, television squelch settings are usually preset. Receivers in [[base station]]s, or [[repeater]]s at remote mountain top sites, are usually not adjustable remotely from the control point.

In [[two-way radio]]s (also known as [[radiotelephone]]s), the received signal level required to unsquelch (un-mute) the receiver may be fixed or adjustable with a knob or a sequence of button presses. Typically the operator will adjust the control until noise is heard, and then adjust in the opposite direction until the noise is squelched.  At this point, a weak signal will unsquelch the receiver and be heard by the operator.  Further adjustment will increase the level of signal required to unsquelch the receiver. 

A typical [[Frequency modulation|FM]] two-way radio carrier squelch circuit is noise-operated. To minimize the effects of voice audio on squelch operation, the audio from the receiver's detector is passed through a [[high-pass filter]], typically passing 4,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (4&amp;nbsp;kHz) and above, leaving only high frequency noise. The squelch control adjusts the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of an [[amplifier]] which varies the level of the noise coming out of the filter. This noise is [[rectifier|rectified]], producing a [[Direct current|DC voltage]] when [[Electronic noise|noise]] is present. The presence of continuous noise on an idle channel creates a DC voltage which turns the receiver audio off. When a signal with little or no noise is received, the noise-derived voltage is reduced and the receiver audio is unmuted. Some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio muting control voltage, as a "signal present" indication; for example, in a [[repeater]] the act of the receiver unmuting will switch on the transmitter.

==Tone squelch and selective calling==
{{main|Selective calling}}

Tone squelch, or another form of selective calling, is sometimes used to solve interference problems. Where more than one user is on the same channel (''co-channel'' users), selective calling addresses a subset of all receivers. Instead of turning on the receiver audio for any signal, the audio turns on only in the presence of the correct selective calling code. This is akin to the use of a lock on a door. A carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in. Selective calling locks out all signals except ones with the correct key to the lock (the correct code).

In non-critical uses, selective calling can also be used to hide the presence of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as inexpensive police scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments. The interference will still be present, and will still degrade system performance, but by using selective calling the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.

Four different techniques are commonly used. Selective calling can be regarded as a form of [[in-band signaling]].

===CTCSS===
{{main|Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System}}

'''CTCSS''' (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System) continuously superimposes any one of about 50 low-pitch audio [[pitch (music)|tone]]s on the transmitted signal, ranging from 67 to 254 [[Hertz|Hz]]. The original tone set was 10, then 32 tones, and has been expanded even further over the years. CTCSS is often called ''PL tone'' (for ''Private Line'', a [[trademark]] of [[Motorola]]), or simply ''tone squelch''. [[General Electric]]'s implementation of CTCSS is called ''Channel Guard'' (or ''CG''). [[RCA|RCA Corporation]] used the name ''Quiet Channel'', or ''QC''. There are many other company-specific names used by radio vendors to describe compatible options. Any CTCSS system that has compatible tones is interchangeable. Old and new radios with CTCSS and radios across manufacturers are compatible.

===SelCall===
{{main|Selcall}}

'''Selcall''' (Selective Calling) transmits a burst of up to five in-band audio tones at the beginning of each transmission. This feature (sometimes called "tone burst") is common in European systems. Early systems used one tone (commonly called "Tone Burst"). Several tones were used, the most common being 1,750Hz, which is still used in European amateur radio repeater systems. The addressing scheme provided by one tone was not enough, so a two-tone system was devised—one tone followed by a second tone (sometimes called a "1+1" system). Motorola later marketed a system called "Quik-Call" that used two simultaneous tones followed by two more simultaneous tones (sometimes called a "2+2" system) that was heavily used by fire department dispatch systems in the USA. Later selective call systems used paging system technology that made use of a burst of five sequential tones.

===DCS===
&lt;!-- Please leave "DCS" header intact for targeted link from "Digital-Coded Squelch", if changing header, please change that article to match --&gt;
'''DCS''' (Digital-Coded Squelch), generically known as ''CDCSS'' (Continuous Digital-Coded Squelch System), was designed as the digital replacement for CTCSS. In the same way that a single CTCSS tone would be used on an entire group of radios, the same DCS code is used in a group of radios. DCS is also referred to as ''Digital Private Line'' (or ''DPL''), another trademark of Motorola, and likewise, General Electric's implementation of DCS is referred to as ''Digital Channel Guard'' (or ''DCG''). DCS is also called ''DTCS'' (Digital Tone Code Squelch) by [[Icom Incorporated|Icom]], and other names by other manufacturers. Radios with DCS options are generally compatible, provided the radio's encoder-decoder will use the same code as radios in the existing system.

DCS adds a 134.4 [[bits per second|bps]] (sub-audible) bitstream to the transmitted audio. The code word is a 23-bit [[Binary_Golay_code|Golay]] (23,12) code which has the ability to detect and correct errors of 3 or fewer bits. The word consists of 12 data bits followed by 11 check bits. The last 3 data bits are a fixed '001', this leaves 9 code bits (512 possibilities) which are conventionally represented as a 3-digit [[octal]] number. Note that the first bit transmitted is the LSB, so the code is "backwards" from the transmitted bit order. Only 84 of the 512 possible codes are available, to prevent falsing due to alignment collisions.

===XTCSS===
'''XTCSS''' is the newest signalling technique, and provides 99 codes with the added advantage of "silent operation". XTCSS-fitted radios are purposed to enjoy more privacy and flexibility of operation. XTCSS is implemented as a combination of CTCSS and in-band signalling.

==Uses==
{{howto|section|date=August 2012}}
Squelch was invented first and is still in wide use in two-way radio, especially in the [[amateur radio]] world. Squelch of any kind is used to indicate loss of signal, which is used to keep commercial and [[amateur radio repeater]]s from continually [[transmitting]]. Since a carrier squelch receiver cannot tell a valid carrier from a spurious signal (noise, etc.), CTCSS is often used as well, as it avoids false keyups. Use of CTCSS is especially helpful on congested frequencies or on frequency bands prone to [[Skip (radio)|skip]] and during band openings.

It is a bad idea to use any coded squelch system to hide interference issues in systems with life-safety or public-safety uses such as police, fire, search and rescue or ambulance company dispatching. Adding tone or digital squelch to a radio system does not solve interference issues, it just covers them up. The presence of interfering signals should be corrected rather than masked. Interfering signals masked by tone squelch will produce apparently random missed messages. The intermittent nature of interfering signals will make the problem difficult to reproduce and troubleshoot. Users will not understand why they cannot hear a call, and will lose confidence in their radio system.

Professional [[wireless microphone]]s use squelch to avoid reproducing noise when the receiver does not receive enough signal from the microphone. Most professional models have adjustable squelch, usually set with a screwdriver adjustment or front-panel control on the receiver.

'''Staggered tuning''' is a technique used in the design of multi-stage [[tuned amplifier]]s whereby each stage is tuned to a slightly different frequency.  In comparison to '''synchronous tuning''' (where each stage is tuned identically) it produces a wider [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] at the expense of reduced [[Gain (electronics)|gain]].  It also produces a sharper [[transition band|transition]] from the [[passband]] to the [[stopband]].  Both staggered tuning and synchronous tuning circuits are easier to tune and manufacture than many other filter types.

The function of stagger-tuned circuits can be expressed as a [[rational function]] and hence they can be designed to any of the major filter responses such as [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] and [[Chebyshev filter|Chebyshev]].   The [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of the circuit are easy to manipulate to achieve the desired response because of the amplifier buffering between stages.

Applications include television [[Intermediate frequency|IF amplifiers]] (mostly 20th century receivers) and [[wireless LAN]].

== Rationale ==
[[File:Stagger-tuned 3-stage amplifier.svg|thumb|center|upright=3|A typical multi-stage tuned amplifier.  The amplifier is synchronously tuned if all LC-circuits are tuned at the same frequency, which occurs if all the products ''C''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; are equal. In staggered tuning, the products ''C''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; are generally different in each stage.]]

Staggered tuning improves the bandwidth of a multi-stage tuned amplifier at the expense of the overall gain.  Staggered tuning also increases the steepness of passband [[skirt (filtering)|skirts]] and hence improves [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Pederson &amp; Mayaram, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Synchronous tuned plot.svg|thumb|upright 1.5|Plot showing the reduction of bandwidth caused by synchronous tuning with increasing number of stages, ''n''.  The ''Q'' of each stage is 10 in this example.]]
The value of staggered tuning is best explained by first looking at the shortcomings of tuning every stage identically.  This method is called '''synchronous tuning'''.  Each stage of the amplifier will reduce the bandwidth.  In an amplifier with multiple identical stages, the {{nowrap|[[3 dB point]]s}} of the response after the first stage will become the {{nowrap|6 dB}} points of the second stage.  Each successive stage will add a further {{nowrap|3 dB}} to what was the band edge of the first stage.  Thus the {{nowrap|3 dB}} bandwidth becomes progressively narrower with each additional stage.&lt;ref&gt;Sedha, p. 627&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, a four-stage amplifier will have its {{nowrap|3 dB}} points at the {{nowrap|0.75 dB}} points of an individual stage.  The [[fractional bandwidth]] of an LC circuit is given by,
:&lt;math&gt; B = {\sqrt{m-1} \over Q} &lt;/math&gt;
:where ''m'' is the power ratio of the power at resonance to that at the band edge frequency (equal to 2 for the {{nowrap|3 dB}} point and 1.19 for the {{nowrap|0.75 dB}} point) and ''Q'' is the [[quality factor]].
[[File:Staggered and synchronous comparison.svg|thumb|upright 1.5|Comparison of synchronous and staggered tuning responses]]
The bandwidth is thus reduced by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  In terms of the number of stages &lt;math&gt;m = 2^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Chattopadhyay, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the four stage synchronously tuned amplifier will have a bandwidth of only 19% of a single stage.  Even in a two-stage amplifier the bandwidth is reduced to 41% of the original.  Staggered tuning allows the bandwidth to be widened at the expense of overall gain.  The overall gain is reduced because when any one stage is at resonance (and thus maximum gain) the others are not, unlike synchronous tuning where all stages are at maximum gain at the same frequency.  A two-stage stagger-tuned amplifier will have a gain {{nowrap|3 dB}} less than a synchronously tuned amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;Maheswari &amp; Anand, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in a design that is intended to be synchronously tuned, some staggered tuning effect is inevitable because of the practical impossibility of keeping all tuned circuits perfectly in step and because of feedback effects.  This can be a problem in very narrow band applications where essentially only one spot frequency is of interest, such as a [[local oscillator]] feed or a [[wave trap]].  The overall gain of a synchronously tuned amplifier will always be less than the theoretical maximum because of this.&lt;ref&gt;Pederson &amp; Mayaram, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

Both synchronously tuned and stagger-tuned schemes have a number of advantages over schemes that place all the tuning components in a single aggregated filter circuit separate from the amplifier such as [[ladder network]]s or [[Coupling coefficient of resonators#Coupling coefficients in filter theory|coupled resonator]]s.  One advantage is that they are easy to tune.  Each resonator is buffered from the others by the amplifier stages so have little effect on each other.  The resonators in aggregated circuits, on the other hand, will all interact with each other, particularly their nearest neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Iniewski, pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;  Another advantage is that the components need not be close to ideal.  Every LC resonator is directly working into a resistor which lowers the ''Q'' anyway so any losses in the L and C components can be absorbed into this resistor in the design.  Aggregated designs usually require high ''Q'' resonators.  Also, stagger-tuned circuits have resonator components with values that are quite close to each other and in synchronously tuned circuits they can be identical.  The spread of component values is thus less in stagger-tuned circuits than in aggregated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Wiser, pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Tuned amplifiers such as the one illustrated at the beginning of this article can be more generically depicted as a chain of [[transconductance]] amplifiers each loaded with a tuned circuit.

[[File:Stagger tuned amplifier generic.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.5|Generic multi-stage tuned amplifier]]

:where for each stage (omitting the suffixes)
:''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplifier transconductance
:''C'' is the tuned circuit capacitance
:''L'' is the tuned circuit inductance
:''G'' is the sum of the amplifier output conductance and the input conductance of the next amplifier.

=== Stage gain ===
The gain ''A''(''s''), of one stage of this amplifier is given by;
:&lt;math&gt; A(s) = \frac {g_\mathrm m sL}{s^2LC + sLG +1} &lt;/math&gt;
:where ''s'' is the [[complex frequency]] operator.

This can be written in a more generic form, that is, not assuming that the resonators are the LC type, with the following substitutions,

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_0 = {1 \over \sqrt {LC}} &lt;/math&gt; (the resonant frequency)
:&lt;math&gt; A_0 := A(\omega_0) = \frac {g_\mathrm m}{G} &lt;/math&gt; (the gain at resonance)
:&lt;math&gt; Q = {1 \over \omega_0 LG} &lt;/math&gt; (the stage quality factor)

Resulting in,

:&lt;math&gt; A(s) = A_0 \frac {s \omega_0}{s^2 Q + s \omega_0 + \omega_0^2 Q} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Stage bandwidth ===

The gain expression can be given as a function of (angular) frequency by making the substitution {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} ''iω''}} where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]] and ''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]]

:&lt;math&gt; A(\omega) = A_0 \frac {i \omega \omega_0}{i \omega \omega_0 +\omega_0^2 Q - \omega^2 Q} &lt;/math&gt;

The frequency at the band edges, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, can be found from this expression by equating the value of the gain at the band edge to the magnitude of the expression,

:&lt;math&gt; |A(\omega_c)| = \frac {A_0}{\sqrt m} &lt;/math&gt;
:where ''m'' is defined as above and equal to two if the {{nowrap|3 dB}} points are desired.

Solving this for ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and taking the difference between the two positive solutions finds the bandwidth Δ''ω'',

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega_\mathrm c = \omega_{\mathrm c1} - \omega_{\mathrm c2} = \frac {\omega_0 \sqrt{(m-1)}}{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

and the fractional bandwidth ''B'',

:&lt;math&gt; B := \frac {\Delta \omega_\mathrm c}{\omega_0} = \frac {\sqrt{m-1}}{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Overall response ===
[[File:Stagger tuned plot.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Gain response of a two-stage stagger-tuned amplifier.  The stage {{nowrap|3 dB}} fractional bandwidth is 0.125, but the overall bandwidth is increased to approximately 0.52.]]
[[File:Stagger tuned plot with Q.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Gain response of a two-stage stagger-tuned amplifier for various values of stage ''Q'']]
The overall response of the amplifier is given by the product of the individual stages,

:&lt;math&gt; A_\mathrm T = A_1 A_2 A_3 \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

It is desirable to be able to design the filter from a standard [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] [[prototype filter]] of the required specification.  Frequently, a smooth [[Butterworth response]] will be chosen&lt;ref&gt;Sedha, p. 627&lt;/ref&gt; but [[network synthesis filters|other polynomial functions]] can be used that allow [[Ripple (electrical)#Frequency-domain ripple|ripple]] in the response.&lt;ref&gt;Moxon, pp. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular choice for a polynomial with ripple is the [[Chebyshev filter|Chebyshev response]] for its steep skirt.&lt;ref&gt;Iniewski, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;  For the purpose of transformation, the stage gain expression can be rewritten in the more suggestive form,

:&lt;math&gt; A(s) = \frac {A_0}{1 + Q \left ( \frac {s}{\omega_0} + \frac {\omega_0}{s}\right )}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be transformed into a low-pass [[prototype filter]] with the transform

:&lt;math&gt; Q \left ( \frac {s}{\omega_0} + \frac {\omega_0}{s}\right ) \to \frac{s}{\omega_c'} &lt;/math&gt;
:where ''ω'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[cutoff frequency]] of the low-pass prototype.

This can be done straightforwardly for the complete filter in the case of synchronously tuned amplifiers where every stage has the same ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but for a stagger-tuned amplifier there is no simple analytical solution to the transform.  Stagger-tuned designs can be approached instead by calculating the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of a low-pass prototype of the desired form (e.g. Butterworth) and then transforming those poles to a [[band-pass filter|band-pass]] response.  The poles so calculated can then be used to define the tuned circuits of the individual stages.

=== Poles ===

The stage gain can be rewritten in terms of the poles by factorising the denominator;

:&lt;math&gt; A(s) = \frac {A_0}{Q} \frac {s \omega_0}{(s-p)(s-p^*)} &lt;/math&gt;
:where ''p'', ''p*'' are a [[complex conjugate]] pair of poles

and the overall response is,

:&lt;math&gt; A_\mathrm T =  \frac {s a_1}{(s-p_1)(s-p_1^*)} \cdot  \frac {s a_2}{(s-p_2)(s-p_2^*)} \cdot  \frac {s a_3}{(s-p_3)(s-p_3^*)} \cdot \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
:where the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0k&lt;/sub&gt;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0k&lt;/sub&gt;/''Q''&lt;sub&gt;0k&lt;/sub&gt;

From the band-pass to low-pass transform given above, an expression can be found for the poles in terms of the poles of the low-pass prototype, ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'',

:&lt;math&gt; p_k, p^*_k = {1 \over 2} \left ( \frac {q_k \omega_{0 \mathrm B}}{\omega'_\mathrm c Q_\mathrm {eff}} \pm \sqrt { \left ( \frac {q_k \omega_{0 \mathrm B}}{\omega'_\mathrm c Q_\mathrm {eff}} \right )^2 - 4 {\omega_{0 \mathrm B}}^2} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

:where ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0B&lt;/sub&gt; is the desired band-pass centre frequency and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective ''Q'' of the overall circuit.
Each pole in the prototype transforms to a complex conjugate pair of poles in the band-pass and corresponds to one stage of the amplifier.  This expression is greatly simplified if the cutoff frequency of the prototype, ''ω'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, is set to the final filter bandwidth ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0B&lt;/sub&gt;/''Q''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; p_k, p^*_k = {1 \over 2} \left ( q_k  \pm \sqrt { q_k^2 - 4 {\omega_{0 \mathrm B}}^2} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a [[narrowband]] design {{nowrap|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;≫''q''}} which can be used to make a further simplification with the approximation,

:&lt;math&gt; p_k, p^*_k \approx {q_k \over 2} \pm i \omega_{0 \mathrm B}&lt;/math&gt;

These poles can be inserted into the stage gain expression in terms of poles.  By comparing with the stage gain expression in terms of component values, those component values can then be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;Maheswari &amp; Anand, pp. 499-500&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Staggered tuning is of most benefit in [[wideband]] applications.  It was formerly commonly used in television receiver [[Intermediate frequency|IF amplifier]]s.  However, [[SAW filter]]s are more likely to be used in that role nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;Gulati, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;  Staggered tuning has advantages in [[VLSI]] for radio applications such as [[wireless LAN]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiser, p. vi&lt;/ref&gt;  The low spread of component values make it much easier to implement in [[integrated circuit]]s than traditional ladder networks.&lt;ref&gt;Iniewski, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tie press''' is a device, based solely on pressure, to flatten [[necktie]]s. Its use is necessitated by ties usually being of silk or some other textile ill-suited to the heat of [[ironing]].

Tie presses usually operate based on two separate wooden boards which are clamped together with spring-loaded levers. A cardboard cut-out is usually included to retain the shape of the tie during pressing.

Tie presses are particularly useful for [[bow tie]]s, due to the creasing and thus deformative nature of the bow tie knot, which involves crushing the ends to produce the 'bow' effect. In time, this crushing affects the appearance of the finished knot. This is particularly the case with bow ties with rectangular ends, rather than the 'bow' shaped ends in some bow ties, though both suffer from crushing to some degree or another. [[Four-in-hand knot|Four-in-hand ties]], naturally, are also creased, but rarely to the same extent and, as such, usually require less regular pressing.

[[Image:Henry Treffry Dunn Rossetti and Dunton at 16 Cheyne Walk.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s drawing room at No. 16 [[Cheyne Walk]], 1882, by [[Henry Treffry Dunn]].]]
'''Victorian decorative arts''' refers to the style of [[decorative arts]] during the [[Victorian era]]. Victorian design is widely viewed as having indulged in a grand excess of ornament. The Victorian era is known for its interpretation and [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] revival of historic styles mixed with the introduction of middle east and Asian influences in furniture, fittings, and [[interior decoration]]. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]], the [[aesthetic movement]], [[Anglo-Japanese style]], and [[Art Nouveau|Art Nouveau style]] have their beginnings in the late Victorian era and gothic period.

==Interior decoration and design==
[[Interior decoration]] and [[interior design]] of the Victorian era are noted for orderliness and ornamentation. A house from this period was idealistically divided in rooms, with public and private space carefully separated. The parlour was the most important room in a home and was the showcase for the homeowners where guests were entertained. A bare room was considered to be in poor taste, so every surface was filled with objects that reflected the owner's interests and aspirations. The dining room was the second-most important room in the house. The [[sideboard]] was most often the focal point of the dining room and very ornately decorated.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Walls and ceilings==
The choice of paint color on the walls in Victorian homes was said to be based on the use of the room. Hallways that were in the entry hall and the stair halls were painted a somber gray so as not to compete with the surrounding rooms. Most people marbleized the walls or the woodwork. Also on walls it was common to score into wet plaster to make it resemble blocks of stone. Finishes that were either [[Marbleizing|marbleized]] or grained were frequently found on doors and woodwork. "Graining" was meant to imitate woods of higher quality that were more difficult to work. There were specific rules for interior color choice and placement. The theory of “harmony by analogy” was to use the colors that lay next to each other on the [[color wheel]]. And the second was the “harmony by contrast” that was to use the colors that were opposite of one another on the color wheel. There was a favored [[3 (number)|tripartite]] wall that included a [[dado (architecture)|dado]] or [[wainscoting]] at the bottom, a field in the middle and a [[frieze]] or [[cornice]] at the top. This was popular into the 20th century. [[Frederick Walton]] who created linoleum in 1863 created the process for embossing semi-liquid linseed oil, backed with waterproofed paper or canvas. It was called [[Lincrusta]] and was applied much like wallpaper. This process made it easy to then go over the oil and make it resemble wood or different types of leather. On the ceilings that were 8–14 feet the color was tinted three shades lighter than the color that was on the walls and usually had a high quality of ornamentation because decorated ceilings were favored.

==Furniture==
There was not one dominant style of furniture in the Victorian period. Designers rather used and modified many styles taken from various time periods in history like [[Gothic art|Gothic]], [[Tudor period|Tudor]], [[Elizabethan]], English [[Rococo]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] and others. The Gothic and Rococo revival style were the most common styles to be seen in furniture during this time in history.

==Wallpaper==
Wallpaper and wallcoverings became accessible for increasing numbers of householders with their wide range of designs and varying costs. This was due to the introduction of mass production techniques and, in England, the repeal in 1836 of the [[Wallpaper tax]] introduced in 1712.

[[Wallpaper]] was often made in elaborate floral patterns with [[primary color]]s (red, blue, and yellow) in the backgrounds and overprinted with colours of cream and tan. This was followed by [[Gothic art]] inspired papers in earth tones with stylized leaf and floral patterns. [[William Morris]] was one of the most influential designers of wallpaper and fabrics during the latter half of the Victorian period. Morris was inspired and used [[Medieval]] and Gothic [[tapestries]] in his work. Embossed paper were used on ceilings and friezes.
