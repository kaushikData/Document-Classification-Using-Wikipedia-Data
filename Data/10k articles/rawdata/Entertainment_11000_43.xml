'''''3-2-1, Rattle Battle!''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Atsui 12 Game: Furi Furi Party!'''''|あつい12ゲーム フリフリパーティー！}}, is a [[video game]] for [[WiiWare]] developed by [[Tecmo]]. It was released in Japan on March 31, 2009, the PAL regions on August 14, 2009&lt;ref name="PAL release"/&gt; and in North America on August 31, 2009.&lt;ref name="NA release"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
''3-2-1, Rattle Battle!'' is a collection of twelve [[minigame]]s that generally revolve around players shaking the [[Wii Remote]] in order to score points. Controlling a blue cartoon mascot named "Rattle Hero", shaking the Wii Remote causes him to perform a different action depending on the minigame. These include firing a laser beam to dispatch enemies, bouncing up and down to weigh down a scale and growing or shrinking in size to dodge a salvo of arrows.&lt;ref name=sili&gt;[http://www.siliconera.com/2009/03/31/this-tecmo-wiiware-game-is-just-about-shaking/ This Tecmo WiiWare Game Is Just About Shaking]&lt;/ref&gt; Each minigame lasts between just three seconds to around two minutes in length.

The game features online leaderboards for high scores for two of the minigames.&lt;ref name=sili/&gt;

==Development==
A prototype for ''3-2-1, Rattle Battle!'', then titled ''Playshake'', was demonstrated at the 2009 [[Tokyo Game Show]]. The prototype featured minimal graphics and only a single minigame in which the player had to shake the Wii Remote as many times as they can in three seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joystiq.com/2008/10/30/playshake-the-game-you-play-by-shaking/ Playshake: the game you play by shaking]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Aaron Richmond was born in 1895 in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], where he had his formal education. After graduating from high school, he intensified his musical training with the goal of becoming a concert pianist. The following was noted in a brief Boston Globe review of a 1919 performance in which Richmond accompanied baritone Giovanni Petrucci at Boston's Steinert Hall, "Mr. Petrucci was assisted by Aaron Richmond, who played his accompaniments and a group of piano pieces." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Giovanni Petrucci, Baritone, in Recital | date=April 23, 1919 | publisher= | url =http://proquest.umi.com | work =The Boston Globe | pages =35 | accessdate = 2008-01-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Richmond toured extensively as a pianist with the Tchaikovsky Quartet. During the same period, Richmond’s friend, conductor [[Arthur Fiedler]], was forced to cancel a series of bookings on the [[Chautauqua]] circuit. Mr. Richmond filled in as pianist on the tour and later organized ''Richmond’s Little Symphony'', a sextet that toured the circuit for several summers playing arrangements of orchestral works. He served as pianist and lecturer on the program and often the newspaper critic of the concerts. ''Richmond’s Little Symphony'' made at least one Chautuaqua circuit tour with [[William Jennings Bryan]].&lt;ref name="Durgin A 11"&gt;{{Citation | last = Durgin | first = Cyrus | title = Concert Manager Who Knew 'Suite' Has Musical Meaning | pages = A 11 | newspaper = Daily Boston Globe | location = Boston, MA | date = 18 April 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist Manager==

An onstage lapse of memory during Richmond's [[Boston]] debut caused him to reevaluate his professional goals and led him to a career in music management. His first office contained a studio where he continued to teach piano while he formed the core of his artists’ list from members of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and some prominent Boston vocalists.

Pianist [[Ignace Jan Paderewski]] was quoted as saying of Richmond, "[He was] perhaps the only manager I have ever known to whom the word 'suite' has meant a musical composition and not a set of furniture for a room."&lt;ref name="Durgin A 11"/&gt;
In the Daily Boston Globe in 1948, Richmond said of himself, "Music to me is not just a business, an occupation, but a passion ... presenting great artists to the public, and expanding that public, is my mission. I never feel right unless I am convinced that my artists are of top rank."&lt;ref name="Durgin A 11"/&gt;

===First Roster===
Aaron Richmond Concert Management’s roster for the 1920-21 season included pianist [[Felix Fox]], cellist Jean Bedetti, soprano Laura Littlefield, flutist Georges Laurent, the American String Quartette, the Smalley Trio, the operatic duo of Mr. and Mrs. George Mager and the Boston Symphony Ensemble, under the direction of Augusto Vannini.

In the ensuing decades, Richmond also represented soprano Claudine Leeve, violinist Carmela Ippolito, pianists [[Harrison Potter]] and [[Leo Podolsky]], the Durrell String Quartet, tenor Joseph Lautner, the Fiedler Trio (Arthur Fiedler, violin; Alfred Hoy, harp, and Jacobus Lengendoen, cello), the Boston Sinfonietta, conducted by Arthur Fiedler, and piano and vocal folk-song duo Constance and Henry Gideon.

In the early 1920s, Richmond was appointed the [[New England]] Manager of the Wolfsohn Musical Bureau, Inc. and, later, became the sole New England representative for the National Concert and Artists Corporation,&lt;ref name="Durgin A 11"/&gt; and later for the NBC Artists Service. In this role, Richmond was the New England artist representative for [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], Mischa Levitski, [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Fritz Kreisler]], Monte Carlo Ballet Russe and the Vienna Choir Boys, among many others.

==Concert Presenter==

===First Concert Series===
Richmond presented his first concert series in Boston during the 1924-25 season. The new venture, called the Wolfsohn Series, included sopranos Katherine Palmer, Kathleen McAlister, Suzanne Dabney, Mildred Cobb and Laura Littlefield; contraltos Abbie Conley Rice, Betty Gray and Rose Zulalian; mezzo-soprano [[Elena Gerhardt]]; baritones, Parish Williams, William Richardson, Wellington Smith, and Ernest Lamoureaux; pianists [[Winifred Byrd]], [[Moriz Rosenthal]], Cyrus Ullian, Hyman Rovinsky, [[Alexander Brailowsky]], George Smith, [[Harold Morris (composer)|Harold Morris]], [[Harrison Potter]], Grace Cronin, [[Guiomar Novaes]], Alfredo Oswald, and Alberto Sciarretti; the Kibalchich Russian Symphonic Choir and The Roman Choir; the Fox-Burgin-Bedetti Trio; cellist [[Felix Salmond]] and violinists Joseph Coleman, Harry Farbman, and Paul Cherkassky.

Over the next several years, Richmond also presented such noted artists as pianist and composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], singer and composer [[J. Rosamond Johnson]], pianist [[Harold Samuel]], contralto [[Margarete Matzenauer]], the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]], [[Harrison Keller]], [[(Charles) Denoe Leedy|Denoe Leedy]], violinist [[Albert Spalding (violinist)|Albert Spalding]], the People's Symphony Orchestra and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]].

===The Celebrity Series Launched===
[[Image:Original ARCelebrity Series Logo.jpg|thumb|255px|Original 1938 logo of Aaron Richmond's Celebrity Series]]
'''Aaron Richmond’s Celebrity Series''' was launched (12 years after his first concert series) for the 1938-39 concert season. In 1953, still under Aaron Richmond’s direction, the Celebrity Series affiliated with [[Boston University]] and took the name, the Boston University Celebrity Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Aaron Richmond Directs BU Celebrity Series | pages = 10 | newspaper = Daily Boston Globe | location = Boston, MA | date = 30 March 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Celebrity Series changed affiliations and moved its operations under the auspices of the [[Wang Center for the Performing Arts]]. Then, in 1989, the Celebrity Series incorporated as Bank of Boston Celebrity Series, an independent, non-profit institution with its own Board of Directors and an annual budget of over $3 million. Today the Celebrity Series annual operating budget is approximately $7 million. After 18 years of operating with the title sponsorship support of Bank of Boston, [[BankBoston]], [[FleetBoston Financial]], and [[Bank of America]], the Celebrity Series began operating under its incorporated name, Celebrity Series of Boston, in June 2007.

Aaron Richmond presented many performers during his 27-year tenure as director of the [[Celebrity Series of Boston]]:

Following Martha Jones' retirement from the Celebrity Series in 2011, Gary Dunning was appointed to the position.

==Association with Sol Hurok==
Aaron Richmond's business association with noted impresario [[Sol Hurok]] dated from 1926. Richmond frequently served as the regional representative for Hurok's tours. On Richmond's death in 1965, Hurok said in The Boston Globe, "Aaron Richmond contributed to Boston what Hurok contributes to New York. He had the ideal spirit: 'Boston should see this company, hear this musician.' That came first, money later. That made cultural life blossom.
He wanted, so do I, that this country should know what is going on in the world. he put all his time, energy, vitality, knowledge to do it. I have lost a good friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hurok on Aaron Richmond | date = June 23, 1965 | work = The Boston Globe | pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other projects==
Richmond served as artistic advisor to numerous colleges and committees throughout the New England area, including the Boston Morning Musical Association ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]), the [http://www.hmaboston.org Harvard Musical Association] ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]), [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]] Country Evening Concert Series, South End Music Centre ([[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]), Boston Community Music Centre ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]), the James Spooner Fund Concerts ([[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]), Gile Fund Concerts ([[Concord, New Hampshire]]), the Greater New Bedford Concert Series ([[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]), Temple Beth El Concert Series ([[Providence, Rhode Island]]), the South Shore Concert Association ([[Massachusetts]]), as well as [[Smith College|Smith]] and [[Williams College]]s, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[Connecticut College|Connecticut College for Women]].

Aaron Richmond was a founding member of the Concerts Association of America, founded in 1937 "to meet the pressing problems now confronting the concert-giving field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Concert Managers Form New Society | date=January 5, 1937 | publisher= | url =http://proquest.umi.com | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Richmond was elected Vice President of the National Association of Concert Managers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Concert Managers Elect | date=December 14, 1951 | publisher= | url =http://proquest.umi.com | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which later became the International Society for the Performing Arts (ISPA) [http://www.ispa.org/].

'''''Air Mata Iboe''''' ([[EYD|Perfected spelling]]: '''''Air Mata Ibu'''''; [[Malay language|Malay]] for ''A Mother's Tears'') is a 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) directed and written by Njoo Cheong Seng. Starring [[Fifi Young]], Rd&amp;nbsp;Ismail, Ali Sarosa, and [[Ali Joego]], it followed a mother who raises her children lovingly but is ultimately betrayed by her eldest sons when she falls upon hard times. The film, billed as a musical extravaganza, featured a soundtrack by [[Koesbini|R.&amp;nbsp;Koesbini]], and an eponymous [[title song]] written by Njoo.

The last production completed by [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]]'s [[Majestic Film Company]], ''Air Mata Iboe'' was released in December 1941, shortly before the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]]. This film, now possibly lost, received positive reviews. A remake was produced under the same title in 1957; Young retook her role.

== Plot ==
Soegiati ([[Fifi Young]]) is the mother of four children: sons Achmad (Rd Ismail), Idris ([[S. Poniman|S Poniman]]) and Soemadi (Ali Sarosa), and a daughter named Soepinah (Soelami). She loves them all, but Soemadi receives the most of her attention because he receives little from his father, the merchant Soebagio ([[Ali Joego]]). As the children grow, they marry and move away, and eventually only Soemadi is left. Although he begins a relationship with a young woman named Noormala ([[Soerip]]), he does not marry her as his income is not enough to support them.

On the night of [[Eid al-Fitr]], the family gathers for the holiday. Unknown to the family, Soebagio is leading a double life as a robber, and that evening the police come to arrest him. To protect his father, Soemadi declares himself the culprit, and he is exiled. Feeling guilty for his sins, Soebagio falls ill and dies soon afterwards. Because of their debts, their home and belongings are repossessed, leaving Soegiati to fend for herself.

Though wealthy, Achmad and Idris refuse to take Soegiati in, fearing their respective wives Moedjenah (Titing) and Mariam (Ning-Nong). Soepinah and her husband Bakar ([[Koesbini]]) are willing to take her in, but they live in poverty. Unwilling to burden them, ultimately Soegiati decides to leave and find her own way, depending on the kindness of strangers. Years pass, and Soemadi returns from exile. Encountering his mother, who now lives in poverty, he decides to take revenge on his brothers.{{efn|Summary derived from {{harvnb|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1941, Air Mata Iboe|p=30}}.}}

[[File:Cast of Air Mata Iboe Perjatoeran Doenia Dec 1941 p30.jpg|alt=A group photograph of 13 men and women|thumb|350px|The cast of ''Air Mata Iboe'']]
The [[Malang]]-based [[Majestic Film Company]] announced ''Air Mata Iboe'' in June 1941 together with two other films, ''Boedi Terbenam'' (''Hidden Wisdom'') and ''Bachtera Karam'' (''Wrecked Ark'').{{efn|{{harvtxt|Biran|2009|pp=379–386}} does not record the latter two titles in his [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies]].}} Production began soon afterwards and, by early December 1941, over 55 reels had been shot, as well as 60 sound reels.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1941, Air Mata Iboe|p=29}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Majestic Film Coy.}}

''Air Mata Iboe'' was written and directed by [[Njoo Cheong Seng]] under his penname M. d'Amour; he had previously directed ''[[Djantoeng Hati]]'' (''Heart and Soul''; 1941), which also had a tragic ending, for the company. The film was produced by the company's owner, [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit Air Mata Iboe}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=278}} It starred Njoo's wife Fifi Young (no relation to Fred), Rd&amp;nbsp;Ismail, Ali Sarosa, and Ali Joego.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Air Mata Iboe}} Other roles were held by established singers of ''[[keroncong]]'' (traditional music with Portuguese influences), including Soerip, Titing, Soelami, Ning Nong, and Poniman.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1941, Air Mata Iboe|p=29}} The film, which used make-up to make Fifi Young age into an old woman over the course of its plot, was the actress' first for Majestic; she had been ill during the production of her husband's debut for the company.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=240–241}}

The [[black-and-white]] film featured eleven ''keroncong'' songs written by [[music director]] R.&amp;nbsp;Koesbini,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Air Mata Iboe}} who also had a role in the film.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1941, Air Mata Iboe|p=29}} Backing music was provided by Koesbini's troupe, the Krontjong Syncopaters,{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1941, Air Mata Iboe|p=29}} while songs were performed by the cast.{{Efn|Soerip provided vocals for three songs: "Sepasang Merpati" ("A Pair of Doves"), "Doelit-Doedit"&lt;!---(This is Javanese, but what does it mean?)---&gt;, and "Gandengan Tangan" ("Holding Hands"). Soelami performed four songs: "Boelan Bersenjoem" ("The Moon Smiles"), "Melajang Semarang 1921" ("Sailing to Semarang, 1921"), "Stamboel II Oh Iboe" ("Stambul II: Oh, Mother"), and "Krontjong Speciaal" ("Special Kroncong"). Titing provided two songs: "Krontjong Boelan Tertawa" ("Kroncong of the Laughing Moon") and "Padi-Padi" ("Rice"). Ning Nong sang a single song, "Gandengan Tangan" ("Holding Hands"), as did Poniman ("Selamat Hari Raya"; "Happy Holiday").

== Release and legacy ==

''Air Mata Iboe'', which was rated for all ages, was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]] and premiered at Sampoerna Theatre in [[Surabaya]] on 24 December 1941. Also advertised under the Dutch title ''Tranen Eener Moeder'' (a literal translation from Malay), the film was promoted as a "musical extravaganza";{{efn|Original: "''muzikale extravaganza''"}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} other advertisements emphasised the size of the cast.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1941, Air Mata Iboe|p=32}} An anonymous review in the ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'' noted the extensive use of ''keroncong'' and praised the acting and singing, suggesting that [[native Indonesians|native]] audiences would flock to see the film.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna theater}}

''Air Mata Iboe'' was the last film produced by Majestic Film Company, which closed following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]].{{efn|Though the director [[Tan Tjoei Hock]] later testified that ''Air Mata Iboe'' was incomplete when the Japanese occupation began, thus leading him to finish it on his own {{harv|Biran|2009|pp=240–241}}, the existence of contemporary coverage belies that.}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=240–241}} During the occupation Njoo, Fifi Young, and Fred Young established their own travelling theatrical troupe, Pantjawarna, though all returned to cinema in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|TIM, Fifi Young}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Fred Young}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Njoo Cheong Seng}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joego likewise returned to film after spending the occupation in theater.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=30}} Poniman, Sarosa, Ismail, and Soerip all returned to cinema,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, S Poniman}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ali Sarosa}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Rd Ismail}}&lt;/ref&gt; the men in the 1950s and Soerip in 1973.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=480}} Soelami is not recorded as acting in any further productions.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Soelami}}

A [[Air Mata Ibu|remake]] of ''Air Mata Iboe'' was produced in 1957, after Indonesia had [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|obtained its independence]]. Directed by Fred Young, the film had Fifi Young retake her role as Sugiati, while Rd&amp;nbsp;Ismail took the role of Subagio. The remake's other cast members had not appeared in the original film. The sons Achmad, Idris, and Soemadi were portrayed by [[Sukarno M. Noor]], [[Boes Boestami]], and Kamsul, respectively. The couple's daughter, renamed Atikah, was played by [[Farida Arriany]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Air Mata Ibu}}

''Air Mata Iboe'' may be [[lost film|lost]]. As elsewhere at the time, films in the Dutch East Indies were shot on highly unstable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, earlier films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} Thus, the American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] wrote that all Indonesian films made before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

"'''Brian &amp; Stewie'''" is the 17th episode of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[Family Guy]]'', and 150th episode of the series overall. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 2, 2010. The episode features [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and baby [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] after they are accidentally trapped inside a [[bank vault]] over a weekend. The two try to kill each other, and are ultimately forced to reveal their true feelings about each other, and eventually go on to question each other's existence and purpose in life. Brian and Stewie become even closer to each other as time goes on, and climactically help each other survive being trapped inside the vault. The [[bottle episode]] breaks from the show's usual set-up, and is the only episode of the series not to feature any music or use any [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] with Brian and Stewie being the only two characters featured in the entire episode. In repeats of the episode there is no main title sequence, nor is any music played over the end credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

"Brian &amp; Stewie" was written by [[Gary Janetti]] and directed by [[Dominic Bianchi]]. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics for its serious dialogue, although it attracted controversy and [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]] for a sequence in which Brian [[Coprophagia|eats Stewie's faeces]] and vomit. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 7.68 million homes in its original airing. The episode aired along with a series of musical numbers from throughout the show's eight seasons. "Brian &amp; Stewie" was released on [[DVD]] along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.

==Plot==
[[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] visit the local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday money in his [[safe deposit box]]. Stewie then wants to go to a store to return a $3,000 [[Thom Browne]] sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes at the end of the work day and locks them inside. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a [[rash]] from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian [[coprophagia|eat his feces]] by threatening him with a [[gun]] that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a [[cellphone]] in his pocket, with only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, breaks his phone, and yells at him, making him cry. Instantly remorseful, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces as a way of apologizing. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean him with his tongue in order to avoid infection. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.

Awaking from his nap, Brian decides to drink a bottle of [[Scotch whisky|scotch]] that he had stored in his deposit box. He offers Stewie a sip, and they both become so drunk that Brian agrees to pierce Stewie's ear with a pin from his sweater, leaving him with a bloodied ear. Stewie and Brian discuss ''[[The Dog Whisperer]]'' and [[Cesar Millan]], and Brian explains that he is inspired by Millan's philosophy about dogs' instinctive ability to live in the present and with purpose. Stewie, however, points out that Brian himself does not appear to live with any specific purpose. Angered, Brian begins insulting Stewie, who bitterly retaliates by revealing that he could have gone all day without having his diaper changed, and only thinks of Brian as a passing amusement and "the best of a bad situation". Stewie dares Brian to shoot him with the revolver in the deposit box. Stewie prematurely causes the gun to discharge, causing the bullet to randomly [[ricochet]] off the vault walls, forcing the two under the table to wait for the bullet to stop.

After sobering up, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch [[gun control]] proponent and seems to be the last person who would ever own a firearm. Brian refuses to talk about it at first, but eventually admits that he has the gun in case he ever wants to commit [[suicide]]. He confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life like other dogs, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie says that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in the world that he really cares about; he finally tells Brian he loves him, and Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. Stewie adds that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of ''[[David Copperfield]]'' to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence.

Vallow and ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] were fans of ''All in the Family'' during its original airing and came up with the original concept for the episode.&lt;ref name="vallowinterview"/&gt; Vallow went on to state that the episode "{{interp|is}} like a one-act stage play in a way," because it "{{interp|doesn't}} rely on our standard cutaways and gags."&lt;ref name="vallowinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/30/family-guy-animation-business-entertainment-vallow.html?boxes=businesschannelsections |title=Talking TV With 'Family Guy' Producer Kara Vallow |author=Rose, Lacey |publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a first for the series, the only voice actor to perform in the episode was series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, who portrays both characters.&lt;ref name="ewreview" /&gt; In addition, neither composer [[Ron Jones (composer)|Ron Jones]] nor composer [[Walter Murphy]] contributed any background music to the episode whatsoever.&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt; The writer of the episode, Gary Janetti, wrote the episode based on a loose script written by MacFarlane, as well as various phone conversations about the structure of the storyline, and the various acts.&lt;ref name="commentary1"&gt;{{cite video |date=2011-12-13 |people=Janetti, Gary|title=Family Guy Volume Nine Audio Commentary |medium= DVD |publisher= 20th Century Fox |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Brian &amp; Stewie", along with the eleven other episodes from ''Family Guy''{{'}}s eighth season, was released on a three-disc [[DVD]] set in the United States on December 13, 2011. The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating "[[And Then There Were Fewer]]", a mini-feature entitled "The Comical Adventures of ''Family Guy'' – Brian &amp; Stewie: The Lost Phone Call", and footage of the ''Family Guy'' panel at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].&lt;ref name="DVDs9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Family-Guy-Volume-9/15567 |title=Family Guy – Does a Fan Site Message Board Have a List of Volume 9 DVD Contents and Extras? |accessdate=2011-07-28 |date=2011-06-24 |last=Lambert |first=Dave |publisher=TVShowsonDVD.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809001311/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Family-Guy-Volume-9/15567 |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Family-Guy-Volume-9/15696 |title=Family Guy – Street Date, Cost, and Other New Info for 'Volume 9' Come Out |publisher=TVShowsonDVD.com |last=Lambert |first=Dave |accessdate=2011-07-28 |date=2011-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BUfd5j0a?url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Family-Guy-Volume-9/15696 |archivedate=2012-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its initial airing, the episode aired with a [[framing device]] involving Stewie and Brian standing in front of a red curtain and addressing [[Fourth wall|the television audience]]. The two begin the program by introducing the [[very special episode|"very special" episode]] and, after the episode aired, conclude it by introducing a series of musical numbers.&lt;ref name="ewreview" /&gt; Together, the episode and musical number aired as an hour-long special, in celebration of a week-long "Fox Rocks" television event.&lt;ref name="latr" /&gt; The initial airing included musical numbers from the fourth-season episode "[[The Fat Guy Strangler]]", the sixth-season episode "[[Play It Again, Brian]]", and the eighth-season episode "[[Business Guy]]", as well as other numbers, including "You've Got A Lot to See" from "[[Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows]]", "[[Shipoopi]]" from "[[Patriot Games (Family Guy)|Patriot Games]]",  and "My Drunken Irish Dad" from the episode "[[Peter's Two Dads]]".&lt;ref name="vallowinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxrocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z1z25z1z8&amp;ID=6078 |title=It's a Monumental May on Fox |publisher=Fox Flash |date=2010-04-19 |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229152741/http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z1z25z1z8&amp;ID=6078 |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxflash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z55z8z5&amp;page=2 |title=Fox Primetime – Family Guy – Gallery Photos |publisher=Fox Flash |accessdate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112110443/http://foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z55z8z5&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2009-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In repeats of the episode the usual main title sequence is replaced by a still shot of the show's logo on a black background, whilst the end credits are shown without any musical accompaniment.

==Cultural references==
In addition to "Archie in the Cellar", the plot of the episode is inspired by the ''All in the Family'' episode "Two's a Crowd", in which Archie and Mike are locked in a storeroom, drink brandy, and share their deepest secrets. The episode also makes reference to an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' entitled "[[Time Enough at Last]]", in which a banker named Henry Bemis sneaks into a bank vault and is knocked unconscious. In the episode, Henry Bemis is reading a copy of ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', which Brian also reads during the episode.&lt;ref name="ewreview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/classics/the_twilight_zone/video/index.php?pid=dxQGcjgGKep5duXVzEKJFKteKLutQsFP |title=The Twilight Zone: "Time Enough at Last" |accessdate=2010-05-11 |publisher=[[CBS]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409080351/http://www.cbs.com/classics/the_twilight_zone/video/index.php?pid=dxQGcjgGKep5duXVzEKJFKteKLutQsFP |archivedate=2010-04-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Quote box|width=25em|quote="&amp;nbsp;The episode is essentially Seth MacFarlane talking to himself for a half hour, with no cutaway gags, very little music, and no characters other than Brian and Stewie. It's a big change from the usual and I have to say I like it. The old shtick was getting very tired, and the past few episodes showed a remarkable lack of ingenuity and real humor, but the story here has a lot going for it."|align=right|source=Ramsey Isler, IGN.&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt;}}

In an improvement over the previous six episodes, the episode was viewed in 7.68 million homes in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]], despite airing simultaneously with ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 9)|Celebrity Apprentice]]'' on [[NBC]] and ''[[Cold Case]]'' on [[CBS]]. The episode also acquired a 3.7 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', as well as the accompanying musical special, which received a total rating of 3.3.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/05/03/tv-ratings-sunday-conan-boosts-60-minutes-a-little-while-abc-wins-a-slow-sunday/50249 |title=TV Ratings: Conan Boosts 60 Minutes A Little; While ABC Wins A Slow Sunday |publisher=TVbytheNumbers |date=2010-05-03 |author=Gorman, Bill |accessdate=2010-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505204117/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/05/03/tv-ratings-sunday-conan-boosts-60-minutes-a-little-while-abc-wins-a-slow-sunday/50249 |archivedate=2010-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics and viewers. Reviewers disliked the episode's moments of [[gross-out humor]], but frequently lauded its serious tone and subject matter, as well as its break from the show's formula. Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' believed that the show's concept, which allowed only two characters and a single scene, was "ambitious" but that the end result was "flaccid."&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt; He commented that with no cut-away gags or side plots, the episode was "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" but was deprived of ''Family Guy''{{'}}s trademark fast pace and reduced to "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches."&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/to-surveil-with-lovebrotherly-lovebrian-stewie%2C40698/ |title="To Surveil With Love"/"Brotherly Love"/"Brian &amp; Stewie" |author=VanDerWerff, Todd |publisher=The A.V. Club|date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television critic Ramsey Isler of [[IGN]] added that the gross-out humor "didn't work for me" and found the "more serious stuff" in the episode to be the most entertaining. Said Isler, "the addition of more dramatic themes and the elimination of the cutaway gags really showed what this show could be if Seth {{interp|MacFarlane}} and team put more effort in."&lt;ref name="ignreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/108/1087342p1.html |title=Family Guy: "Brian and Stewie" Review|publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |author=Isler, Ramsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent review of ''Family Guy''{{'}}s eighth season, Isler listed "Brian &amp; Stewie" as being "surprisingly dramatic," and, "had it not been for the extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/109/1093953p1.html |title=Family Guy: Season 8 Review |last=Isler |first=Ramsey |accessdate=2010-08-28 |date=2010-06-02 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Hughes of [[Weblogs, Inc.#TV Squad|TV Squad]] was also "more than a little disturbed" by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper.

The [[Parents Television Council]], a conservative media [[watchdog (disambiguation)#Consumer protection|watchdog]] group and frequent critic of MacFarlane-produced programs, called on the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to investigate ''Family Guy'' after the episode aired, citing the scenes where Brian is talked into eating Stewie's feces and vomit. PTC president Tim Winter said that, "Given the patently offensive depictions of one character eating excrement out of a diaper, then eating vomit, and finally licking the remaining excrement from a baby’s bottom – while the baby expresses physical gratification from having his bottom licked – we believe that the broadcast decency law has been broken. It seems as though ''Family Guy'' creator, Seth MacFarlane, carefully reviewed the legal definition of broadcast indecency and set out to violate it as literally as he could."&lt;ref name="latr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/05/is-family-guy-creator-seth-macfarlane-taunting-the-fcc-.html|title=Is 'Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane taunting the FCC? |author=Flint, Joe|date=2010-05-04|publisher=LATimes.com|accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/news/release/2010/0504.asp |title=PTC Calls on FCC to Find Fox’s 150th ''Family Guy'' Episode Indecent |publisher=[[Parents Television Council]] |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parents Television Council went on to name the episode as its "Worst TV Show of the Week", ending the week of May 7, 2010, citing the extreme indecency of the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Guy on Fox|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2010/0507worst.asp|publisher=[[Parents Television Council]]|date=2010-05-07|accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brought to Light: Thirty Years of Drug Smuggling, Arms Deals, and Covert Action''''' is an [[anthology]] of two political [[graphic novel]]s, published originally by [[Eclipse Comics]] in [[1988 in comics|1988]].&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Digital Spy]]|title='Brought to Light' digitally remastered|first=Hugh|last=Armitage|date=September 26, 2011|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/comics/news/a342277/brought-to-light-digitally-remastered.html#~phvNvjELbufjJt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two stories are ''Shadowplay: The Secret Team'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], and ''Flashpoint: The LA Penca Bombing'' documented by [[Martha Honey]] and [[Tony Avirgan]] and adapted by [[Joyce Brabner]] and [[Tom Yeates]]. ''Brought to Light'' was edited overall by Joyce Brabner, [[Catherine Yronwode]] acted as executive editor, and Eclipse publisher [[Dean Mullaney]] was the publication designer.

==''Shadowplay: The Secret Team''==
{{Peacock|date=October 2009}}
''Shadowplay: The Secret Team'' written by [[Alan Moore]] and drawn by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] with an introduction by Daniel Sheehan (general counsel of TCI).  It covers the history of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and its involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Iran-Contra affair]], and its relationship with figures like [[Augusto Pinochet]] and [[Manuel Noriega]].  The narrator of ''Shadowplay'' is an aging anthropomorphic [[bald eagle|American Eagle]], a bellicose retired CIA agent.

As Moore's first major work which was not superhero oriented, it was highly praised for its storytelling and Sienkiewicz's sometimes brutal art. Moore received praise especially for blending the sometimes overwhelming mass of details into a coherent and effective story. Over the years there have been rumors that Moore was unable to travel to America due to the CIA being annoyed at his story in ''Brought to Light''. However, the real reason was Moore not renewing his passport.&lt;ref&gt;Beaton, Frank. [http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=536 "Snake Charmer: An Interview with Alan Moore," part II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026160334/http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=536 |date=October 26, 2005 }}, NinthArt (April 7, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of "Shadowplay" is of an unseen character (presumably representing the oblivious American public in first-person view of the reader) in a bar, where he is approached by a man-sized, walking, talking eagle. The eagle, from the emblem of the CIA, proceeds to drink alcohol and, in a drunken stupor, divulge all the bloody details of The Agency's sordid past. Early on a reference is made to the number of gallons an Olympic swimming pool can hold, and the fact that an adult human body has one gallon of blood; from then on, the victims of CIA activities (directly or indirectly) are quantified in swimming pools filled with blood, each pool representing 20,000 dead.

===''Shadowplay'' spoken word===
''Shadowplay'' was made into a spoken word performance with [[Alan Moore]]&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; and released on an audio compact disc ({{ISBN|1-899598-56-1}}) by [[Codex Books]] in 1998. The narrative for the production is performed by Moore himself, in character, set to music by the composer [[Gary Lloyd]] who also collaborated on a similar narrative/music performance piece with Scottish author [[Iain Banks]].

==''Flashpoint: The LA Penca Bombing''==
''Flashpoint: The LA Penca Bombing'' is written by [[Joyce Brabner]],&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; as told to her by Christic Institute clients [[Martha Honey]] and [[Tony Avirgan]].  It deals with the [[La Penca bombing]] which happened during the civil war in [[Nicaragua]] in 1984.

Credits for “Flashpoint” list [[Jonathan Marshall]] on the introduction, Joyce Brabner writing, and Thomas Yeates illustrating, with letters by [[Bill Pearson (comics)|Bill Pearson]] and painting by [[Sam Parsons]]. Martha Honey and Tony Avirgan are credited with having told the story to Joyce Brabner.

==Thirty Years of Covert War==
In the center is a two-page feature by [[Paul Mavrides]], "World Map of 30 Years of Covert Action" detailing election tampering, drug trafficking, assassination, and other crimes committed by the CIA.

'''7 Mages''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: '''Brány Skeldalu: 7 Mágů''', literally ''Gates of Skeldal: 7 Mages'') is a 2016 [[video game]] developed by Napoleon Games. It is the third installment in ''[[Gates of Skeldal]]'' series. ''7 Mages'' a tactical, turn-based game with that focuses on musical magic. Each character has a tune they can play to directly affect anyone within earshot.

The story is an adaptation of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s benchmark film, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.

==Gameplay==
''7 Mages'' is a [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawler]] that features [[gameplay]] similar to the original ''[[Gates of Skeldal]]''. The player moves squares in real-time, but battles are turn-based. Each mage has some specialization, such as being a warrior or archer.&lt;ref name="games1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smutný|first1=Aleš|title=Brány Skeldalu 3: Sedm mágů - recenze - Games.cz|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/recenze/brany-skeldalu-3-sedm-magu-recenze-271970|website=Games.cz|accessdate=23 June 2016|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple types of magic, such as elemental magic and musical magic etc.&lt;ref name="pocket1"&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Mages - Napoleon Games talks us through its musical old-school turn-based RPG|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/7+Mages/feature.asp?c=69418|website=[[Pocket Gamer]]|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical magic uses instruments, and its effect weakens with larger distances. Magic can heal, refill [[Magic (gaming)|mana]], resurrect dead companions, etc.&lt;ref name="games1" /&gt;

==Reception==
7 Mages hold 90% at [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Mages|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/7-mages|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TouchArcade]] praised the game play. It noted the puzzles, though "its approach is probably not going to gel with everyone." Another praise was for the combat system and dungeon design. The story was noted to be a weaker part of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musgrave|first1=Shaun|title='7 Mages' Review – A Magnificent Ode To The Classics|url=http://toucharcade.com/2016/03/23/7-mages-review/|website=[[TouchArcade]]|accessdate=23 June 2016|date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''Chitlin Circuit'''" was a collection of performance venues throughout the eastern, southern, and upper midwest areas of the United States that provided commercial and cultural acceptance for [[African Americans|African American]] musicians, comedians, and other entertainers during the era of [[racial segregation in the United States]] (from at least the early 19th century{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} through the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Englehardt|first1=Sheree|title=Musicians trying to save Legendary Blues Joint|url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/news/article.html/content/news/articles/bn9/2015/8/27/musicians_trying_to_.html#.VeBFhlpYBO0.facebook|accessdate=29 August 2015|publisher=Bay New 9|date=Aug 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the term is applied to the venues, especially in the South, where contemporary African-American [[blues]] singers such as [[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]], [[Denise LaSalle]], and [[O.B. Buchana]] continue to appear regularly. The name derives from the [[soul food]] item [[chitterlings]] (stewed pig intestines); it is also a play on the term "[[Borscht Belt]]", which referred to particular resort venues (primarily in New York State's [[Catskill Mountains]]) that were popular with Jewish performers and audiences during the 1940s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Douglass Opie, ''Hog and Hominy: Soul Food from Africa to America,'' (Columbia University Press 2008), Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This name also comes from the culinary history of black people, where they were often only given the intestines of the pig to eat as opposed to the bacon or ham. It symbolizes acquiring a taste out of necessity and eventually coming to like it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Henry Louis Gates Jr. |title=The Chitlin Circuit |accessdate=13 September 2018 |publisher=The New Yorker |date=3 February 1997 |pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chitlin' Circuit was considered to be by, for, and about black people.  Topics of plays were often farcical and overdramatic. There is debate as to when the Chitlin' Circuit's peak was.  Some say its peak was in the 30's, some say it was after World War II, and others say it was the time of the blues.&lt;ref&gt;Stober, Karl H. "The Chitlin Circuit Revisited." Cadence Magazine, the Independent Journal of Creative Improvised Music Oct 2014: 61-4. ProQuest. 20 Sep. 2018 .&lt;/ref&gt;


==Theaters and night clubs==
Noted theaters and [[night clubs]] on the Chitlin' Circuit included the Royal Peacock in [[Atlanta]]; the 100 Men Hall (Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi), the [[Carver Theatre (Birmingham, Alabama)|Carver Theatre]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; the Harlem Duke Social Club in Mobile (Prichard), Alabama;  [[Cotton Club]], [[Smalls Paradise]] and the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem, New York City]]; [[Robert's Show Lounge]], [[Club DeLisa]] and the [[Regal Theater, South Side (Chicago)|Regal Theatre]] in Chicago; the [[Howard Theatre]] in Washington, D.C.; the [[Uptown Theater (Philadelphia)|Uptown Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]]; the [[Royal Theatre (Baltimore)|Royal Theatre]] in [[Baltimore]]; the [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]] in [[Detroit]]; the Eastwood Country Club in [[San Antonio, Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas Online, Karla Peterson, "Eastwood Country Club," accessed March 02, 2018, http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/xde01. &lt;/ref&gt;; the [[Victory Grill]] in [[Austin, Texas]]; the [[Hippodrome Theater (Richmond, Virginia)|Hippodrome Theatre]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]]; the [[Ritz Theatre (Jacksonville)|Ritz Theatre]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; [[Club Eaton]] in historic [[Eatonville, Florida]]; [[Abe's 506 Club]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]]'s [[Historic Belmont-DeVilliers]] Neighborhood, the [[Manhattan Casino]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], the [[Red Bird Cafe]] in [[Frenchtown (Tallahassee)|Frenchtown]], [[Tallahassee, Florida]], Club Cherry in [[Lebanon, Kentucky]], the [[Lyric Theatre and Cultural Arts Center (Lexington, Kentucky)|Lyric Theatre]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], The National Theater in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], The Quanset in [[Bowling Green, KY]] and The [[Madam C. J. Walker]] Theatre on [[Indiana Avenue]] in [[Indianapolis]]. 

Seasonal venues included the still-standing auditorium at John Brown's Farm (also known as "the [[Kennedy Farm]]") outside Sharpsburg, Maryland&lt;ref&gt;Maliskas, Ed. John Brown to James Brown - The Little Farm Where Liberty Budded, Blossomed, and Boogied, Hagerstown, MD: Hamilton Run Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;; Carr's and Sparrow's Beach in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]]; and Rosedale Beach in [[Millsboro, Delaware]].

According to [[Ruth Brown]], an artist needed to play at four specific theaters to prove they had made it: the Regal, the Howard, the Uptown, and the Apollo. This was called the "litchman chain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voHveKbg6ZU |title=Why We Should Build the R&amp;B Music Hall of Fame Museum |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-12-10 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[Tuxedo Junction]]" was written about a stop along the Chitlin' Circuit in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. Once the performance was over, the band would leave for the next stop on the circuit. After composing the music, [[Erskine Hawkins]] explained the reason for the title to [[Buddy Feyne]], who created lyrics to express the concept.&lt;ref&gt;

==Mississippi Blues Trail marker==
An historic marker designated by the Mississippi Blues Commission on the Mississippi Blues Trail was placed in front of the 100 Men Hall in Bay Saint Louis, MS. The 100 Men Hall is one of the rare still standing, still active blues venues on the trail. The second historic marker designated by the Mississippi Blues Commission on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]] was placed in front of the Southern Whispers Restaurant on Nelson Street in [[Greenville, Mississippi]], a stop on the Chitlin' Circuit in the early days of the blues. The marker commemorates the importance of this site in the history of the [[blues]] in Mississippi.&lt;ref name=bluesmatters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesmatters.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2493 |title=Blues Matters! - Delta sites to be included on new blues trail |publisher=www.bluesmatters.com |accessdate=2008-05-28 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}

&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, this historic strip drew crowds to the flourishing club scene to hear [[Delta blues]], [[big band]] [[jump blues]] and [[jazz]].

==Contemporary use==
''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine prefers the term "urban theater circuit" for recent work like that of playwright and actor [[Tyler Perry]]. In a January 2004 interview with Perry, the genre's leading practitioner, ''Ebony'' wrote that his work marked
:"a new chapter in the urban theater circuit as a whole—a genre that has been dogged by criticism from some Blacks in the traditional theater. Perry, as the most visibly recognized player in the circuit, has felt the brunt of this criticism.
:"'They say that Tyler Perry has set the Black race back some 500 years with these types of "Chitlin' Circuit" shows. The problem with the naysayers is that they don't take the opportunity to see my shows,' Perry argues. 'With my shows, I try to build a bridge that marries what's deemed "legitimate theater" and so-called "chitlin' circuit theater," and I think I've done pretty well with that, in bringing people in to enjoy a more elevated level of theater.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2888">[[File:rcactc101.jpg|thumb|RCA Colortrak set, using the CTC101 chassis, circa 1980]]
'''Colortrak''' was a trademark used on several [[RCA]] color [[Television|TVs]] throughout the 1970s to the 1990s. After RCA was acquired by [[General Electric]] in 1986, GE sold the RCA consumer electronics line to [[Thomson SA]]. RCA televisions with the Colortrak branding were mid-range models; in comparison to the low-end [[XL-100]] chassis or [[high-end]] [[Dimensia]] or [[Colortrak 2000]] chassis in consumer sets (the professional version of the [[Dimensia]] model, or versions with [[BNC connector|BNC]] inputs, the designation was "[[Lyceum TV]]" for a short period in the early to mid-1980s).  RCA discontinued use of the Colortrak brand, replacing with the [[Entertainment Series]] designation by 2001.  Some models like this with the design quirks mentioned below have also been marketed under the [[GE]] name as both RCA and GE's brand names are marketed by [[Thomson SA]]. 

==Design quirks==
During the early 1980s, RCA responded to increased demand for [[component television]]s with monitor capabilities by adding [[composite video|composite]] and [[S-video]] inputs to the Colortrak lineup. These inputs allowed owners to easily connect a stereo audio/video source, like a [[VCR|Video Cassette Recorder]], [[LaserDisc|LaserDisc player]], or with use of an RCA [[SelectaVision|SelectaVision CED videodisc players]] to the television. For example, early composite video-equipped RCA sets were to coincidentally be tuned to Non-broadcast channel 91 to display a composite video signal, if a set was equipped with more than one input, subsequent inputs are designated to channels 92 to 95, which are usually accessed from the [[remote control]].  However, when manufactures learned that accessing input mode within numeric channels pressing channel up/down was feasible, channel 9x channels were dropped from future models.

===RF Input===
{{main|RCA (trademark)#Class-action lawsuit}}
Apparently due to a bad [[solder]], the antenna/cable inputs of ''many'' models of RCA TV's would occasionally malfunction. The station being watched would seem to cut out and the picture went to snow. Wiggling the cable sometimes cured the problem, suggesting that it was just a bad connection. The problem was common and widespread enough that it actually led to a [[class-action lawsuit]]. This problem occurred in other models of RCA TV's, too, such as the high-end [[Dimensia]] model.

Some owners would dismiss this lawsuit, simply by using a [[VCR]] as an external TV tuner, or a [[cable box (electronics)|cable box]] of some kind on the Channel 9x inputs, since a tactic like this would later be used for the [[2009 analog shutdown]] on older (i.e. NTSC-only) TVs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11608">{{Costume}}
A '''costumed character''' wears a costume that usually (but not always) covers the performer's face. These range from [[theme park]] "walk-around" or "meetable" characters, the [[mascot]]s of corporations, schools, or sports teams to novelty act performers. Some costumes cover the performer's face; others, especially those in theme parks, may leave the performer's face visible.

== In theme parks, international fairs, and festivals ==
Costumed characters are a major feature of [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] (Disney Parks),&lt;ref name="Sehlinger"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2014|date=2014|publisher=Keen Communications|location=Birmingham, AL|isbn=9781628090000|author=Bob Sehlinger|author2=Len Testa}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} the world's largest operator of theme parks, where the most ubiquitous character is [[Mickey Mouse]], but a wide variety of characters from different [[media franchise]]s are portrayed at various parks.  For example: 
* Disney Parks — feature approximately 250 characters&lt;ref name="Sehlinger" /&gt;{{rp|341}} from [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney Studios]]' library of animated films, live-action films, and animated TV shows, as well as characters from [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' franchises, and [[The Muppets]] franchise. [[Marvel Comics]] characters can be found in all of their parks, except for in Florida and Japan.
* [[Great Wolf Resorts]] - feature characters of characters like Wiley, Violet, Sammy, Oliver, Rachel and Brinley.
* [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts]] - feature a variety of characters from dozens of movies, TV shows, and video games. These include their own properties, like ''[[Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Despicable Me]]'', and the [[Dreamworks Animation]] library, to those not owned by the company, like ''[[Harry Potter]]'', [[Marvel Comics]] (in Florida and Japan only), ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' (the latter two in Japan only).
* [[Six Flags]] parks — feature [[Time-Warner]]'s [[Looney Tunes]] cartoons, [[DC Comics]] superhero characters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sixflags.com/greatAmerica/entertainment/AllEntertainment.aspx Six Flags entertainment website]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' characters.
* [[Cedar Point]], [[Knott's Berry Farm]], and other [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company|Cedar Fair]] parks — feature ''[[Peanuts]]'' characters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/park/kids/camp_snoopy.cfm Camp Snoopy at Cedar Point] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216112312/http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/park/kids/camp_snoopy.cfm |date=2008-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knotts.com/park/tour/csnoopy/ Camp Snoopy at Knott's Berry Farm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209204200/http://www.knotts.com/park/tour/csnoopy/ |date=2008-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kings Island]], [[California's Great America]], [[Kings Dominion]], [[Carowinds]], [[Canada's Wonderland]] — until recently featured [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] characters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitkingsisland.com/attractions/index.cfm Nickelodeon Universe at Kings Island] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229020303/http://www.visitkingsisland.com/attractions/index.cfm |date=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cagreatamerica.com/attractions/ Nickelodeon Central at California's Great America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219204258/http://www.cagreatamerica.com/attractions/ |date=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (and before that, [[Hanna-Barbera]] characters). {{as of|2016||}}, the ''Peanuts'' characters listed above, have taken their place.
* [[SeaWorld]] Parks and Resorts - Outside of their original characters like Shamu, they have the American theme park rights to the muppets from ''[[Sesame Street]]''. They also own the show's own theme park, [[Sesame Place]].
Other theme parks, as well as international expositions and fairs, create their own meetable characters.
[[File:June 1984 Snap Shot.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seymore D. Fair]] - 1984 Louisiana World Exposition Character Mascot.]]
Costumed characters are intended to add to the fantasy experience by enabling visitors to encounter and interact with fictional characters, such as [[mascot]]s for a company or organization. The characters are portrayed by employees in costume. Some of the costumes merely consist of clothing and makeup (e.g. [[Sleeping Beauty (Disney)|Sleeping Beauty]], [[Anna (Disney)|Anna]] and [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]], [[Batman]], [[Captain America]]), while those for non-human characters generally conceal the performer entirely and include a full-head/body mask (e.g. [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]], [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], [[Bugs Bunny]] and his crew, [[Scooby-Doo]], [[Minions (Despicable Me)|The Minions]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Godzilla]], [[Woody Woodpecker]], [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]], [[Elmo]], and World Exposition characters such as [[Seymore D. Fair]], [[Twipsy]], and [[Haibao]]).   A longstanding policy of Disney Parks is that the first category of characters, where the performer's face remains visible ("face" characters) are allowed to speak (usually on the basis of scripts carefully prepared in advance), while the second category of characters, where the face is covered ("fur" characters) are not allowed to speak, but can make a kissing sound, and can only communicate through [[pantomime]].&lt;ref name="Sehlinger" /&gt;{{rp|343}}

An interesting phenomenon regularly seen at Disney Parks with costumed characters, especially "fur" characters, is that young children can become very scared at first sight, when they belatedly realize a character they may have seen only on television or in a book is ''much'' larger in person.&lt;ref name="Sehlinger" /&gt;{{rp|342–343}}

For human characters based on a well-known [[media franchise]] that speak with visitors, theme park operators may prepare detailed scripts covering a variety of questions regularly asked by visitors, especially young children who have difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy.  Performers cast in those roles are required to memorize and rehearse those scripts as part of their training, so they can learn their characters' [[backstory|backstories]] by heart and consistently respond in character to visitors.

At the largest theme parks (especially Disney Parks), popular costumed characters are often accompanied by one or more assistants in regular park uniforms, who handle [[customer service]], [[security]], and [[crowd control]].  This minimizes the necessity for performers to [[Breaking character|break character]] to deal with those kinds of issues.  When a performer really needs a [[Break (work)|break]] (as staying in character is hard work), they simply give a prearranged signal, and their handler will then assure patrons the character will be back momentarily.

All theme park operators that present costumed characters enforce strict character performance regulations so that performers are ''never'' seen out of character by visitors.  In the case of more elaborate costumes, they are never seen "with their head off."  A related rule is that performers costumed as the same character (normally to allow the other to go on break) are supposed to avoid being seen side-by-side by the public.

== In Japan ==
The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name for costumed performers is {{Nihongo|''kigurumi''|着ぐるみ}}. The name comes from the Japanese verb {{Nihongo|''kiru''|着る|to wear}} and noun {{Nihongo|''nuigurumi''|ぬいぐるみ|stuffed toy}}. Japan's [[kawaii]] aesthetic means that mascots are commonly used for promotional purposes. These mascots are often constructed with an appearance that is more [[Chibi (term)|chibi]] than Western mascots, with a massive head that encompasses the performer's entire upper body and the arms low on the body. Other mascots more greatly resemble [[anime]] characters.

=== Animegao ===
[[File:Animegao at Kyoto International Manga Summit.jpg|thumb|188x188px|A "{{Not a typo|doller}}" at the 2008 Kyoto International Manga Summit]]
{{Main|Animegao kigurumi}}
''Animegao''{{Nihongo|2 = アニメ顔|4 = ''anime face''}} is a type of ''kigurumi'' used to portray anime or cartoon characters. The face of the performer is fully covered with a stylized [[mask]], and the costume of the character is worn. ''Animegao'' costumes are used both in professional stage shows and by [[cosplay]]ers, sometimes called "dollers", who make custom masks of various characters. It is still a very minor part of the cosplay scene in Japan, though around 2005, it began attracting attention in other countries, including the United States, [[Canada]], and European countries.

==On television==
Current shows featuring a costumed character puppet include [[Big Bird]] of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', [[Barney &amp; Friends#Barney|Barney]] from ''[[Barney and Friends]]'', and Bear of ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''. Less complicated characters include ''[[Hip Hop Harry]]'' or ''[[RAGGS Kids Club Band]]''.

Older examples include ''[[New Zoo Revue]]'', ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'', ''[[Banana Splits]]'', and British series ''[[Gophers!]]''.

== Unauthorized costume characters ==
In recent years, performers wearing unauthorized, [[Counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeit]] costumes of pop-culture characters such as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Elmo]], [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] or [[Spider-Man]] have appeared in popular tourist destinations such as [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and [[Times Square]]. They usually pose for photos and collect (or, often, [[Extortion|extort]]) [[Gratuity|tip]]s from tourists. The 2007 documentary film ''[[Confessions of a Superhero]]'' focuses on costumed "superheroes" on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Because they are not regulated or authorized, there have been many controversies and arrests involving costumed characters in Times Square.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Christopher.

==Industry==
The mascot industry is estimated at $5-million a year.&lt;ref name=macleans-2011&gt;{{cite journal|title=Character builders|journal=Macleans|date=28 July 2011|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/07/28/character-builders/|accessdate=28 July 2011|publisher=Rogers Media|location=Toronto ON}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], is one of the hubs in the industry, with six major firms headquartered out of the city.&lt;ref name=macleans-2011 /&gt; Knock-off costumes are fabricated in, among other places, [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Kirk.

'''''Divine Divinity''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Larian Studios]] and published by [[cdv Software Entertainment]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], which was released in September 2002. It has three sequels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/beyond-divinity | title=Beyond Divinity for Windows | work=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Beyond Divinity]]'', ''[[Divinity II]]'', and ''[[Divinity: Original Sin II]]''. It also has a prequel, ''[[Divinity: Original Sin]]''; and a spin-off, ''[[Divinity: Dragon Commander]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Divd sewer combat.jpg|thumb|left|While exploring a dimly-lit sewer system, the male warrior character runs into a massed attack of lizardmen warriors and assassins. The character statistics and equipment windows are open. In the upper left is the auto-map window]]

''Divine Divinity'' is an [[action role-playing game]] with a top-down camera angle and controlled primarily through the mouse.  Its gameplay is focused on [[hack and slash]] combat and has significant similarities to ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'', with features such as random equipment generation and a wide set of skills organized into archetypes.

Unlike Diablo, ''Divine Divinity'' also features a significant amount of traditional [[computer role-playing game]] elements such as branching conversation trees, non-combat skills like lockpicking, pickpocketing, and bartering, and a reputation and disposition system to track how NPCs will react to the player.

The game also incorporates point-and-click elements which allows the player to move and manipulate certain items in the world. For example, a barrel can be clicked and dragged to move it, revealing that a key is underneath it, or a hay bale can be clicked to spread it out and provide a bed for the player to rest.

The skill system, which would become a staple in later Divinity games, allows a character of any starting class to learn any skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.locusinn.com/show/infopages?gameid=179 | title=Divine Divinity - All info pages | publisher=Locus Inn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system of attributes is also open-ended, allowing the player to develop their character in any direction regardless of their initial class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.larian.com/Site/english/divinity/faq_char.html | title=Divine Divinity | publisher=[[Larian Studios]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Two thousand years before the game begins, those who sat on Council of Seven in the land of Rivellon sacrificed themselves in the fight against a group of treacherous magicians, who had passed over to the dark side of magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.locusinn.com/show/infopage?infoid=12&amp;gameid=179 | title=The Prophecy: Pre-story to Divine Divinity | publisher=Locus Inn}}&lt;/ref&gt; To remember the Council of Seven, the "Divine Order" was founded to pass on the knowledge of the wise men to the next generations.

At the beginning of the game, the player wakes up in a house in Aleroth, a town of healers. It is revealed that Mardaneus, leader of the town, has gone crazy, and the player is asked to help by traveling into the catacombs beneath the town to stop the undead mage Thelyron, who is driving Mardaneus mad. Once Thelyron is put to rest, Mardaneus appears to bring the player back to the surface.

With the crisis in Aleroth resolved, the player leaves to explore, and is ambushed by a dragon rider, but is saved by the appearance of the wizard Zandalor, who explains that the player is one of three Marked Ones, and asks the player to meet him at an inn. Shortly thereafter, the other two Marked Ones are discovered dead, leaving only the player. The player is invited to come to Castle Stormfist, home of Duke Janus, a young noble who claims to be the Divine, a messiah prophesied to protect Rivellon against the summoning of the demon Chaos.  The player is forced to do menial tasks for Janus, and no matter what they do, they end up in a dungeon, and have to fight their way out.

Once free, Zandalor takes the player to where the Council of Seven met, and explains that in order to find the real Divine, the heirs to the Council of Seven have to be brought together.  In doing so, the player learns more about the way events have been manipulated by the Black Ring, the evil organization dedicated to bringing the demon Chaos back to Rivellon; the orcs have been goaded into attacking humans, and the elves and dwarves are poised at the brink of war, until the player reveals the manipulation going on.

As the new council members assemble to complete the ritual that will turn the player into the Divine, Duke Janus appears, revealing himself to be the Demon of Lies, in league with the Black Ring and seeking to summon Chaos. The council is attacked and a number of the members slain, along with the player. The player returns to life, however, with new abilities as the Divine, and is able to reach the fortress where the Black Ring is summoning Chaos. The Divine defeats Janus, but finds a baby who was picked to be the vessel of Chaos, lying on the summoning altar, and carries the baby out in their arms.

==Development==
An early version of the isometric game engine was used by Larian Studios for its very first project, ''Unless: The Treachery of Death'', in 1996. Larian Studios was about to sign a publishing deal with [[Atari]], but it didn't come to be as Atari announced its departure from the PC platform.&lt;ref name="rpgvaultarchive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rpgvaultarchive.ign.com/features/interviews/divinity.shtml | title=Divinity, The Sword of Lies Interview | publisher=[[IGN]] RPG Vault | date=March 22, 2000 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713005305/http://rpgvaultarchive.ign.com/features/interviews/divinity.shtml | archivedate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after [[Attic Entertainment Software]] joined Larian and ''Unless'' was turned into ''The Lady, the Mage and the Knight'', a game set in the universe of ''[[The Dark Eye]]''. Due to financial problems between the two development studios and its publisher, [[Infogrames]], ''The Lady, the Mage and the Knight'' was canceled in July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Swen Vincke | url=http://www.larian.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/000408.html | title=The truth about LMK | publisher=Larian Studios | date=April 30, 2011 | accessdate=April 15, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010815212428/http://www.larian.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/000408.html | archivedate=August 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Divine Divinity'' development started in early 1999&lt;ref name="rpgvaultarchive"/&gt; codenamed ''Project C'' and later ''Divinity: The Sword of Lies''. The publisher forced Larian to change the name to ''Divine Divinity'' from ''Divinity: The Sword of Lies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=437807&amp;#Post437807 | title=Re: More Blood and Gore ? [Re: GabeN] | publisher=Larian Studios | accessdate=July 22, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722170740/http://www.larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=437807&amp; | archivedate=July 22, 2014 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was re-released in 2004 along with ''Beyond Divinity'' as a part of ''Beyond Divinity: Deluxe Edition''. In 2009 a remastered version of Divine Divinity was released as a download on [[GOG.com]], the main change being support for higher resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=390118&amp;an= | title=A touch of Divinity at GOG.COM! | publisher=Larian Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 it was noticed that the [[source code]] of the "remastered" version 1.4 was lost because of a [[backup]] failure.

The game received "generally favorable reviews" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] opined that there is "much more to ''Divine Divinity'' than its impressive graphics and music and its combination of hack-and-slash action and pure role-playing, and that says a lot for the game."&lt;ref name="gspot"/&gt;

[[IGN]] declared, in summary, that "''Divine Divinity'' is a very easy game to get into and enjoy. It lacks anything memorable, like the party NPCs with minds and dialog of their own in ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'', but it has atmosphere, tons of quests, and a great deal of variety to offer. Above all, it's plain fun to play, to develop your character and find ever-better weapons and armor, to face the foe around the next corner. And who knows...? With [[BioWare]]'s assets tied up in light sabers and [[Black Isle Studios]] working on a game that has no strategic pause mode, perhaps Larian will step forward to carry the CRPG banner in the near future. We could do a lot worse."&lt;ref name="ign2002"/&gt;

''Divine Divinity'' was a nominee for ''[[PC Gamer US]]''{{'}}s "2002 Best Roleplaying Game", [[GameSpy]]'s "PC RPG Game of the Year", [[RPG Vault]]'s "RPG of the Year" and GameSpot's "Best Role-Playing Game on PC" awards, but lost these prizes to ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]''.&lt;ref name=rpgvault2002&gt;{{cite web | author=Staff | url=http://rpgvault.ign.com:80/articles/382/382567p1.html  | title=2002 RPG Vault Awards | work=[[RPG Vault]] | date=January 13, 2003 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918055234/http://rpgvault.ign.com:80/articles/382/382567p1.html | archivedate=September 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gamespy2002&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914023924/http://archive.gamespy.com:80/goty2002/pc/ |url=http://archive.gamespy.com:80/goty2002/pc/  |title=GameSpy 2002 Game of the Year PC | author=Staff | work=[[GameSpy]] |archivedate=September 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gamespot2002&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030207155400/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/bestof2002/ |url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/bestof2002/ |title=GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2002 | author=GameSpot Staff | work=[[GameSpot]] |archivedate=March 7, 2003 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcgamerusawards2003&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 2003 | title=The Ninth Annual ''PC Gamer'' Awards | volume=10 | number=3 | pages=48–50, 54, 58, 60, 66, 68, 70  | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | author=Smith, Rob }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a runner-up in GameSpot's "Best Music on PC" and "Best Game No One Played on PC" categories.&lt;ref name=gamespot2002 /&gt; However, ''Divine Divinity'' won RPG Vault's awards for "Surprise of the Year" and "Outstanding Achievement in Music"; the publication's editors wrote that its score "very proficiently supports the changing moods and locations in the game, never becoming either overwhelming or repetitive."&lt;ref name=rpgvault2002 /&gt;

'''Dogs On Acid''' (also known as its abbreviation '''DOA''' by its users), is a UK-based [[electronic music]] website, established in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www73.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=dogsonacid.com ''Wolfram Alpha Statistics''] Wolfram Alpha: Accessed 18 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dogs On Acid began life as a community on [[Bad Company (drum and bass group)|Bad Company]]'s website, bcrecordings.com, back in 2000.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

On 27 April 2010, the website reached 10 million posts from the forums, with almost 9 million posts on The Board and over a million on The Grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=674782&amp;mode=article "DOGS ON ACID REACHES 10 MILLION POSTS"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918111246/http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=674782&amp;mode=article |date=18 September 2012 }} Dogs On Acid: Accessed 27 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawkey.co.uk/2010/04/dogs-on-acid-reaches-10-million-posts/ "Dogs On Acid Reaches 10 Million Posts"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Its not just music: Accessed 28 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Next to a community which holds over 87,000 members, the website features: an Editorial section, stores selling merchandise and - in cooperation with Track It Down - online [[music download]]s, an image gallery, an online radio and an audio section, showcasing the latest tracks from the scene. The Grid, the website's [[Record producer|music production]] section, is the birthplace of many new D&amp;B talent. [[Noisia]], Mistabishi, [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Alix Perez]], [[Danny Byrd]] and Data to name a few, were regular contributors before gaining any mainstream popularity. Next to this, most D&amp;B artists and promoters are or were regular contributors to the community. Dogs On Acid also runs various music labels: [[Breakbeat Kaos]], Dogs On Acid&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/label/Dogs+On+Acid Discogs listing of the Dogs on Acid label releases]&lt;/ref&gt; and Under Construction (''See BBK [[Breakbeat Kaos discography#Sublabels|Sublabels]]'') and promotes and organises various parties worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/content/redbridge/recorder/whatson/story.aspx?brand=RECOnline&amp;category=whatsonclubmix&amp;tBrand=northlondon24&amp;tCategory=whatsonnewham&amp;itemid=WeED25%20May%202006%2009%3A16%3A18%3A457 ''Drum in the sun'']{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Romford Recorder: Accessed 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perception, controversy and rivalry==
Dogs on Acid's arch-rivals are [[Drum and Bass Arena]]. The rivalry spawns from the fact that both portals are arguably the two biggest content-filled websites for the drum and bass genre on the internet. Today the relationship between both forums are light-hearted, where both production sub-forums have competitions for best track and mixes; bringing the comprehensive community together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnbforum.com/archive/index.php?t-20147.html "DOA vs DNBA 2005 Production Forum Results"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710142104/http://dnbforum.com/archive/index.php?t-20147.html |date=10 July 2011 }} dnb Forum: Accessed 19 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.girodivite.it%2Fbreve.php3%3Fid_breve%3D1315 "Maffia Bologna: prossimo live"] Girodivite: Accessed 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of DOA's users are considered more international whereas DnB Arena is a site mainly aimed at UK; although a few members post on both.

===Jungle Sound Gold===
The Drum &amp; Bass group [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] started much of their activity on DOA, before and during their time being signed to [[Breakbeat Kaos]] (BBK), posting on the board and helping other producers on production forum the 'Grid'. During this time DOA was to become the first board to get hit with any news of their releases, also causing the group to be hit with many questions on the production side. Following the success of Pendulum's Slam and [[Hold Your Colour]], Fresh decided to release a compilation CD entitled [[Jungle Sound: The Bassline Strikes Back!|Jungle Sound]] [[Jungle Sound: Gold|Gold Edition]]. Pendulum responded to the thread stating they had no idea about the release nor gave any permission. [[Rob Swire]] responded by admitting no knowledge of the album's release, and that it had nothing to do with the band. Rob also stated they gave Fresh &amp; Adam F low quality tracks to be used for a set and not for releases. &lt;blockquote&gt;''We didn't approve and in fact strongly disapprove of the 'Junglesound Gold' artwork, especially in relation to our name being unfairly used as an advertisement - plainly an attempt to link 'Junglesound Gold' to the recent success of 'Hold Your Colour'.''&lt;br /&gt;
''As a result of the above, we do not endorse 'Junglesound Gold' at all.&lt;br /&gt;
- Pendulum.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=375398&amp;cache=2301 Re: 'junglesound Gold']. Dogs On Acid (1 March 2006). Retrieved on 25 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the few [[Internet forum#Thread|threads]] that caused uproar within the forum and gained over a thousand replies &amp; 141,000 views in the space of 4 weeks from [[Rob Swire|Rob's]] post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=375398 "Re: 'junglesound Gold'"] DOA: Accessed 20 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; News of the scandal spread quickly, even being mentioned on Radio 1's Drum &amp; Bass show only a week later. Fresh was also accused by various members for deviously capitalizing on [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum's]] sudden success. Since the incident, Fresh gave his statement (although by this point the CD was out) and Pendulum left the label. On 18 June 2007 Fresh released Pendulum's last 12" Single: Blood Sugar / Axle Grinder along with a special edition ‘[[Hold Your Colour]]’ CD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=455805 " BBK/PENDULUM Joint Press Statement (08/12/06)"] DOA: Accessed 20 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pendulum Vs DOA===
Although Pendulum (which at that time included Rob Swire, Paul Harding and Gareth McGrillen) felt the forum began to become negative and cut ends with BBK &amp; Fresh, they continued posting on the portal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atm-mag.co.uk/issue57/pendulum.htm "PENDULUM/INTERVIEW ISSUE 57"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830181958/http://www.atm-mag.co.uk/issue57/pendulum.htm |date=30 August 2009 }} ATM Magazine: Accessed 20 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Once the track "Granite" was released, Pendulum became ridiculed by various members for their change in style and being accused of "selling out" for mainstream success. Although the album was highly successful the band continued to receive heavy sarcasm and accusations for killing the genre from various members, described by the board as "haters". Pendulum responded by saying ''"if we 'killed drum and bass' last time, this is the final nail in its coffin."'' As the album continued to do well in the mainstream (including Propane Nightmares peaking at #9 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]) the band continued to be criticised by DnB enthusiasts, to the point where in March 2009 the band were booed at the Drum and Bass awards from certain enthusiasts for ''"selling out"'' "sounding more rock and having a different style to their preceding album".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teletext.co.uk/planetsound/news/8f94d79ffc51d134a4940df006c71208/Pendulum+attack+critics.aspx "Pendulum attack critics"] Teletext: Accessed 21 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/10213-sultans-of-swing-pendulum-interview/ "Sultans of swing - Pendulum Interview"] Edinburgh Festival Guide: Accessed 21 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving a heavy amount of criticism Pendulum decided to respond one more time and left the forum and have never posted since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatportal.com/feed/item/pendulum-strike-back/  "Pendulum strike back on drum and bass forum"] BeatPortal: Accessed 21 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
The Grid (Production side) holds monthly Q&amp;A Sessions where posters and members get to ask (mainly productive) questions to notable producers and artists. Members of the grid also collaborate to their 'Grid wiki'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnbwiki.com/index.php/Main_Page "Welcome to DNBWiki.com! "] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721203946/http://www.dnbwiki.com/index.php/Main_Page |date=21 July 2009 }} DnB WIki: Accessed 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The board holds more ambiguous discussions than in its early days. Regardless of the fact that Drum &amp; Bass Isn't discussed as much this hasn't hindered the website; only leading them to receive just as much members as before. The board is still favoured for having discussions and debates on varied music and not just drum and Bass, it brings even notable DJs to post their opinions such as radio one's Grooverider or [[Mary Anne Hobbs]]. Mary Anne announced during an interview ''"Everything happens on-line. The forums and the bloggers are running things - dubstepforum.com and dogsonacid.com are phenomenal".''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/mary-anne-hobbs-my-life-in-media-422158.html  "Mary Anne Hobbs: My life in media"] The Independent: Accessed 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.rwcactivist.com/media/storage/paper248/news/2006/01/23/ArtsAndEntertainment/Internet.Review.Dogsonacid.More.Than.A.Peta.Nightmare-1369698.shtml  "Internet review: DogsOnAcid more than a PETA nightmare"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Activist: Accessed 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The forum is often compared with dubstepforum like it once was with [[Drum and Bass Arena|DNBA]].

Although Fresh is still listed as a shareholder of Dogs on Acid, he recently mentioned that he no longer has anything to do with the running of the forum or website. It is unknown whether he still holds his share.

==Developments (DOA V3)==

The website is based on an old version of [[VBulletin]] and was purportedly scheduled for a major refurbish in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The aim of this development was to make the website more of a [[Web 2.0]] community{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} involving mash-ups from [[soundcloud]] and other MP3 stores. According to an old thread, some of these changes were purportedly being tested around 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=582757 "http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=582757"] DOA: Accessed Sept 03, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on Friday 17 December 2010 that 'DOA V3' would go live on the following Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid%3D699870%26mode%3Darticle |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230195616/http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=699870&amp;mode=article |archivedate=30 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this failed to happen with the site's owner instead stating that there was "no exact date" for the changeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?s%3Dcd48da1f224aa9d78999616f5159f456%26threadid%3D699874%26perpage%3D20%26pagenumber%3D4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010203859/http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?s=cd48da1f224aa9d78999616f5159f456&amp;threadid=699874&amp;perpage=20&amp;pagenumber=4 |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the week of 17 January 2011, many of the bugs that plagued the site redesign were worked on. DOA pushed through its V3 revisions in 2011 and celebrated a decade of existence.

On 23 September 2013, the forum was taken offline with no explanation as to why it was taken down. In a quickly set up alternative forum,&lt;ref&gt;http://doa.freeforums.net&lt;/ref&gt; several of the former forum moderators pledged to find a way to resurrect the website. However, in January 2014, the site was relaunched under new ownership, with updated design and servers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/threads/doa-reborn-whats-been-happening-with-dogsonacid.759043/] DOA: Accessed 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relaunch==

The site went offline in October 2013 due to financial problems, before the sale of the domain to a user named "Vexus".&lt;ref name="dogsonacid.com"&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/threads/doa-reborn-whats-been-happening-with-dogsonacid.759043/] DogsOnAcid: Accessed 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
On the 10 January 2014, a placeholder page appeared on the original domain stating that the site would be "Renamed. Rebranded. Relaunched".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/ "DogsOnAcid - Renamed. Rebranded. Relaunched."] DogsOnAcid: Accessed 12 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Facebook account repeated the message on the website,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/OfficialDOA/ "Dogs On Acid | Facebook"] Facebook: Accessed 14 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  whereas the Twitter account had the message "RIP DOA".&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/DogsOnAcid/ "Dogs On Acid Twitter"] Twitter: Accessed 14 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; However, in late January, the site was relaunched under the name "Mixspace", sporting a new design, but keeping the existing forums and database. Due to the Dogs on Acid branding being more popular, the site soon reverted to its original name and banned DJ Mix.&lt;ref name="dogsonacid.com"/&gt;

'''''Double Dare''''' is a 2004 [[documentary film]] about [[stunt double|stuntwomen]], specifically [[Jeannie Epper]] and [[Zoë Bell]], directed by [[Amanda Micheli]].&lt;ref name="Double Dare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/613648/Double-Dare/|title=Double Dare|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documentary follows Epper and Bell over several years, Epper from 1997 and Bell from the end of ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' in 2001, to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/doubledare/qa.html PBS - Filmmaker Q&amp;A - Independent Lens - DOUBLE DARE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins with Bell finishing her work on ''Xena'' and Epper searching for continuing work in [[Hollywood]] despite her age, even considering liposuction before forgoing cosmetic surgery.  ''Xena'' ends its run and Bell struggles with what to do next in her career.  Meanwhile, Epper negotiates to have a women's category included in the [[Taurus World Stunt Awards]] (also called the World Stunt Awards).  Bell is invited to the United States for a ''Xena'' [[Fan convention|convention]].  There she meets Epper and, obtaining a ticket with the help of the documentary crew, attends the stunt awards.  Though initially receiving an offer to work on [[Cleopatra 2525|a series]] starring [[Victoria Pratt]], Bell ultimately does not get the job and returns home to New Zealand.

The film resumes one year later with Bell still training, though unemployed, and planning a move to America.  She stays with Epper, who is attempting to get a job working on ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' with Terry Leonard.  Epper helps Bell assemble the necessary elements for her to start her career in America, such as a [[resume|CV]] and [[head shot]]s.  She also warns Bell about the deceptive nature of Hollywood, instructing her to list her weight as 130 [[pounds (mass)|lbs]] when Bell actually judges herself to weigh 145.  Epper takes her to a training session, where they encounter [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s stunt scout Kenny Lesco, who is looking for someone to [[stunt double|double]] [[Uma Thurman]] in ''[[Kill Bill]]''.  Lesco arranges for an [[audition]] on the same day as the training session.  Epper and Bell drive to Tarantino's [[Culver City]] training center for the audition, there meeting Tarantino himself as he evaluates Bell.  Much to her delight, she earns the job doubling Thurman and is sent to train in [[Beijing]] with [[Yuen Wo Ping]].

Eventually Bell begins filming for ''Kill Bill Vol. 1''; the documentary shows her working on the fight between [[Beatrix Kiddo]] (Thurman) and [[O-Ren Ishii]] ([[Lucy Liu]]) and her bodyguards, as well as several other fight scenes.  The film ends with Epper being honored by the Stuntmen's Association and Bell speaking optimistically about her future as an adult.

{{nihongo|'''''Dream Club Zero'''''|'''ドリームクラブゼロ''' or '''Dream C Club Zero'''}}  is a [[dating sim]] [[video game]] developed by [[Tamsoft]] and published by [[D3 Publisher]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game is a prequel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Anoop Gantayat | date=September 3, 2010 | title=Dream Club Zero: The Couch is Full | url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/09/03/dream_club_zero_full_cast/ | work=andriasang.com | accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Dream Club]] and basically a [[Host and hostess clubs|Japanese hostess]] game where the player gets drunk with the hostess while trying to gain her favor. The game was released on January 27, 2011.&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt; It was released on [[PlayStation Vita]] on December 17, 2011. This game is rated D by [[CERO]], due to featuring more sexual themes than the previous game, such as erotic eating.

==Gameplay==
The player's goal of the game is to achieve a happy ending with a hostess working at the club by repeatedly visiting her there and eventually winning her heart. Visiting the club costs money which is raised by doing part-time jobs which are performed by the player simply selects one work option from among two to four, after which the result of player's work is immediately displayed and money is collected. Money is spent on club entrance, drinks purchased there for both the player and a selected hostess, and on gifts for hostesses.
The majority of the game is spent at the club one-on-one with a hostess of player's choice, trying to raise her level of affection for the player by answering her questions in a favorable way, giving her desired presents, and scoring high on mini-games which include karaoke performances by the hostesses during which the player times button presses along with the music, as commonly done in music games. Player's performance over repeated visits determines whether player will achieve a happy ending with a particular hostess, or is left lonesome and unable to return to the club again due to expired membership or triggered a certain event that causes both of the player to remain as friends only rather than lovers.

'''Edward Vincent Bracken''' (February 7, 1915 &amp;ndash; November 14, 2002) was an American actor. Bracken became a [[Hollywood]] comedy legend with lead performances in the films ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]'' and ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]'' both in 1944, and both have been preserved by the [[National Film Registry]]. During this era, he also had success on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], with performances in plays like ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]'' (1941).

Bracken's later movie roles include ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' (1983), ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' (1991), ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'' (1992), and ''[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]'' (1993).

==Life and career==
[[File:Howard Freeman and Eddie Bracken 1954.JPG|thumb|Howard Freeman and Eddie Bracken 1954]]
Bracken was born in [[Astoria, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the son of Joseph L.  and Catherine Bracken.&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Severo|first1=Richard|title=Eddie Bracken Dies at 87; Acted in Sturges Comedies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/16/arts/eddie-bracken-dies-at-87-acted-in-sturges-comedies.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bracken performed in vaudeville at the age of nine and gained fame with the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]'' in a role he reprised for the 1940 film adaptation. He had performed in a short film series called ''The Kiddie Troupers'' (one of many ''[[Our Gang]]''-like series) prior to that, but that film was his big break. In 1936, Bracken enjoyed success on Broadway with his starring run in the Joseph Viertel play ''So Proudly We Hail''. The military drama, co-starring [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]], opened to much fanfare but closed after 14 performances at the 46th Street Theater.

In the 1940s, director [[Preston Sturges]] cast Bracken in two of his best-loved films, ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]'', opposite [[Betty Hutton]], and ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]''. Due to the popularity of these films, Eddie Bracken was a household name during [[World War II]]. He made numerous [[radio]] broadcasts and had his own program, ''[[The Eddie Bracken Show]]''.

In 1953, Bracken left [[Hollywood]]. He appeared on Broadway in ''[[Shinbone Alley]]'', ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'' and ''[[Sugar Babies (musical)|Sugar Babies]]''. His last appearance on Broadway was in the musical ''[[Dreamtime (musical)|Dreamtime]]'', directed by David Niles at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] at the age of 77.

Bracken's extensive television roles between 1952 and 2000 include an episode of ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' as Rose Nylund's ex-childhood boyfriend from St. Olaf, as well as an episode of ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' playing a stubborn old man who refuses to believe that he has died.  After nearly 30 years out of feature films, he returned to perform character roles, including the sympathetic ''Walley World'' theme park founder Roy Walley in ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', and ''Duncan's Toy Chest'' toy store owner Mr. Duncan in ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]''. Bracken also had a long career with [[Papermill Playhouse]] in [[New Jersey]], starring in dozens of productions in the 1980s–early 2000s. One high point was their production of ''[[Show Boat]]'' in which he played Cap'n Andy Hawkes. This production was broadcast on PBS in 1990. He also played a cameo in [[Patrick Read Johnson]]'s 1994 film, ''[[Baby's Day Out]]'', as one of the veterans in the old soldier's home.

Bracken has acted in films with two actors who later became [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]; these were [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Donald Trump]]. Bracken co-starred in ''[[The Girl from Jones Beach]]'' with Reagan in 1949, thirty-one years before Reagan was [[United States presidential election, 1980|elected president]], and Bracken and Trump played minor parts in ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'' in 1992, twenty-four years before Trump was [[United States presidential election, 2016|elected president]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Death===
On November 14, 2002, Bracken died in [[Glen Ridge, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1466084.html]." ''Blumenfeld Development Group''. Accessed May 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of complications from an undisclosed surgery at the age of 87. His wife of 63 years, Connie Nickerson, a former actress, died in August 2002, just three months before his death.&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit/&gt; He met Connie when they performed together in a road company of the Broadway play ''[[What a Life (play)|What a Life]]'' in 1938 (Ref.: New York Times Nov. 16, 2002.). Together Eddie and Connie had five children: two sons (Michael and David) and three daughters (Judy, Carolyn and Susan).

===Hollywood Walk of Fame===
For his contributions to radio and television, Bracken has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], at 1651 Vine Street and 6751 Hollywood Boulevard respectively.

Unusual betting patterns highlight fixed matches. For example, a single very large bet for 50,000 euros on an event that usually has a total of around 160,000 euros bet, sets a flag.  This combined with an analysis of other betting patterns on the match essentially ensures that the match is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Arribas, Carlos|date=5 December 2013|title=Match-fixing extends its reach|newspaper=El Pais|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/12/05/inenglish/1386268449_855255.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207214708/http://elpais.com/m/elpais/2013/12/05/inenglish/1386268449_855255.html|archivedate=7 December 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FindMe.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the book ''Find Me'']]

'''''Find Me''''' is a memoir written by comedian, actress, and [[talk show]] host [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. It was published in 2002.

The book, which reached number two on the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller list,&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/02/books/best-sellers-june-2-2002.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm BEST SELLERS: June 2, 2002] - ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; is, at heart, a remembrance of O'Donnell's troubled childhood. It also tells the story of O'Donnell's involvement with a woman who has [[multiple personality disorder]] who initially claims to be the mother of a [[pregnant]] 14-year-old girl and later that very girl and, even later on, the girl's father.
 
O'Donnell professes her own compulsion to try to rescue others from their negative situations and details her inability to listen to the reason of those around her who urge her not to pursue the situation.

It precedes O'Donnell's latest memoir, ''[[Celebrity Detox|Celebrity Detox:The Fame Game]]'', which was published October 9, 2007.

'''Gertrud Bodenwieser''' (3 February 1890 – 10 November 1959), also known as "Gertrude", was a [[dancer]], [[choreographer]], [[dance teacher]] and pioneer of [[expressionist dance|expressive dance]].

==Life==

The daughter of Theodore and Maria Bondi, a wealthy Jewish couple, she turned to dance under the pseudonym Gertrud Bodenwieser of which she was celebrated in [[Vienna]] as a sensation. Bodenwieser's style was based on [[classical ballet]] of which she was originally taught by [[Carl Godlewski]] from 1905 to 1910; she had a new style of dance that was welcomed by the audience, critics and young students with much enthusiasm. She was inspired by the works of [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. One of her greatest successes was "Demon Machine", a dance performance, in which a group of dancers turned into machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.impulstanz.com/en/videogallery/36/ |title=Dance in Exile: Central European Expressionist Dance |publisher=www.impulstanz.com |date=2000 |access-date=2016-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrud Bodenwieser was appointed professor of dance at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna]]. In the concert hall's basement she ran her own dance studio. Her pupils went out on tours throughout Europe as the "Bodenwieser dance group". Among some of her students who went on to pursue their own careers were names such as [[Vilma Degischer]], [[Trudl Dubsky]], [[Shona Dunlop MacTavish]], [[Gisa Geert]], Grete Gross, Erika Hanka, [[Hilde Holger]], Evelyn Ippen, Susi Jeans, [[Eileen Kramer]], [[Gertrud Kraus]], [[Ena Noël]], [[Maria Palmer]], Lisl Rinaldini, Emmy Towsey, Bettina Vernon and [[Cilli Wang]].&lt;ref&gt;Vernon-Warren, B. and Warren, C.

Her dance "The Masks of Lucifer" showed intrigue, terror and hatred as personifications of political totalitarianism and became famous as the embodiment during an ominous time.

In the build-up to [[World War Two]], Gertrud Bodenwieser fled with a handful of students to [[Colombia]] in 1938, where she gave a guest performance as part of the four hundred year celebration of [[Bogotá]]. She was even able to fill a bullfight arena with enthusiastic spectators. Emigration led Bodenwieser to Australia. In Sydney, she taught dance and founded the Bodenwieser Ballet. Her teaching has produced some of the most important choreographers and dancers of Australia, including Anita Ardell, Keith Bain and Margaret Chapple.

Bodenwieser was married in 1920 to the Viennese director and playwright [[Friedrich Rosenthal]], who was murdered in 1942 in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] by the [[Nazi]] regime.

[[File:Rockford Illinois Harlem Park amusement park advertisement ca. 1890s.jpg|Harlem Park advertisement 1890s|thumb|right]]
'''Harlem Park''' was an [[amusement park]] and [[Chautauqua]] site in [[Rockford, Illinois]] that operated from 1891 to 1928. It was located on 47 wooded acres (0.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) east of Harlem Blvd. on the west bank of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River tributary)|Rock River]] on Rockford's north side. The main entrance was located between Harper and Brown Avenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rockford's Harlem Park: The People and the Times|last=Baie|first=Lyle H.|publisher=John Gile Communications |location=Rockford, Ill.|year=1987}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rides ==
Harlem Park was known for its roller coaster, "The Famous Switchback Railway - Cars Run 1100 Feet In 26 Seconds". The park also featured: Steam Merry Go Around (later Electric Carousel), Three Way Figure Eight Scenic Railway, Shoot the Chutes, Giant Flying Circle Swing, Maze, The Old Mill (Tunnel of Love), Laughing Gallery Fun House, boat rentals, picnic grounds, a 5000-seat auditorium, a dance pavilion, a roller skating palace, a swimming pool (1922), and the midway bordered on both sides with such attractions as the ice cream parlor, lunch room, games of skill, and the rides.

== Chautauqua ==
Beginning in 1902, the Assembly of the Rockford Chautauqua met at Harlem Park for two weeks each summer, with attendance of over 80,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockfordreminisce.com/amusement-parks-gallery-1/|title=Rockford's Harlem Park|last=Cohen|first=Doug|work=RockfordReminisce.com|access-date=March 26, 2018}}{{better source|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants could rent tents and stay overnight on site, enjoying educational and entertainment programs during the day and evening. Lecturers included [[William Jennings Bryan]], [[Robert M. La Follette|"Fighting Bob" La Follette]] and [[Jane Addams]].

== Transportation ==
The Rockford Street Railway Company developed Harlem Park as a terminus for its streetcar line serving the north side of the city. A car barn stood near the park between Harlem Blvd. and Clinton Street on the south side of Brown Ave. During the summer, cars departed every 15 minutes from the center of town, bound for the park. The park was also served by two steamboats running two miles upstream from the center of town and by an electric ferry bringing park patrons across the river. 
[[File:Rockford Illinois Harlem Park amusement park steamboat "Illinois" 1910.png|Steamboat ''Illinois'' at Harlem Park 1910|thumb|right]]

== Demise ==
At the close of the 1928 summer season the park was closed, and some of the attractions were moved to Central Park (1921-1942) on the west edge of the city. In preparation for a residential subdivision, a 2,000-foot seawall was built on the river bank and the land behind it was built up by as much as six feet with material dredged from the river. The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought the project to a standstill and it was 1948 before the first home was built in the Rock Terrace subdivision.

'''''En la cama''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''In Bed'') is a [[2005 in film|2005]] [[Chile]]an film [[Film director|directed]] by [[Matías Bize]] and starring [[Blanca Lewin]] and [[Gonzalo Valenzuela]].

It was Chile's submission to the [[79th Academy Awards]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref name="VarietySubmissionList"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117952315.html?nav=news&amp;categoryid=1985&amp;cs=1|title=Oscar race counts 61 countries|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]|author=Sneider, Jeff|date=2006-10-19|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZHeraldShortlist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/location/story.cfm?l_id=34&amp;objectid=10419560|title=Foreign language Oscar nominees announced|publisher=''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the film garnered ten awards at various film festivals.

==Plot==
Set entirely in a Santiago motel room, two young middle-class people are seen making love. They met while leaving a party and do not know each other's names. The man and woman eventually tell each other their names; he is Bruno and she is Daniela. As the night progresses in between having sex with each other, they share more details of their lives, their sorrows and their fears. Bruno pretends that his girlfriend, who rings him up on his cellphone, is his ex and admits that he is moving to Belgium for postgraduate study. Daniela admits that her man can be violent but she is going to marry him anyway. From initial passion they have moved to confidences, even tenderness, yet she insists that it will remain her last fling before matrimony.

[[image:Set of juggling balls.jpg|thumb|right|A set of juggling beanbags]]
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Juggler.jpg|thumb|[[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1848–1906) ''Lady Juggler'']]

'''Juggling balls''', or simply '''balls''',  are a popular [[juggling prop|prop]] used by [[juggling|jugglers]], either on their own&amp;mdash;usually in sets of three or more&amp;mdash;or in combination with other props such as [[juggling club|clubs]] or [[juggling ring|ring]]s.  A juggling ball refers to any juggling object that is roughly spherical in nature.

== Types ==
[[File:HDRI Sample Scene Balls (Auto Exposure).jpg|thumb|Vinyl "beach" beanbags]]
'''Beanbags''' are the most common type of juggling ball.  Juggling beanbags are typically constructed with an outer shell made from several pieces of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] or [[microfiber]] (imitation leather), and filled with [[millet]], [[birdseed]], plastic pellets, sand, crushed rock, ground rubber, or other material designed to give the beanbag bulk.&lt;ref&gt;Besmehn, Bobby (1994). ''Juggling Step-by-Step'', p.78. Sterling. {{ISBN|0-8069-0815-7}} "Bean Bag: Juggling object often round or square shaped and about 2" diameter. It is filled with rice or bird seed."&lt;/ref&gt; Beanbags come in a variety of colors, the most common being "beach" (a combination of 4 panels colored red, yellow, blue and green), white, and other combinations of colors that are easily visible.  Beanbags are preferred by many jugglers because beanbags don't bounce or roll when dropped, are caught the most easily, and have reasonable pricing and availability.  Beanbags are generally found in sizes ranging from 2.5"-3" in diameter, with weights of 90-130g. Smaller beanbags with less filling in them are sometimes used by [[Forms of juggling#Numbers|numbers jugglers]], who require a smaller and lighter ball so they can  throw and catch many balls using the same hand. 

[[File:Theaterspektakel (2010) 2010-09-04 18-52-02.JPG|thumb|Stage balls in use]]
'''Stage Balls''' are often used during juggling performances. Stage balls have a polished outer shell, typically made of plastic or hard rubber, and are hollow. For this reason, stage balls can be manufactured to a greater diameter than beanbags, whilst maintaining a more manageable weight for the juggler. Furthermore, stage balls hold their shape and color better than beanbags making them a more visual prop. Stage balls, however, tend to roll away when dropped, and therefore are not commonly used during practice.  Stage balls are generally found in sizes ranging from 2.5"-4" in diameter, though many performers such as [[Sergej Ignatov]] have used balls larger than 4" when performing for extra dramatic effect.

'''DX/Russian Balls''' are a style of juggling balls that combines many of the benefits of both beanbags and stage balls.  DX balls are constructed with a hard PVC outer shell, similar to a stage ball, and are part-filled with millet seed, to give the ball a consistent weight.  This produces a juggling ball that flies consistently in the air, and does not roll away when dropped.  The DX ball is patented in the UK by Beard Enterprises Ltd.

'''[[Bouncing ball]]s''' are designed for [[bounce juggling]], and feature a 75-90% bounce return. They are made of silicone or a synthetic rubber compound.

'''Silicone Balls''' are a type of bouncing ball most commonly used during [[bounce juggling]] and stage performances.  These balls are made of [[silicone]] and have the same clean appearance as stage balls, a surface which is easy to grip and catch, and have a consistent, high bounce.  Silicone balls are also easier to clean than stage balls, which can often scuff permanently.  Unfortunately, these balls often cost 5-7 times more than beanbags or stage balls, which often limits the use of these balls to performers and serious hobbyists. Many jugglers choose to use non-silicone bouncing balls instead, due to their far cheaper price and similar performance.

'''Russian Balls''' share some of the advantages of stage balls (rigidity, visibility) and some advantages of beanbags (dead drop). They have a thin shell, and most of the weight is provided by a filling of granular material (most commonly sand or salt). This gives them slightly unusual flight characteristics, but the low [[centre of mass]] makes them well suited for catches using other parts of the body than hands. Russian balls are sometimes home-made since the materials needed are cheap. This makes them well-suited for experimentation regarding different sizes and weights, with the main limitation being the availability of the shells. Play, from Italy, makes similar balls with a soft and slightly thicker shell, partially filled with liquid silicone or fine sand.

==Use==
Juggling balls are usually the first props that beginners attempt to juggle with, due to their simplicity (compared to other juggling props such as [[Juggling club|clubs]]) and availability.  Additionally, many common types of balls can function as juggling balls for a beginning juggler (such as tennis balls or baseballs).  Most novice jugglers often spend much time learning how to juggle three balls before moving on to other juggling props. However, some jugglers prefer to focus on only one juggling prop in order to achieve "mastery" of one art.

For the more advanced juggler, juggling balls are often used to demonstrate basic [[juggling pattern|patterns]] such as the [[cascade (juggling)|cascade]], [[fountain (juggling)|fountain]], [[shower (juggling)|shower]] and [[juggling pattern#Half shower|half-shower]], and can be used to form more creative juggling patterns as well, such as patterns involving throws around the body, blind throws or catches, and throwing or catching with parts of the body other than the hands.  Many advanced jugglers can juggle seven or more balls at once, but not seven or more rings or clubs. This is because juggling balls are the easiest to juggle, can be manufactured (or home-made) in small sizes and light weights, and beanbags can be underfilled to facilitate catching.

However, some juggling tricks, such as those typically done with [[juggling club|clubs]] or [[juggling ring|rings]] that involve spinning or twirling the prop are impossible or not as effective with balls, since a juggling ball appears the same from whichever angle it is viewed.  The use of juggling balls in passing is, for this reason, less popular than the use of clubs, since the spin of the clubs in the air is often one of the appeals of passing with juggling clubs. Clubs are also larger and therefore easier to catch when thrown from a great height or distance.

Juggling balls can also be used for [[contact juggling]], a form of juggling in which the juggler never throws the objects.  Typically, the contact juggler will use stage balls or balls specifically designed for contact juggling.

== Records ==

{{main|Juggling world records}}

The record for the most juggling balls juggled (where a "juggle" is defined as at least two throws and catches of each prop) in [[toss juggling]] is eleven ([[Alex Barron (juggler)|Alex Barron]], 2012, 25 Catches).  The record for most balls juggled in [[bounce juggling]] is ten.&lt;ref name="records_flashed"&gt;[http://www.juggling.org/records/records.html JISCON Juggling Records.]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enrico Rastelli]] is also widely reported to have been able to juggle ten balls in the 1920s.&lt;ref name = "Rastelli"&gt;[http://www.juggling.org/fame/rastelli/index.html Enrico Rastelli.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The record for the most juggling balls [[flash (juggling)|flashed]] (where each prop is thrown and caught once) is fourteen, by [[Alex Barron (juggler)|Alex Barron]] on April 19, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK6AlhTjUbY 14 Ball Flash on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Kairakutei and Ishii}}
[[File:Kairakutei Black.jpg|thumb|Henry Black, (1858-1923).]]

'''Henry James Black''' (22 December 1858 - 19 September 1923) was a [[kabuki]] actor and [[Japan]]'s first foreign-born [[rakugo]]ka, or public storyteller, performing under the name {{Nihongo|'''Kairakutei Black I'''|初代 快楽亭 ブラック|Shodai Kairakutei Burakku}}. He was also known by the name {{Nihongo|'''Black Ishii'''|石井 貎刺屈|Ishii Buratsuku}}.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz and Miyoko, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
His father was [[J. R. Black]], a singer and publisher of several newspapers in Japan, including ''[[The Far East (periodical)|The Far East]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, 146-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Black was born in Adelaide, Australia on 22 December 1858 and lived in Japan from the age of three. Following in his father’s entertainer streak, he became the first foreign-born Kabuki actor.

Black worked as an English teacher for about ten years, even publishing a textbook during that time.  He had picked up Japanese in part by hanging round his father’s publishing company, and began appearing on stage telling entertaining stories about famous European historical figures. His audience was astounded to see a foreigner not only fluent in Japanese but also fluent enough to make them laugh.  He published some of these stories in book form.  By the early 1890s, English teaching had declined in popularity, and Black took up ''[[rakugo]]'' in defiance of his mother and brother, who felt it was not only undignified but also unstable work. The rakugo master, Sanyutei Encho gladly took him under his wing.

==Kabuki and rakugo==
In March 1891, Black adopted the stage name {{Nihongo|Kairakutei (Pleasure) Black|快楽亭ブラック|}} and soon after tried his hand at acting on the Kabuki stage. He was an instant hit, playing female roles, and continued to issue printed versions of his rakugo stories. His mother, and especially his brother, John were increasingly hostile. John actually burst into one of his performances and succeeded in bringing it to an early end by loudly yelling out insults and calling him an embarrassment to the family.  The following year, Black reacted by taking Japanese nationality, and the name Ishii Black.  He had been adopted by Ishii Mine, a sweet shop owner, and appears to have largely severed links with his family from that point.

In 1892, Black played the role of [[Banzuiin Chōbei]] at the Haruki Theatre after starting to be tutored by [[Ichikawa Danjūrō IX]]. This event was regarded as being a meeting between two reformists.&lt;ref name="McArthur2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McArthur|first1=Ian|title=Mary Braddon and the English heroine in Meiji-Era Japan|journal=IAFOR Journal of Asian Studies|volume=3|issue=1|year=2017|issn=2187-6037|doi=10.22492/ijas.3.1.02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black married Mine’s daughter, Aka, but the marriage ended in divorce within two years. In 1903, Black made possibly the first [[gramophone record]]ing in Japan, one of his stories, for the British Gramophone Company. In 1904, he unveiled his comic masterpiece, “Biiru no Kakenomi” (The Beer Drinking Bet) in which a man’s friend bets him he can’t drink fifteen bottles of beer in one sitting. The man accepts the challenge but drops into a pub on the way over to check that he can manage it (with the obvious result that he was already too inebriated to drink another fifteen before he even got started.) A version of this story is still a popular rakugo tale even today.

Black was continually on tour but as time passed he became depressed about his declining popularity and earnings.  He attempted suicide in 1908 by drinking arsenic, but survived. His career slowly wound down, and he lived with his adopted son, Ishii Seikichi, another entertainer and his family. Ishii Black died of a stroke on 19 September 1923 at the age of 64 and is buried in [[Yokohama Foreign Cemetery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12992">:''This tournament should not be confused with the "King of Europe Tournament", held in 2006 by the Austrian wrestling promotion Rings of Europe.''
The '''King of Europe Cup''' ('''KOE cup''') is a [[Europe]]an [[professional wrestling tournament]] in the style of the "King of Indies" and "[[ECWA Super 8 Tournament|Super 8]]" tournaments of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="1stop1"&gt;[http://www.1stopwrestling.co.uk/view.php?ArtID=2620&amp;page=5 "TNA, IPW:UK and RQW now added to KOE Cup"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124517/http://www.1stopwrestling.co.uk/view.php?ArtID=2620&amp;page=5 |date=2007-09-29 }} Posted by Sarah Barraclough, Staff Writer at 1 Stop Wrestling. 24 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural event was hosted in [[Liverpool, England]] on the last weekend of April 2007 and was the brainchild of two [[United Kingdom|UK]] wrestling veterans [[Alex Shane]] and [[Doug Williams (wrestler)|Doug Williams]]. In what was considered a historic event in [[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom|British wrestling history]], the first event featured a tournament to crown the first KOE cup holder and involved 16 promotions and wrestlers from across the world.

==Interactive aspects==

The following ideas were advertised on the web-site prior to the tournament, but were not implemented.

*'''Prize fighting'''
For the first time in modern British wrestling, fans were given the opportunity to make voluntary donations for match of the night. This money was then added to a £1000 match of the night cash prize which was donated by event organizers, giving £500 a night for the best match on each day. Fans were given score sheets at the start of the show and were asked to put their top three matches from that night in order. The votes were collected and the three matches with the most votes were decided. The fan donated money was then added to the $1000 prize fund giving grand cash reward.

The participants who fans selected to have the best 3 matches each night then received the prize money at the end of each night with 55% for 1st prize, 35% for second, and 10% for third prize, improving the earnings of the wrestlers who give fans the best matches.&lt;ref name="1stop2"&gt;[http://www.1stopwrestling.co.uk/view.php?ArtID=2609&amp;page=3 "King Of Europe (KOE) Tournament"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124508/http://www.1stopwrestling.co.uk/view.php?ArtID=2609&amp;page=3 |date=2007-09-29 }} Posted by Sarah Barraclough, Staff Writer at 1 Stop Wrestling. 14 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Match suggestions'''
At the end of night one, fans were asked upon leaving to select two matches using the eliminated 8 wrestlers from round one. Once again these suggestions were collected and the matches with the most audience votes were made for the following evening.&lt;ref name="1stop2"/&gt;

==="Taste of IPW:UK" pre-show===
Several matches from the UK promotion took place on the afternoon card before the tournament matches in the evening of both dates. The two-hour pre-shows were billed as containing no interval, but due to travel problems for Rhino the day one pre-show actually had two intervals. These pre-shows gave one of the UK’s fastest growing independent companies a chance to be seen in front of their largest audience ever.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Chris Hero was hand-picked by CZW owner [[John Zandig]].&lt;br&gt;
² Claudio Castagnoli defeated [[Mike Quackenbush]] to qualify.&lt;br&gt;
³ Are$ qualified for the wXw spot after winning wXw's point system which saw any wrestler scoring a direct pinfall over another wrestler during one of wXw's shows was awarded one point; and whoever scored three points first would represent wXw in both this tournament and their own 16 Carat Gold Tournament. As the promotion is based on the pure effect of the sport, points are not given for a DQ, Countount, Draw or even if your tag team partner scores the fall. Wrestlers are unable to lose the points.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Matt Sydal was chosen by IWA:MS to represent the company.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; IWS's representative was decided at their "Praise the Violence" show on January 20, where El Generico won a three-way dance involving Jagged and Kid Kamikaze, and was named the official IWS representative for both the King of Europe Cup and for wXw's 16 Karat Gold tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://syndicatewrestling.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=3726 "The IWS Joins the King of Europe Cup"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005546/http://syndicatewrestling.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=3726 |date=2007-09-28 }}. Posted by Llakor on the SyndicateWrestling.com messageboard. 10 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; RQW representative Martin Stone secured his spot by being the winner of the one-night RQW Heavyweight title tournament from [[London]]’s [[York Hall]] on December 16, 2006.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;PWG representative Davey Richards won the right to represent the company by defeating a veteran of the 2006 16 Carat Gold Tournament, Rocky "Azucar" Romero, in a Double Tournament Qualifying Match (winning entry in both tournaments) at their ''Passive Hostility!'' event on December 2.&lt;ref&gt;"PWG Presents Passive Hostility on December 2!"

&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; WAW representative Zebra Kid is the son of WAW owner Ricky Knight. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Though involved with the pre-show, IPW:UK were not originally scheduled to enter a wrestler into the tournament.&lt;ref name="1stop1"/&gt; However, this was changed in February 2007 when it was revealed that IPW:UK would in fact be entering Pac.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Trent Acid won the right to represent PWU by pinning [[Gary Wolfe (wrestler)|Gary Wolfe]] in a qualifying match on March 14. &lt;br&gt;

In television, [[sitcoms]] generally use [[laugh tracks]]. However, there are some examples of these kind of works that do not use them, for different reasons, such as not wanting to induce laughter.

The following list includes television sitcoms that do not use laugh tracks, regardless of whether they are artificial (also known as canned) or obtained from an audience that reacts to the show on set as it is recorded.

[[File:Pearse - Louis de Rougemont 1.jpg|thumb|Illustration to a story by De Rougemont (Alfred Pearse, "The Wide World Magazine", 1899)]]
'''Louis De Rougemont''' (12 November 1847 – 9 June 1921) was a Swiss [[List of explorers|explorer]] who claimed to have had adventures in [[Australasia]].&lt;ref&gt;B. G. Andrews, ''[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080309b.htm De Rougemont, Louis (1847 - 1921)]'', [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 8, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1981, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal history==
"De Rougemont" was born '''Henri Louis Grin''' in 1847 in [[Gressy]], Vaud, Switzerland. He left home at the age of sixteen. He became a [[footman]] to the actress [[Fanny Kemble]], servant to a Swiss banker de Mieville in 1870 and a butler for the [[Governor of Western Australia]], Sir [[William Cleaver Francis Robinson|William Robinson]]. In the latter job he lasted less than a year.

He tried various ventures with very little success. He worked as a doctor, a "spirit photographer" and an inventor. He also married and abandoned a wife in Australia.

In 1898 he began to write about his invented adventures in the British periodical "[[The Wide World Magazine]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/wide.html The Wide World Magazine].&lt;/ref&gt; under the name Louis De Rougemont. He described his alleged exploits in search of pearls and gold in [[New Guinea]], and claimed to have spent thirty years living with [[Indigenous Australians]] in the [[outback]]. He claimed that the tribe with whom he had lived had worshipped him as a [[god]]. He also claimed to have encountered the [[Alfred Gibson|Gibson expedition]] of 1874.

Various readers expressed disbelief in his tales from the start, for example, claiming that no one can actually ride a [[turtle]]. De Rougemont had also claimed to have seen flying [[wombat]]s. The fact that he could not place his travels on a map aroused suspicion. Readers' arguments in the pages of the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' and other London newspapers continued for months.

Rougemont subjected himself to examination by the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. He claimed that he could not specify exactly where he had been because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with a syndicate that wanted to exploit the gold he had found in the area. He also refused to talk about Aboriginal languages he had supposedly learned. Still his supporters continued to find precedents for his exploits.

In September 1898 the ''Daily Chronicle'' announced that a certain F.W. Solomon had recognized De Rougemont and identified him as Louis Grin, who had presented himself at Solomon's firm as an [[entrepreneur]]. Grin had collected tidbits for his exploits from the Reading Room of the [[British Museum]]. [[Edwin Greenslade Murphy]] had helped to expose him.

Grin tried to defend himself by writing a letter to ''The Daily Chronicle'', using his original name, in which he expressed his consternation that anybody would confuse him with Louis De Rougemont. The ''Daily Chronicle'' was very willing to publish the letter. ''The Wide World Magazine'' exploited the situation and prepared a Christmas double issue. Sales of both papers increased greatly. De Rougemont himself disappeared from view.

During 1899 Grin travelled to [[South Africa]] as a music-hall attraction, "the greatest liar on Earth". On a similar tour of Australia in 1901 he was booed from the stage. In July 1906 he appeared at the [[Hippodrome, London|London Hippodrome]] and successfully demonstrated his turtle-riding skills. During the [[World War I|First World War]] he reappeared as an inventor of a useless meat substitute. He died a poor man in [[London]] on 9 June 1921.

It was said of the would-be adventurer:

[[File:Марш энтузиастов.ogg|thumb|"Enthusiast's March" is a mass song of the [[Soviet Union]] that was first performed in the film "Светлый путь" (''[[Shining Path (1940 film)|Shining Path]]'') in 1940]]

'''Mass song''' ({{lang-ru|ма́ссовая пе́сня}} ''mássovaya pésnya'') was a genre of [[Music of the Soviet Union|Soviet music]] that was widespread in the [[Soviet Union]]. A mass song was written by a professional or amateur composer for individual or chorus singing and intended for "broad masses" of Soviet people. &lt;ref name=muen/&gt;

The Soviet mass song is representative of the school of [[Socialist realism]] in art and an important part of [[Soviet propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Boris.  Music and Musical Life in Soviet Russia.  1972.  New York: W. W. Norton, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet ''Music Encyclopedia'' says that they were "a powerful means of organization and education of the masses".&lt;ref name=muen/&gt;

According to the Soviet ''Music Encyclopedia'', during 1920–1950s the term was applied to most of the songs written by Soviet composers. However, with the establishment of the term "Soviet song," the term "mass song" was restricted to the genre of chorus songs without accompaniment and with lyrics based on social-political themes, typically performed during various Soviet gatherings such as rallies, demonstrations, and meetings. Some songs of other Soviet song genres, "stage song" (estradnaya pesnya) and "everyday song" (bytovaya pesnya), could also be considered mass songs depending on their social importance.&lt;ref name=muen/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Musical characteristics of a mass song ensured easy comprehension and performance by non-professional "masses". A mass song is typically an alternating sequence of four-line [[stanza]]s and [[refrain]]s in a non-sophisticated [[musical form]] which employed most common [[vocal register]]. Typically these songs are of optimistic or heroic character, written in the form of a [[march (music)|march]].&lt;ref name=muen&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_music/4827/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F "Mass Song"], ''Music Encyclopedia'' (Музыкальная энциклопедия. — М.: Советская энциклопедия, Советский композитор. Под ред. Ю. В. Келдыша. 1973—1982.) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of mass songs were film soundtracks.

The concept of "mass song" was put forth by members of the union of young composers [[Prokoll]] (Production Collective of the Students at the [[Moscow Conservatory]]). &lt;ref name=muen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olkhovsky, Andrey. Music under the Soviets. 1955. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award''' is an honour presented annually by the [[Royal Academy of Dance]], to people who have made a significant contribution to the ballet and dance industry. The award was instituted by [[Dame Adeline Genee]] in 1953, to mark the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and her appointment as Royal Patron of the Academy. The first winner of the award was [[Ninette de Valois|Dame Ninette de Valois]], founder of the [[Royal Ballet]], [[Birmingham Royal Ballet]] and [[Royal Ballet School]]. The award has since been presented to a number of notable people, and is recognised as the highest honour awarded by the Academy.

==Winners==
The award was shared in 1963, 1966 and 2009, and in 2014 was awarded to a [[ballet company]], rather than an individual. The full list of winners is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rad.org.uk/documents/about-docs/QEIIAwardrecipientsupdatedAug2016.pdf|title=QEII Award recipients - updated Aug 2016|publisher=Royal Academy of Dance|access-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Roesia si Pengkor''''' ({{IPA-id|ruˈsia siˈ peŋˈkor|}}; [[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''''Rusia si Pengkor''''', Indonesian for ''Secret of the Clubfoot''), also known as '''''Hadji Saleh''''', is a 1939 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia) which was directed and produced by [[The Teng Chun]] for his Java Industrial Films. Starring Da'ing, Bissu, and [[Hadidjah]], this [[black-and-white]] film followed a young woman who is saved from deceptive suitors by her beloved and a man known as "Si Pengkor".

==Plot==
Hadji Saleh goes on a pilgrimage to a sacred mountain, leaving behind his wife and daughter Suti. Owing to her beauty, Suti receives many suitors. She, however, only loves Saari. Because of this love, Saari's friend Lihin (a spurned suitor) manipulates the police into imprisoning Saari. Upon his release, after being found not guilty, Saari must fight a would-be suitor named Usin before ultimately being recognised as Suti's husband-to-be. After the climax, it is revealed that Suti was often protected without her knowledge by her father, using the nickname "Si Pengkor".{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roesia si Pengkor}}

==Production==
''Roesia si Pengkor'' was directed and produced by [[The Teng Chun]] for his company Java Industrial Film. Cinematography was handled by his brother The Teng Liong, while sound for this [[black-and-white]] film was provided by another The brother, The Teng Hui. The film starred Da'ing, Bissu, and [[Hadidjah]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roesia si Pengkor}} Bissu had long worked for JIF, whereas Hadidjah&amp;nbsp;– the wife of musician [[Mas Sardi]]&amp;nbsp;– was a new hire. The story of a masked figure aiding a girl was likely inspired by the earlier production ''[[Gagak Item]]'', released by Java Industrial Film's rival [[Tan's Film]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=176–77}}

The completed ''Roesia si Pengkor'' two years after the commercial success of [[Indo people|Dutch–Indonesian]] journalist [[Albert Balink]]'s ''[[Terang Boelan]]'' and a year after [[Tan's Film]]'s ''[[Fatima (1938 film)|Fatima]]''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=176–77}} Though his earlier works had been oriented at ethnic Chinese audiences, ''Roesia si Pengkor'' was targeted at the [[native Indonesian|native]] population of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=176–77}} The success of the earlier films convinced him that it presented greater financial opportunities. This emphasis towards native audiences was also shown in advertisements, which repeatedly used the word "Indonesia", a word used by [[Indonesian National Awakening|nationalists]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=176–77}}

==Release==
''Roesia si Pengkor'' was released in 1939.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roesia si Pengkor}} Ultimately, Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes, it was unable to truly capture the elements which had made ''Terang Boelan'' and ''Fatima'' successful. However, The's later production ''[[Alang-Alang (film)|Alang-Alang]]'', which followed the ''Terang Boelan'' formula more closely, proved to be one of his greatest successes.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=176&amp;ndash;77}}

The film is likely [[lost film|lost]]. The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

{{Unreferenced|date=June 2008}}
A '''scoreboard''' is a large board for publicly displaying the score in a game.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  Most levels of sport from high school and above use at least one scoreboard for keeping score, measuring time, and displaying statistics.  Scoreboards in the past used a mechanical clock and numeral cards to display the score.  When a point was made, a person would put the appropriate digits on a hook.  Most modern scoreboards use electromechanical or electronic means of displaying the score.  In these, digits are often composed of large [[dot matrix|dot-matrix]] or [[seven-segment display]]s made of [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent bulbs]], [[light-emitting diode]]s, or electromechanical flip segments.  An official or neutral person will operate the scoreboard, using a [[control panel (engineering)|control panel]].

==Technology==
[[Image:20070616 Chris Young visits Wrigley (4)-edit3.jpg|thumb|[[Wrigley Field]] uses a hand operated scoreboard, but added a video board at the bottom of it in 2004. The video board removed in 2015 upon the building of video boards in right and left-center fields.]]
Prior to the 1980s most electronic scoreboards were electro-mechanical.  They contained [[relay]]s or [[stepping switch]]es controlling digits consisting of incandescent [[light bulb]]s.  Beginning in the 1980s, advances in [[solid state electronics]] permitted major improvements in scoreboard technology.  High power [[semiconductor]]s such as [[thyristor]]s and [[transistor]]s replaced mechanical [[relay]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s first replaced [[light bulb]]s for indoor scoreboards and then, as their brightness increased, outdoor scoreboards.  [[Light-emitting diode]]s last many times as long as [[light bulb]]s, are not subject to breakage, and are much more efficient at converting electrical energy to light.  The newest light emitting diodes can last up to 100,000 hours before having to be replaced.  Advances in large-scale [[integrated circuit]]s permitted the introduction of [[computer]] control.  This also made it [[cost effective]] to send the signals that control the operation of the scoreboard either through the existing [[Alternating current|AC]] [[wire]]s providing [[Electric power|power]] to the scoreboard or through the air.  [[Power line communication|Powerline]] [[modem]]s permit the [[digital control]] signals to be sent over the [[AC power|AC]] [[electric power transmission|power line]]s.  The most common method of sending [[digital data]] over power lines at rates less than 2400 bits per second is called [[frequency shift keying]] (FSK).  Two radio frequencies represent [[binary numeral system|binary]] 0 and 1.  [[Radio transmission]] such as FSK sends data digitally.  Until recently [[radio transmission]] was subject to short range and [[Interference (communication)|interference]] by other [[radio]] sources.  A fairly recent technology called [[spread spectrum]] permits much more robust radio control of scoreboards.  [[Spread spectrum]], like the name implies, distributes the signal over a wide portion of the [[radio spectrum]].  This helps the signal resist interference which is usually confined to a narrow [[frequency band]].

==Scoreboards in various sports==

===North American football===
[[Image:SSHS Football Scoreboard.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A scoreboard for American [[high school football]], which also features tenths timing for [[track and field]] events.]]
In both the [[American football|United States]] and [[Canadian football]] codes, the minimum details displayed are the time and score of both teams.  A typical [[high school]]  scoreboard will additionally  display the [[down (football)|down]], the yardage of the line of [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]], the yards to go until a [[first down]], the team with the possession (usually signified with the outline of a [[football (ball)|football]] in lights next to the possessing team's score) and the quarter.  Higher levels will also include [[play clock]]s and the number of [[Time-out (sport)|time out]]s left for each team.  [[American football]] scoreboards may include a [[Horn loudspeaker|horn]] to signal the end of a quarter, but they are not used in larger venues. In those cases, the referee or [[public address]] announcer denotes the termination of a quarter vocally via the PA system; formerly quarter ends were denoted with the firing of a [[starting pistol]] in the era before digital timing.

===Basketball===
A [[basketball]] scoreboard will at the minimum display the time left in the period and both teams' scores. The last minute of each quarter is usually displayed with [[Millisecond|tenths]] of a second, which is required in FIBA, NBA (since 1989), and NCAA (since 2001). Most high school scoreboards also include a display of the number of team fouls, the number of the last player to commit a [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal foul]] (with the total number of personal fouls for that player), the period, and indicators of which team is in the team foul penalty situation, and possession (with a separate possession arrow display at half-court; not used in the NBA). College basketball scoreboards include [[shot clock]]s and the number of time-outs left for each team, with some high school state athletics bodies also beginning to adopt shot clocks to remove end of game [[Running out the clock|stalling]].  Larger scoreboards include statistics on the players in the game. Basketball scoreboards must include a [[Klaxon|horn]] or [[buzzer]] to signal the end of a period, fouls, and substitutions; the shot clocks have their own buzzer system sounding a different octave to avert any confusion with the game clock system.

In some multipurpose venues where ice hockey and basketball are played, the scoreboard unit which shows penalties will be used to display the player on the court, number of fouls, and points scored in the game.  The team fouls are usually placed in the same position as shots on goal in hockey games. In some university arenas, the scorer's table, which has traditionally been used for displaying physically scrolling advertising boards along its face, may also feature either a traditional mechanical scoreboard, or a scoreboard display within a [[Light-emitting diode|LED display]] on the front of the table which also functions with virtual scrolling advertisements.

Since 1991, the NBA has mandated that each shot clock carry a duplicate readout of the time left in the period in addition to the shot time. Since 2011, the shot clock also shows tenths of a second past five seconds left on the shot clock. Many college and even some high-school shot clocks (in states where a shot-clock rule is in effect for high-school basketball) now also include a game timer.

Three-sided game shot clocks became a trend in the 1990s, and after a controversial series of calls during the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]], the NBA instituted a new game shot clock rule in 2002, requiring specific visibility of the game- and shot-clock time for [[instant replay|instant-replay]] purposes.  FIBA installed a similar three-sided rule in 2004.  The rule was further changed in 2005 by permitting a new [[Daktronics]] see-through model (one on top of the basket, one on the end of the basket unit) that has gained popularity as many OES and Daktronics venues have adopted the system.

Daktronics has introduced a technology called ColorSmart, which denotes the trailing team's score numbers with red lighting, while the leading team is in green. However this technology has yet to be utilized in a game settings as the bylaws of the major basketball sanctioning bodies and many of the high school athletic bodies decree that both scores must display in the same color; the rule came into effect in 1994 after Spectrum Scoreboards introduced an earlier version of the concept. This is used almost exclusively in recreation leagues.

===Baseball===
[[Image:Ray Fisher Stadium scoreboard University of Michigan Ann Arbor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ray Fisher Stadium]] baseball scoreboard, [[University of Michigan]]]]
For [[baseball]] the scoreboard will at the minimum show both team scores, as well as the current [[Inning (baseball)|inning]].  In addition the number of balls, strikes and outs is represented by digits or individual lights. Larger scoreboards offer an [[Inning (baseball)|inning]]-by-inning breakdown of the scores, hits, errors, [[pitch count]] and the time of day.  There may also be another display either separate or combined with the scoreboard listing the [[radar gun]] reading of the last pitch thrown in miles per hour. Almost all Major League facilities have a video board as a scoreboard or a matrix display. Usually these scoreboards are controlled via programs that keep statistics and not just the score. Usually the official scorer will operate this program. Then all the information the official scorer will enter, will automatically be made output to the scoreboard. Currently, the largest scoreboards are located at [[Progressive Field]] in Cleveland, Ohio, and Kansas City, Missouri's [[Kauffman Stadium]]. There is also a very large scoreboard at [[Citizens Bank Park#Video boards|Citizens Bank Park]], in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Manually operated scoreboards are still found frequently in baseball, particularly at older venues. Well-known examples of manual scoreboards, using numbers painted on metal sheets hung by people working inside the scoreboard, include [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Wrigley Field]] in [[Chicago]]. 

In some stadiums since 2005, LED boards which are the full height of the outfield wall have been installed to either replace a manual scoreboard or enhance an existing wall, are considered in play, and are durably constructed to withstand the impacts of fielders colliding with the wall, along with the impact of a baseball against the panel. Examples of this type of scoreboard display are seen in [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], [[Rogers Centre]] in [[Toronto]], New [[Yankee Stadium]] in [[The Bronx]], and [[Kauffman Stadium]] in Kansas City. In all three cases, the walls display the current game state of out-of-town games (often down to pitch count for the current at-bat and runners on base), statistics for the current batter or pitcher, and promotional messages.

===Cricket===
For [[cricket]] a scoreboard will as a minimum display the batting team's score, wickets fallen, the opposition's totals. Most [[county cricket|county-standard]] scoreboards will also display each batsman's score, overs remaining, extras, the bowlers currently on and details of the last wicket to fall. [[Sheffield Shield|Australian state]] scoreboards will usually contain more detailed information.

[[Image:Nordis Valotaulu HIFK-HPK.jpg|thumb|right|Ice hockey scoreboard in Helsinki Ice Hall.]]

===Ice hockey===
An [[ice hockey]] scoreboard will at the minimum display the time left (in North America) or played (in Europe), the number of goals scored by each team as well as any penalties currently being served. Additional information such as shots on goal may be shown on smaller scoreboards located in the arena. Tenths of a second are usually displayed within the last minute of each period.

In multipurpose arenas, the penalties being served will appear in the multi-purpose panels, used for player statistics in basketball, with shots on goal in the same position as team fouls for basketball. In some arenas the sideboards of the [[Ice hockey rink|hockey rink]] feature three or four LED displays the size of one advertising hoarding which will show scoring information and promotional messages, though their limited visibility makes them rarely used.

A [[horn (instrument)|horn]] or [[buzzer]] must be used to signal end of timeouts or period. A separate horn, usually a Kahlenberg, Airchime, or Buell, is used to signal goals.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Motorsports===
In [[auto racing]], the scoreboard typically displays the running order of the race, and number of laps completed. Some more complex boards scroll statistics such as average speed, laps behind, and timing reports.

===Rugby football===
All codes of rugby football have a game clock, the number of tries, penalties, field goals and conversions listed.

===Track and field===
In [[track and field]] there is usually an elapsed time display.  Sometimes the team scores are displayed.  Often in higher levels there is a variable message display next to each field event area that displays the standings and who is up next.  Other indicators may show track side wind speed. In some settings where a track surrounds an athletic field, a track and field scoreboard may be combined within the football scoreboards.

===Association football ===
An [[association football]] scoreboard usually shows the score for the home and away team, as well as the current match time. A board displaying the current stoppage time is usually held up by one of the match officials towards the end of the first and second half. The same board is also used to denote the [[jersey number]]s of players coming in and leaving the game during a [[Substitute (football)|substitution]], with the substitute's number appearing in green, while the leaving player is denoted in red.

Some amateur and youth levels will have the clock count down.

Some American venues will use a multi-purpose gridiron/soccer venue type scoreboard where various statistics are shown.  Such may include either total fouls, corner kicks, shots on goal, or other important statistics for spectators to learn their team's overall performance.

===Softball===
Similar to [[baseball]], a [[softball]] scoreboard will at the minimum show both team scores and the current inning.  In addition, the number of balls, strikes and outs, and the number of hits and errors are often indicated.

===Swimming===
The scores for the meet, swimmer by lane, and their current placing, along with their race times are displayed on this type of board. The time display is most often in [[hundredth]]s of a second, though [[thousands]]s may also be utilized.

===Wrestling===
Wrestling scoreboards will display the team scores, the current match time, the match score, and the weight class. Some scoreboards may also display riding time.

==Captioning requirements==
Within the last few years most major league, professional and major college venues also include smaller displays featuring [[closed captioning]] of announcements from the [[public address system]] and advertisements displayed on the scoreboards to comply with the United States [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] for the hard of hearing, and to allow distracted spectators to read what had been said.

==Video board animation==
{{see also|Jumbotron|Instant replay}}
Most major sports facilities will use a video board and display graphics and fun [[Videotape|videos]] relating to what is happening in the game.  For instance, a [[home run]] may be depicted by an animation of a ball flying out to space. These animations are usually high in detail and are customized for the team that uses them. Most Major League Baseball facilities do their video editing on site in the press box; however, at [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] baseball stadiums most of it is done off site. Some teams have animators that create their own animations, while others have outside companies do the work for them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

'''Shanda Games''' is a publisher and operator of online games based in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. Founded in 1999 as '''Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited''' ({{zh|c=盛大互动娱乐有限公司|p=Shèngdà Hùdòng Yúlè Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī}}), it spun off from [[Shanda|Shanda Interactive]] in 2009 and is currently owned by Zhejiang Century Huatong. Shanda's published and operated games include ''[[Aion: The Tower of Eternity|AION]]'', ''[[MapleStory]]'', ''The World of Legend'', ''The Age'', ''Magical Land'', ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'',  ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online]]'', ''[[Crazy Arcade]]'', and ''GetAmped'' among others.

==History==
Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited was founded in December 1999 by [[Chen Tianqiao]], Chrissy Luo, and [[Chen Danian]].&lt;ref name=CHINADAILY-2014/&gt; In September 2001, Shanda published its first game, ''[[The Legend of Mir 2]]'' (Chinese: 热血传奇), which was licensed from a Korean company, [[WeMade Entertainment|WeMade Soft]].&lt;ref name=CHINADAILY-2014&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=June 17, 2014 |title=Top 10 biggest IPOs by game manufacturers |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2014-06/17/content_17591869_9.htm |work=[[China Daily]] |location= |access-date=November 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a dispute over profit sharing caused the relationship to fracture between Shanda and WeMade. No longer able to operate ''The Legend of Mir 2'', Shanda developed the game ''The World of Legend'' (Chinese:传奇世界), which began operation in June 2003.  Shanda transferred all user data from ''The Legend of Mir 2'' into the new game, promising its customers that their character, points, armors and weapons would remain the same.  WeMade Entertainment deemed ''The World of Legend'' to be a copy of Mir 2 and sued Shanda for copyright infringement in October 2003. After a prolonged legal battle, the two companies reached a settlement on April 26, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jiayu | last=Lv | title=(Simplified Chinese) Shanda MIR Copyright Infringement Legal Case Finally Settled in Second Half of 2009|url=http://games.qq.com/a/20090426/000227.htm|work=games.qq.com |publisher=Tencent | date= 2009-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By October 2004, Shanda operated eight games and was the largest online game company in China, hosting 1.2 million simultaneous players.&lt;ref name=CNN-2004-Roth&gt;{{cite news |last=Roth |first=Daniel |date=October 4, 2004 |title=In Search of China's Bill Gates |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/10/04/8186780/index.htm |work=[[CNN]] |location= |access-date=November 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 2004 listing on the US-based [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange raised $151.8 million [[United States dollar|USD]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In November 2005, Shanda announced that its multiplayer online role-playing games ''Magical Land'' and ''The World of Legend'' would forever be [[Free-to-play|free to play]]. It was later revealed that once Shanda's games adopted this model, average customer spending increased from 30 Chinese yuan to 55 Chinese yuan per quarter. Following Shanda's example, other Chinese online game operators began to follow suit, declaring many of their titles free to play, popularizing this model in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jun | last=Tang | title=(Simplified Chinese) Shanda Responds to Customer Self-Immolation Case with the Help of Police|url=http://it.sohu.com/20070213/n248211551.shtml|work=it.sohu.com|publisher=SOHU.com | date= 2007-02-13 |accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Medieval and Renaissance literature}}

'''''Sir Degrevant''''' is a [[Middle English]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] from the early fifteenth century. Generally classified as a "composite romance," that is, a romance that does not fit easily into the standard classification of romances, it is praised for its realism and plot. The poem is preserved in two manuscripts along with a variety of secular and courtly texts, one of which was compiled by the fifteenth-century scribe [[Robert Thornton (scribe)|Robert Thornton]]. It is notable for its blending of literary material and social reality.

The title character, while a perfect knight in many respects, is initially reluctant to love. His life changes when he seeks redress from his neighbor for the killing of his men and damages done to his property. He falls in love with the neighbor's daughter, and after she initially denies him her love, she accepts him. They both convince the overbearing and initially violent father to grant Degrevant his daughter's hand in marriage.

==Plot==
The plot of ''Sir Degrevant'' revolves around the title character and his neighbor, an earl, whose daughter Myldore falls in love with Sir Degrevant. While there is a "perfunctory connection" with [[King Arthur]] and his court, the romance is devoid of the usual marvels associated with Arthurian literature.&lt;ref name=kane/&gt;

Sir Degrevant is the "perfect romance hero":&lt;ref name="Sylvester p. 18"&gt;Sylvester p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; intent on hunting and adventures, he is young, handsome, and strong; most importantly to the plot, he is not interested in the love of a woman.&lt;ref name="Sylvester p. 18"/&gt; While he is on a [[Crusades|crusade]], his neighbor, an earl, does great damage to Degrevant's property and kills the foresters who oversee his [[Medieval deer park|deer park]]. Degrevant hurries back from [[Granada]], repairs the fences and the other damage done, then addresses a letter to the earl seeking legal redress.

When the earl refuses to make reparations, Degrevant avenges himself by attacking the earl's hunting troop and then his castle. During this latter engagement, the earl's daughter, Melydor, watches from the castle walls and Degrevant falls in love with her. Melydor initially rebuffs Degrevant's attempt to declare his love, but later grants it to him. Her father sets up a tournament to promote the chances of another suitor (the Duke of Gerle), but Degrevant defeats him thrice. The lovers meet secretly in her splendidly decorated bedroom (it contains paintings of saints and angels, and such details as glass from [[Westphalia]] and "curtain cords made of mermaids' hair won by Duke Betyse,"&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to a duke from a fourteenth-century [[chanson de geste]] ''[[Jacques de Longuyon|Les Voeux du paon]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs p. 156 note to l. 510.&lt;/ref&gt;), but they remain chaste until marriage. Finally, the earl agrees to his daughter's engagement with Degrevant, convinced by his daughter and his wife's pleas and by Degrevant's obvious chivalry and strength. The couple have seven children and enjoy a happy and prosperous life together. When Melydor dies, Degrevant returns to the crusade and dies in the [[Holy Land]].

==Characters==
*Sir Degrevant—young, handsome, and strong, he embodies all the values of knighthood. The beginning of the narrative finds him crusading, where he is fighting for personal fame. He is also a landowner, and as such has legal and economic concerns as well. He is initially referred to as a nephew of King Arthur and [[Sir Gawain]], opening up the possibility that he is [[Agravain]]—his name possibly being a misreading of the [[Old French]] ''d'Egrivaunt''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs p. 137 note to l. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Melydor—the earl's beautiful daughter. While also a beauty in the traditional sense of romance, she is not devoid of practical sense: when Degrevant attempts to seduce her, she responds by saying "Thou touchest non swych thing / Or thou wed me with a ryng, / And maryage fulfille."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Her name is possibly influenced by the name of Duke Betyse's lover ''Ydorus''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs p. 156 notes to l. 510 and l. 511.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Earl—the unnamed earl is in many ways the opposite of Degrevant: he takes advantage of his neighbor's absence, and does not act in a chivalrous manner until the end of the story.
*Degrevant's squire—a clever and educated assistant who functions as a messenger to the Earl and a go-between for Degrevant and Melydor
*Melydor's maid—instrumental, with the squire, in bringing about the encounters between the lovers
*Countess—the Earl's wife, who pleads with him in vain that he stop harassing his neighbor's land and settle the conflict.

==Composition==
The poem is dated in the early fifteenth century. Its verse is tail rhyme, in stanzas of sixteen lines with "conventional thematic and verbal formulas." There are no known sources or analogues.&lt;ref name=d82/&gt; The poem survives in two manuscripts from the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, the [[Findern Anthology]] and the [[Lincoln Thornton Manuscript|Lincoln Thornton MS]]. The Findern Anthology ([[Cambridge University Library]], MS Ff.1.6) contains a variety of texts (the manuscript itself is a composite, like the poem, according to Davenport&lt;ref name=dav111/&gt;) with secular and courtly poetry, including selections from [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (''[[Parlement of Foules]]'' and other texts), [[John Gower]] (some tales from the ''[[Confessio Amantis]]''), and [[John Lydgate]] (various shorter poems and other texts). ''Sir Degrevant'' is the only full-length romance in the manuscript.&lt;ref name=dav111&gt;Davenport 111-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lincoln Thornton MS ([[Lincoln Cathedral Library|Lincoln, Dean and Chapter Library]] MS 91) contains seven romances copied by [[Robert Thornton (scribe)|Roberth Thornton]], the fifteenth-century landowner, scribe, and manuscript compiler.

==Critical assessment==
The romance is praised for its realism. George Kane writes, "The love affair, made exciting by the risk with which it is conducted, is very close to life in some of its touches. The effects of this romance, supported by skillful construction, a tone perfectly maintained, characters realistically conceived and developed, and a tolerably incisive narrative, is entirely good and persuasive."&lt;ref name=kane&gt;Kane p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics agree; Arlyn Diamond notes the "lively plot and remarkable density of description."&lt;ref name=d82/&gt; W.A. Davenport analyzes the poet's popular verse form and contrasts it with the broad vocabulary used in the poem, and identifies literary borrowing from "alliterative poetry, love-lyric, and court allegory, as well as literary romance"; he concludes that the result of the poet's skill in "mixing" of themes and styles makes for "an unusually well-constructed and unified narrative."&lt;ref name=dav129&gt;Davenport p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Love===
As W.A. Davenport noted, the composite nature of the poem also involves extensive debates on love, between Sir Degrevant and his [[squire]], between Degrevant and Melydor, and between Melydor and her maid. Further debate on love takes place when Melydor (in the company of her maid) and Degrevant (with his squire) meet in her orchard, "an archetypal, courtly pastoral setting", into which Degrevant and his squire have entered, fully armed.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport pp. 121-23.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davenport, one of the poet's intentions was to express the "wonders and restraints of virtuous love."&lt;ref name=dav129/&gt;

The love of Degrevant and Melydor, though the wooing in presented as classical [[courtly love]], ends in marriage and children—a deviation from the original formulation of courtly love that grew common in romances of this era.&lt;ref&gt;Gervase Mathew, "Marriage and ''Amour Courtois'' in Late Fourteenth Century England", ''Essays Presented to Charles William'' edited by [[C. S. Lewis]] p 132 {{ISBN|0-8028-1117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues and conflicts===
Scholars have seen in the poem a reflection of fifteenth-century concerns with matchmaking between noble families. The happy ending, which unites two formerly conflicted families through marriage, allows for the peaceful resolution of competing sexual and economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond pp. 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; A.C. Gibbs notes that the romance, with all its literary elements (of duels, quests, and love) is also a reminder of the social reality of knighthood. The titular hero is also a landowner, with all the pursuant cares, and is called back from his crusade by the news that his men and his property have been attacked by his unchivalrous neighbor. Realistic elements (as opposed to literary convention) also play a part in the plot—for instance, Degrevant ambushes the earl, and uses arrows as an offensive weapon; there is never a formal duel between the two opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and desire===
Since the romance is concerned with household and marriage, it also opens up a space for female desire and for the discussion of the difference between male and female desire. Diamond summarizes:&lt;blockquote&gt;What women want is a handsome, valiant, wealthy and noble lover, triumph over fierce paternal opposition, a splendid wardrobe, and a fabulous room of their own. What men want is a noble reputation, a huge deer park in which to spend their days hunting, extensive and prosperous estates, triumph over would-be oppressors, and a beautiful opinionated heiress.&lt;ref name=d82&gt;Diamond p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; With its happy ending, the romance suggests that these different desires can be reconciled.&lt;ref name=d82/&gt;

Louise Sylvester, in a study of heterosexuality in medieval romance, argues that the love affair between Melydor and Degrevant develops according to stereotypical masculinist heterosexual Western patterns. Love happens to people and is not an act of will; Degrevant, as a strong knight, is undone by his feelings and loses all interest in other activities, such as hunting; he vehemently denies the suggestion by his squire that he be interested in the daughter because of the earl's wealth; at least the initial encounter between the two lovers is completely dominated by his perspective and his feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester pp. 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, she notes after a linguistic analysis that even Melydor's very language (which has more slips and meaningless tags than Degrevant's), which Sylvester qualifies as "powerless speech," serves to deny her an independent and powerful status.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The romance was edited by [[Leslie Casson]] for the [[Early English Text Society]] and published in 1949; this edition is generally preferred by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond p. 98 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, A.C. Gibbs published a selection from the romance in the ''York Medieval Texts'' series.

"'''So Sexy: Chapter II (Like This)'''" is single by [[Twista]] and [[R. Kelly]], a sequel to their hit single, "[[So Sexy]]". The song did not appear on the original release of Twista's album ''[[Kamikaze (Twista album)|Kamikaze]]'', but was later included on the re-release that included two new tracks. While not as successful as the original, "So Sexy: Chapter II" made it to two Billboard charts in the USA, peaking at 92 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and 47 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks]].

A division of [[Sony Pictures Digital]], '''SoapCity''' is the defunct former home to the official websites for two [[soap opera]]s produced by [[Columbia TriStar Television]] (later [[Sony Pictures Television]]); [[NBC]]'s ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' and [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''.

When announced in 1999, SoapCity was planned to be the online component to a Sony-produced [[cable channel]] of the same name, which would air same-day repeats and archives of these same shows. However the channel would never air after being beaten to the market by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[SoapNet]], contractual objections by NBC and CBS at the time disallowing re-airs on an network not owned by them, and distribution and programming complications with Sony's [[Game Show Network]] which made launching a second channel untenable. 

In addition to standard coverage of daytime soap operas, including news stories, catch-up synopses and story analysis, the site was one of the first to allow day-and-day digital downloads of ''Days'' and ''Y&amp;R'', along with archived episodes dating back to the series' 1965 and 1973 launches. Eventually the site became a [[landing page]] redirecting viewers to the sites of their soap operas on their television networks, though as of 2017, the domain is defunct, but still held by Sony Pictures Television.

SoapCity was created and executive produced by soap opera journalist Michael Fairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/biography/ |title=Biography: Michael Fairman |work=[[Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps]] |accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, the iOS version was removed from the App Store due to firmware incompatibility, but in early 2016, the game was updated to work on the latest firmware and returned to the store.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Sonic 4 Episode 2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In-game screenshot, showing both Sonic and Tails]]
''Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] platformer reminiscent of the original ''Sonic'' games for the [[Sega Mega Drive]]/Genesis. It plays very similarly to the previous episode, but with several enhancements. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] is now accompanied by [[Tails (character)|Tails]], either controlled by the computer or a second player via [[Local area network|local]] or [[Multiplayer online game|online]] co-operative play. Unlike the earlier [[16-bit]] games, Tails cannot be played in single-player mode, and likewise Sonic can't be played on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicstadium.org/2012/02/tails-limited-to-2-player-mode-in-sonic-4-episode-2/ |title=Tails Limited to 2 Player Mode in Sonic 4: Episode 2 |publisher=Sonic Stadium |date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various combination moves that Sonic and Tails can perform together, such as Tails lifting Sonic up to places he would be unable to reach otherwise, or the two rolling into a ball to perform a fast and powerful spin attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Workman |first=Robert |url=http://www.gamezone.com/products/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-ii/previews/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-2-preview |title=Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 2 |publisher=GameZone |date=May 18, 2012 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special Stages in ''Episode II'' are accessed the same way as in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Episode I]]'' (finishing an act with at least 50 rings and then jumping into the Giant Ring that appears at the end of the stage), and are based on the [[half-pipe]] style format introduced in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', in which the player is required to collect a certain number of rings before the goal in order to obtain a [[Chaos Emerald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicstadium.org/2012/02/xbox-com-releases-first-screenshots-of-sonic-4-episode-2-co-op-play-also-revealed/ |title=Xbox.com Releases First Screenshots of Sonic 4: Episode 2, Co-op Play Also Revealed |publisher=Sonic Stadium |date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also features Red Star Rings, which previously appeared in ''[[Sonic Colors]]'' and ''[[Sonic Generations]]'', with one Red Ring hidden per act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicstadium.org/2012/02/sega-europe-releases-more-sonic-4-episode-2-screenshots/ |title=SEGA Europe Releases More Sonic 4: Episode 2 Screenshots |publisher=Sonic Stadium |date=February 5, 2012|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-compatibility was planned for the Xbox Live Arcade and Windows Phone versions, allowing players to alternate their games by means of [[Cloud storage|Cloud saving]], but the idea was removed because the Windows Phone version was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/gdc-2012-sonic-the/728043 |title=Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode II Video Game, GDC 2012: Features Interview HD|publisher=GameTrailers|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owners of both ''Episode I'' and ''II'' on the same system can unlock free "Episode Metal" content in ''Episode II''.&lt;ref name="Ep2Trailer"/&gt; "Episode Metal" explains how [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog video game characters#Metal Sonic|Metal Sonic]] came back to life after being defeated in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog CD|Sonic CD]]'', and players can play as Metal Sonic through four acts, all of which are reworked from the first act of each Zone in ''Episode I''.

==Plot==
Metal Sonic survived his previous defeat in ''Sonic CD'', but was severely damaged, and left on Little Planet when it disappeared at the end of the game. After the events of ''Episode I'', Little Planet returns, and Dr. Eggman locates and repairs Metal Sonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ishaan |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/12/29/tails-returns-as-a-playable-character-in-sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-2/ |title=Tails Returns As A Playable Character In Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 2 |publisher=Siliconera |date=December 29, 2011|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonic hears that Eggman is back, and reunites with Tails to stop him. Meanwhile, Metal Sonic, after receiving a mysterious power source, searches for the heroes and sees them fly away in the Tornado, following them using Tails' rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonicthehedgehog4.com/us/ |title=Sonic The Hedgehog 4 Official Website |publisher=[[Sega]] |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403233106/http://www.sonicthehedgehog4.com/us/ |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is revealed that Eggman plans to construct a new Death Egg mk.II over Little Planet. As the dwarfed planet heads back into space, Sonic and Tails follow the villains to the Death Egg. Inside, they confront and defeat Metal Sonic. Later, they defeat Eggman at the heart of the base. Sonic and Tails then escape via space pods just before the Death Egg begins to explode. As the credits roll, the duo head back to Earth while the Death Egg shuts down.

==Development==
In February 2011, ''Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II'' was confirmed to be in early development. [[Sega]] Brand Manager Ken Balough stated that "the idea is to introduce new zones with things you haven't seen." He has also hinted that ''Episode II'' may have a larger budget than ''Episode I'', due to the commercial success of ''Episode I''. Balough also stated that many of the ideas in ''Episode II'' were planned while the first episode was still under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver |first=Tristan |url=http://www.tssznews.com/2011/02/25/sonic-4-episode-ii-now-in-early-development-says-ken-balough/ |title=Sonic 4: Episode II Now "In Early Development", Says Ken Balough |publisher=Tssznews|date=February 25, 2011|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sega of America Community Manager Aaron Webber also hinted that Tails may appear in ''Episode II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Tristan|title=Sega Celebrates Hedgehog Day, Hints at Tails in Sonic 4: Episode 2?|url=http://www.tssznews.com/2011/02/03/sega-celebrates-hedgehog-day-hints-at-tails-in-sonic-4-episode-2/|publisher=Tssznews|date=February 3, 2011|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, 2011, Sonic Team head [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]] stated that "this year, 2011, is the anniversary, so we're focusing on the celebration title, but moving forward to 2012, Sonic will still be going, so I'd hope to provide Episode 2 then." He also said that Sonic Team "knew about the anniversary year," and that "''Generations'' was planned way in advance." As such, "it was always our plan to release Episode 2 after Generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GeneHF |url=http://www.sonicretro.org/2011/08/sonic-4-episode-2-in-2012-episode-3-unlikely/ |title=Sonic 4: Episode 2 in 2012, Episode 3 Unlikely|publisher=Sonicretro|date= |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for ''Episode II''{{'}}s release, Sega re-released ''Sonic the Hedgehog CD'' to digital platforms in late 2011, billing it as a 'prequel' to ''Sonic 4'', as the events of ''Episode II'' would rely heavily on what occurred in ''CD''.

On December 29, a teaser trailer for ''Episode II'' was released, and it was revealed that both Metal Sonic and Tails would be returning. It was also revealed that the game would feature an updated graphics and physics engine from ''Episode I''.

On April 21, 2012, an early beta version of ''Episode II'' was accidentally made available to people who pre-ordered the game on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. However, Sega quickly removed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez |first=David |url=http://www.gamezone.com/products/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-ii/news/sonic-4-episode-ii-was-leaked-on-steam |title=Sonic 4: Episode II was leaked on Steamews |publisher=GameZone |date=May 18, 2012 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II'' received mixed reviews. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] gave the PlayStation 3 version 63/100,&lt;ref name="MCPS3II" /&gt; the Xbox 360 version 61/100,&lt;ref name="MCX360II" /&gt; the PC version 54/100,&lt;ref name="MCPCII" /&gt; and the iOS version 66/100.&lt;ref name="MCiOS" /&gt;

''[[IGN]]''{{'s}} Lucas M. Thomas gave the game a score of 6.5, stating that while it fixes the physics problems of ''Episode I'', it is still missing the "magic" of its Genesis predecessors.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; ''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'s}} Lucas Sullivan criticized it in similar ways, stating that the two-player mode "seems to prioritize griefing your friends instead making real in-game progress," and further stating that "every time we felt like we were reliving our old Sonic glory days, the next stage would incorporate limp and uninspired gimmicks like shifting winds or avalanche snowboarding."&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt; ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'s}} Ray Carsillo gave the game a 6.5, praising the "old-school Sonic" aspects of the gameplay, but criticizing the Tails-related gameplay, stating "there were too many puzzles that required Tails' assistance."&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; ''[[Joystiq]]''{{'s}} Richard Mitchell had mixed feelings on the game as well, awarding it 3 out of 5 stars, and stating "''Episode 2'' makes improvements over its predecessor, with better visuals, useful co-op maneuvers and great special stages, but the inconsistent boss battles and uninspired level design keep it from recapturing Sonic's glory days."&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave the game a score of 5.5, saying that the level design and the team-up moves often slow the pace of the game.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt; ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]''{{'s}} (UK) Jon Blyth was more positive, concluding that the game was "a smooth, slippery Sonic that takes another step away from it's {{sic}} single-button origins without losing any of the hog essence. With local and online co-op, it offers just enough entertainment to justify its steep episodic price."&lt;ref name="OXMUK"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5772">In [[economics]] and [[game theory]], the decisions of two or more players are called '''strategic complements''' if they mutually reinforce one another, and they are called '''strategic substitutes''' if they mutually offset one another.  These terms were originally coined by Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer (1985).&lt;ref&gt;J. Bulow, J. Geanakoplos, and P. Klemperer (1985), 'Multimarket oligopoly: strategic substitutes and strategic complements'. ''Journal of Political Economy'' 93, pp. 488-511,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1832005 .&lt;/ref&gt;

To see what is meant by 'reinforce' or 'offset', consider a situation in which the players all have similar choices to make, as in the paper of Bulow et al., where the players are all imperfectly competitive firms that must each decide how much to produce. Then the production decisions are strategic complements if an increase in the production of one firm increases the marginal revenues of the others, because that gives the others an incentive to produce more too. This tends to be the case if there are sufficiently strong aggregate increasing [[returns to scale]] and/or the [[demand curve]]s for the firms' products have a sufficiently low own-price [[Price elasticity of demand|elasticity]]. On the other hand, the production decisions are strategic substitutes if an increase in one firm's output decreases the marginal revenues of the others, giving them an incentive to produce less.

According to [[Russell W. Cooper (economist)|Russell Cooper]] and Andrew John, strategic complementarity is the basic property underlying examples of [[General equilibrium#Uniqueness|multiple equilibria]] in [[coordination game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Cooper  and Andrew John (1988), 'Coordinating coordination failures in Keynesian models.' ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 103 (3), pp. 441-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculus formulation==
Mathematically, consider a [[symmetric game]] with two players that each have payoff function &lt;math&gt;\,\Pi(x_i, x_j)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\,x_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the player's own decision, and &lt;math&gt;\,x_j&lt;/math&gt; represents the decision of the other player. Assume &lt;math&gt;\,\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is increasing and [[concave function|concave]] in the player's own strategy &lt;math&gt;\,x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Under these assumptions, the two decisions are strategic complements if an increase in each player's own decision &lt;math&gt;\,x_i&lt;/math&gt; raises the marginal payoff &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi _j}{\partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt; of the other player. In other words, the decisions are strategic complements if the second derivative &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2\Pi _j}{\partial x_j \partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; is positive for &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, this means that the function &lt;math&gt;\,\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is [[supermodular]]. 

On the other hand, the decisions are strategic substitutes if &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2\Pi _j}{\partial x_j \partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; is negative, that is, if &lt;math&gt;\,\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Submodular set function|submodular]].


== Example ==

In their original paper, Bulow et al. use a simple model of competition between two firms to illustrate their ideas.
The revenue for firm x with production rates &lt;math&gt; (x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is given by
: &lt;math&gt; U_x(x_1, x_2; y_2) = p_1 x_1 + (1 - x_2 - y_2 ) x_2 - (x_1 + x_2)^2/2 - F &lt;/math&gt;
while the revenue for firm y with production rate &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; in market 2 is given by 
: &lt;math&gt; U_y(y_2;x_1,x_2) = (1 - x_2 - y_2 ) y_2 - y_2^2/2 - F &lt;/math&gt;
At any interior equilibrium, &lt;math&gt; (x_1^*, x_2^*, y_2^*) &lt;/math&gt;, we must have
: &lt;math&gt; \dfrac{\partial U_x}{\partial x_1} = 0, \dfrac{\partial U_x}{\partial x_2} = 0, \dfrac{\partial U_y}{\partial y_2} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
Using vector calculus, geometric algebra, or differential geometry, Bulow et al. showed that the sensitivity 
of the Cournot equilibrium to changes in &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated in terms of second partial derivatives
of the payoff functions:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{d x_1^*}{d p_1} \\[2.2ex] \dfrac{d x_2^*}{d p_1} \\[2.2ex] \dfrac{d y_2^*}{d p_1} \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_x}{\partial x_1 \partial x_1 }
&amp;
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_x}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2 }
&amp;
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_x}{\partial x_1 \partial y_2 }
\\[2.2ex]
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_x}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2 }
&amp;
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_x}{\partial x_2 \partial x_2 }
&amp;
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_x}{\partial y_2 \partial x_2 }
\\[2.2ex]
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_y}{\partial x_1 \partial y_2 }
&amp;
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_y}{\partial x_2 \partial y_2 }
&amp;
\dfrac{\partial^2 U_y}{\partial y_2 \partial y_2 }
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
-\dfrac{\partial^2 U_x}{\partial p_1 \partial x_1 }
\\[2.2ex]
-\dfrac{\partial^2 U_x}{\partial p_1 \partial x_2 }
\\[2.2ex]
-\dfrac{\partial^2 U_y}{\partial p_1 \partial y_2 }
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt; 1/4 \leq p_1 \leq 2/3 &lt;/math&gt;, 

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{d x_1^*}{d p_1} \\[2.2ex] \dfrac{d x_2^*}{d p_1} \\[2.2ex] \dfrac{d y_2^*}{d p_1} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ -1 &amp; -3 &amp; -1 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -3 \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{5}
\begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ -3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This, as price is increased in market 1, Firm x sells more in market 1 and less in market 2, while firm y sells more in market 2.  If the Cournot equilibrium of this model is calculated explicitly, we find
: &lt;math&gt; x_1^* =  \max \left\{ 0, \frac{8 p_1 - 2 }{5} \right\}, x_2^* = \max \left\{ 0, \frac{2  - 3 p_1}{5} \right\}, y_2^* = \frac{p_1+ 1 }{5}. &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Suffrajitsu - Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons cover.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of ''Suffrajitsu'', Issue #1.]]

'''''Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons''''' is a [[graphic novel]] trilogy published by Jet City Comics, portraying the adventures of an all-women secret society of [[bodyguards]] who protect the leaders of the radical [[suffragette]] movement during early 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindlepost.com/2015/01/guest-post-by-tony-wolf-author-of-suffrajitsu-mrs-pankhursts-amazons.html Kindle Post US: Guest Post by Tony Wolf Author of Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst’s Amazons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==

''Suffrajitsu'' was written by Tony Wolf, with art by Joao Vieira, colors by Josan Gonzales and lettering by Ed Dukeshire.  Artwork, colors and lettering were supervised by Jasmine Amiri and Dafna Pleban of [[BOOM! Studios]].  Issue #1 was published on January 28, 2015, with Issues #2 and #3 being released on February 25 and March 25.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.suffrajitsu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial publication was as a series of [[e-books]] via the [[Amazon Kindle]] app, with individual issues also becoming available to both US and international readers via [[comiXology|comiXology.com]]. As of May 2015, collected editions became available via both the Kindle Fire and comiXology.

The ''Suffrajitsu'' trilogy is part of the [[Foreworld Saga]], a shared-world [[secret history]] transmedia franchise initiated by [[speculative fiction]] authors [[Neal Stephenson]] and [[Mark Teppo]] via the Subutai Corporation in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foreworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A printed collector's anthology edition, also including two other Foreworld graphic novels, ''The Dead God'' and ''Symposium'', was published as ''Blood and Honor: The Foreworld Saga Graphic Novels'' on July 29, 2015.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Premise and historical basis==

The majority of characters featured in the ''Suffrajitsu'' trilogy are fictionalized versions of real people and many events and locations shown are also closely based on real history.

The trilogy is set during the height of the English [[women's suffrage]] protests of the early 20th century, which included acts of mass [[civil disobedience]], [[sabotage]], and even [[riots]] as pro- and anti-suffragists battled over the right of women to vote in national elections.  During this period, many suffragettes were imprisoned on charges ranging from [[vandalism]] and [[assault]] to [[sedition]].

In response to the so-called [[Cat and Mouse Act]] legislation, which allowed hunger-striking incarcerated suffragettes to be temporarily released from prison and then re-arrested when their health had sufficiently recovered, the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] established an [[Edith Margaret Garrud#Trainer of bodyguards|all-women bodyguard team]].  Trained by [[Edith Margaret Garrud]], the team - known within the WSPU as "The Bodyguard" and dubbed "jujitsuffragettes" and "Amazons" by the media - frequently clashed with the police, employing [[decoy]] and [[Military deception|subterfuge]] tactics as well as [[hand-to-hand combat]] to protect fugitive suffragettes from arrest and assault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshistorynetwork.org/blog/?p=2928 Suffrajitsu – The Jiu Jitsu Teacher of the Woman’s War « Women's History Network Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observationdeck.io9.com/the-amazons-of-edwardian-london-kick-ass-suffragette-b-644342073?rev=1422999500817 Suffrajitsu: The Amazons of Edwardian London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Suffrajitsu trilogy also refers to numerous circa 1914 events, institutions and social movements notably including [[eugenics]], [[Bohemianism]], composer Alexander Scriabin's [[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]] and the controversial [[White feather|White Feather]] campaign, which protagonist Persephone Wright rejects on ethical grounds.

==Issues==

Issue #1 of the trilogy follows Amazon leader Persephone Wright and her team as they engage in escalating conflicts with the police in London and Glasgow during early 1914.  Most of the key events depicted in Issue #1 are closely based on real history, including sections of speeches by the politician [[William Cremer]] and both Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In Issues 2 and 3 the plot dramatically diverges from real history, although major elements and characters are inspired by history.  In Issue #2 the Amazons embark on a daring rescue mission in the Austrian Alps, battling with members of a [[eugenic]] cult called the Order of New Templars and in Issue 3 they must race to prevent a terrorist attack that may have dire consequences for the entire world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Characters==

* '''Persephone Wright''':  a "[[fallen woman]]", expert strategist and the field leader of the Amazons; partially inspired by real suffragettes including [[Gertrude Harding|Gert Harding]] and [[Elizabeth Robins]].
* '''[[Emmeline Pankhurst]]''': the leader of the radical [[Women's Social and Political Union]], and a fugitive from the law when the story begins.
* '''[[Christabel Pankhurst]]''':  Emmeline's daughter, and effectively the second-in-command of the WSPU.
* '''[[Edward William Barton-Wright]]''': Persephone's uncle; owner of the [[Bartitsu]] Club (the Amazons' gymnasium/base of operations) and a staunch supporter of their activism.
* '''[[Florence LeMar|Florence "Flossie" Le Mar]]''': a New Zealand-born adventuress.
* '''[[Toupie Lowther]]''': an aristocratic, cross-dressing lesbian motorist, fencer and jujitsu exponent who serves as Mrs. Pankhurst's getaway driver and chauffeuse.
* '''Judith Lee''': an amateur detective and expert lip-reader of Anglo-Chinese descent (adapted from the early 20th century "lady detective" character created by author [[Richard Marsh (author)|Richard Marsh]]).
* '''[[Katie Sandwina|Katharina "Sandwina" Brumbach]]''':  an Austrian professional wrestler and circus [[strongwoman]].
* '''Miss Sanderson''': a silent [[femme fatale]] who is an expert at self-defense with umbrellas and parasols.
* '''Kitty Marshall''': a quick-witted teenager who keeps her suffragette activism secret from her family.
* [[Vernon Kell|'''Vernon Waldegrave Kell''']]: the Director-General of the newly formed [[British Security Service]].
* '''[[Edith Margaret Garrud]]''' (cameo appearance): the Amazons' jiujitsu instructor and leader of the Palladium Irregulars, a reserve unit of suffragette bodyguards.

==Novellas and short stories==

During 2014 Suffrajitsu author Tony Wolf organised a scheme that produced two novellas and two short stories inspired by the Suffrajitsu trilogy and licensed and published via the [[Kindle Worlds]] platform.  The stories included:

''The Pale Blue Ribbon'', by John Longenbaugh

''The Isle of Dogs'', by Michael Lussier

''Carried Away'', by Ray Dean

''The Second-Story Girl'', by Mark Lingane

With the closure of the Kindle Worlds platform in July of 2018, these short stories and novellas are no longer available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3451">A '''Sunday drive''' is an [[automobile]] trip, primarily in the [[United States]] and Australia, typically taken for pleasure or leisure on a [[Sunday]], usually in the afternoon. During the Sunday drive, there is typically no destination and no rush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Katie|last=Clements|publisher=Guardian Newspapers|date=3 October 2007|accessdate=5 June 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/oct/04/abrilliantstartforteamgbr|title=A brilliant start for Team GBR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The use of the automobile for the Sunday drive began in the 1920s and 1930s. The idea was that the automobile was not used for commuting or errands, but for pleasure. There would be no rush to reach any particular destination.&lt;ref name="1930s"&gt;{{cite book| title=The 1930s| first1=William H.|last1=Young| first2=Nancy K.|last2=Young| edition=illustrated| year=2002| page=234| isbn=978-0-313-31602-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice became increasingly popular throughout the 20th century.  [[Parkway]]s were constructed for recreational driving of this sort{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}.

==Views==
Traveling on Sunday by automobile is questioned by some [[Christian]]s, due to observing [[Sunday Sabbath]]. While these parties consider the activity "leisure", they do not count it as "rest".&lt;ref name="Holy Day, Holiday1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Holy Day, Holiday|last=McCrossen|first=Alexis|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8014-8787-3|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stricter Sabbatarians consider leisure activities to be [[Sabbath breaking]], because excluded from the three permitted categories of works of piety, mercy, and necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|2:23-27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Less strict Sabbath-keepers consider leisure to be "calling [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] a delight".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|58:13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects Jewish tradition, in which delighting in the day, spending freely on food, and traveling leisurely (i.e., more aimlessly and unhurriedly, and for shorter distances than one would during the week) were widely considered appropriate for ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tractate Shabbat]] 119a.&lt;/ref&gt; In many Jewish traditions, [[Driving on Shabbat in Jewish law|driving on Shabbat]] is prohibited or severely restricted.

[[Henry Ford]] was an advocate of the Sunday drive. He promoted Sunday as a day of activity rather than rest because it led to the sale of automobiles.&lt;ref name="day apart1"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Day Apart|last=Ringwald|year=2007|page=150|isbn=0-19-516536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of fuel prices==
During the mid-[[2000s (decade)|2000s]], as a result of higher [[gas prices|gasoline prices]], some have curtailed their Sunday drives.&lt;ref name="gas prices"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gas Prices Force Some to Change Their Lifestyles|date=August 20, 2005|author=Kyle Kennedy|publisher=The Ledger|page=A13|accessdate=5 June 2009| url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20050820/NEWS/508200352}}&lt;/ref&gt; But after OPEC started increasing supply to hold market share against North American shale oil producers, oil and gasoline prices dropped to records levels leading some to go driving on Sunday again in the mid-2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drivingonsunday.com|title=Driving On Sunday|website=Driving On Sunday|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; the Curse''''' (stylized as '''''The Blueprint²: The Gift &amp; the Curse''''') is the seventh [[studio album]] by American [[rapper]] [[Jay-Z]]. It was released on November 12, 2002, by [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] and [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album serves as a sequel to his sixth album ''[[The Blueprint]]'' (2001). Parts of the album were later reissued for his compilation album, titled ''[[Blueprint 2.1]]'' (2003). The album debuted at number one, shipping with first-week sales of 545,000 units. As of February 2012, the album has sold 2,117,000 units in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grein |first=Paul |url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/week-ending-feb-26-2012-albums-half-top-160050213.html |title=Week Ending Feb. 26, 2012.

== Background ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=September 2016}}
The recording sessions took place after Jay-Z's critically acclaimed and commercially successful sixth album ''[[The Blueprint]]'' (2001), at the age of 32. The production on the album was handled primarily by [[Just Blaze]] and [[Kanye West]] - both of whom had recently established themselves as both of one of hip-hop's most celebrated producers due to the success of ''The Blueprint'' - while other producers include [[The Neptunes]], [[Timbaland]], [[No I.D.]], Darrell "Digga" Branch, Charlemagne, Big Chuck, [[Dr. Dre]], Jimmy Kendrick, [[Heavy D]], and Neff-U. Unlike ''The Blueprint'' which was almost void of guest appearances, ''The Blueprint²'' features many featured guests, even out-of-genre artists that include [[Lenny Kravitz]] and [[Sean Paul]]. Other features include West Coast rapper and producer Dr. Dre, [[Rakim]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Faith Evans]], [[Beanie Sigel]] and [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]]. The album also includes an uncredited verse from [[Kanye West]] on the Timbaland-produced track "The Bounce". Pharrell also provides vocals and hooks of many of his produced tracks, for example "[[Excuse Me Miss]]" and "Nigga Please". Though the album has no strict concept, the album contains two discs. The first disc entitled "The Gift" features mainstream, pop-oriented music. The second disc entitled "The Curse" contains dark, emotional, and bravado street songs such as the dark-toned retelling of "Meet the Parents", the emotional substance of escaping the dangerous ghetto in "Some How Some Way", the [[Nas]]-diss "Blueprint&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;", and the bravado "Nigga Please".

In his review for ''[[The A.V.

"It could have been a good single disc."&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; [[Robert Christgau]] named "U Don't Know (Remix)" and "Poppin' Tags" as highlights while writing in his ''[[Village Voice]]'' consumer guide that he was disappointed Jay-Z sampled [[Paul Anka]] for "I Did It My Way" when he could not get permission to use [[Frank Sinatra]]'s recording of "[[My Way]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=February 11, 2003|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv203-03.php|title=Consumer Guide: The Prelude|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cadence Weapon|Rollie Pemberton]] was more enthusiastic in his review for ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', writing that Jay-Z "weaves his way through every imaginable style and flavor with unyielding expertise".&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hailed it as "the most ambitious and most fully realized album of his career",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73372/the-blueprint-2-the-gift-the-curse|title=The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; the Curse|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=November 30, 2003|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' felt it surpassed his previous album.&lt;ref name="Qmag"/&gt; In the opinion of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' critic Chris Ryan, ''The Blueprint 2'' found Jay-Z "tightening the screws of his delivery" and discovering a "bruising poetry in a flow that once seemed clumsily conversational".&lt;ref name="Spin"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5197">The '''Clown's Prayer''' is a poem or prayer that comedians of various sorts use for inspiration. There have been several poems that have gone by that name.

==Author unknown==
The original author of this poem is unknown. There are several variations on this poem. [[Chris Farley]] (from [[Saturday Night Live]] and [[Tommy Boy (film)|Tommy Boy]]) was known to have carried this prayer with him in his wallet.&lt;ref name=FarleyShow&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farley|first1=Tom|last2=Colby|first2=Tanner|title=The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780670019236|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hod_yMJ4840C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+chris+farley+show&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ-LvL1KnKAhXEVD4KHRJbCa0Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Clown's%20Prayer&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wisconsin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilpatrick|first1=Kristin|title=Famous Wisconsin Film Stars|date=2002|publisher=Badger Books Inc.|isbn=9781878569868|page=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kKPcSwYtbQUC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=The+Clown%27s+Prayer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip1eeR0KnKAhUMdD4KHbH8Bq4Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Clown's%20Prayer&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly includes the following four verses:&lt;ref name=Abundant&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eneli|first1=Aya|title=Live Your Abundant Life|date=2004|publisher=Xulon Press|isbn=9781594676611|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pxlGJ0TWrTUC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=The+Clown%27s+Prayer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip1eeR0KnKAhUMdD4KHbH8Bq4Q6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Clown's%20Prayer&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FarleyShow /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
As I stumble through this life,
help me to create more laughter than tears,
dispense more happiness than gloom,
spread more cheer than despair.

Never let me become so indifferent,
that I will fail to see the wonders in the eyes of a child,
or the twinkle in the eyes of the aged.

Never let me forget that my total effort is to cheer people,
make them happy, and forget momentarily,
all the unpleasantness in their lives.

And in my final moment,
may I hear You whisper:
"When you made My people smile,
you made Me smile."
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Never let me acquire success to the point that
I discontinue calling on my Creator in the hour of need,
Acknowledging and thanking Him in the hour of plenty.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Clowns International==
[[Clowns International]] hosts a service every year on the first Sunday in February at [[Holy Trinity Church, Dalston#The Clowns' Church|The Clowns' Church]] in London, and they recite a version of the Clown's Prayer then.&lt;ref name=Clowning&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bain|first1=Roly|last2=Forbes|first2=Patrick|title=Clowning Glory|date=1995|publisher=Church House Publishing|isbn=9780715148631|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y307g259-YUC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=The+Clown%27s+Prayer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnuPzl-KnKAhUFOT4KHT-bC64Q6AEIVjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Clown's%20Prayer&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Dear Lord, I thank you for calling
me to share with others the most
precious gift of laughter.
May I never forget that it is your gift 
and my privilege.
As your children are rebuked for their self importance
and cheered in their sadness,
help me to remember that your foolishness is
wiser than our wisdom. Amen. &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Lord, I am poor, I have no gift
Meet for Thy shrine;
My life is spent in joke and jest,
So empty, vain, e'en at its best,
This life of mine.
But, Lord, beneath my mirthful face
I hide a tear,
And when the crowd laugh at the fair
They seem to gibe at my despair
And mock my fear.
Lord, I am poor save in this wise:
A child have I,
And as I joke the best I may,
He, uncomplaining fades away
And soon must die.
Lord, thou hast many in thy home,
I only one;
Think, Lord, a jester's life is sad,
Change not "he has" into "he had," --
Grant me my son.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Tintin in the Congo''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Tintin au Congo'''}}; {{IPA-fr|tɛ̃tɛn o kɔ̃go}}) is the second volume of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Hergé]]. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|[[Le Vingtième Siècle]]}} for its children's supplement {{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingtième]]}}, it was [[serial (literature)|serialised]] weekly from May 1930 to June 1931 before being published in a collected volume by Éditions de Petit Vingtième in 1931. The story tells of young Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], who are sent to the [[Belgian Congo]] to report on events in the country. Amid various encounters with the native Congolese people and wild animals, Tintin unearths a criminal diamond [[smuggling]] operation run by the American gangster [[Al Capone]].

Following on from ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' and bolstered by publicity stunts, ''Tintin in the Congo'' was a commercial success within Belgium and was also serialised in France. Hergé continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[Tintin in America]]'' in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]]. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured ''Tintin in the Congo'' in his distinctive ''[[Ligne claire|ligne-claire]]'' style for republication by [[Casterman]], with further alterations made at the request of his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.

In the late 20th century, ''Tintin in the Congo'' became increasingly controversial for both its perceived [[racism|racist]] colonial attitude toward the Congolese and for its glorification of big-game hunting. Accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on ''The Adventures of Tintin'' describing it as one of Hergé's lesser works.

==Synopsis==
Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] travel to the [[Belgian Congo]], where a cheering crowd of native Congolese greet them.{{sfn|Hergé|2005|pp=1–11}} Tintin hires a native boy, [[Coco (comics)|Coco]], to assist him in his travels, and soon thereafter Tintin rescues Snowy from a [[crocodile]]. A criminal stowaway attempts to kill Tintin, but monkeys throw coconuts at the stowaway that knock him unconscious. A monkey kidnaps Snowy, but Tintin saves him by disguising himself as another monkey.{{sfn|Hergé|2005|pp=11–18}}

The next morning, Tintin, Snowy, and Coco crash their car into a train, which the reporter fixes and tows to the village of the Babaorum{{efn|{{lang|fr|Babaor'om}}, a play on {{lang|fr|baba au rhum}}, "[[rum baba]]"{{sfn|Pellegrini|2013|p=200}} }} tribe. He meets the king, who accompanies him on a hunt the next day. A lion knocks Tintin unconscious, but Snowy rescues him by biting off its tail. Tintin gains the admiration of the natives, making the Babaorum witch-doctor Muganga jealous. When he cures a man using [[quinine]], he is hailed as a ''Boula Matari'' ("Breaker of rocks").{{efn|''Boula Matari'' was a nickname for [[Henry Morton Stanley]], an explorer who worked with [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] to explore and annex the Congo basin region as a private colony, the [[Congo Free State]], during the late 19th century. The Free State was annexed by Belgium in 1908 and reorganized as the Belgian Congo.{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|pp=128-9}} }} With the help of the criminal stowaway, Muganga accuses Tintin of destroying the tribe's sacred idol. The enraged villagers imprison Tintin, but then turn against Muganga when Coco shows them footage Tintin had made of the witch-doctor and the stowaway conspiring to destroy the idol. Tintin becomes a hero in the village, and a local woman bows down to him, saying, "White man very great! Has good spirits&amp;nbsp;... White mister is big [[juju]] man!"{{sfn|Hergé|2005|pp=19–28}}

Angered, Muganga starts a war between the Babaorum and their neighbours, the M'Hatuvu,{{efn|{{lang|fr|M'Hatouvou}}, a play on {{lang|fr|m'as-tu vu}}, "show-off"{{sfn|Pellegrini|2013|p=200}} }} whose king leads an attack on the Babaorum village. Tintin outwits them, and the M'Hatuvu cease hostilities and come to idolise Tintin. Muganga and the stowaway plot to kill Tintin and make it look like a [[leopard]] attack, but Tintin survives and saves Muganga from a [[boa constrictor]]; Muganga pleads mercy and ends his hostilities. The stowaway attempts to capture Tintin again and eventually succeeds disguised as a Catholic missionary. They fight across a waterfall, and the stowaway is eaten by crocodiles.{{sfn|Hergé|2005|pp=44}} After reading a letter from the stowaway's pocket, Tintin finds that someone called "A.C." has ordered his elimination. Tintin captures a criminal who tried to rendezvous with the stowaway and learns that "A.C." is the American gangster [[Al Capone]], who is trying to gain control of African diamond production. Tintin and the colonial police arrest the rest of the diamond smuggling gang and Tintin and Snowy return to Belgium.{{sfn|Hergé|2005|pp=44–52}}

==History==

===Background===
Georges Remi—best known under the pen name [[Hergé]]—was employed as editor and illustrator of {{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingtième]]}} ("''The Little Twentieth''"),{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1pp=31–32|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=24–25}} a children's supplement to {{lang|fr|[[Le Vingtième Siècle]]}} ("''The Twentieth Century''"), a staunchly Roman Catholic, [[social conservatism|conservative]] Belgian newspaper based in Hergé's native [[Brussels]].  Run by the [[Abbé]] [[Norbert Wallez]], the paper described itself as a "Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information" and disseminated a far-right, fascist viewpoint.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1pp=20–32|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=24–25|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=38}} According to [[Harry Thompson]], such political ideas were common in Belgium at the time, and Hergé's milieu was permeated with conservative ideas revolving around "patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline, and naivety".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=24}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="For ''the Congo'' as with ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets'', the fact was that I was fed on the prejudices of the bourgeois society in which I moved&amp;nbsp;... It was 1930. I only knew things about these countries that people said at the time: 'Africans were great big children&amp;nbsp;... Thank goodness for them that we were there!' Etc. And I portrayed these Africans according to such criteria, in the purely paternalistic spirit which existed then in Belgium."|source=Hergé, talking to [[Numa Sadoul]]{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} }}

In 1929, Hergé began ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic strip for {{lang|fr|Le Petit Vingtième}}, a series about the exploits of a fictional Belgian reporter named Tintin. Following the success of ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', [[serial (literature)|serialised]] weekly in ''Le Petit Vingtième'' from January 1929 to May 1930, Hergé wanted to send Tintin to the United States.  Wallez insisted he write a story set in the Belgian Congo, then a [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colony]] and today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=26|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=24|3a=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=45}} Belgian children learned about the Congo in school, and Wallez hoped to encourage colonialist and missionary zeal in his readership.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=26}} He believed that the Belgian colonial administration needed promotion at a time when memories "were still fairly fresh" of the 1928 visit to the colony by the Belgian [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Queen Elisabeth]].{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=21}} He also hoped that some of his readers would be inspired to work in the Congo.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=46}}

Hergé characterised Wallez's instructions in a sarcastic manner, saying Wallez referred to the Congo as "our beautiful colony which has great need of us, tarantara, tarantaraboom".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=33}} He already had some experience in illustrating Congolese scenes; three years previously, Hergé had provided two illustrations for the newspaper that appeared in an article celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s expedition to the Congo. In one of these, Hergé depicted a native Congolese bowing before a European, a scene that he repeated in ''Tintin in the Congo''.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=27}}

As in ''Land of the Soviets'', where Hergé had based his information about the Soviet Union almost entirely on a single source, in ''Tintin in the Congo'' he used limited source material to learn about the country and its people. He based the story largely on literature written by missionaries, with the only added element being that of the diamond [[smuggling|smugglers]], possibly adopted from the "''[[Jungle Jim]]''-type serials".{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=25}} Hergé visited the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa|Colonial Museum]] of [[Tervuren]], examining their ethnographic collections of Congolese artefacts, including costumes of the [[Leopard Society|Leopard Men]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=27|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=46}} He adopted hunting scenes from [[André Maurois]]'s novel ''The Silence of Colonel Bramble'', while his animal drawings were inspired by [[Benjamin Rabier]]'s prints.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=27}} He also listened to tales of the colony from some of his colleagues who had been there, but disliked their stories, later claiming: "I didn't like the colonists, who came back bragging about their exploits. But I couldn't prevent myself from seeing the Blacks as big children, either."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=46}}

===Original publication, 1930–31===
''Tintin in the Congo'' was serialised under the French title of ''Tintin au Congo'' in ''Le Petit Vingtième'' from 5 May 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was [[print syndication|syndicated]] to the French Catholic newspaper ''[[Cœurs Vaillants]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=28|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=24}} Drawn in black and white, it followed the same formula employed in ''Land of the Soviets'', remaining "essentially plotless" according to Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Hergé improvised each week.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=21–22}} Hergé later commented on the process of writing these early adventures, stating, "The {{lang|fr|Petit Vingtième}} came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=33}} The strip's visual style was similar to that of ''Land of the Soviets''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=26}} In the first instalment of ''Tintin in the Congo'', Hergé featured [[Quick and Flupke]], two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another ''Le Petit Vingtième'' comic strip, in the crowd of people saying goodbye to Tintin.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=27|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=21}}

Like ''Land of the Soviets'', ''Tintin in the Congo'' was popular in Belgium. On the afternoon of 9 July 1931, Wallez repeated the publicity stunt he had used when ''Soviets'' ended by having a young actor, Henry de Doncker, dress up as Tintin in colonial gear and appear in Brussels and then [[Liège]], accompanied by 10 African bearers and an assortment of exotic animals hired from a zoo. Co-organised with the [[Bon Marché]] department store, the event attracted 5,000 spectators in Brussels.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=28|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=47|3a1=Thompson|3y=1991|3p=41}} In 1931, Brussels-based Éditions de Petit Vingtième collected the story together into a single volume, and [[Casterman]] published a second edition in 1937.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=28|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=24}}  By 1944 the book had been reprinted seven times, and had outsold each of the other seven books in the series.{{efn|The first seven ''Tintin'' books averaged a print run of 17,000 copies; ''Tintin in the Congo''{{'}}s sales exceeded 25,000.{{sfn|McKinney|2008|p=171}} }}{{sfn|McKinney|2008|p=171}} The series' success led Wallez to renegotiate Hergé's contract, giving him a higher salary and the right to work from home.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=47}}

===Second version, 1946===
[[File:Opening of Tintin in the Congo.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|The opening frames from the 1931 and 1946 versions of the book. In the crowd of the original are [[Quick and Flupke]]; they are joined by Hergé, E.&amp;nbsp;P. Jacobs, and Thomson and Thompson in the latter.|alt=Two comic book frames; the same basic scene of a young man being seen off at a railway station is depicted, but one image is in black and white while the other is in colour.]]
In the 1940s, after Hergé's popularity increased, he redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin stories in colour using the {{lang|fr|[[ligne claire]]}} ("clear line"){{efn|Hergé himself did not use the term ''ligne claire'' to describe his drawing style; the Dutch cartoonist [[Joost Swarte]] first used the term in 1977.{{sfn|Pleban|2006}} }} drawing style he had developed, so that they fitted in visually with the newer ''Adventures of Tintin'' that he had produced.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=25}} Hergé first made some changes in this direction in 1940, when the story was serialised in the Dutch-language ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]''.{{sfn|Goddin|2009|pp=70, 73}}

At Casterman's prompting, ''Tintin in the Congo'' was subsequently fully re-drawn, and the new version was published in 1946.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=25}} As a part of this modification, Hergé cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and [[Colonialism|colonial rule]].{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=25}} For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about [[geography]], he states in the 1930–31 version, "My dear friends, today I'm going to talk to you about your country: Belgium!" whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a [[mathematics]] lesson.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=25}} Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe."{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=25}}

In the 1946 colour version, Hergé added a cameo appearance from [[Thomson and Thompson]], the two detectives that he had introduced in the fourth Tintin story, ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'' (1932–34), which was chronologically set after the Congolese adventure. Adding them to the first page, Hergé featured them in the backdrop, watching a crowd surrounding Tintin as he boards a train and commenting that it "Seems to be a young reporter going to Africa&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=21}} In the same frame, Hergé inserted depictions of himself and his friend [[Edgar P. Jacobs]] (the book's colourist) into the crowd seeing Tintin off.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=42}}

===Later alterations and releases===
When ''Tintin in the Congo'' was first released by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live [[rhinoceros]], fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=23, 25}}

Although publishers worldwide had made it available for many years, English publishers refused to publish ''Tintin in the Congo'' because of its racist content. In the late 1980s, Nick Rodwell, then agent of [[Studios Hergé]] in the United Kingdom, told reporters of his intention to finally publish it in English and stated his belief that publishing the original 1931 black and white edition would cause less controversy than releasing the 1946 colour version.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=42}} After more delay, in 1991—sixty years after its original 1931 publication—it was the last of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' to see publication in English.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} The 1946 colour version appeared in English in 2005, published by [[Egmont Publishing|Egmont]].{{sfn|Hergé|2005|loc=inset}}

==Critical analysis==
Hergé biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] believed that Hergé's drawing became more assured throughout the first version of the story without losing any of its spontaneity.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=27}} He thought that the story began in "the most inoffensive way", and that throughout the story Tintin was portrayed as a [[Scout (Scouting)|Boy Scout]], something he argued reflected Hergé's "moral debt" to Wallez.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=27}} Biographer [[Benoît Peeters]] opined that ''Tintin in the Congo'' was "nothing spectacular", with some "incredibly cumbersome" monologues, but he thought the illustrations "a bit more polished" than those in ''Land of the Soviets''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=46–47}} Believing the plot to be "extremely simple", he thought that Tintin's character was like a child manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=47}}
Michael Farr felt that, unlike the previous Tintin adventure, some sense of a plot emerges at the end of the story with the introduction of the American diamond-smuggling racket.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=21–22}} [[Philippe Goddin]] thought the work to be "more exciting" than ''Land of the Soviets'' and argued that Hergé's depiction of the native Congolese was not mocking but a parody of past European militaries.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=75}}
By contrast, Harry Thompson believed that "''Congo'' is almost a regression from ''Soviets''", in his opinion having no plot or characterisation; he described it as "probably the most childish of all the Tintin books."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=40}} Simon Kuper of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' criticised both ''Land of the Soviets'' and ''Tintin in the Congo'' as the "worst" of the ''Adventures'', opining that they were "poorly drawn" and "largely plot-free".{{sfn|Kuper|2011}}

Farr saw the 1946 colour version as poorer than the black and white original; he said it had lost its "vibrancy" and "atmosphere", and that the new depiction of the Congolese landscape was unconvincing and more like a European zoo than the "parched, dusty expanses of reality".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} Peeters took a more positive attitude towards the 1946 version, commenting that it contained "aesthetic improvements" and "clarity of composition" because of Hergé's personal development in draughtsmanship, as well as an enhancement in the dialogue, which had become "more lively and fluid."{{sfn|Peeters|1989|pp=30–31}}

In his [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] study of the series, [[Jean-Marie Apostolidès]] highlighted that in the Congolese adventure, Tintin represented progress and the Belgian state was depicted as a model for the natives to imitate. In doing so, he argued, they could become more European and thus civilised from the perspective of Belgian society, but that instead they ended up appearing as parodies.{{sfn|Apostolidès|2010|pp=12–15}}  Opining that Tintin was imposing his own view of Africa onto the Congolese, Apostolidès remarked that Tintin appeared as a god-figure, with evangelical overtones in the final scene.{{sfn|Apostolidès|2010|pp=15–16}} Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] concurred that Tintin represented the Belgian state, but also suggested that he acted as a Christian missionary, even being "a kind of god" akin to the character of [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]] in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899).{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=51}} McCarthy compared the scene where Tintin exposes Muganga as a fraud to that in which the character of [[Prospero]] exposes the magician in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=51}}

==Criticism==

===Racism===
[[File:Angry King in Tintin.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A comics strip panel.  A heavily caricatured African king jumps in the air angrily, saying, "Curses!&amp;nbsp;... Our artillery done for!&amp;nbsp;... By my ancestors, me myself kill miserable white man!" |The King of the M'Hatuvu angry at his failure in battle against Tintin, from the 1946 version of the book; such depictions have widely been labelled racist.]]
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised ''Tintin in the Congo'' as [[racism|racist]] due to its portrayal of the Congolese as infantile and stupid.{{sfn|Cendrowicz|2010}} According to Tom McCarthy, Hergé depicted the Congolese as "good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery."{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=37}} There had been no such controversy when originally published,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=28}} because it was only following the [[decolonization of Africa]], which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, that Western attitudes towards indigenous Africans shifted.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} Harry Thompson argued that one must view ''Tintin in the Congo'' in the context of European society in the 1930s and 1940s, and that Hergé had not written the book to be "deliberately racist". He argued that it reflected the average Belgian view of Congolese people at the time, one that was more "patronising" than malevolent.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=40}} Jean-Marie Apostolidès supported this idea,{{sfn|Apostolidès|2010|p=14}} as did biographer Benoît Peeters, who asserted, "Hergé was no more racist than the next man."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=46}} After meeting Hergé in the 1980s, Farr commented, "You couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist."{{sfn|Smith|2010}}

Contrastingly, biographer Pierre Assouline stated that in 1930s Belgium, Hergé would have had access to literature by the likes of [[André Gide]] and [[Albert Londres]] that was critical of the colonial regime. Assouline claimed that Hergé instead chose not to read such reports because they conflicted with the views of his conservative milieu.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=29–30}} Laurence Grove—President of the International ''Bande Dessinée'' Society and an academic at the [[University of Glasgow]]—concurred, remarking that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that "[w]hen it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that's what he was."{{sfn|Smith|2010}} Comic book historian Mark McKinney noted that other Franco-Belgian comic artists of the same period had chosen to depict the native Africans in a more favourable light, citing the examples of [[Jijé]]'s 1939 work ''[[Blondin et Cirage]]'' (''Blondy and Shoe-Black''), in which the protagonists are adopted brothers, one white, the other black, and ''Tif et Tondu'', which was serialised in ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' from 1939 to 1940 and in which the Congolese aid the Belgians against their American antagonists.{{sfn|McKinney|2008|pp=171–172}}

Farr and McCarthy stated that ''Tintin in the Congo'' was the most popular Tintin adventure in Francophone Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=27|2a1=McCarthy|2y=2006|2p=37}} According to Thompson, the book remained hugely popular in the Congo even after the country achieved independence in 1960.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=41–42}} Nevertheless, government figures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have criticised the book. In 2004, after the Belgian [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Belgium)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Karel De Gucht]] described President [[Joseph Kabila]]'s provisional DRC government as incompetent, Congolese Information Minister Henri Mova Sakanyi accused him of "racism and nostalgia for colonialism", remarking that it was like "''Tintin in the Congo'' all over again." De Gucht refused to retract his statement.{{sfnm|1a1=Cendrowicz|1y=2010|2a1=BBC|2y=2004}}

[[File:Humanzoogermany.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A poster depicting two black African faces.|''Tintin in the Congo'' fitted widely held stereotypes about black Africans found in early 20th century Europe. This is a poster for a [[human zoo]] in [[Stuttgart]] in 1928.]]
In July 2007, British human rights lawyer David Enright complained to the United Kingdom's [[Commission for Racial Equality]] (CRE) that he came across the book in the children's section of [[Borders Group|Borders]] bookshop while shopping with his wife and two sons. The CRE called on bookshops to remove the comic, stating that it contained "hideous racial prejudice" by depicting Congolese who "look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles." Responding that it was committed to letting its "customers make the choice", Borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels. UK bookseller [[Waterstones|Waterstone's]] followed suit.{{sfn|Bunyan|2011}}  Another British retailer, [[WHSmith]], said that the book was sold on its website, but with a label that recommended it for readers aged 16 and over.{{sfnm|1a1=BBC|1y=2007|2a1=Fernandez|2y=2007|3a1=Beckford|3y=2007|4a1=Anon|4y=2007|4p=14}} The CRE's attempt to ban the book was criticised by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician [[Ann Widdecombe]], who remarked that the organisation had more important things to do than regulate the availability of historical children's books.{{sfn|Beckford|2007}} The media controversy increased interest in the book, and Borders reported that its sales of ''Tintin in the Congo'' had been boosted 4,000%, while it also rose to eighth on the [[Amazon.com]] bestseller list.{{sfn|Anon|2007|p=14}} Publisher Egmont UK also responded to racism concerns by placing a protective band around the book with a warning about its content and writing an introduction describing its historical context.{{sfn|Bunyan|2011}}

''Tintin in the Congo'' also came under criticism in the United States; in October 2007, in response to a complaint by a patron, the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] in [[New York City]] placed the graphic novel in a locked back room, only permitting access by appointment.{{sfn|Leigh Cowan|2009}} ''Tintin in the Congo'' became part of a drawn-out media debate in Sweden after national newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' reported on the book's removal from a children's library in [[Kulturhuset]] in [[Stockholm]] in September 2011. The incident, nicknamed "Tintin-gate", led to heated discussions in mainstream and social media concerning accusations of racism and censorship.{{sfn|Chukri|2012}}

In August 2007, Congolese student Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo filed a complaint in Brussels, claiming that the book was an insult to the Congolese people and required banning. Public prosecutors investigated and initiated a criminal case. The matter was eventually transferred to a civil court in April 2010.{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC|2y=2012}} Mondondo's lawyers argued that ''Tintin in the Congo'' amounted to "a justification of colonisation and of white supremacy", and Mondondo called it "racist and xenophobic".{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC|2y=2012}} Alain Berenboom, lawyer for both [[Hergé Foundation|Moulinsart]], the company which controls Hergé's estate, and Casterman, the book's publisher, argued that the cartoonist's depiction of the Congolese "wasn't racism but kind paternalism". He said that banning it would set a dangerous precedent for the availability of works by other historical authors, such as [[Charles Dickens]] or [[Jules Verne]], which contain similar stereotypes of non-white ethnicities.{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC|2y=2012}} The court ruled in February 2012 that the book would not be banned, deciding that it was "clear that neither the story, nor the fact that it has been put on sale, has a goal to&amp;nbsp;... create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, or humiliating environment", and that it therefore did not break Belgian law.{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC|2y=2012}} Belgium's [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism|Centre for Equal Opportunities]] warned against "over-reaction and hyper [[political correctness]]".{{sfn|Vrielink|2012}}

Shortly after, Swedish-Belgian Jean-Dadaou Monyas filed a similar complaint, which was supported by Afrosvenskarna, an interest group for Swedes of African descent.{{sfn|Kalmteg|2007}} The complaint to the [[Chancellor of Justice (Sweden)|Chancellor of Justice]] was turned down as violations of [[hate speech]] restrictions in the Swedish [[Constitution of Sweden|Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression]] must be filed within one year of publication, and the latest Swedish edition of ''Tintin in the Congo'' appeared in 2005.{{sfn|Lindell|2007}}

The South African comics writer [[Anton Kannemeyer]] has parodied the perceived racist nature of the book to highlight what he sees as the continuing racist undertones of South African society. In his ''Pappa in Afrika'' (2010), a satire of ''Tintin in the Congo'', he portrays Tintin as an [[Afrikaner]] with racist views of indigenous Africans.{{sfnm|1a1=Mail &amp; Guardian|1y=2010|2a1=Heller|2y=2011}}

===Hunting and animal cruelty===
''Tintin in the Congo'' shows Tintin taking part in what [[Michael Farr]] described as "the wholesale and gratuitous slaughter" of animals; over the course of the ''Adventure'', Tintin shoots several [[antelope]], kills an ape to wear its skin, rams a rifle vertically into a crocodile's open mouth, injures an elephant for ivory, stones a buffalo, and (in earlier editions) drills a hole into a rhinoceros before planting dynamite in its body, blowing it up from the inside.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} Such scenes reflect the popularity of big-game hunting among whites and affluent visitors in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1930s.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=22}} Hergé later felt guilty about his portrayal of animals in ''Tintin in the Congo'' and became an opponent of [[blood sport]]s; when he wrote ''Cigars of the Pharaoh'' (1934), he had Tintin befriend a herd of elephants living in the Indian jungle.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=41}}

Philippe Goddin stated that the scene in which Tintin shoots a herd of antelope was "enough to upset even the least ecological reader" in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=70}} When [[India Book House]] first published the book in India in 2006, that nation's branch of the [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] issued a public criticism, and chief functionary Anuradha Sawhney stated that the book was "replete with instances that send a message to young minds that it is acceptable to be cruel to animals."{{sfn|Chopra|2006}}
