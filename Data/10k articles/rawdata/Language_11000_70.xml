The '''Activist Women's Voices''' collection is an oral history project of 35 women activists who worked in community-based organizations in the [[New York City area]]. The project covers the period from 1995 to 2000 and was a project of The [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) [[Graduate Center, CUNY|Graduate Center's]] Women's Studies Program and Center for the Study of Women. The digitized collection is made up of women from a diverse cross-section of cultural and ethnic social service organizations including activists from Arab-American, Haitian, Hispanic, African American, and Asian American communities. It is held at the [[Graduate Center, CUNY#Mina Rees Library|Mina Rees Library, CUNY Graduate Center]].&lt;ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-Overview&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Projects: The Activist Women's Voices Oral History Project and Archive|url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-the-Study-of-Women-and-Society/Research-Projects|website=[[CUNY Graduate Center]]|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldCat-AWV-1995&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelb|first1=Joyce|last2=Laurence|first2=Patricia Ondek|title=Activist Women's Voices Oral History Archives|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/activist-womens-voices-oral-history-archives-1995-2000/oclc/55492073|website=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=26 September 2015|date=1995|OCLC=55492073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project began in 1995 under the [[aegis]] of the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) [[Graduate Center, CUNY|Graduate Center's]] Women's Studies Program and Center for the Study of Women and Society. Initially started as part of a graduate class "Women, Community, and Public Voice,"&lt;ref name=OralHistReview-Roundtable-1998&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=DA-SORT&amp;docType=Discussion&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;contentSegment=&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;inPS=true&amp;userGroupName=nypl&amp;docId=GALE%7CA21210602&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA21210602|last1=Fong|first1=Timothy P.|last2=Kahn|first2=Ava F.|title=An Educational Exchange: Teaching Oral History on the Post-Secondary Level|journal=[[Oral History Review]]|date=1998|volume=25|issue=1-2 (Summer-Fall 1998)|pages=9–34|accessdate=30 September 2015|issn=0094-0798|oclc=193192588|doi=10.1093/ohr/25.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's Studies Director Joyce Gelb and Deputy Director Patricia Laurence curated a list of oral history subjects: New York City-based women who were leaders in their communities.&lt;ref name=LvivCenter-GelbLecture-2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronicle: Lecture by Professor Joyce Gelb|url=http://www.lvivcenter.org/en/chronicle/news/?newsid=396|website=Lviv Center|accessdate=30 September 2015|date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenwood-Laurence-2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Emmanuel S.|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Multiethnic American Literature|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|ISBN=978-0-313-33059-9|page=1,308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9Xk28_4NBoC&amp;lpg=PA1308&amp;dq=%22activist%20women's%20voices%22&amp;pg=PA1308#v=onepage&amp;q=%22activist%20women's%20voices%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015|OCLC=60839325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific focus was on unheralded women from a diverse cross-section of the five boroughs of New York.&lt;ref name=ClioinClassroom-Diverse-2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berkin|first1=Carol|last2=Crocco|first2=Margaret|last3=Winslow|first3=Barbara|title=Clio in the Classroom A Guide for Teaching U.S. Women's History|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|ISBN=978-0-199-71776-7|page=264|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jKi30N-fkYC&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;ots=eDnPJOYkSW&amp;dq=%22activist%20women's%20voices%22%20cuny&amp;pg=PA264#v=onepage&amp;q=%22activist%20women's%20voices%22%20cuny&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015|OCLC=311040200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the project was based in the Women's Studies Program, the subjects were not specifically working in organizations that specifically supporting women. The focus was on the women leaders themselves. The last interviews were completed in 1998.&lt;ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-Overview /&gt;

The scope of the project included compiling a list of oral history projects&lt;ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-WomensOralHist-2001&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Kai Alexis|title=Wayback Links: Women's Oral History Collection Links|url=http://activistwomen.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2013/03/27/wayback-links/|website=Activist Women's Voices, [[Graduate Center, CUNY|The Graduate Center Library, CUNY]]: Special Collections|accessdate=26 September 2015|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a now-defunct searchable database of oral history collections.&lt;ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-Consortium&gt;{{cite web|title=Activist Women's Voices: Consortium|url=https://activistwomen.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about/consortium/|website=Activist Women's Voices, [[Graduate Center, CUNY|The Graduate Center Library, CUNY]]: Special Collections|accessdate=26 September 2015|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UWI-OralHistWomen&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Office of the Gender and Women's Studies Librarian|title=Oral Women’s History in the United States|url=https://www.library.wisc.edu/gwslibrarian/research-help/wkdl/subject-areas/history/oralhis/|website=[[University of Wisconsin Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries]]|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
Graduate students from different concentrations within [[Graduate Center, CUNY|CUNY Graduate Center]] completed weekly internships  as part of their degree programs, working at the organization that was the focus of the oral history project. Through this process they identified and interviewed leaders in the organization in a fieldwork environment within the metropolitan area of New York City.&lt;ref name=OralHistReview-Roundtable-1998 /&gt; After receiving training on conducting oral history interviews, the graduate students went into the field and interviewed their subjects.&lt;ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-Overview /&gt;&lt;ref name=OxfordHandbookOralHist-2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armitage|first1=Sue|editor1-last=Ritchie|editor1-first=Donald A.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Oral History|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|ISBN=978-0-195-33955-0|pages=180–181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNkL6T8Zx4cC&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;ots=Wfu_uojtS2&amp;dq=%22activist%20women's%20voices%22&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q=activist%20women's%20voices&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 September 2015|OCLC=827753920|chapter=The Stages of Women's Oral History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of the interviews was on biographical experiences that shaped their community-based work, and on challenges, achievements, motivations, and methodologies used to effect changes within their communities.&lt;ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-Overview /&gt; The project was categorized into a subject map.&lt;ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-SubjectMap-2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Kai Alexis|title=Wayback: Subject Map|url=http://activistwomen.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2013/03/27/wayback-subject-map/|website=Activist Women's Voices, [[Graduate Center, CUNY|The Graduate Center Library, CUNY]]: Special Collections|accessdate=26 September 2015|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Processing ===
In 2011, a finding aid was completed. In 2013, digitization of the 77 audio cassettes and 2,300 pages of interview transcripts was completed, with clips of some of the oral histories made available online in 2014.&lt;ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-FindingAid-2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handis|first1=Michael W.|url=http://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=gc_arch|title=Activist Women's Voices Oral History Collection, 1995-2000, Finding Aid (Archives and Special Collections.

'''Bamako Sign Language''', also known as '''Malian Sign Language''', or '''LaSiMa''' (''Langue des Signes Malienne''), is a [[sign language]] that developed outside the Malian educational system, in the urban tea-circles of [[Bamako]] where deaf men gathered after work. It is used predominantly by men, and is threatened by the educational use of [[American Sign Language]], which is the language of instruction for those deaf children who go to school.

The '''Bongo languages''', or '''Bongo–Baka''', comprise six languages spoken in [[South Sudan]]. They are members of the [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]] language family.

The most populous Bongo language is [[Jur Modo language|Jur Modo]], spoken by a hundred thousand people. The languages are:
* [[Bongo language|Bongo]]
* [[Baka language (Sudan)|Baka]]
* Morokodo–Beli
** [[Jur Modo language|Jur Modo]]
** [[Morokodo language|Morokodo]] (Nyamusa-Molo, Mo’da)
** [[Jur Beli language|Jur Beli]] (Beli)
** [[Mittu language|Mittu]] (extinct)

In various classifications, Bongo is sometimes split off from the rest of the family, so the phrase ''Bongo–Baka'' may be less ambiguous than simply ''Bongo''.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Ethnologue'' places Bongo in its own branch of Bongo–Baka, but then comments that it is similar to Jur Beli in the main branch.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bulu''' is the language of the [[Beti-Pahuin|Bulu people]] of [[Cameroon]]. The language had 174,000 native speakers in 1982, with some 800,000 second language speakers in 1991.  Colonial and missionary groups formerly used Bulu as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the region for commercial, educational, and religious purposes, though it is today becoming less frequent in those spheres. Dialects include Bene, Yelinda, Yembana, Yengono, and Zaman.

Bulu speakers are concentrated primarily in Cameroon's [[South Province (Cameroon)|South Province]], with the largest number at [[Ebolowa]] and [[Sangmélima]]. Some speakers live in the [[Nyong-et-Mfoumou division]] of the [[Centre Province (Cameroon)|Centre]] and the [[Haut-Nyong division]] of the [[East Province (Cameroon)|East]].

Bulu is a [[Bantu language]]. It is a dialect of the [[Beti language]] and is intelligible with [[Eton language|Eton]], [[Ewondo language|Ewondo]], and [[Fang language|Fang]].

Bowen studied speech therapy in Melbourne, graduating from the Victorian School of Speech and Hearing Science with a LACST (Licentiate of the Australian College of Speech Therapists, a forerunner of the Australian Association of Speech and Hearing, later to become [[Speech Pathology Australia]]) in 1970, and received her [[PhD]] degree in 1996 from [[Macquarie University]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquariematters/macquarie-alumni-feature-in-2018-australia-day-honours/ |title=Macquarie alumni feature in 2018 Australia Day honours |publisher=Macquarie University |date=15 February 2018 |accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has qualifications in Speech and Drama from [[Trinity College London]] (ATCL performer 1964; LTCL teaching 1966) and a diploma in Family Therapy (1989) from the now disbanded Family Therapy Institute of Australia. 

She has worked extensively across Australia, Ireland and the UK and is regarded as an international expert in both clinical fields of children's speech sound disorders and in the use of technology to improve speech pathology practice.&lt;ref name="RCSLT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 2018|title=SLT Awarded Australian honour|url=|journal=Bulletin: The Official Magazine of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists|volume=791|page=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a Senior Honorary Research Fellow in Linguistics at Macquarie University in Australia, and an Honorary Research Fellow in Speech-Language Pathology at the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]] in South Africa.

In 2008 Bowen was elected as a fellow the [[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association]]. In 2011 she was made a life member of [[Speech Pathology Australia]] and in 2014 became an honorary fellow of the [[Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists]]. She is the only Australian, and only speech-language pathologist, to be awarded high honours by all three of these professional organisations.&lt;ref name='RCSLT' /&gt; 

Dr Bowen's other professional interests include [[evidence-based practice]]; the role of families in speech-language pathology intervention; [[developmental language disorder]]; the impact of treatment fads, [[Alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]] and [[pseudoscience]] on clinical and education practice (e.g., the [[Arrowsmith Program]], [[Brain Gym International|Brain Gym]], [[Facilitated communication|Facilitated Communication]], [[Irlen syndrome|Irlen]], [[Learning styles|Learning Styles]],  the [[Rapid prompting method|Rapid Prompting Method]], [[Whole language|Whole Language]], etc.); and the application  of information and communication technology, including social media, for professional purposes. Dr Bowen has also been a pioneer in the use of the Internet in Speech Pathology. Her own website and her Phonological Therapy listserv have facilitated worldwide communication of the highest standard within the profession.&lt;ref name='SPA'&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2018|title=Dr Caroline Bowen AM: Honorary Division of the Order of Australia|url=|journal=Speak Out: The Magazine for Australian Speech Pathologists|volume=|page=|pages=10-11|via=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

She consulted on the 2010 film [[The King's Speech]],&lt;ref name=' 'BMG'&gt;{{cite news |title=Australia Day Honour: Dr Caroline Bowen, AM ||author1=Lewis, B.

'''Chuj''' is a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] spoken by around 40,000 members of the [[Chuj people]] in [[Guatemala]] and around 3,000 members in [[Mexico]]. Chuj is a member of the [[Mayan languages#Q'anjobalan|Q'anjob'alan branch]] along with  the languages of [[Tojolab'al language|Tojolab'al]], [[Q'anjob'al language|Q'anjob'al]], [[Akatek language|Akateko]], [[Jakaltek language|Popti']], and [[Mocho' language|Mocho']] which, together with the Ch'olan branch, Chuj forms the [[Mayan languages#Western branch|Western branch]] of the Mayan family.  The Chujean branch emerged approximately 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Stzolalil Stz'ib'chaj Ti' Chuj, ALMG, 2007, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;  In Guatemala, Chuj speakers mainly reside in the municipalities of [[San Mateo Ixtatán]], [[San Sebastián Coatán]] and [[Nentón]] in the [[Huehuetenango Department]]. Some communities in Barillas and Ixcán also speak Chuj. The two main dialects of Chuj are the San Mateo Ixtatán dialect and the San Sebastián Coatán dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Robertson, John S. |title = A history of tense/aspect/mood/voice in the Mayan verbal complex |year= 1992 |publisher = University of Texas press |location = Austin, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chuj language has been influenced by Spanish, and Chuj speakers have a tendency to borrow [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words or [[Code-mixing|code-mix]]. It is estimated that 70% of the Chuj language is purely Chuj.&lt;ref&gt;Yumal Skuychaj Ti' Chuj, ALMG, 2006, p.234&lt;/ref&gt; There are language conservation and revitalization efforts taking place in San Mateo Ixtatán, through groups like the [[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="ALMG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almg.org.gt/portal/index.php?id=40&amp;idioma=1 |title= Comunidad Lingüística Chuj -Historia |accessdate=2009-01-20 |publisher=Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala |year=}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter 'h' is conventionally used in words with initial vowels to distinguish them from words that begin with a glottal stop.

==Grammar==

===Verb stem morphology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Grinevald, Collette |author2=Peake, Marc|year=2012 |title= Ergativity and voice in Mayan: A functional-typological approach |editor = Giles Authier |editor2 = Kathleen Haude |journal=Ergativity, valency, and voice| pages=15–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Below is a template for the verbal stem in Chuj. Verbal predicates in Chuj appear with a status suffix: -a with transitive verbs and –i with intransitive verbs. Finite clauses inflect for [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]-[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]], [[Grammatical person|person]], and [[Grammatical number|number]].

{| class="wikitable"

|colspan="5"|''tzachinchela''' 'I am hugging you.'
|}

===Non-verbal predicates===

Non-verbal predicates are non-verbal words like adjectives, nouns, positionals, or directionals that act as the main predicate and are semantically [[stative verb|stative]]. These constructions do not inflect for Tense-Aspect, but do inflect for person and number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Mateo-Toledo, B'alam Eladio | title= The finiteness of nonverbal predicates in Q’anjob’al (Maya). |journal=New Perspectives in Mayan Linguistics |pages= 162–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no overt [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] in Chuj and copula constructions are expressed through non-verbal predicates.

'''Chuj:''' ''a ix Malin k'ayb'um ix''.
&lt;br&gt;'''Gloss:''' top/foc CL Maria teacher CL
&lt;br&gt;'''English:''' Maria is a teacher.

'''Chuj:''' ''Ay ix hin-nun niwakil ix''.
&lt;br&gt;'''Gloss:''' top/foc CL my-mother large CL
&lt;br&gt;'''English:''' My mother is large.

===Person-markers===

Chuj is an [[ergative-absolutive language]]. The subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are both cross-referenced with an absolutive marker, which appears in the verbal stem. The subject of a transitive verb is cross-referenced with an ergative marker in the verbal stem.

Chuj has four attested [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]-[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] markers.&lt;ref name="Hopkins, Nicholas A. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Domingo Pascual, Pascual Martín 2007"/&gt; Finite clauses inflect obligatorily for Tense-Aspect.

===Nominal classifiers===


Chuj nominal [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] represent a closed class of approximately a dozen words. They specify gender for humans, and the base material for objects, such as wood (te') for houses and metal (k'en) for knives.

{| class="wikitable"

Chuj nominal classifiers have two main functions: they act as [[Article (grammar)|articles]] for referential nouns, and as [[Pronoun|pronouns]]. They have a lexical origin, but have undergone semantic bleaching and may therefore refer to a larger semantic field than the nominals that they are derived from.



'''Articles for referential nouns'''

'''Chuj:''' ''Heb‘ winh unin ix-s-lo‘ [te‘        manzan] heb‘ winh.''
&lt;br&gt;'''Gloss:''' Pl   cl.masc child prfv-a3s-eat cl.wood apple pl cl.masc
&lt;br&gt;'''English:''' As for the boys, they ate the apple.



'''Pronouns'''

'''Chuj:''' ''Ol-s-lo te’ ix.''
&lt;br&gt;'''Gloss:''' Prosp-b3s-a3s-eat cl.wood cl.fem
&lt;br&gt;'''English:''' She (Elsa) will eat it (the apple).

[[File:Young grapes.jpg|right|thumb|Young grapes are most susceptible to coulure right after flowering when they need vital carbohydrate resources in order to develop fully.]]
'''Coulure''' (pronounced coo-LYUR) is a [[viticultural hazard]] that is the result of [[metabolic]] reactions to weather conditions that causes a failure of [[grape]]s to develop after [[flowering (vine)|flowering]]. In English the word ''shatter'' is sometimes used. Coulure is triggered by periods of cold, cloudy, rainy weather or very high out-of-season temperatures. The condition is most often manifested in the [[spring (season)|spring]]. It also occurs in vines that have little [[sugar content (wine)|sugar content]] in their [[Vascular tissue|tissue]]. [[Flowers]] stay closed and are not [[Biological dispersal|fertilized]]. Thus the vines are not [[pollinated]] as the grape fails to develop and falls off. Coulure can also cause irregular bunches of grapes which are less compact than normal. These bunches are more sensitive to developing various [[grape diseases]]. The [[yield (wine)|yield]] of a vine with coulure will decrease substantially. [[Grape varieties]] with high proclivity to coulure are [[Grenache]], [[Malbec]], [[Merlot]], and [[Muscat Ottonel]]. Other causes of coulure may be vineyard conditions and practices, [[pruning]] too early or too severely, excessively fertile soils or overuse of [[fertilizers]], and improper selection of [[rootstocks]] or [[clones (plant)|clones]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 207-208"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 207-208 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the flowering part of the [[growing season (vine)|growing season]] (May-June in the Northern Hemisphere, November-December in the Southern Hemisphere), grapevines often need dry conditions with sufficient sunlight and ambient air temperature around {{convert|15|C|F}} for pollination to go smoothly. Less ideal conditions, particularly wet, rainy weather, increases the odds that a higher than normal numbers of flowers go unpollinated and coulure to occur.&lt;ref name="WSET"&gt;Wine &amp; Spirits Education Trust ''"Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality"'' pg 25, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, {{ISBN|9781905819157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulure is a distinct phenomena unrelated to another viticultural hazard, [[millerandage]], where the flowers are pollinated but the resulting berries develop with seeds and remain small. Like coulure, millerandage is often caused by inclement weather during the flowering and fruit set period and cause reduced yields.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

==Cause and effect==
[[File:Grapes03.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Grapevines need a balance of sufficient leaf cover in order to produce photosynthesis but not shade the grapes too much from sunlight.]]
Coulure is caused by a [[carbohydrate]] deficiency in the plant tissues that causes the vine to conserve resources that would otherwise be funneled into the developing grape berries. As carbohydrate levels drop, soon after flowering the [[stem (vine)|stem]]s connected to the berries shrivel as the small grapes (0.2&amp;nbsp;inches/5 millimeters in diameter) eventually fall off. 
[[Image:Coulure 2014 P7053002 bew.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Most likely a clear example of coulure.]]
To some extent coulure and the dropping of fruit is a natural and healthy reaction of a vine that is self-regulating its resource and the amount of fruit that it produces. But when the situation is exacerbated by certain weather conditions and disruption to [[photosynthesis]], coulure can have a more severe impact on yields that may negatively affect a region's grape supply and thus influence pricing.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 207-208"/&gt;

When the weather is the primary instigator of coulure, the French term this phenomenon ''coulure climatique''. This describes the cloudy and wet conditions that limit the amount of photosynthetic activity that takes place during the flowering cycle of a grapevine. Limited sunshine means lower sugar levels that can be converted into resources to develop grape berries. Warm temperatures can also exacerbate coulure in some grape varieties by promoting [[cellular respiration]] and excessive [[shoot]] growth that further competes with the berries for the resources derived from carbohydrates. Other contributing factors include excessively fertile [[vineyard soils]], either naturally or enhanced by the use of [[nitrogen]]-rich fertilizers, overly vigorous rootstock and severe pruning that too drastically limits the amount of leaf surface needed to sustain photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 207-208"/&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:Malbec grapes.jpg|right|thumb|Malbec can be highly susceptible to coulure but newer clones are being produced with less sensitivity.]]
Coulure is not 100% preventable but a vineyard manager can take several precautions to lessen the severity and impact of coulure. Some grape varieties are more prone to develop coulure than others, such as [[Grenache]], [[Malbec]], [[Merlot]] and [[Muscat Ottonel]]. A grower can choose to grow clones of those varieties, now commonly available for Merlot and Malbec, that have less susceptibility to developing coulure. In the vineyard, care can be taken to not prune so severely and insure that there is adequate leaf coverage for photosynthesis. Trimming the tips of developing shoots near the end of the flowering period can lessen the competition for sugar resources between berries and new shoot development. For non-[[organic viticulture]], chemical growth inhibitors can be applied to the vine to limit shoot growth as well.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 207-208"/&gt;

The '''Dardani''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑr|d|ə|n|aɪ}}; {{lang-grc|Δαρδάνιοι, Δάρδανοι}}; {{lang-la|Dardani}}), or '''Dardanians''' (Δαρδανίωνες) were an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] tribe which settled in the region that took its name from them of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D%232163 "Δαρδάνιοι, Δάρδανοι, Δαρδανίωνες"] Dardanioi, Georg Autenrieth, "A Homeric Dictionary", at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=dardani&amp;ending= Latin Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Thraco-Illyrian]] contact zone.

==Etymology==
The ethnonym was spelled in Greek as ''Dardaneis'', ''Dardanioi'' and ''Dardanoi'', and in Latin as ''Dardani''.{{sfn|Papazoglu|1969|p=201}} 

In 1854 within the context of 19th century [[historical linguistics]], [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] was the first to propose that the names ''Dardanoi'' and ''Dardania'' were derived from a proto-[[Albanian language|Albanian]] word, meaning ''pear tree'' (''dardha'' in modern Albanian the definite form, ''dardhë'' indefinite form &lt; PAlb *''dardā''&lt;ref&gt;Albanian Etymological Dictionary, V.Orel, Koninklijke Brill ,Leiden Boston Köln 1998, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkes244"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John|title=The Illyrians|year=1992|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780631146711|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=l8q0QgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Wilkes%20the%20illyrians&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|pages=244|ref=harv}} "Names of individuals peoples may have been formed in a similar fashion, Taulantii from ‘swallow’ (cf. the Albanian tallandushe) or Erchelei the ‘eel-men’ and Chelidoni the ‘snail-men’. The name of the Delmatae appears connected with the Albanian word for ‘sheep’ delmë) and the Dardanians with for ‘pear’ (''dardhë'')."&lt;/ref&gt;), in view of the fact that toponyms related to fruits or animals are not unknown in the region (cf. Alb. ''dele''/''delmë'' "sheep" supposedly related to Dalmatia, [[Ulcinj]] in Montenegro &lt; Alb. ''ujk'', ''ulk'' "wolf" etc.). Opinions differ whether the ultimate etymon of this word in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was *''g'hord-'', or *''dheregh-''.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie, Robert (1998): "Dendronymica Albanica: A survey of Albanian tree and shrub names". ''Zeitschrift für Balkanologie'' 34: 163-200 [http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A1998DendronEngl.pdf online paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term used for their territory was ''Dardanike'' ({{lang|grc|Δαρδανική}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papazoglu|1978|p=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other tribal areas had more unspecified terms, such as ''Autariaton khora'' ({{lang|grc|Αὐταριατῶν χώρα}}), for the "land of [[Autariatae]]."

==Greek mythological origin==
In [[Greek mythology]], Dardanos (Δάρδανος), one of the sons of [[Illyrius]] (the others being Enchelus, Autarieus, Maedus, Taulas, and Perrhaebus) was the [[eponymous]] ancestor of the ''Dardanoi'' (Δάρδανοι).&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''The Foreign Wars, III, 1.2''&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Roman ethnography|Roman ethnographers]] proposed a connection between Dardani of the [[Balkans]] and the [[Dardanians (Trojan)|Dardans]] of [[Troy]], having a group of Dardan colonists settle in the Balkans and subsequently degenerate into a state of barbarism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=220}} {{quote|Leaving aside Strabo's comment on the dirty habits of the Dardanians, there is little on which to judge the general health of the Illyrian population.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Romans&lt;ref&gt;Greeks and Barbarians (Edinburgh Readings on the Ancient World) by T. Harrison, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-93959-3}}, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; considered them to be Greeks as a whole, which contradicts modern scholarship.

==History==
{{See also|Kingdom of Dardania|Dardanian-Bastarnae war}}

===4th century BC===
The Dardani are first mentioned in the 4th century BC, when their king [[Bardylis]] succeeded in bringing various tribes into a single organization. Under his leadership the Dardani defeated the Macedonians and Molossians several times. At this time they were strong enough to rule Macedonia through a puppet king in 392-391 BC. In 385-384 they allied with [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] and defeated the Molossians, killing up to 15,000 of their soldiers and ruling their territory for a short period. Their continuous invasions forced [[Amyntas III of Macedon]] to pay them a tribute in 372 BC. They returned raiding the Molossians in 360. In 359 BC Bardylis won a decisive battle against Macedonian king [[Perdiccas III]], whom he killed himself, while 4,000 Macedonian soldiers fell, and the cities of upper Macedonia were occupied.&lt;ref name="Lewis-1994-428"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=D.

The time of this marriage is somewhat disputed while some historians maintain that the marriage happened after the defeat of Bardylis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Donnelly Carney|title=Women and Monarchy in Macedonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbI2hZBy_EkC|year=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3212-9|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave Philip II valuable time to gather his forces against those Dardani who were still under Bardylis, defeating them at the Erigon Valley by killing about 7,000 of them, eliminating the Dardani menace for some time.&lt;ref name=Ashley111/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.

In 334 BC, under the leadership of Cleitus, the son of Bardylis, the Dardani, in alliance with other Illyrian tribes attacked Macedonia held by [[Alexander the Great]]. The Dardani managed to capture some cities but were eventually defeated by Alexander's forces.&lt;ref name="Lewis-1994-428"/&gt;

===3rd–1st century BC===

[[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe|Celts were present]] in Dardania in 279 BC.{{sfn|Mócsy|2014|p=9}} The Dardanian king offered to help the Macedonians with 20,000 soldiers against the Celts, but this was refused by Macedonian king [[Ptolemy Keraunos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Malcolm Errington|title=A History of Macedonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYgkqP_s1PQC|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06319-8|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dardani were a constant threat to the Macedonian kingdom. In 230 under [[Longarus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; they captured [[Bylazora]] from the Paionians&lt;ref&gt;A history of Macedonia Volume 5 of Hellenistic culture and society, Author: Robert Malcolm Errington, University of California Press, 1990 {{ISBN|0-520-06319-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-06319-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PYgkqP_s1PQC&amp;lpg=PA185 p. 185]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 229 they again attacked Macedonia, defeating [[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius II]] in an important battle.&lt;ref&gt;A history of Macedonia Volume 5 of Hellenistic culture and society, Robert Malcolm Errington, University of California Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-520-06319-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-06319-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PYgkqP_s1PQC&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=bardylis&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA174 p. 174]&lt;/ref&gt; In this period their influence on the region grew and some other Illyrian tribes deserted [[Teuta]], joining the Dardani under Longarus and forcing Teuta to call off her expedition forces in Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] rose to the Macedonian throne, skirmishing with Dardani began in 220-219 BC and he managed to capture Bylazora from them in 217 BC. Skirmishes continued in 211 and in 209 when a force of Dardani under Aeropus, probably a pretender to the Macedonian throne, captured Lychnidus and looted Macedonia taking 20.000 prisoners and retreating before Philip's forces could reach them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 201 [[Bato of Dardania]] along with Pleuratus the Illyrian and Amynander king of Athamania, cooperated with Roman consul Sulpicius in his expedition against Philip V.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being always under the menace of Dardanian attacks on Macedonia, around 183 BC [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] made an alliance with the [[Bastarnae]] and invited them to settle in Polog, the region of Dardania closest to Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint campaign of the Bastarnae and Macedonians against the Dardanians was organized, but Philip V died and his son [[Perseus of Macedon]] withdrew his forces from the campaign. The Bastarnae crossed the Danube in huge numbers and although they didn't meet the Macedonians, they continued the campaign. Some 30,000 Bastarnae under the command of Clondicus seem to have defeated the Dardani.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 179 BC, the [[Bastarnae]] conquered the Dardani, who later in 174 pushed them out, in a war which proved catastrophic, with a few years later, in 170 BC, the Macedonians defeating the Dardani.{{sfn|Mócsy|2014|p=10}} Macedonia and Illyria became Roman protectorates in 168 BC.{{sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p=173}} The [[Scordisci]], a tribe of Celtic origin, most likely subdued the Dardani in the mid-2nd century BC, after which there was no mention of the Dardani for a long time.{{sfn|Mócsy|2014|p=12}}

In 97 BC the Dardani are mentioned again, defeated by the Macedonian Roman army.{{sfn|Mócsy|2014|p=15}} In 88 BC, the Dardani invaded the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] together with the [[Scordisci]] and the [[Maedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=140}} {{quote| ...

According to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'' (compiled 20 BC–23 AD), they were divided into two sub-groups, the [[Galabri]] and the [[Thunaki]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]]: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/home.html Books&amp;nbsp;1‑7, 15‑17] in English translation, ed.

[[File:Balkans 6th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Dardania and the northern Balkans in [[Late Antiquity]]]]
It seems quite probable that the Dardani actually lost independence in 28 BC thus, the final occupation of Dardania by Rome has been connected with the beginnings of [[Augustus]]' rule in 6 AD, when they were finally conquered by Rome. Dardania was conquered by [[Gaius Scribonius Curio]] and the Latin language was soon adopted as the main language of the tribe as many other conquered and Romanized.&lt;ref name="balkaninstitut.com"&gt;http://www.balkaninstitut.com/pdf/izdanja/B_XXXVII_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==
{{see also|Dardania (Roman province)}}
At first, Dardania was not a separate Roman province, but became a region in the province of [[Moesia Superior]] in 87 AD.&lt;ref name="Wilkes-1992-210"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=210}} {{quote|Here the old name of Dardania appears as a new province formed out of Moesia, along with Moesia Prima, Dacia (not Trajan's old province but a...

Other than that, little to no data&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papazoglu|1978|p=187}} {{quote|We have very little information about the territory of the Dardanians before its inclusion in the Roman state}}&lt;/ref&gt; exists on the territory of the Dardani prior to Roman conquest, especially on its southern extent.

According to Ancient Greek and Roman historiography, the tribe was viewed of as "extremely barbaric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aelian|author2=Diane Ostrom Johnson|title=An English translation of Claudius Aelianus' Varia historia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFAXAQAAIAAJ|date=June 1997|publisher=E.

Dardanian slaves or freedmen at the time of the Roman conquest were clearly of [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan]] origin, according to their personal names.{{sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p=224}} It has been noted that personal names were mostly of the "Central-Dalmatian type".{{sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p=245}}

An extenstive study based on [[onomastics]] has been undertaken by [[Radoslav Katičić]] which puts the Dardani language area in the Central Illyrian area (''"Central Illyrian"'' consisting of most of former Yugoslavia, north of southern Montenegro to the west of Morava, excepting ancient Liburnia in the northwest, but perhaps extending into Pannonia in the north).&lt;ref&gt;Katičić, Radoslav (1964b) "''Die neuesten Forschungen über die einhemiche Sprachschist in den Illyrischen Provinzen''" in Benac (1964a) 9-58 Katičić, Radoslav (1965b) "''Zur frage der keltischen und panonischen Namengebieten im römischen Dalmatien''" ANUBiH 3 GCBI 1, 53-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katičić, Radoslav.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8141">The '''Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language''' (French: ''Délégation pour l'Adoption d'une Langue Auxiliaire Internationale'') was a body of academics convened in the early part of the 1900s (decade) to decide on the issue of which [[international auxiliary language]] should be chosen for international use. The ultimate decision of the committee charged by the Delegation was to adopt the [[Esperanto]] language, but with certain reforms. The result became a distinct language known as [[Ido (language)|Ido]].

==Creation==
The Delegation was founded in 1901 by French academics [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Léopold Leau]], who had noted the language difficulties arising among international bodies convening during the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 World's Fair]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uli-ido.info/ULI_Angla_History_Ido.htm Document sans titre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204319/http://www.uli-ido.info/ULI_Angla_History_Ido.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with European esperantists, they gathered support for the Delegation from professional societies, companies, and universities.

Among the chief aims of the Delegation were to select a language to be taught alongside "natural languages" and allow written and spoken communication in an international environment. Three conditions were laid out for the language to be chosen:

#It must be capable of serving the needs of science, in addition to everyday life, commerce and general communication,
#It must be able to be easily learned by all people of average education, and especially those of the civilized nations of Europe, and
#It must not be a living language.

In June 1907, the Delegation convened and refused to decide the ultimate issue, but rather, at Couturat's insistence, created a committee to make the decision.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==The Committee==
The Delegation Committee arranged to meet in Paris in October 1907. Supporters of [[Esperanto]], including its author [[L. L. Zamenhof]], warned Couturat that the committee had no authority to impose an international language, but they had received assurances from Couturat that Esperanto would be chosen anyway.&lt;ref name="The Esperanto Book: 3"&gt;[http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html#ido The Esperanto Book: 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044938/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html |date=2012-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=December 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Historio/LeterojZ.4.html Zamenhof to Couturat: 21. I. 1907&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Committee were:

*Manuel Barrios, President of the Peruvian Senate
*[[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]], Professor of Linguistics, University of St. Petersburg
*[[Émile Boirac]], University of Dijon, author and Esperanto supporter known for the phrase [[déjà vu]]
*[[Charles Jacques Bouchard]], Professor, Paris College of Medicine
*[[Loránd Eötvös]], Hungarian Academy of Sciences
*[[Wilhelm Julius Foerster|Wilhelm Förster]], President of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]]
*Col. [[George Brinton McClellan Harvey|George Harvey]], Esperanto supporter and editor of the ''North American Review''
*[[Otto Jespersen]], philologist, University of Copenhagen
*[[Spyridon Lambros]], University of Athens
*[[Constantin Le Paige]], University of Liege
*[[Wilhelm Ostwald]], University of Leipzig, future [[Nobel Prize]] winner (chemistry)
*[[Hugo Schuchardt]], University of Graz.

The committee heard from representatives of language projects, including Italian mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano]] in support of his own [[Latino sine flexione]]. Esperanto was represented by [[Louis de Beaufront]], an active supporter of the language. Other languages, such as [[Bolak language|Bolak]], [[Spokil]] and [[Idiom Neutral]] received the attention of the committee.

Towards the end of the Committee's meeting, committee members received a proposal by an anonymous author identified as "Ido" (I.D. in Esperanto, possibly for ''Internacia Delegacio'' International Delegation, but also meaning "offspring" in Esperanto). The proposal reformed Esperanto in a number of ways, including removing circumflexed letters, dropping the mandatory accusative ending and reforming the plural. The reforms were endorsed by Esperanto's representative, [[Louis de Beaufront|de Beaufront]].

The decision of the committee was to adopt Esperanto in principle, but with the reforms spelled out by Ido. A permanent commission was set up to see the implementation of the reforms. The anonymous "Ido", author of the reform project, was later revealed to be Louis de Beaufront, acting in concert with [[Louis Couturat]].&lt;ref name="The Esperanto Book: 3"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

The commission delivered an ultimatum to the Esperanto Language Committee, the nearest approximate to a governing body of the Esperanto movement at the time. A response was demanded in one month, but this was logistically impossible as members of the Language Committee spread out all over Europe and beyond.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} After a month passed with no response, the commission broke relations with the Esperantists.

A number of Esperantists did migrate to the movement, including a number of influential leaders of the movement, but most ordinary speakers did not support the Ido reforms. This prompted the observation from outsiders that the Idists were generals without an army, and the Esperantists were an army with no generals.&lt;ref name="The Esperanto Book: 3"/&gt; Less than a year later, the [[Universala Esperanto-Asocio]] was created to provide stronger leadership within the Esperanto movement, which had not received organizational guidance from its inventor, Dr. Zamenhof. While Esperantists have little regard for the Delegation and its decisions, partisans of Ido continue to insist that the Delegation Committee was legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028132654/http://geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5037/truth.html  The Truth about the Delegation in 1907&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ido (language)|Ido language]] even today still has a following.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idolinguo.com/ The Uniono por la Linguo Internaciona Ido organizes annual conventions of Ido speakers and supporters&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Encyclopedia of Esperanto]] summarizes the Esperantists' position as follows: 

:''La "Delegitaro" estis unu-homa afero, sen kunvenoj aŭ difinita regularo. La unu klara regulo, ke aŭtoroj de lingvoprojekto ne rajtas partopreni, estis rompita. El la 12 membroj de la komitato nur du estis lingvistoj, kaj nur 4 partoprenis; oni aldonis nomojn de anstataŭantoj aŭ novaj membroj sen rajtigo. La fina rezolucio estis voĉdonita de nur tri el la 12 plus 4 anstataŭantaj kaj la sekretarioj. Oni sendis al la L. K. 25 kopiojn de la projekto, por disdoni ilin inter 100 membroj de la L. K. (loĝantaj ankaŭ ekster Eŭropo) kaj postulis respondon post unu monato.''

:The "Delegation" was a one-man enterprise, without meetings or a definitive set of rules. The one clear rule, that authors of language projects have no right to participate, was broken. Of the 12 members of the committee, only two were linguists, and only four participated; they added names of substitutes or new members without permission. The final resolution was voted upon by only three of the twelve plus four substitutes and the secretaries. They sent to the L.K. (Esperanto Language Committee) 25 copies of the project, to distribute among its 100 members (some of whom were living outside of Europe) and demanded a response in one month.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1948">'''Distributed Language Translation''' ({{lang-eo|Distribuita Lingvo-Tradukado}}, '''DLT''') was a project to develop an [[interlingual machine translation]] system for twelve European languages. It ran between 1985 and 1990.

:The distinctive feature of DLT was the use of [a version of] [[Esperanto]] as an [[pivot language|intermediate language]] (IL) and the idea that translation could be divided into two stages: from L1 into IL and then from IL into L2. The intermediate translation could be transmitted over a network to any number of workstations which would take care of the translation from IL into the desired language. Since the IL format would have been disambiguated at the source, it could itself serve as a source for further translation without human intervention. &amp;mdash; Job M. van Zuijlen (one of the DLT researchers)

DLT was undertaken by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] software house BSO (now part of [[Atos Origin]]) in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in cooperation with the now defunct Dutch airplane manufacturer [[Fokker]] and the [[Universal Esperanto Association]].

The project's results were far from the expected. From a modern view, the DLT concept was erroneous in itself, as it couldn't distinguish the different meanings of the same word in different contexts.{{POV-statement|1=Erroneous concept, really?|date=October 2015}} Modern statistic-based and context-based translation programs are able to produce a better translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages|url=https://www.languagemarketplace.com/Translation-Languages.html|publisher=www.languagemarketplace.com|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]], the [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] ⊨, ⊧ or &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''double turnstile'''. It is often read as "[[logical consequence|entails]]", "[[Model theory|models]]", "is a '''[[semantic]]''' '''consequence''' of" or "is stronger than".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nederpelt |first=Rob  |title=Logical Reasoning: A First Course |publisher=King's College Publications|year=2004| edition=3rd revised |page=62 |chapter=Chapter 7: Strengthening and weakening|isbn=0-9543006-7-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the [[turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;, which has a single bar across the middle, and which denotes ''[[syntactic]]'' consequence (in contrast to ''semantic'').

== Meaning ==
The double turnstile is a binary relation. It has several different meanings in different contexts:
* To show [[Logical consequence#Semantic consequence|semantic consequence]], with a set of sentences on the left and a single sentence on the right, to denote that if every sentence on the left is true, the sentence on the right must be true, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vDash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;. This usage is closely related to the single-barred [[turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]] symbol which denotes [[logical consequence#Syntactic consequence|syntactic consequence]].
* To show [[satisfiability|satisfaction]], with a model (or truth-structure) on the left and a set of sentences on the right, to denote that the structure is a model for (or satisfies) the set of sentences, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.
* To denote a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], &lt;math&gt;\vDash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;. which is to say that the expression &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a semantic consequence of the empty set.

== Typography ==
In [[TeX]], the turnstile symbols &lt;math&gt;\vDash&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; are obtained from the commands  &lt;tt&gt;\vDash&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\models&lt;/tt&gt; respectively. In Unicode it is encoded at {{unichar|22A8|TRUE|html=}}

In [[LaTeX]] there is the [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/turnstile turnstile package], which issues this sign in many ways, including the double turnstile, and is capable of putting labels below or above it, in the correct places. The article [http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2007-3/buchsbaum A Tool for Logicians] is a tutorial on using this package.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42173">'''Dramatism''', an interpretive communication studies theory, was developed by [[Kenneth Burke]] as a tool for analyzing human relationships. In this theory, our lives are as if on a stage, setting us individuals as actors on that stage as a way to understand human motives and relations.&lt;ref name="Blakesley"&gt;Blakesley, David.  The Elements of Dramatism. New York: Longman. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke discusses two important ideas – that life is drama, and the ultimate motive of rhetoric is the purging of guilt.&lt;ref name="Overington" /&gt; Burke recognized guilt as the base of human emotions and motivations for action. As cited in ''A Note on Burke on "Motive",'' the author recognized the importance of "motive" in Burke's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benoit|first=William|date=1996|title=A Note on Burke on "Motive"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3886226|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=26|issue=2|pages=67–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in ''Kenneth Burke's concept of motives in rhetorical theory,'' the authors mentioned that Burke believes that when guilty "combined with other constructs, describes the totality of the compelling force within an event which explains why the event took place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crable|first=Richard E.|last2=Makay|first2=John J.|date=1972-01|title=Kenneth Burke's concept of motives in rhetorical theory|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01463377209369017|journal=Today's Speech|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=11–18|doi=10.1080/01463377209369017|issn=0040-8573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Burke and the Method of Dramatism. ''Theory and Society,'' 4, 131-156.&lt;/ref&gt; and to find the ultimate motivations of human activities.

==Background and Assumptions==

=== Background ===
Why use "drama" as the metaphor? According to West,&lt;ref name="West" /&gt; there are three basic reasons that drama is a useful metaphor to the idea of Dramatism.

# Drama indicates a wide range of human experience. 
# There are typical genres that drama follows, which is similar to communications in human lives.
# Drama is closely related to audiences, which shows the struggles of audiences and also provides suggestions.

It is possible because Burke believes that Drama has recognizable genres. Humans use language in patterned discourses, and texts move us with recurring patterns underlying those texts.&lt;ref name="Brummett"&gt;Brummett, B. (1993). Landmark Essays on Kenneth Burke (Vol. 2). Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; And drama has certain audiences, which means rhetoric plays a crucial role when humans deal with experiences. Language strategies are central to Burke's dramatistic approach.&lt;ref name="Block"&gt;Brock, B. L. (1985). Epistemology and ontology in Kenneth Burke's dramatism. Communication Quarterly, 33(2), 94-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assumptions ===
Because of the complexity and extension of Burke's thinking, it is difficult to label the ontology behind his theory. However, some basic assumptions can still be extracted to support the understanding of dramatism.
# Some of what we do is motivated by animality and some of it by symbolicity.&lt;ref name="Brummett"/&gt; Human's drinking water is to satisfy the thirst, which is an animal need; while the action of reading papers is influenced by symbols. Burke's position is that both animal nature and symbols motivate us. For him, of all the symbols, language is the most important. [https://g.co/kgs/fZ5d9y Brummett] , shares a smilier idea in his book ''[https://www.amazon.com/LANDMARK-ESSAYS-KENNETH-BURKE-Brummett/dp/B002K7FNFI Landmark Essays on Kenneth Burke]'', that “teeters between the realizations that some of what we do is motivated by animality and some of it by symbolicity (p. xii)." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landmark essays on Kenneth Burke|last=Brummett|first=Barry|publisher=Hermagoras Press., Davis, CA|year=1993|isbn=B002K7FNFI|location=|pages= xi–xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# When we use language, we are used by it as well. Burke held a concept of linguistic relativity similar to the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. Words set our concepts and opinions, which means people cannot see beyond what their words lead them to believe.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, K. (1965). Permanence and Change. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}  This assumption suggests that language exerts a determining influence over people,&lt;ref name="Melia"&gt;Melia, T. (1989). Scientism and Dramatism: Some Quasi-Mathematical Motifs in the Work of Kenneth Burke. The Legacy of Kenneth Burke, 55-73.&lt;/ref&gt; which means meanwhile people's propositions are often restricted to be polarized by language, because some language cannot express much nuance of opinion.
# We humans are choice makers. [[Agency (sociology)]] is another key point of dramatism. "The essence of agency is choice."&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;Conrad, C., &amp; Macom, E. A. (1995). Re‐visiting Kenneth Burke: Dramatism/logology and the problem of agency. Southern Journal of Communication, 61(1), 11-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Social actors have the ability of acting out of choices.

==Key Concepts==
=== 1. Dramatistic pentad ===

==== The Dramatistic Pentad ====
The [[Dramatistic pentad|Dramatistic Pentad]] is an instrument used as a set of relational or functional principles that could help us understand what he calls the ‘cycle cluster of terms’ people use to attribute motive.&lt;ref name="Blakesley" /&gt; This pentad is a dissolution to drama.&lt;ref name="Crable"&gt;Crable, Bryan. (2000). Burke's Perspective on Perspectives: Grounding Dramatism in the Representative Anecdote. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' 86, 318-333.&lt;/ref&gt; It is parallel with [[Four causes|Aristotle’s four causes]] and has a similar correlation to journalists catchism: who, what, when, where, why, and how.&lt;ref name="Overington" /&gt;  This is done through the five key elements of human drama – act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; The Pentad is a simple tool for seeing and understanding the complexity of a situation. It reveals the nuances and complications of language as symbolic action, which in turn, opens up our perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine.(2002). Beyond the Tyranny of the Real: Revisiting Burke's Pentad as Research Method for Professional Communication. ''Technical Communication Quarterly,'' 11, 365-388.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Dramatism Pentad.png|thumb|Dramatism Pentad|238x238px]]
* '''Act:''' "What", what has done. According to Burke, "the act" of the Pentad is which “names what took place, in thought or deed.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Motives|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Scene:''' "When" and "Where". According to Burke, "the scene" is defined as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Agent:''' "by Whom", who did it. Burke defines the "agent" as “what person or kind of person performed the act.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Agency:''' "How", which is associated with methods and technologies. Burke defines the "agency" as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Purpose:''' "Why", why it happened. This is associate with the motive behind the behavior, which is the main focus of the analysis.
* '''''Attitude'':''' How to prepare for an act

In the 1969 edition of ''Grammar'', Burke added a new element, Attitude, thereby making the pentad a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). Five fingers or six? Pentad or hexad. KB Journal, 6(2).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] means "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." &lt;ref name="BurkeGrammar"&gt;Burke, K., 1897. (1955). ''A grammar of motives''. New York: George Braziller.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

===== Example of the usage of pentad =====
David Ling used the pentad elements to evaluate Senator Edward Kennedy's speech in 1969 to persuade the audiences to see him as a victim of his family curse instead of the one who should be responsible for a accident which caused death of a woman. From Kennedy's statement, Ling recognized several elements from the pentad: "the scene (the event surrounding the death of the woman), the agent (Kennedy), the act (Kennedy's failure to report immediately the accident), the agency (whatever methods to make such a report), the purpose (to fulfill his legal and moral responsibilities). "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ling|first=David A.|date=1970-06|title=A pentadic analysis of senator Edward Kennedy's address to the people of massachusetts, July 25, 1969|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/10510977009363002?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=81–86|doi=10.1080/10510977009363002|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy denied his relationship with the died woman, described his survival as a fate, and described the hardness of rescuing the woman at the scene. He pivoted the fact and described it as a circumstance that he couldn't control.

====The Dramatistic Ratios====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dramatistic_pentad&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7#Ratios_within_the_dramatistic_pentad Dramatistic ratios] is the "proportions of one element relative to another in the Dramatism Pentad",&lt;ref name="West" /&gt; which can be used to find the dominant element in the interaction.

Any complete statement about motives will offer some kind of answers to the five questions above.&lt;ref name="Crable" /&gt; While it is important to understand each element of the Pentad on its own, it is more important to understand how the elements work together. This is called a ''[[ratio]]'', and there are ten possible ratios within the Pentad. Burke maintained that analyzing the ratios of a speaker’s presentation would expose the resources of ambiguity people might exploit to interpret complex problems.&lt;ref name="Blakesley" /&gt; The most common ratios used by Burke are Scene-Act and Scene-Agent. When engaged in a dramatistic study, he notes, "the basic unit of action would be defined as 'the human body in conscious or purposive motion'", which is an agent acting in a situation.&lt;ref name="Overington" /&gt;

===2. Identification===
[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]] is the basic function of sociality, using both positive and negative associations. When there is overlap between two people in terms of their substance, they have identification.&lt;ref name="West, T"&gt;West, T., &amp; Turner, L. (2003). Introducing communication theory: analysis and application with powerweb.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, division is the lack of overlap between two people in matters of essence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing communication theory: Analysis and application|author1=West, R. L.  |author2=Turner, L. H.|publisher=McGraw-Hill.|year=2010|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=328–342|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burke, identification is an inevitable, thus both beneficial and detrimental characteristic of language in human relations.&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;Jordan, J. (2005). Dell Hymes, Kenneth Burke's "identification," and the Birth of sociolinguistics.  Rhetoric Review. 24(30, 264-279).  doi:10.1207/s15427981rr2403_2&lt;/ref&gt;  Identification has the following features:

==== The chief notion of a "new rhetoric" ====
Examining Aristotle's  principles of rhetoric, Burke points out that the definition of the "old [[rhetoric]]" is, in essence, persuasion.&lt;ref name="BurkeRhetoric"&gt;Burke, K. (1950). A rhetoric of motives. New York, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, Burke proposes a new rhetoric, which discusses several issues, but mainly focuses on the notion of identification. In comparison with "old" rhetoric, which stresses on deliberate design, [[new rhetoric|"new" rhetoric]] may include partially "unconscious" factors in its appeal.&lt;ref name="Hochmuth"&gt;Hochmuth, M. (1952). Kenneth burke and the "new rhetoric". Quarterly Journal of Speech, 38(2), 133-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's concept of new rhetoric has also been expanded in various academic disciplines. For example, in 2015 philosophers Rutten &amp; Soetaert used the new rhetoric concept to study changing attitudes in regards to education as a way to better understand if Burke's ideas can be applied to this arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutten|first=Kris|last2=Soetaert|first2=Ronald|title=Attitudes Toward Education: Kenneth Burke and New Rhetoric|url=https://doi-org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/10.1007/s11217-014-9432-5|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|volume=34|issue=4|pages=339–347|doi=10.1007/s11217-014-9432-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's new rhetoric has also been used to understand the [[Women's rights|women's equality movement]], specifically in regards to the education of women and sharing of knowledge through print media. Academic Amlong deconstructed print medias of the [[Caroline Healey Dall|1800]]s addressing human rights as an aspect of educating women about the women's rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amlong|first=Terri A.|date=2013-04-04|title="Universal Human Rights": The New Rhetoric of the Woman's Rights Movement Conceptualized Within the Una (1853-1855)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/503867|journal=American Periodicals: A Journal of History &amp; Criticism|volume=23|issue=1|pages=22–42|doi=10.1353/amp.2013.0006|issn=1548-4238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Generated when two people's substances overlap ====
Burke asserts that all things have substance, which he defines as the general nature of something. Identification is a recognized common ground between two people’s substances, regarding physical characteristics, talents, occupation, experiences, personality, beliefs, and attitudes. The more substance two people share, the greater the identification.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;  It is used to overcome human division.&lt;ref name="Ahmed"&gt;Ahmed, R. (2009). Interface of political opportunism and Islamic extremism in Bangladesh: Rhetorical identification in government response. Communication Studies. 60(1). 82-96. doi:10.1080/10510970802623633&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Can be falsified to result in homophily ====
Sometimes the speaker tries to falsely identify with the audience, which results in [[homophily]] for the audience.  Homophily is the perceived similarity between speaker and listener.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;  The so-called "I" is merely a unique combination of potentially conflicting corporate "we's". For example, the use of the people rather than the worker would more clearly tap into the lower middle-class values of the audience the movement was trying to reach.&lt;ref name="Jordan"/&gt;

==== Reflects ambiguities of substance ====
Burke recognizes that identification rests on both unity and division, since no one's substance can completely overlap with others. Individuals are "both joined and separated".&lt;ref name="BurkeRhetoric"/&gt; Humans can unite on certain aspects of substance but at the same time remain unique, which is labeled as "ambiguities". Identification can be increased by the process of consubstantiation, which refers to bridging divisions between two people. Rhetoric is needed in this process to build unity.

===3. Guilt and Redemption ===
According to Burke, [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]] Redemption is considered the plot of all human drama, or the root of all rhetoric. He defined the "guilt" as "the theological doctrine of Original Sin"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wess|first=Robert|title=Permanence and Change: a biological subject of history|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511552878.004|work=Kenneth Burke|pages=55–83|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511552878|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as cited from Littlejohn, Burke sees guilt as "all-purpose word for any feeling of tension within a person—anxiety, embarrassment, self-hatred, disgust and the like"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJ32DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=Littlejohn+all-purpose+word+for+any+feeling+of+tension+within+a+person%E2%80%94anxiety,+embarrassment,+self-hatred,+disgust&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r53AdD__6J&amp;sig=lT8nmns5zvORPiwsXr4FpanN5Sg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQmYeRpuHeAhVmoFkKHQHoARYQ6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Littlejohn%20all-purpose%20word%20for%20any%20feeling%20of%20tension%20within%20a%20person%E2%80%94anxiety,%20embarrassment,%20self-hatred,%20disgust&amp;f=false|title=Theories of Human Communication: Eleventh Edition|last=Littlejohn|first=Stephen W.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|last3=Oetzel|first3=John G.|date=2016-12-22|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=9781478634775|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this perspective, Burke concluded that the ultimate motivation of man is to purge oneself of one's sense of guilt through public speaking. The term guilt covers tension, anxiety, shame, disgust, embarrassment, and other similar feelings. Guilt serves as a motivating factor that drives the human drama.

Burke's cycle refers to the process of feeling guilt and attempting to reduce it, which follows a predictable pattern: order(or hierarchy), the negative, victimage (scapegoat or mortification), and [[redemption (theology)|redemption]].

==== Order or hierarchy ====
Society is a dramatic process in which hierarchy forms structure through power relationships. The structure of social hierarchy considered in terms of the communication of superiority, inferiority and equality.&lt;ref name = "Duncan"&gt;Duncan, H. D. (1968). Communication and social order. Transaction Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy is created through language using, which enables us to create categories. We feel guilt as a result of our place in the hierarchy.&lt;ref name = "West" &gt;West, R., &amp; Turner, L. Introducing communication theory. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The negative ====
The negative comes into play when people see their place in the social order and seek to reject it. Saying no to the existing order is both a function of our language abilities and evidence of humans as choice makers.&lt;ref name = "Duncan"/&gt; Burke coined the phrase "rotten with perfection", which means that because our symbols allow us to imagine perfection,  we always feel guilty about the difference between the reality and the perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, K. (1966). Language as symbolic action: Essays on life, literature and method. University of California Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Victimage ====
Victimage is the way that we try to redeem the guilt. There are two ways of victimage. The way of turning the guilt into ourselves is called [[Mortification (theology)|mortification]]. It is engaged when we apologize or blame ourselves when facing the wrongdoing; the way of turning the guilt to external parties is called [[scapegoating]]. According to Burke, there are two different types of scapegoating, ''universal'' and ''fractional''. In ''universal'' scapegoating, the speaker blames everyone for the problem, so the audience associates and even feels sorry for the victim, because it includes themselves.  In ''fractional'' scapegoating, the speaker blames a specific group or a specific person for their problems.  This creates a division within the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. P. (2006). To Execute Capital Punishment: The Mortification and Scapegoating of Illinois Governor George Ryan. Western Journal of Communication, 70(4), 311-330. doi:10.1080/10570310600992129&lt;/ref&gt;  The victim, whoever it may be, is ''vilified'', or made up to violate the ideals of social order, like normalcy or decency. As a result, by people who take action against the villains become ''heroized'' because they are confronting evil.&lt;ref&gt;Blain, M. (2005). The politics of victimage:. Critical Discourse Studies, 2(1), 31-50. doi:10.1080/17405900500052168&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Redemption ====
This is a confession of guilt by the speaker and a request for forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Normally, these people are sentenced to a certain punishment so they can reflect and realize their sins.  This punishment is specifically a kind of “death,” literal or figuratively.  
 
Many speakers experience a combination of these two guilt-purging options.The ongoing cycle starts with order.  The order is the status quo, where everything is right with the world.  Then pollution disrupts the order.  The pollution is the guilt or sin.  Then casuistic stretching allows the guilt to be accepted into the world.  Next, is the guilt, which is the effect of the pollution.  After that, is victimage or mortification which purges the guilt.  Finally comes transcendence which is new order, the now status quo.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

== Other application fields ==
Dramatism provides us a new way to understand people. Burke's goal is to explain the whole of human experience with symbolic interaction. It is used in a variety of fields.

=== English ===

Burke's technical term for drama representative anecdote&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}} indicates that the compositionist's adage gives appropriate examples covers the case adequately. Winterowd suggests writers should present ideas dramatistically,not relying on argument and demonstration alone but grounding their abstractions in the concreteness of what being called as representative anecdotes.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. (1985). Dramatism and Deliberation. ''Rhetoric Review'', ''4''(1), 34-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Representative anecdote means conceptual pivot and is equated with a family of terms: [[enthymeme]], thesis, topic sentence, theme. The representative anecdote, can be either support or conceptual pivot, and in the case of drama is both support and conceptual pivot.&lt;ref&gt;Winterowd, W. R. (1983). Dramatism in themes and poems. ''College English, 45''(6), 581-588.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular art ===
[[Dwight Macdonald]] and [[Ernest van den Haag|Ernest Van Den Haag]] views that popular (or "mass"-) culture functions not as Scene, as one might ordinarily expect, but as Agency. "Masscult" itself is the force involved in the Act of brainwashing the public into accepting lower standards of art. This Act is accomplished with the "Sub-Agency" of modern electronic technology, the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberling, C. R. (1982). ''Kenneth B''urke's dramatism and popular arts''. Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green''
State University Popular Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Politics ===
David Ling uses the pentad to analyze Senator Edward [[Ted Kennedy|Ted Kenndy]]'s address to the people of Massachusetts.(See [[Chappaquiddick incident]])&lt;ref&gt;David
A. Ling (1969). A pentadic analysis of senator Edward Kennedy's address to the
people of Massachusetts. Communication Studies, 21(2), 81-86&lt;/ref&gt;  He regards the events surrounding the death of Miss Kopechne as the scene, Kennedy himself as the agent, Kennady's failure to report the accident in time as act, methods to report as agency, and finds out that the purpose for Kennedy is to fulfill his legal and moral duty.

Another example of dramatism in politics is the use of Burke’s rhetorical interpretations as a tool to understand presentations of terrorism in media. Researchers Gurrionero and Canel highlight the use of Burke’s understanding of motives and identification within the context of the media’s framing of terrorist attacks, saying that the words and symbols used are with specific motives to frame the pentad into the voice that benefits the media and viewers at the expense of the acclaimed terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canel|first=María José|last2=Gurrionero|first2=Mario García|title=Framing analysis, dramatism and terrorism coverage: politician and press responses to the Madrid airport bombing|url=http://www.unav.es/fcom/communication-society/en/resumen.php?art_id=596|journal=Communication &amp; Society|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=133–149|doi=10.15581/003.29.4.133-149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication ===
Rempel Denise applies dramatism to explore the social networking site [[Myspace|MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;Rempel, D. (2008).
An exploration of the social networking site MySpace using kenneth burke's theory of dramatism&lt;/ref&gt; She analyzed the architecture of MySpace, the identity presentation of users and the audience reception and finds out that legitimate communication is impossible, and consequently, cannot lead the users to act [[Consubstantiality|consubstantially]].

Another example of applying Dramatism guilt redemption cycle elements in communication field, is the communication crisis of [https://g.co/kgs/mY29Mi Donald Sterling]'s scandal. Donald Sterling was the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers professional basketball franchise of the National Basketball Association. A leaking private conversation provoked his racist and disparaging statement on African Americans. As Billings, the author of ''The Dramatistic Implications of Burke's Guilt Redemption Cycle in the Donald Sterling Communication Crisis'' recognized and analyzed, that Sterlings act of trying to redeem his guilt was failed because of insufficient scapegoat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=J.|first=Billings, Molly|title=The Dramatistic Implications of Burke's Guilt Redemption Cycle in the Donald Sterling Communication Crisis|date=2015|publisher=The College at Brockport: State University of New York|url=https://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/honors/114/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
[[Gregory Clark (rhetorician)|Gregory Clark]] addressed the pentad to look into the sharing places in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Clark,G., &amp; Benson, T. W. (2004). Rhetorical Landscapes in America: Variations on a Theme from Kenneth Burke. Columbia, SC: U of South Carolina P.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that tourism sites, which work as the scene in pentad, have the tendency to differentiate American people from other culture and therefore established a sense of national identity in terms of a common culture.

=== Sociological field ===
Some researchers, such as Robert Wade Kenny, addressed the use of the Pentad and Dramatism to look into the field of sociology. As Kenny states, that the pentad can be used to examine sociology because, "sociology is predicated on the notion that human action is neither random nor mystical, and this sets up the initial condition necessary for an inquiry into the motivating principles that give rise to social order and disorder."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kbjournal.org/kenny|title=The Glamour of Motives: Applications of Kenneth Burke within the Sociological Field {{!}} KB Journal|website=www.kbjournal.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that sociology is a study of human action, human behavior and lifeworld "must be in play",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and the behaviors are motivated, so the dramatism elements can be applied to sociology field.

==  Critiques ==
Burke's Dramatism has been a great contribute to the communication field, which is praised by many researchers in this area. [[James Chesebro|Chesebro]] commented on Burke's work that “few critics have revealed the scope, imagination, insights, and dazzling concern for symbol using which Kenneth Burke possesses (Chesebro, 1993, p. xii) ” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jameswchesebro.wordpress.com/2002/11/21/a-burkeian-perspective-of-interpersonal-communication-a-confession-and-extension/|title=A Burkeian Perspective of Interpersonal Communication: A Confession and Extension|date=2002-11-21|work=James W. Chesebro|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] commented Burke as a leading critic in the US, that Burke is recognized "as a major influence on critics like Harold Bloom and writers like Ralph Ellison"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/20/arts/kenneth-burke-to-get-literature-medal.html|title=KENNETH BURKE TO GET LITERATURE MEDAL|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's work is widely praised and influenced a great amount of researchers as well as students in communication filed.

But there are indeed a lot of critiques on the work too. As [https://g.co/kgs/JF58NU Charles Kneupper] comments on Burke's work on this theory, that "i would concur that has been limitations in the application of dramatistic theory..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kneupper|first=Charles W.|date=1985|title=The Relation of Agency to Act in Dramatism: A Comment on "Burke's Act"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/376784|journal=College English|volume=47|issue=3|pages=305–308|doi=10.2307/376784}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory can be examined by four criteria below.

* Scope

The theory of Dramatism is criticized for being too broad in scope because it aims to explain how humans interact with each other using symbols, which been described as a general explanation that is almost has no meaning as some critics believe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Parsimony

Relatedly, some critique that the theory lacks parsimony, meaning it is unclear and too large to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Contemporary_Perspectives_on_Rhetoric.html?id=Ui7DQgAACAAJ|title=Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric|last=Foss|first=Karen A.|last2=Trapp|first2=Robert|date=1991-01-01|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=9780881335422|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Utility

Other theorists argue that Dramatism lacks [[utility]] because it leaves out topics of gender and culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Notably, Burke included women in his theory (unlike much of scholarship at the time), but feminist scholars, like Condit, found Burke's concepts inadequate to their critical concerns,&lt;ref&gt;Japp, P. M. (1999). 'Can This Marriage Be Saved?': Reclaiming Burke for Feminist Scholarship. In B. i. Brock (Ed.) , ''Kenneth Burke and the 21st Century'' (pp. 113-130). Albany, NY: State U of New York P.&lt;/ref&gt; by using the generic "man" to represent all people.

Dennis Brissett and Charles Edgley examine the utility of dramatism on different levels, which can be categorized as the following dimensions:&lt;ref name="Brissett"&gt;Brissett, D., &amp; Edgley, C. (Eds.). (2005). Life as theater: A dramaturgical sourcebook. Transaction Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;1. The dramaturgical self&lt;/u&gt;

Dramaturgical perspective is vividly used to analyze human individuality. It views individuality as more a social rather than a psychological phenomenon. The concept of a [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgical self]] was formulated by sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] was inspired by the theatre, and also finds roots in relations to Burke's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life|last=Goffman|first=Erving|publisher=Allen Lane|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the concept of dramaturgy ideates life as a metaphorical theater, differentiating from Burke's concept of life as a theater itself.

Some examples of classic research questions on the topic involve how people maximize or minimize the expressiveness, how one stage ideal self, the process of impression-management, etc. For example, Larson and Zemke described the roots of the [[ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] and patterning of temporal socialization which is drawn from biological rhythms, values and beliefs, work and social commitments, cultural beliefs and engagement in activity.&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;Larson, E. A., &amp; Zemke, R. (2003). Shaping the Temporal Patterns of our Lives: The Social Coordination of. Journal of Occupational Science, 10(2), 80-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;2. Motivation and drama&lt;/u&gt;

Motives play a crucial role in social interaction between an acting person and his or her validating audience. Within the [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgical]] frame, people are rationalizing. Scholars try to provide a way of understanding how the various identities which comprise the self are constructed. For example, Anderson and Swainson tried to find the answer of whether rape is motivated by sex or by power.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Swainson"&gt;Anderson, I., &amp; Swainson, V. (2001). Perceived motivation for rape: Gender differences in beliefs about female and male rape. Current Research in Social Psychology, 6(8), 107-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social relationships as drama

Dramatists also concern the ways in which people both facilitate and interfere with the ongoing behavior of others. The emphasis is on the expressive nature of the social bond. Some topics as role taking, role distance are discussed. For example, by analyzing public address, scholars examine why a speaker selects a certain strategy to identify with audience. For example, [[Orville Gilbert Brim, Jr.]] analyzed data to interpret how group structure and role learning influence children's understanding of gender.&lt;ref name="Brim"&gt;Brim, O. G. (1958). Family structure and sex role learning by children: A further analysis of Helen Koch's data. Sociometry, 21(1), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;3. Organizational dramas&lt;/u&gt;

In addition to focusing on the negotiated nature of social organization, [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgy]] emphasizes the manner in which the social order is expressed through social interaction, how social organization is enacted, featured and dramatized. Typical research topics include corporate realm, business influence on federal policy agenda, even funerals and religious themes. For example, by examining the decision making criteria of Business Angels, Baron and Marksman identified four social skills which contribute to entrepreneurial success: social perception; persuasion and social influence; social adaptability and impression management. They employ dramatism to show how these skills are critical in raising finance.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;Baron, R. A., &amp; Markman, G. D. (2000). Beyond social capital: How social skills can enhance entrepreneurs' success. The Academy of Management Executive, 14(1), 106-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;4. Political dramas&lt;/u&gt;

It is acknowledged that the political process has become more and more a theatrical, image-mongering, dramatic spectacle worthy of a show-business metaphor on a grand scale. Scholars study how dramaturgical materials create essential images by analyzing political advertising and campaigns, stagecraft-like diplomacy, etc. For example, Philip.E.Tetlock tried to answer why presidents became more complex in their thinking after winning the campaign. He found the reason is not presidents' own cognitive adjustment, but a means of [[impression management]].&lt;ref name="Philip"&gt;Philip E. Tetlock (1981).Pre- to Postelection Shifts in Presidential Rhetoric: Impression Management or Cognitive Adjustment? Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 41(2), 207-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feminist critiques ====

[[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist scholars]] also talked about our ability as a society to begin to think in new ways about sex and gender, to extent our language beyond duality to a broad "[[Humanism|humanity]]" and to "human beings".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Condit, C. M. (1992). Post-Burke: Transcending the Sub-Stance of Dramatism. ''The Quarterly Journal of Speech'', ''78''(3), 349-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Since "being" is a state in which women simply experience life as freely, consciously, and fully as possible, realizing that this is not only the purpose of life but a genuine place from which change can occur.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, K. A., &amp; White, C. L. (1999). 'Being' and the Promise of Trinity: A Feminist Addition to Burke's Theory of Dramatism. In B. i. Brock (Ed.) , ''Kenneth Burke and the 21st Century'' (pp. 99-111). Albany, NY: State U of New York P.&lt;/ref&gt; Condit also went on to criticize Burke for assuming culture as a hegemony, specifically in relation to Burke's application of guilt purging within cultures as necessitating victims.

Later scholars, such as Anne Caroline Crenshaw,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Anne Caroline|date=1992|title=The Rhetoric of Fetal Protection Policies: Toward a Feminist Dramatism|url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/docview/1555405281?pq-origsite=summon&amp;https://proquest.umi.com/login?COPT=REJTPUcyODcrNTRlNyszYjBmJklOVD0wJlZFUj0y&amp;clientId=5604|journal=niversity of Southern California|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; went on to note that Burke did identify gender relations in one instance in relation to his arguments on social hierarchies through his analysis of socio-sexual relations present in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare’s]] [[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]. However, this author notes that Burke’s work wasn’t a critique and examination of this relationship through dramatism, but rather that the theory of dramatism does give space to make such analyses. Furthermore, scholar Brenda Robinson Hancock used Burke’s dramatism to study women’s movements, specifically with identification as actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hancock|first=Brenda Robinson|date=1972-10-01|title=Affirmation by negation in the women's liberation movement|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00335637209383123|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=58|issue=3|pages=264–271|doi=10.1080/00335637209383123|issn=0033-5630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, Janet Brown,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Janet|date=1979|title=Kenneth Burke and the Mod Donna: The Dramatistic Method Applied to Feminist Criticism|url=|journal=Central States Speech Journa|volume=30|pages=250–61|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made use of Burke's pentad in relation to understanding and identifications of feminist literature. Despite these works and incorporation of Dramatism in feminist work, there remains the evidence that Burke did not use or intent his theory to account for gender.

==== Metaphorical or literal? ====
Another critique of the theory is to whether the theory exists as a metaphorical or literal theory.

Burke staunchly argued that his theory of dramatism is a literal theory, understanding reality as a literal stage with actors and enactment. However, future theorists, specifically Bernard Brock&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brock|first=Bernard L.|date=1985-03-01|title=Epistemology and ontology in Kenneth Burke's dramatism|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01463378509369585|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=33|issue=2|pages=94–104|doi=10.1080/01463378509369585|issn=0146-3373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert A. Simon|Herb Simons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kbjournal.org/content/revisiting-controversy-over-dramatism-literal|title=Revisiting the Controversy over Dramatism as Literal {{!}} KB Journal|website=www.kbjournal.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; went on to argue dramatism as metaphorical theory claiming that Burke’s idea that all the world's a stage is mere a tool of symbolic interaction that signals life as a drama. Of note, the reasoning for Burke to emphasize his theory as literal relates to the reasons to why others claim it to be metaphorical: the issue lies in the understanding of language’s power as a symbol itself.

'''Ega''', also known as '''Egwa''' and '''Diés''', is a language of uncertain affiliation within the [[Niger–Congo]] language family spoken in [[Ivory Coast]]. It does not appear to belong to any of the traditional branches of Niger–Congo. Though traditionally assumed to be one of the [[Kwa languages]], [[Roger Blench]] conservatively classifies it as a separate branch of the [[Atlantic–Congo]] family, pending a demonstration that it is actually related to the Kwa or [[Volta–Niger languages]].

The Ega people are increasing in number, though some are shifting to [[Dida language|Dida]] through intermarriage.

Ega has the full [[noun class]] system for which the [[Bantu languages]] are known.

An '''experimental language''' is a [[constructed language]] designed for [[linguistics]] research, often on the relationship between [[language and thought]].

One particular assumption having received much attention in fiction is popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].  The claim is that the structure of a language somehow affects the way its speakers perceive their world, either strongly, in which case "language determines thought" ([[linguistic determinism]]), or weakly, in which case "language influences thought" ([[linguistic relativity]]). (For a list of languages that are merely mentioned, see the relevant section in [[List of constructed languages]].)

The extreme case of the strong version of the hypothesis would be the idea that words have a power inherent to themselves such that their use determines not just our thoughts, but even that which our thoughts are about, i.e. reality itself. This idea, however, is more properly treated within [[ontology]] than linguistics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Languages exploring the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis==

===Constructed languages===
* [[Láadan]] was designed by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in her science fiction novel [[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|''Native Tongue'']]'','' about a patriarchal society in which the overriding priority of the oppressed women is the secret development of a "feminist" language, Láadan, to aid them in throwing off their shackles.
* [[Loglan]], by [[James Cooke Brown]], was designed for linguistic research with the specific goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. 
* [[Lojban]] is the successor of Loglan and has the same goals.
* [[Toki Pona]], by [[Sonja Elen Kisa]], is inspired by [[Taoist]] philosophy, among other things, and designed to shape the thought processes of its users in Zen-like fashion.

===Fictional languages===

====Named====
* ''[[Babel-17]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], is centered on a fictional language that denies its speakers independent thought, forcing them to think purely logical thoughts. This language is used as a weapon of war, because it is supposed to convert everyone who learns it to a traitor. In the novel, the language Babel-17 is likened to computer programming languages that do not allow errors or imprecise statements.
* [[The Culture#Language|Marain]], in [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[Culture series]]. The Culture believes (or perhaps has proved, or else actively made true) the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language affects society, and Marain was designed to exploit this effect. A related comment is made by the narrator in ''[[The Player of Games]]'' regarding gender-specific pronouns in English. Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language.
* [[Newspeak]], by [[George Orwell]] in his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', does not have any of the words expressing the ideas underlying a revolution with the idea that its speakers cannot revolt. All of the theory of Newspeak is aimed at eliminating such words. For example, ''bad'' has been replaced by ''ungood'', and the concept of "freedom" has been eliminated over time. According to the appendix on Newspeak, the result of the adoption of the language would be that "a heretical thought ... should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words."
* [[Pravic]] is one of the languages used in ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], that takes place partly on a world with an anarcho-communist society. Pravic contains little means for expressing possessive relationships, among other features.
* Tamarian, in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Darmok]]", is unintelligible to Starfleet's universal translators because it is too deeply rooted in local metaphor and consequently its sentences have no meaning to other civilizations.

====Unnamed====
* In ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', by [[Ayn Rand]], the World Council attempted to enforce collectivist thinking among the populace by removing from the language all words expressing individuality.
* In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', by [[Frank Herbert]], [[Lady Jessica]] (who has extensive linguistic training) encounters the [[Fremen]], the native people of Dune. She is shocked by the violence of their language, as she believes their word choices and language structure reflect a culture of enormous violence. Similarly, earlier in the novel, her late husband, Duke Leto, muses on how the nature of Imperial society is betrayed by "the precise delineations for treacherous death" in its language, the use of highly specific terms to describe different methods for delivering poison.
* In [[Gulf (Heinlein)|''Gulf'']], by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the characters are taught an artificial language which allows them to think logically and concisely by removing the "false to fact" linguistic constructs of existing languages.
* ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', by [[Jack Vance]], centers on an experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. The mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: "We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language." His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: "every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind."
* In ''Mud/Aurora'', by [[D.D. Storm]], society is divided in three classes speaking three different languages, designed to allow survival on a hostile, deserted world of a wrecked starship's crew and their descendants. The long-forgotten ship's linguist hid the true history of their world within the language spoken by the descendants of the commanding officers, the Sah.
* ''[[Snow Crash]]'', by [[Neal Stephenson]], explores the (controversial) concept of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] programming language for the [[brain stem]] which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter program which he called a [[nam-shub]] that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah, supposedly giving rise to the biblical story of the [[Tower of Babel]].
* In ''[[Story of Your Life]]'', by [[Ted Chiang]], learning the written language used by alien visitors to the Earth allows the person who learns the language to think in a different way, in which the past and future are illusions of conventional thought. This allows people who understand the language to see their entire life as a single unchangeable action, from past to future.
* In ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], Valentine Michael Smith is able to do things that most other humans cannot, and is unable to explain any of this in English. However, once others learn Martian, they start to develop the ability to do these things; those concepts could be explained only in Martian.
* ''[[The Unnamable (short story)|The Unnamable]]'', by [[H.P. Lovecraft]], explores the idea of whether or not someone can conceptualize something which cannot be described by any name.
* In ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the author discovers references in books to a universe of idealistic individuals whose languages have peculiarities that shape their idealism. For example, one of the language families lacks nouns, while another primarily uses monosyllabic adjectives to describe objects. As the story progresses the books become more and better known to the world at large, their philosophy starts influencing the real world, and Earth becomes the ideal world described in the books.

====Counterexamples====
* In ''[[The Citadel of the Autarch]]'', by [[Gene Wolfe]], one of the characters (an Ascian) speaks entirely in slogans, but is able to express deep and subtle meanings via context. The narrator, Severian, after hearing the Ascian speak, remarks that "The Ascian seemed to speak only in sentences he had learned by rote, though until he used each for the first time we had never heard them ... Second, I learned how difficult it is to eliminate the urge for expression. The people of Ascia were reduced to speaking only with their masters' voice; but they had made of it a new tongue, and I had no doubt, after hearing the Ascian, that by it he could express whatever thought he wished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Gene |year=1998 |title=The book of the new sun |publisher=SFBC |location=New York |page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  Name        = Expressive language disorder |
  ICD10       = {{ICD10|F|80|1|f|80}}
}}
'''Expressive language disorder''' is a [[communication disorder]] in which there are difficulties with verbal and written expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Expressive_language_disorder |title=Expressive language disorder |format= |work=The Better Health Channel (BHC) }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[specific language impairment]] characterized by an ability to use expressive [[spoken language]] that is markedly below the appropriate level for the [[mental age]], but with a [[language comprehension]] that is within normal limits.&lt;ref name = "icd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F80.1 |title= F80.1 Expressive language disorder |format= |work=ICD-10 Version:2010|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be problems with vocabulary, producing complex sentences, and remembering words,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001544.htm |title=Expressive language disorder - developmental |work=  MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there may or may not be abnormalities in [[Manner of articulation|articulation]].&lt;ref name = "icd" /&gt;

As well as present [[speech production]], very often, someone will have difficulty remembering things. This [[memory]] problem is only disturbing for speech; non-verbal or non-linguistically based memory will be unimpaired. An example of a child with expressive language disorder can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnRNeDtme0g here].

Expressive language disorder affects work and schooling in many ways. It is usually treated by specific speech therapy, and usually cannot be expected to go away on its own.

Expressive language disorder can be further classified into two groups: developmental expressive language disorder and acquired expressive language disorder. Developmental expressive language disorder currently has no known cause, is first observed when a child is learning to talk, is more common in boys than girls, and is much more common than the acquired form of the disorder. [[Expressive aphasia|Acquired expressive language disorder]] is caused by specific damage to the brain by a [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], or seizures.

Care must be taken to distinguish expressive language disorder from other [[communication disorder]]s, sensory-motor disturbances, [[intellectual disability]] and/or environmental deprivation (see DSM-IV-TR criterion D). These factors affect a person's speech and writing to certain predictable extents, and with certain differences.

Careful diagnosis is also important because "atypical language development can be a secondary characteristic of other physical and developmental problems that may first manifest as language problems".&lt;ref name="McLaughlin 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=McLaughlin MR |title=Speech and language delay in children |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=1183–8 |date=May 2011 |pmid=21568252|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2011/0515/p1183.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of language production==
{{Main|Speech production}}
[[Willem Levelt]] outlined the currently accepted theory of speech production. Words are produced after the concept waiting to be produced is conceptualized, related words are selected, encoded and the sound waves of speech are produced.&lt;ref name="Levelt 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levelt WJ |title=Spoken word production: a theory of lexical access |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=98 |issue=23 |pages=13464–71 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11698690 |pmc=60894 |doi=10.1073/pnas.231459498 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with language networks==
There is also a lot of debate about whether specific language impairments, such as expressive language disorder, are caused by deficits in grammar or by a deficit in processing language information.&lt;ref name="Joanisse 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Joanisse MF, Seidenberg MS |title=Specific language impairment: a deficit in grammar or processing? |journal=Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.) |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=240–7 |date=July 1998 |pmid=21244922 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01186-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an alternative hypothesis to the cause of SLIs has been posited, called the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis. The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis opines that we can explain language impairments due to abnormal development of brain structures that are involved in [[procedural memory]], our memories that remember how to perform different cognitive and motor tasks. The procedural memory system is associated with basal-ganglia circuits in the frontal lobe and further investigation of this particular hypothesis could aid in the development of a clinical neurological picture of what the underlying causes of SLI are.&lt;ref name="Ullman 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ullman MT, Pierpont EI |title=Specific language impairment is not specific to language: the procedural deficit hypothesis |journal=Cortex |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=399–433 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15871604 |doi= 10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70276-4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific studies of speech and language==

Some of the earliest neuroscientific discoveries were related to the discovery that damage to certain areas of the brain related to impairments in language, such as the discovery of [[Wernicke's area]] and [[Broca's area]]. Lesions in these parts of the brain impair language comprehension and language production, respectively. [[Paul Broca]] was the first to note that the left hemisphere of the brain appeared to be localized for language function, particularly for right handed patients. Modern neuroscientific research has verified this, though language may be lateralizaed to the right hemisphere in some right-handed individuals.&lt;ref name="Knecht 2000"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Knecht S, Deppe M, Dräger B, etal |title=Language lateralization in healthy right-handers |journal=Brain |volume=123 |issue= 1|pages=74–81 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10611122 |doi= 10.1093/brain/123.1.74 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pujol 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pujol J, Deus J, Losilla JM, Capdevila A |title=Cerebral lateralization of language in normal left-handed people studied by functional MRI |journal=Neurology |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=1038–43 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10102425 |doi=10.1212/WNL.52.5.1038 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental verbal dyspraxia===

In 1990, it was reported that the several generations of the [[KE family]] suffered from [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]] and [[Apraxia#Types|orofacial praxis]] that were inherited in a typical [[autosomal dominant]] pattern.&lt;ref name="Hurst 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hurst JA, Baraitser M, Auger E, Graham F, Norell S |title=An extended family with a dominantly inherited speech disorder |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=352–5 |date=April 1990 |pmid=2332125 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1990.tb16948.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis traced this inheritance pattern back to mutations in the FOXP2 genes.&lt;ref name="Vargha-Khadem 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liégeois 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liégeois F, Baldeweg T, Connelly A, Gadian DG, Mishkin M, Vargha-Khadem F |title=Language fMRI abnormalities associated with FOXP2 gene mutation |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1230–7 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14555953 |doi=10.1038/nn1138 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have allowed scientists to begin to investigate how changes to one gene can alter human communication.

FOXP2 is the first gene that has been identified that is specifically linked to speech and language production. Mutant alleles of the normal [[FOXP2]] gene have been found to be the cause of severe speech impairments.&lt;ref name="Vargha-Khadem 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vargha-Khadem F, Gadian DG, Copp A, Mishkin M |title=FOXP2 and the neuroanatomy of speech and language |journal=Nat. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=131–8 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15685218 |doi=10.1038/nrn1605 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/losterho/varghakhadem2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific language impairment===
{{Main|Specific language impairment}}
Neuroimaging techniques, such as structural and [[functional MRI]], found no significant differences between individuals with SLI and normal controls. However, more subtle and sophisticated techniques, such as [[voxel-based morphometry]] studies have allowed researchers to identify [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] abnormalities in neural volume in areas of the brain associated with motor functions, such as the caudate nucleus, in the affected members of the KE family when compared to the unaffected family members. This volume reduction showed a high correlation between reduced volume and tests of [[oral praxis]], supporting the idea that odd development of the caudate nucleus is related to the problems in motor control observed in the KE family.&lt;ref name="Vargha-Khadem 2005"/&gt;

Due to the vague nature of the diagnosis of expressive language disorder, there is little specific scientific research that we can currently locate. A larger body of research exists around neuroscientific studies with children diagnosed with a specific language impairment (SLI). fMRI studies have shown that children with SLI have a significantly smaller left hemispheric pars triangularis (Broca's area) and asymmetry of dominance of language structures, as opposed to the more typical left hemisphere dominance.&lt;ref name="Gauger 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gauger LM, Lombardino LJ, Leonard CM |title=Brain morphology in children with specific language impairment |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1272–84 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9430748 |doi= 10.1044/jslhr.4006.1272|url=http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/content/abstract/40/6/1272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are beginning to elucidate differences in activation patterns in children with SLIs using neuroimaging techniques to capture brain activity while performing different cognitive tasks. A major observation is lack of left hemisphere lateralization in major language structures such as the inferior frontal gyrus-opercularis, inferior frontal gyrus-triangularis, supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. The same study reported hypoactivation and hyper activation of other brain regions - the supramarginal junction  and anterior insula, respectively.&lt;ref name="de Guibert 2011"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=de Guibert C, Maumet C, Jannin P, etal |title=Abnormal functional lateralization and activity of language brain areas in typical specific language impairment (developmental dysphasia) |journal=Brain |volume=134 |issue=Pt 10 |pages=3044–58 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21719430 |doi=10.1093/brain/awr141 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other in-depth imaging studies report finding previously undiagnosed lesions in the brains of children with well-characterized developmental language development.&lt;ref name="Webster 2008"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Webster RI, Erdos C, Evans K, etal |title=Neurological and magnetic resonance imaging findings in children with developmental language impairment |journal=J. Child Neurol. |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=870–7 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18660471 |doi=10.1177/0883073808315620 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these findings strongly suggest that language impairments are the result of an underlying neurological defect in an area of the brain related to language.

Studies looking at long-term outcomes for individuals with specific language impairments such as expressive language disorder track these individuals from childhood to adulthood. As Whitehouse and his colleagues &lt;ref name="Whitehouse 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitehouse AJ, Watt HJ, Line EA, Bishop DV |title=Adult psychosocial outcomes of children with specific language impairment, pragmatic language impairment and autism |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=511–28 |year=2009 |pmid=19340628 |pmc=2835860 |doi=10.1080/13682820802708098 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest, "When childhood language problems persist into adulthood, they can have far reaching consequences in terms of academic, social and vocational outcomes." These researchers found that children diagnosed with an SLI would have persistent problems with language and are more likely to pursue vocational training rather than university, thereby avoiding professions requiring high levels of literacy. A lower socioeconomic status was also noted by adults who were diagnosed with an SLI as a child. Whitehouse &lt;ref name="Whitehouse 2009"/&gt; also reported that these adults had more difficulties in establishing friendships, most likely due to a decreased ability to express themselves socially.

==Current educational interventions for students with an SLI==

Specific language impairments are often secondary characteristics of other disorders such as [[autism spectrum disorder]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. In these cases, issues with speech and language are often not treated specifically, but rather attention is given to the primary complaint. Due to the high correlation of an SLI with other disorders, it is difficult to tell the difference between "pure SLI" or language impairments due to the presence of another disorder.&lt;ref name="Van Balkom, Verhoeven, 2004"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hans Van Balkom |author2=Verhoeven, Ludo Th |title=Classification of developmental language disorders: theoretical issues and clinical implications |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-8058-4122-9 |oclc=803128031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus and attention on the need for effective literacy instruction in the current educational climate is large. It is widely recognized that literacy needs to be taught across all curricula and verbal fluency correlates positively academic achievement. Literacy strategies are now being taught in an inclusive manner, rather than the traditional pull-out system, it is assumed that successful teaching strategies for high needs students are good for all students. Basic principles for interventions for students with a specific language impairment follow - the necessity to set specific goals, to manipulate the classroom environment and curricula so that there are many opportunities to use grammar effectively, the importance of consistently modelling high quality speech, the use of a wide variety of text and literature, and to value comprehension as the most important goal for students to achieve.&lt;ref name="Fey 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fey ME, Long SH, Finestack LH |title=Ten principles of grammar facilitation for children with specific language impairments |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=3–15 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12680809 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2003/048) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no current cure-all intervention for students with SLIs, however, this is an ever expanding field of research.

==Special education coding==

Students diagnosed with an expressive language disability usually qualify for extra educational supports and assistance in school.

===In Alberta schools===
An expressive language disability or delay in kindergarten age children is classified as a Communication Disability/Delay under a Code 30. If there is no marked improvement in the child's ability to express themselves verbally once the student enters Grade 1, a child can be given a Code 57 for a Communication Disability. This diagnosis must be given from a Speech-Language Pathologist  in order for the child to receive continued special education funding.&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Education Special Education Coding Criteria 2011/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10414">In [[martial arts]], the terms '''hard''' and '''soft''' technique denote how forcefully a defender martial artist counters the [[force]] of an attack in [[weapons|armed]] and [[unarmed combat]]. In the [[Origins of Asian martial arts|East Asian martial arts]], the corresponding '''hard technique''' and '''soft technique''' terms are [[wiktionary:硬|硬]] (pinyin yìng, Japanese '''gō''') and [[wiktionary:柔|柔]] (pinyin róu, Japanese '''jū'''), hence [[Goju-ryu]] (hard-soft school), [[Shorinji Kempo]] principles of ''go-ho'' ("hard method") and ''ju-ho'' ("soft method"), [[Jujutsu]] (“art of softness”) and [[Judo]] (“gentle way”).

In European martial arts the same scale applies, especially in the [[Germany|German]] style of grappling and [[sword]]play dating from the 14th century (''e.g.'', the [[German school of fencing]]); the use of the terms hard and soft are otherwise translated as "strong" and "weak."  In later European martial arts the scale becomes less of a philosophic concept and more of a scientific approach to where two swords connect upon one another and the options applicable to each in the circumstance, parting further from the original meaning as time went along.

Regardless of origins and styles "hard and soft" can be seen as simply "opposing or yielding"; each has its application and must be used in its own way, and each makes use of specific principles of timing and [[biomechanics]].

In addition to describing a physical technique applied with minimal force, "soft" also sometimes refers to elements of a discipline which are viewed as less purely physical; for example, martial arts that are said to be "[[internal styles]]" are sometimes also known as "soft styles", for their focus on mental techniques or spiritual pursuits.

==Hard technique==
A '''hard technique''' meets force with force, either with a linear, head-on force-blocking technique, or by diagonally cutting the strike with one's force.  Although hard techniques require greater strength for successful execution, it is the mechanics of the technique that accomplish the defense. Examples are:

*A [[kickboxing]] low [[kick]] aimed to break the attacker's leg.
*A [[Karate]] block aimed to break or halt the attacker's arm.

Hard techniques can be used in offense, defense, and counter-offense. They are affected by footwork and skeletal alignment. For the most part, hard techniques are direct. The key point of a hard technique is interrupting the flow of attack: in counter-offense they look to break the attack and in offense they are direct and committed blows or throws. Hard technique use muscle more than soft techniques.

==Soft technique==
{{further|Tai sabaki}}
[[File:Taisabaki.svg|thumb|right|Tai sabaki step diagram, 180-degree.]]

The goal of the '''soft technique''' is deflecting the attacker’s force to his or her disadvantage, with the defender exerting minimal force and requiring minimal strength.&lt;ref name="Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fu |first=Zhongwen |title=Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan |origyear=1996|year=2006 |publisher=Blue Snake Books |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-58394-152-5&lt;!-- (trade paper)--&gt; |others=Louis Swaine}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a soft technique, the defender uses the attacker's [[force]] and [[momentum]] against him or her, by leading the attack(er) in a direction to where the defender will be [[tai sabaki|advantageously positioned]] (tai sabaki) and the attacker off balance; a seamless movement then effects the appropriate soft technique. In some styles of martial art like [[Wing Chun]], a series of progressively difficult, two-student training drills, such as [[pushing hands]] or [[Wing Chun#Chi sao|sticky hands]], teach to exercise the soft-technique(s); hence:

(1) The defender leads the attack by redirecting the attacker's forces against him or her, or away from the defender — instead of meeting the attack with a [[Blocking techniques|block]]. The mechanics of soft technique defenses usually are circular: ''Yielding'' is meeting the force with no resistance, like a projectile glancing off a surface without damaging it. Another example could be: an [[Aikido]] check/block to an attacker's arm, which re-directs the incoming energy of the blow.

[[File:Jujitsu sacrifice throw edited.jpg|right|thumb|A ''tomoenage'' front sacrifice throw used against a front-pushing attacker.]]

(2) The soft technique usually is applied when the attacker is off-balance, thus the defender achieves the "maximum efficiency" ideal posited by [[Kano Jigoro]] (1860–1938), the founder of [[judo]]. The [[T'ai chi ch'uan|Taijiquan]] (''T'ai chi ch'uan'') histories report "a force of four [[taels]] being able to move a thousand [[Catty|catties]]", referring to the principle of ''Taiji'' — a moving mass can seem weightless. Soft techniques — throws, armlocks, etc. — might resemble hard martial art techniques, yet are distinct because their application requires minimal force. (see [[kuzushi]])

* In [[Fencing]], with a [[Parry (fencing)|parry]], the defender guides or checks the attacker's sword away from himself, rather than endure the force of a direct block; it likely is followed by [[riposte]] and [[counter-riposte]].
* In Classical Fencing, other techniques appear in all forms of swordplay which fall into the soft category, the most obvious being the disengage where the fencer or swordsman uses the pressure of his opponent to disengage and change lines on his opponent giving him an advantage in the bind.
* In Bare-Knuckle Boxing or [[Boxing|Pugilism]], with a parry, the defender guides or checks the attacker’s blow away from himself, attempting to cause the attacker to over commit to his blow and allow an easy [[riposte]] and [[counter-riposte]].
*  In [[Judo]] and [[Jujutsu]] when the attacker (uke) pushes towards the defender (tori), the tori drops under the uke, whilst lifting the uke over himself, effecting the [[Tomoe Nage]] throw with one of his legs. The technique is categorized as a "front sacrifice technique" in [[judo]] and [[jujutsu]] styles. The push from the uke can be direct, or it can be a response to a push from the tori.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* With martial arts styles such as T'ien Ti Tao Ch'uan-shu P'ai the soft style is also in keeping with the Taoist philosophy, the idea that the technique can also be applied in mental terms as well as physical.

Soft techniques can be used in offense but are more likely to appear in defense and counter offense. Much like hard techniques they are effected by foot work and skeletal alignment. Where a hard technique in defense often aims to interrupt the flow of attack; a soft technique aims to misdirect it, move around it or draw it into over commitment, in counter offense a soft technique may appear as a slip or a vault or simply using the momentum of a technique against the user. Soft techniques in offense would usually only include feints and pulling motions but the definition and categorization may change from one art form to another.

Soft techniques are also characterized as being circular in nature and considered internal (using [[Qi]] (Chinese) or [[Qi|ki]] (Japanese and Korean)) by martial arts such as [[t'ai chi ch'uan]], [[hapkido]] and [[aikido]].

==Principle of ''Jū''==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
The '''principle of''' {{nihongo|'''Ju'''|[[wiktionary:柔|柔]]|Jū, Yawara}} underlies all classical [[Bujutsu]] methods and was adopted by the developers of the [[Budō]] disciplines. Acting according to the principle of Jū, the classical warrior could intercept and momentarily control his enemy's blade when attacked, then, in a flash, could counter-attack with a force powerful enough to cleave armor and kill the foe. The same principle of Jū permitted an unarmed exponent to [[kuzushi|unbalance]] and hurl his foe to the ground.
Terms like "[[Jujutsu|Jūjutsu]]" and "Yawara" made the principle of Jū the all-pervading one in methods cataloged under these terms. That principle was rooted in the concept of pliancy or flexibility, as understood in both a mental and a physical context. To apply the principle of Jū, the exponent had to be both mentally and physically capable of adapting himself to whatever situation his adversary might impose on him.

There are two aspects of the principle of Jū that are in constant operation, both interchangeable and inseparable. One aspect is that of "yielding", and is manifest in the exponent's actions that accept the enemy's force of attack, rather than oppose him by meeting his force directly with an equal or greater force, when it is advantageous to do so. It is economical in terms of energy to accept the foe's force by intercepting and warding it off without directly opposing it; but the tactic by which the force of the foe is dissipated may be as forcefully made as was the foe's original action.

The principle of Jū is incomplete at this point because yielding is essentially only a neutralization of the enemy's force. While giving way to the enemy's force of attack there must instantly be applied an action that takes advantage of the enemy, now occupied with his attack, in the form of a counterattack.
This second aspect of the principle of Jū makes allowance for situations in which yielding is impossible because it would lead to disaster. In such cases "resistance" is justified. But such opposition to the enemy's actions is only momentary and is quickly followed by an action based on the first aspect of Jū, that of yielding.

==Distinction from "external and internal"==
{{Further|External and internal (Chinese martial arts)}}

There is disagreement among different [[schools of Chinese martial arts]] about how the two concepts of "Hard/Soft" and "External/Internal" apply to their styles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Among styles that this terminology is applied to, traditional [[T'ai chi ch'uan|Taijiquan]] equates the terms while maintaining several finer shades of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/martial-arts/faq/ The martial arts FAQ], built up over years of discussion on rec.martial.arts. In part one, there is an entry for hard vs soft and internal vs external.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harishankar Parsai''' (22 August 1924 – 10 August 1995) was a [[Hindi]] writer. He was a noted satirist and humorist of modern Hindi literature and is known for his simple and direct style. He wrote [[vyangya]] (hindi satire) articles. 

He was born in Jamani village near [[Itarsi]] in [[Hoshangabad district]], Madhya Pradesh. He completed his M.A. in Hindi from R.T.M. [[Nagpur University]]. After pursuing writing along with his service for some time, he quit his job and took writing as a full-time career. He settled in [[Jabalpur]] (M.P) and started a literature magazine called ''Vasudha''. Despite it being highly praised, he had to stop the magazine after the publication suffered economic losses.&lt;ref&gt;Date of birth 22 August 1924, per Manas Publishing, in Inspector Matateen on The Moon&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsai died on 10 August 1995 in [[Jabalpur]]. According to ''[[The Hindu]]'', by the time of his death, Parsai had revolutionised the art of satire writing in Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/nobodys-cheerleader/article7566281.ece Nobody's Cheerleader, ''The Hindu'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He won [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1982, for his satire, "Viklaang Shraddha Ka Daur" 'विकलांग श्रद्धा का दौर'&lt;ref name=sahitya&gt;[http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa10306.htm#hindi Awards 1955–2007] [[Sahitya Akademi]] Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hari Shankar Parsai used to give answers of readers in a column "POOCHHIYE PARSAI SE" in a Hindi News paper DESHBANDHU published from [[Raipur]] and [[Jabalpur]].
*A collection of 21 selected stories translated into English by C. M. Naim was published in 1994: ''Inspector Matadeen on the Moon'' (Manas Books, Chennai).

==Mechanism of protective effect==
One of the most pernicious and irreparable types of [[oxidative damage]] inflicted by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) upon biomolecules involves the carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage (hydrogen abstraction). Intriguingly, the biomolecules most damageable by this type of damage belong to the group of [[essential nutrient]]s (10 out of 20 amino acids; nucleosides at certain conditions (conditionally essential); all [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s). In theory, replacing hydrogen with deuterium "reinforces" the bond due to the [[kinetic isotope effect]], and such reinforced biomolecules taken up by the body will be more resistant to ROS.&lt;ref name=pmid17378752&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/rej.2006.0506 |pmid=17378752 |title=Reactive Oxygen Species, Isotope Effect, Essential Nutrients, and Enhanced Longevity |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=47–59 |year=2007 |last1=Shchepinov |first1=Mikhail S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Typographic Style''', also known as the '''Swiss Style''', is a [[graphic design]] style that emerged in Russia, the Netherlands, and Germany in the 1920s and was developed by designers in [[Switzerland]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lessons From Swiss Style Graphic Design – Smashing Magazine|url = http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/lessons-from-swiss-style-graphic-design/|website = Smashing Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design as a part of the modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1080070/International-Typographic-Style International Typographic Style]&lt;/ref&gt; Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]], [[sans-serif]] typefaces like [[Akzidenz Grotesk]], and [[flush left]], ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured [[typography]] as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Arts &amp; Entertainment: graphic design, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design THE INTERNATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC STYLE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalposter.com/about-poster-art/international-typographic.aspx International Poster Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day.

==History==
The style emerged from a desire to represent information objectively, free from the influence of associated meaning. In 1896 the [[Berthold Type Foundry]] released its [[Akzidenz Grotesk]] Typeface in an attempt to capture an objective style, and from that point the International Typographic style evolved as a modernist graphic movement that sought to convey messages clearly and in a universally straightforward manner. Two major Swiss design schools are responsible for the early years of International Typographic Style. A graphic design technique based on grid-work that began in the 19th century became inspiration for modifying the foundational course at the [[Schule für Gestaltung Basel|Basel School of Design]] in 1908. Shortly thereafter, in 1918 Ernst Keller became a professor at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] and began developing a graphic design and typography course. He did not teach a specific style to his students, rather he taught a philosophy of style that dictated “the solution to the design problem should emerge from its content.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the solution to the design emerging from the problem itself was a reaction to previous artistic processes focused on "beauty for the sake of beauty" or "the creation of beauty as a purpose in and of itself". Keller’s work uses simple geometric forms, vibrant colors and evocative imagery to further elucidate the meaning behind each design. Other early pioneers include Théo Ballmer and [[Max Bill]].

The 1950s saw the distillation of International Typographic Style elements into sans-serif font families such as [[Univers]]. Univers paved the way for [[Max Miedinger]] and collaborator Edouard Hoffman to design the typeface Neue Haas Grotesk, which would be later renamed [[Helvetica]]. The goal with Helvetica was to create a pure typeface that could be applied to longer texts and that was highly readable. The movement began to coalesce after a periodical publication began in 1959 titled New Graphic Design, which was edited by several influential designers who played major roles in the development of International Typographic Style. The format of the journal represented many of the important elements of the style—visually demonstrating the content—and was published internationally, thus spreading the movement beyond Switzerland’s borders. One of the editors, [[Josef Müller-Brockmann]], “sought an absolute and universal form of graphic expression through objective and impersonal presentation, communicating to the audience without the interference of the designer’s subjective feelings or propagandist techniques of persuasion.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Müller-Brockmann’s feature large photographs as objective symbols meant to convey his ideas in particularly clear and powerful ways.

After World War II international trade began to increase and relations between countries grew steadily stronger. Typography and design were crucial to helping these relationships progress—clarity, objectivity, region-less glyphs, and symbols are essential to communication between international partners. International Typographic Style found its niche in this communicative climate and expanded further beyond Switzerland, to America.

One of the first American designers to integrate Swiss design with his own was [[Rudolph de Harak]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of International Typographic Style on de Harak’s own works can be seen in his many book jacket designs for McGraw-Hill publishers in the 1960s. Each jacket shows the book title and author, often aligned with a grid—flush left, ragged-right. One striking image covers most of the jacket, elucidating the theme of the particular book. International Typographic Style was embraced by corporations and institutions in America from the 1960s on, for almost two decades. One institution particularly devoted to the style was [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated movements ==
During 1900s other design based movements were formulating, influencing and influenced by the International Typographic movement. These movements emerged within the relationships between artistic fields including architecture, literature, graphic design, painting, sculpting etc.

[[De Stijl]] was a Dutch artistic movement that saw prominence in the period between 1917-1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = .. :: The International Typographic Style Timeline :: ..|url = http://smearedblackink.com/swiss_style_timeline/|website = smearedblackink.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as neoplasticism, this artistic strategy sought to reflect a new Utopian ideal of spiritual harmony and order. It was a form of pure abstraction through reduction to the essentials of form and colour, employing vertical and horizontal layouts using only black and white and primary colors. Proponents of this movement included painters like [[Piet Mondrian]], Vilmes Huszar and Bart van der Hoff as well as architects like [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff|Robert van't Hoff]] and [[Jacobus_Oud|J.J.P. Oud]].

[[Bauhaus]] was a German-based movement that emphasized purity of geometry, absence of ornamentation and the motto 'form follows function'. This was a school of thought that combined craftsmaking with the fine arts and was founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. The goal was to work towards the essence of the form follows function relationship to facilitate a style that could be applied to all design problems; the International Style.

[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] was an art/architectural philosophy that emerged from Russia in 1920s. The style develops by assorted mechanical objects that are combined into abstract mobile structural forms. Hallmarks of the movement include geometric reduction, photo-montage and simplified palettes.

[[Suprematism]], which arose in 1913, is another Russian art movement similarly focused on the simplification and purity of geometric forms to speak to values of spirituality.

All of these movements including the International Typographic styles are defined by reductionist purity as a visually compelling strategy of conveying messages through geometric and color based hierarchies.

== Notes on theory ==
The Bauhaus mantra of 'form follows function' applies to design in the spirit of the International Typographic movement. The movement was structured by focusing on detail, precision, craft skill, systems of education and approach, technical training, high standards of print and the innovative application of lettering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Swiss Style: The Principles, the Typefaces &amp; the Designers - Print Magazine|url = http://www.printmag.com/typography/swiss-style-principles-typefaces-designers/|website = Print Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory revolves around critically approaching the development of a system specific to the design problem presented.

For example, a father of the style Ernst Keller argued that a design solution should always be respectful of its content.

A good comparison is the structure that defines a math problem. You only use specific equations for specific types of problems. You similarly only can work through these equations in specific ways. With the International Typographic and other related philosophies, a design context is critical to deriving a response.

==Characteristics of style==
Each design done with International Typographic Style in mind begins with a mathematical grid, because a grid is the “most legible and harmonious means for structuring information.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Text is then applied, most often aligned flush left, ragged right. Fonts chosen for the text are sans serif, a type style believed to “[express] the spirit of a more progressive age” by early designers in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Objective photography is another design element meant to present information clearly, and without any of the persuading influences of propaganda or commercial advertising. Such a strong focus on order and clarity is drawn from early pioneers of the movement believing that design is a “socially useful and important activity... the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society.” &lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13119">In [[mathematics]], the '''Jacobian conjecture''' is a famous problem on [[polynomial]]s in several [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. It was first posed in 1939 by [[Ott-Heinrich Keller]]. It was widely publicized by [[Shreeram Abhyankar]], as an example of a question in the area of [[algebraic geometry]] that requires little beyond a knowledge of [[calculus]] to state.

The Jacobian conjecture is notorious for the large number of attempted proofs that turned out to contain subtle errors. As of 2018, there are no plausible claims to have proved it. Even the two-variable case has resisted all efforts. There are no known compelling reasons for believing it to be true, and according to {{harvtxt|van den Essen|1997}} there are some suspicions that the conjecture is in fact false for large numbers of variables.  The Jacobian conjecture is number 16 in [[Smale's problems|Stephen Smale's 1998 list of Mathematical Problems for the Next Century]].

==The Jacobian determinant==
Let ''N'' &gt; 1 be a fixed integer and consider  polynomials ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; in variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; with [[coefficient]]s  in a field ''k''. Then we define a [[vector-valued function]] ''F'': ''k&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; by setting:

: ''F''(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''c''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;),..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''c''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;)).

(''F'' is a [[polynomial mapping]].)

The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] of ''F'', denoted by ''J&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'', is defined as the [[determinant]] of the ''N'' × ''N'' [[Jacobian matrix]] consisting of the [[partial derivative]]s of ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;J_F = \left | \begin{matrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial X_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial X_N} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_N}{\partial X_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_N}{\partial X_N} \end{matrix} \right |,&lt;/math&gt;

then ''J&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' is itself a polynomial function of the ''N'' variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Formulation of the conjecture==
It follows from the multivariable chain rule that if ''F'' has a polynomial inverse function ''G'': ''k&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ''k&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'', then ''J&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a polynomial reciprocal, so is a nonzero constant. The Jacobian conjecture is the following partial converse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Jacobian conjecture:''' If ''J&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a non-zero constant and ''k'' has [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0, then ''F'' has an inverse function ''G'': ''k&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ''k&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''G'' is [[regular map (algebraic geometry)|regular]] (in the sense that its components are polynomials).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to {{Harvtxt|van den Essen|1997}}, the problem was first conjectured by Keller in 1939 for the limited case of two variables and integer coefficients (which has been proved — see {{Section link||Results}}).  

The obvious analogue of the Jacobian conjecture fails if ''k'' has characteristic ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 even for 1 variable. The characteristic of a field must be prime, so it is at least 2. The polynomial {{math|''x'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} has derivative {{math|1 − ''px x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} which is 1 (because ''px'' is 0) but it has no inverse function. However, {{harvtxt|Adjamagbo|1995}} suggested extending the Jacobian conjecture to characteristic {{nowrap|''p'' &gt; 0}} by adding the hypothesis that ''p'' does not divide the degree of the field extension {{nowrap|''k''(''X'') / ''k''(''F'')}}.

The condition ''J&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ 0 is related to the [[inverse function theorem]] in [[multivariable calculus]]. In fact for smooth functions (and so in particular for polynomials) a smooth local inverse function to ''F'' exists at every point where ''J&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' is non-zero. For example, the map x → ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has a smooth global inverse, but the inverse is not polynomial.

==Results==
{{harvtxt|Wang|1980}} proved the Jacobian conjecture  for polynomials of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] 2, and {{harvtxt|Bass|Connell|Wright|1982}} showed that the general case follows from the special case where the polynomials are of degree&amp;nbsp;3, or even  more specifically, of cubic homogeneous type, meaning  of the form ''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), where each ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is either zero or a homogeneous cubic. {{harvtxt|Drużkowski|1983}}  showed that one may further assume that  the map is of cubic linear type, meaning that the nonzero ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are cubes of homogeneous linear polynomials.  These reductions introduce additional variables and so are not available for fixed ''N''.

{{harvtxt|Connell|van den Dries|1983}} proved that if the Jacobian conjecture is false, then it has a counterexample with integer coefficients and Jacobian determinant 1.  In consequence, the Jacobian conjecture is true either for all fields of characteristic 0 or for none.  For fixed ''N'', it is true if it holds for at least one algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.

Let ''k''[''X''] denote the polynomial ring {{nowrap|''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} and ''k''[''F''] denote the ''k''-subalgebra generated by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  For a given ''F'', the Jacobian conjecture is true if, and only if,  {{nowrap|''k''[''X''] {{=}} ''k''[''F'']}}. Keller (1939) proved the birational case, that is, where the two fields ''k''(''X'') and ''k''(''F'') are equal. The case where ''k''(''X'') is a Galois extension of ''k''(''F'') was proved by {{harvtxt|Campbell|1973}} for complex maps and in general by {{harvtxt|Razar|1979}} and, independently, {{harvtxt|Wright|1981}}. {{harvtxt|Moh|1983}} checked the conjecture for polynomials of degree at most 100 in two variables.

{{harvtxt|de Bondt|van den Essen|2005, 2005}} and {{harvtxt|Drużkowski|2005}} independently showed that it is enough to prove the Jacobian Conjecture for complex maps of cubic homogeneous type  with a symmetric Jacobian matrix, and further showed that the conjecture holds for maps of cubic linear type with a symmetric Jacobian matrix, over any field of characteristic 0.

The strong real Jacobian conjecture was that a real polynomial map with a nowhere vanishing Jacobian determinant has a smooth global inverse.  That is equivalent to asking whether such a map is topologically a proper map, in which case it is a covering map of a simply connected manifold, hence invertible. {{harvs|txt|last=Pinchuk|first= Sergey|year=1994}} constructed two variable counterexamples of total degree 25 and higher.

It is well-known that the [[Dixmier conjecture]] implies the Jacobian conjecture (see Bass et al. 1982). Conversely, it is shown by [[#{{harvid|Tsuchimoto|2005}}|Yoshifumi Tsuchimoto (2005)]], and independently by {{harvs|txt | last1=Belov-Kanel | first1=Alexei | last2=[[Maxim Kontsevich|Kontsevich]] | first2=Maxim |year=2007 }}, that the Jacobian conjecture for 2N variables implies the [[Dixmier conjecture]] for N dimension. A self-contained and purely algebraic proof of the last implication is also given by  {{harvs|txt|first=P. K.|last1= Adjamagbo|authorlink1=Pascal Kossivi Adjamagbo|first2= A.|last2= van den Essen|year=2007}} who also proved in the same paper that these two conjectures is equivalent to Poisson conjecture.

'''Jennifer Hornsby''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 1951) is a British philosopher with interests in the philosophies of [[philosophy of mind|mind]], [[philosophy of action|action]], [[philosophy of language|language]], as well as [[feminist philosophy]].  She is currently a professor at the School of Philosophy, [[Birkbeck, University of London]].  She is well known for her opposition to orthodoxy in current analytic philosophy of mind, and for her use of [[J. L. Austin]]'s [[Speech Act]] Theory to look at the effects of pornography.

==Education and career==

Hornsby earned her PhD from the [[University of Cambridge]] under the direction of [[Bernard Williams]]. She also earned a BA and MPhil from Oxford and London, respectively. She taught at the University of Oxford for 17 years before moving to [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, London]]. She was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1996 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/philosophy/our-staff/academics/hornsby Hornsby's Profile] at Birkbeck College, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Hornsby's work focuses primarily on the philosophies of [[philosophy of mind|mind]], [[philosophy of action|action]], [[philosophy of language|language]], and [[feminist philosophy]].

===Actions===

Hornsby's action theory is significantly influenced by the philosophy of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].  In her book ''Actions'' (1980), she argues that actions are events occurring beneath the surface of the skin. The argument for this turns on an ambiguity in the slogan "all actions are bodily movements". The ambiguity stems from the fact that 'move' is one of a class of verbs that can occur either transitively or intransitively. Nominal expressions containing such verbs are therefore ambiguous: for example, 'the movement of the flag' can refer either to the action of someone's moving the flag or to the resultant movement of the flag. As we only ever answer a question about what someone did by using transitive verbs --- e.g. 'Jack moved his arm', not 'Jack's arm moved' (unless the latter is taken to imply that the former is true) --- the slogan "all actions are bodily movements" is only true if 'movement' is read transitively. This ambiguity noted, Hornsby then points out that if A V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;-s B, then A caused B to V&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; ('&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;' and '&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;' serving to distinguish between transitive and intransitive uses of the relevant verbs). If Jack raised&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; the flag, Jack caused the flag to rise&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;. As causes and effects must be distinct, we must therefore also distinguish between Jack's raising&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; his arm from Jack's arm's rising&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;, the former causing the latter. So actions are bodily movements&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, which cause bodily movements&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;. The final move is to claim that we know from physiology that the causes of bodily movements&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; are events that occur beneath the surface of the skin. Therefore, actions occur beneath the surface of the skin.

This claim is combined with another: that the most basic description, in the causal sense of 'basic', of an action is as a trying. This arises from accepting a coarse-grained account of the individuation of events, according to which events are particulars that can be described in many different ways. The descriptions are distinguished by the effects of the described event in terms of which they are picked out. For example, the event of my slamming the door may be identical to the event of my waking the cat. The first description picks out the event by reference to the event of the door's being slammed. The second description picks out the event by reference to the event of the cat's waking. The question then is, Is there a description of the events which are actions that picks them out without reference to any effects? Hornsby's answer is that we can describe actions as tryings. I can try to raise my arm and, if successful, my arm will rise. (Note, though, that not all tryings are actions, only the successful ones.)

==Honours==
Hornsby is a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104 |title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag |publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=16 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109221405/http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104 |archivedate= 9 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, she was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections to the British Academy celebrate the diversity of UK research|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/elections-british-academy-celebrate-diversity-uk-research|website=British Academy|accessdate=29 July 2017|date=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected international honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences|American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/news/british-academy-president-and-fellows-elected-american-academy-arts-sciences|title=British Academy President and Fellows elected to American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences {{!}} British Academy|website=British Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krikor Torosian''' ({{lang-hy|Գրիգոր Թորոսյան}}, 1884 &amp;ndash; 1915) was an Armenian satirical writer, journalist, and publisher. He started his own satirical journal entitled ''Gigo'', which became popular among the [[Armenian people|Armenians]] in [[Constantinople]]. He is also known for writing an illustrative encyclopedia. He was a victim of the [[Armenian Genocide]].

==Life==
Of Armenian descent, Krikor Torosian was born in Eğin (today [[Kemaliye]]) in 1884.&lt;ref name=teotik&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapçinciyan|first=Teotoros|title=Houshartsun nahadoug medavoraganouti|year=1919|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rf90HAAACAAJ|language=Armenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stepanyan|first=Karnik|title=Biographical Dictionary|year=1973|publisher=Hayasdan|location=Yerevan|page=373|language=Armenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, he moved to Constantinople where he received his early education.&lt;ref name=teotik /&gt; He later began to write in the local Armenian newspaper ''Lila'' and soon became a renowned figure.&lt;ref name=ragip&gt;{{cite news|last=Zarakolu |first=Ragıp |title=Basın da geçmişine sansür uyguluyor |url=http://www.haberruzgari.com/Tarih/34812-BASIN-DA-gECMISINE-SANSUR-UYgULUYOR.html |newspaper=Haber Ruzgari |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019083943/http://www.haberruzgari.com/Tarih/34812-BASIN-DA-gECMISINE-SANSUR-UYgULUYOR.html |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Torosian would be subsequently known for satire, his early writing style was of a more serious tone. Upon the suggestions of Armenian writers Kasim and Der-Hagopyan, he began writing satirical stories in the newspaper ''Manzume'' where he became the chief editor.&lt;ref name=teotik /&gt; After the Young Turk revolution of 1908, he founded the periodical ''Gigo'' which earned him the pen name Gigo.&lt;ref name=turkish /&gt; The periodical published various satirical drawings and caricatures drawn by Torosian himself. He later published an encyclopedia consisting of 300 illustrations.&lt;ref name=turkish&gt;{{cite news|title=Ermeni yıllıkları|url=http://akunq.net/tr/?p=5148|newspaper=Agos|date=2011-04-08|author=Zakarya Mildanoglu|language=Turkish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202112217/http://akunq.net/tr/?p=5148|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
During the Armenian Genocide numerous Armenian intellectuals and notables, including Krikor Torosian, [[Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman capital in 1915|were arrested and sent]] to the interior provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Torosian was arrested on 24 April 1915 and sent to [[Ayaş]] near [[Ankara]].&lt;ref name=massis /&gt;

During his imprisonment in Ayaş, Torosian continued to draw caricatures. He planned to publish the caricatures and illustrations after being released.&lt;ref name=massis /&gt; However, Torosian and other prisoners were later taken out of prison and sent to Ankara where they were killed.&lt;ref name=massis&gt;{{cite news|title=97 Years Later, on the Road to Ayash…|url=http://massispost.com/2012/05/97-years-later-on-the-road-to-ayash/|newspaper=Massis Post|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Balakian|first=Grigoris |title=Armenian Golgotha : a memoir of the Armenian genocide, 1915-1918|year=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=1400096774|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3llu-RtIKwC&amp;dq|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed at the age of 31 and his body was never found.&lt;ref name=ragip /&gt;

{{main|Somali language}}
{{Culture of Somalia}}
[[Somali language|Somali]] is the official language of Somalia and the [[mother tongue]] of the [[Somali people]], the nation's most populous ethnic group. &lt;ref name="Frspc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Republic of Somalia - Provisional Constitution |url=http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |accessdate=10 September 2012 |quote=The official language of the Federal Republic of Somalia is Somali (Maay and Maxaa-tiri), and Arabic is the second language. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124010543/http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |archivedate=24 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2009factbook&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html|title=Somalia|accessdate=2009-05-31|date=2009-05-14|work=[[World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family, and its nearest relatives are the [[Afar language|Afar]] and [[Saho language|Saho]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Lewis, ''Peoples of the Horn of Africa: Somali, Afar and Saho'', (Red Sea Press: 1998), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Somali is the best documented of the Cushitic languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/b14r67j54k377r7g/ |title=A software tool for research in linguistics and lexicography: Application to Somali |doi=10.1007/BF01540131 |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27 |volume=2 |journal=Computers and Translation |pages=21–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; with academic studies of it dating from before 1900.
[[File:Shaxmednuradc1.ogg|thumb|left|180px|Speech sample in [[Somali language|Standard Somali]].]]
As of 2006, there were approximately 16.6 million speakers of Somali, of which about 8.3 million reside in Somalia.&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;{{cite web | title = Somali | publisher = [[SIL International]] | date = 2013 | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/language/som | accessdate = May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Somali language is spoken by ethnic Somalis in [[Greater Somalia]] and the [[Somali diaspora]]. It is spoken as an adoptive language by a few [[ethnic minority]] groups in these regions.

Somali [[dialect]]s are divided into three main groups: Northern, Benaadir and [[Maay language|Maay]] (sometimes spelled Mai or Mai Mai). Northern Somali (or Northern-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali. Benaadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the [[Benadir]] coast from [[Cadaley]] to south of [[Merca]], including [[Mogadishu]], as well as in the immediate hinterland. The coastal dialects have additional [[phoneme]]s which do not exist in Standard Somali. Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle ([[Rahanweyn]]) clans in the southern areas of Somalia.&lt;ref name="Dalby"&gt;Andrew Dalby, ''Dictionary of languages: the definitive reference to more than 400 languages'', (Columbia University Press: 1998), p.571.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Somali language is regulated by the [[Regional Somali Language Academy]], an intergovernmental institution established in June 2013 by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia. It is officially mandated with preserving the Somali language.&lt;ref name="Crslalid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Somali Language Academy Launched in Djibouti|url=http://www.comesaria.org/site/en/news_details.php?chaine=regional-somali-language-academy-launched-in-djibouti&amp;id_news=17578&amp;id_article=119|publisher=COMESA Regional Investment Agency|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabic==
{{main|Arabic language}}
In addition to Somali, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which is also an Afro-Asiatic tongue, is an official national language in Somalia.&lt;ref name="Frspc"/&gt; Many Somalis speak it due to centuries-old cultural and ethnic ties with the [[Arab world]], the far-reaching influence of the [[Arabic media]], and religious education. Variants of the [[Yemeni Arabic|Yemeni]] and [[Hadhramaut|Hadhrami]] dialects are most common, particularly among merchants.&lt;ref name="Dalby2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalby|first=Andrew|title=Dictionary of Languages: The Definitive Reference to More Than 400 Languages|year=1999|publisher=Bloomsbury Pub Ltd.|isbn=0231115687|page=25|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yKSeVLghcfQC&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali's main lexical borrowings come from Arabic. Soravia (1994) noted a total of 1,436 Arabic [[loanword]]s in Agostini a.o. 1985, a prominent Somali dictionary. Most of the vocabulary terms consisted of commonly used nouns. These lexical borrowings may have been more extensive in the past since a few words that Zaborski (1967:122) observed in the older literature were absent in Agostini's later work.&lt;ref name="Versteegh"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Versteegh|2008|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian (former Official Language)==
{{main|Italian language}}

[[Italian language|Italian]] was the only official language in [[Italian Somaliland]] for nearly 70 years and later - during the Trusteeship period - was official together with the Somali. After 1960 independence, the Italian remained official for another dozen years. Italian was later declared an official language again by the [[Transitional Federal Government]] along with [[English language|English]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;According to article 7 of [http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=country&amp;category=&amp;publisher=&amp;type=LEGISLATION&amp;coi=SOM&amp;rid=456d621e2&amp;docid=4795c2d22&amp;skip=0 Transitional Federal Charter for the Somali Republic]: ''The official languages of the Somali Republic shall be Somali (Maay and Maxaatiri) and Arabic. The second languages of the Transitional Federal Government shall be English and Italian.''&lt;/ref&gt; But, in 2012, they were later removed by the establishments of the [[Constitution_of_Somalia#Federal_Republic_of_Somalia|Provisional Constitution]] by the [[Federal Government of Somalia]]&lt;ref&gt;According to article 5 of [http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf Provisional Constitution]: ''The official language of the Federal Republic of Somalia is Somali (Maay and Maxaa-tiri), and Arabic is the second language.''&lt;/ref&gt; leaving [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as the only official languages.
 
Italian is a legacy of the [[Italian Somaliland|Italian colonial period]] of Somalia when it was part of the [[Italian Empire]]. Italian was the mother tongue of the [[Italian Somalis|Italian settlers]] of Somalia. 
 
Although it was the primary language since [[Italian Somaliland|colonial rule]], Italian continued to be used among the country's ruling elite even after [[Somali Republic|1960 independence]] when it continued to remain as an official language. It is estimated that more than 200,000 native Somalis (nearly 20% of the total population of former ''Somalia italiana'') were fluent speaking Italian when independence was declared in 1960&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W96tncBcItg Video (showing Somalis speaking Italian) of the last day of Italian presence in Mogadishu, when was declared the Somalian independence in July 1960 {{it icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
After a [[Somali Democratic Republic|military coup in 1969]], all foreign entities were nationalized by [[Siad Barre]] (who spoke fluently Italian), including [[Mogadishu under Italian rule|Mogadishu]]'s principal university, which was renamed 'Jaamacadda Ummadda Soomaliyeed' ([[Somali National University]]). This marked the initial decline of the use of Italian in Somalia.
 
However, Italian is still widely spoken by the elderly, the educated, and by the governmental officials of Somalia. Prior to the [[Somali civil war]], Mogadishu still had an Italian-language school, but was later destroyed by the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=country&amp;category=&amp;publisher=&amp;type=LEGISLATION&amp;coi=SOM&amp;rid=456d621e2&amp;docid=4795c2d22&amp;skip=0 Scuola media di Mogadiscio] (Picture)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign and minority languages==
{{main|Bravanese dialect|Bajuni dialect|Italian language|English language}}
[[English language|English]] is widely taught in schools. It used to be a working language in the [[British Somaliland]] protectorate.

[[Italian language|Italian]] was an official language in [[Italian Somaliland]] and during the trusteeship period, but the use of [[Italian language in Somalia]] significantly diminished following [[Independence Day (Somalia)|independence]]. It is now most frequently heard among older generations.&lt;ref name="Dubnov"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubnov|first=Helena|title=A grammatical sketch of Somali|year=2003|publisher=Köppe|isbn=389645045X|pages=70–71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us1iAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minority languages include [[Bravanese language|Bravanese]] (also known as Chimwiini or Chimbalazi), a variant of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]] that is spoken along the southern coast by the [[Bravanese people]]. [[Bajuni dialect|Kibajuni]] is a Swahili dialect that is the mother tongue of the [[Bajuni people|Bajuni]] ethnic minority group. Additionally, a number of [[Somali Bantu|Bantus]] speak [[Zigula language|Mushunguli]] as a mother tongue.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=xma Ethnologue – Mushungulu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somali Sign Language==
{{main|Somali Sign Language}}
The [[Somali Sign Language]] (SSL) is a [[sign language]] used by the [[deaf community]] in Somalia and [[Djibouti]]. It was originally developed by a Somali man educated in a Somali deaf school in [[Wajir]], [[Kenya]]. In 1997, he established the first school for the deaf in the city of [[Borama]],Somalia

==Orthography==
{{main|Somali orthography}}
[[File:Ciismaniya.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The [[Osmanya alphabet|Osmanya]] writing script for Somali.]]
A number of [[writing system]]s have been used for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the [[Somali alphabet|Somali Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Economist Intelligence Unit (Great Britain), ''Middle East annual review'', (1975), p.229&lt;/ref&gt; The script was developed by the Somali linguist [[Shire Jama Ahmed]] specifically for the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except ''p'', ''v'' and ''z''. There are no [[diacritics]] or other special characters except the use of the apostrophe for the [[glottal stop]], which does not occur word-initially. There are three consonant [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: DH, KH and SH. Tone is not marked, and front and back vowels are not distinguished.

Besides Ahmed's Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the long-established [[Arabic script]] and [[Wadaad's writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/somali.htm Omniglot - Somali writing scripts]&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous writing systems developed in the twentieth century include the [[Osmanya script|Osmanya]], [[Borama script|Borama]] and [[Kaddare script|Kaddare]] scripts, which were invented by [[Osman Yusuf Kenadid]], [[Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur]] and [[Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare]], respectively.&lt;ref name="laitin"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Laitin|1977|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lateral masking''' is a problem for the human [[visual perception]] of identical or similar entities in close proximity. This can be illustrated by the difficulty of counting the vertical bars of a [[barcode]].

In [[linguistics]] lateral masking refers to the interference a [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] has on its neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;Massaro, Dominic W. and Alexandra Jesse (2005): The Magic of Reading - Too many influences for quick and easy explanations. in: Richard L. Venezky, Tom Trabasso, John P. Sabatini, Dominic W. Massaro, Robert Calfee (eds.): From Orthography to Pedagogy: Essays in Honor of Richard L. Venezky. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-8058-5089-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a problem readers encounter when reading a word. The identity of a letter in the middle of a word is obscured by the presence of its neighboring letters.

Lateral masking may also be a problem in [[orthography]] design. A [[reading (process)|readable]] orthography will avoid situations in which a reader is faced with severe lateral masking.

In [[computing]] and specifically  [[Internet]], a '''leech''' is one who benefits, usually deliberately, from others' information or effort but does not offer anything in return, or makes only token offerings in an attempt to avoid being called a leech. In economics, this type of behavior is called "free riding" and is associated with the [[free rider problem]].

Depending on context, leeching does not necessarily refer to ''illegal'' use of computer resources, but often instead to ''greedy'' use according to etiquette: to wit, using too much of what is freely given without contributing a reasonable amount back to the community that provides it.

The name derives from the [[leech]], an animal that sucks blood and then tries to leave unnoticed. Other terms are used, such as "freeloader" and "sponge", but leech is the most common.

== Examples ==
* [[Wi-Fi]] leeches attach to open wireless networks without the owner's knowledge in order to access the Internet.  One example of this is someone who connects to a café's free wireless service from his or her car in the parking lot in order to download large amounts of data.  See [[Piggybacking (Internet access)]]
* [[Direct linking]] (or hot-linking) is a form of bandwidth leeching that occurs when placing an unauthorized linked object, often an image, from one site in a web page belonging to a second site (the leech). 
* In most [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]]-networks, leeching can be defined as behavior consisting of downloading more data, over time, than the individual is uploading to other clients, thus draining speed from the network.  The term is used in a similar way for shared [[FTP]] directories. Mainly, leeching is taking without giving.
* Claiming credit for, or offering for sale, freely available content created and uploaded by others to the Internet ([[Plagiarism]]/[[Copyfraud]])

== Gaming ==
In games (whether a traditional tabletop [[Role Playing Game|RPG]], [[Live action role-playing game|LARPing]], or even [[MMORPG]]) the term "leech" is given to someone who avoids confrontation and sits out while another player fights and gains experience for the person, or "leecher", who is avoiding confrontation.

* In online multi-player games, "to leech" generally means that a player be present and qualify for the presentation of a reward of some sort, without contributing to the team effort needed to earn that reward.  Although in the past the term "leeching" has been applied to a player gaining any benefit due solely to the efforts of others, the term is now most often limited to players that gain [[Experience point|experience]] without meaningful contribution.  However, while this usually carries negative connotations, this is not always the case; for instance, in MMOs where [[power leveling]] is possible, a higher level player may deliberately consent to a lower leveled player gaining experience without assisting, usually due to the danger to the lower leveled player.  In situations where the amount of assistance the lower level player can provide is negligible (as is often the case when being Power Leveled, due to the disparity between target mobs and the player), a higher level player may deliberately encourage the lower level player to "leech" to avoid wasted time spent protecting the lower level player that could otherwise be directed towards more quickly accomplishing the goal of earning experience points.  However, this is usually an arrangement between friends or guild-mates, and unsolicited requests to "leech" experience off of a higher level player is often considered extremely rude. 
* In popular MMORPG's the alternative way to refer to a "leecher" (especially one that is "leeching" items, as opposed to experience) has arisen as being "Ninja" (referring to the notional lightning reflexes needed to claim the reward between its appearance and its retrieval by the more deserving player).  This can be used as either a noun ("Player One is a loot ninja!") or a verb ("Player One keeps ninja'ing all the drops!").  However, a "ninja" may not necessarily be "leeching", in that they do sometimes contribute to the goal, "ninja" more applies towards a player claiming an item unfairly, either because the group agreed to pass the item to a particular player in advance, or by taking the item before the group can determine which player gets the item fairly through whichever process the group agreed upon (usually rolling for it, which is simulated in many MMOs through a "/random" or "/roll" command).  
* This is different from "killstealing" where a player uses an attack at the right moment to kill an enemy and take the experience benefit (XP), which may benefit the player or not.  In some games, XP is granted to the person who deals a final shot to an enemy, or to who deals a significant amount of damage regardless of who hit it last.  Killstealing can in this fashion be applied as a reverse leeching: it prevents another player from gaining XP at all regardless of their effort.

== Prevention ==
* Wi-Fi networks can implement various authentication and access control technologies in order to prevent leeching. The most common are client [[MAC address]] authorization tables ([[deprecated]] due to insecurity), [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] ([[deprecated]] due to insecurity), and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]].
* Bandwidth leeching can be prevented by running an anti-leeching script on the website's server. It can automatically ban IPs that leech, or can redirect them to faulty files.

== P2P networks ==
Amongst users of the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] [[File sharing|file distribution]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] and common [[P2P network]]s, such as the [[eDonkey network]] or [[Gnutella2]], a leech is a user who disconnects as soon as they have a complete copy of a particular file, while minimizing or completely suppressing data upload.

However, on most BitTorrent tracker sites, the term ''leecher'' is used for all users who are not [[Terminology of BitTorrent#Seed|seeders]] (which means they do not have the complete file yet). As BitTorrent [[Client (computing)|clients]] usually begin to upload files almost as soon as they have started to download them, such users are usually not freeloaders (people who don't upload data at all to the swarm). Therefore, this kind of leeching is considered to be a legitimate practice. Reaching an upload/download ratio of 1:1 (meaning that the user has uploaded as much as they downloaded) in a BitTorrent client is considered a minimum in the etiquette of that network. In the terminology of these BitTorrent sites, a leech becomes a seeder (a provider of the file) when they finished downloading and continues to run the client. They will remain a seeder until the file is removed or destroyed (settings enable the torrent to stop [[Seeding (computing)|seeding]] at a certain share ratio, or after X hours have passed seeding).

The so-called ''bad'' leechers are those running specially modified clients which avoid uploading data. This has led to the development of a multitude of technologies to ban such misbehaving clients. For example, on BitTorrent, most private trackers do keep track of the amount of data a client uploads or downloads to avoid leeching, while on real [[P2P network]]s systems like DLP (Dynamic Leecher Protection) ([[Xtreme Mod|eMule Xtreme Mod]], [[eDonkey network]]) or uploader rewarding ([[Gnutella2]]) have been brought in place.  Note that BitTorrent is not a [[P2P network]], it is only a P2P file distribution system.

Leeching is often seen as a threat to peer-to-peer sharing and as the direct opposite of the practice of [[Seeding (computing)|seeding]]. But with rising downloads, uploads are still guaranteed, although few contributors in the system account for most services.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, S., Jin, H., Liao, X., Yao, H., Huang, Q., Tu, X. (2009).

The modern '''Malay alphabet''' or '''Indonesian alphabet''' ([[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]: ''Tulisan Rumi'', literally "Roman script" or "Roman writing", [[Indonesia]]: "Tulisan Latin") consists of the 26 letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] without any [[diacritic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Before [[Perfected Spelling System|a spelling reform in 1972]], Indonesia would disambiguate {{IPA|/e/}} as ''é'' and {{IPA|/ə/}} as ''e'', and Malaysia {{IPA|/e/}} as ''e'' and {{IPA|/ə/}} as ''ĕ''. The spelling reform removed the diacritics and use ''e'' to represent both {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the more common of the two alphabets used today to write the [[Malay language]], the other being [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]] (a modified [[Arabic script]]). The Latin Malay alphabet is the official Malay script in [[Indonesia]] (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Malaysia]] (as [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]) and [[Singapore]], while it is co-official with Jawi in [[Brunei]].

Historically, various scripts such as [[Pallava script|Pallava]], [[Kawi script|Kawi]] and [[Rencong script|Rencong]] were used to write [[Old Malay]], until they were replaced by Jawi with the introduction of [[Islam]]. The arrival of [[Europe]]an [[colonial powers]] brought the Latin alphabet to the [[Malay Archipelago]].

As the Malay-speaking countries were divided between two colonial administrations (the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]]), two major different spelling [[orthographies]] were developed in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[British Malaya]] respectively, influenced by the orthographies of their respective colonial tongues. The [[Soewandi Spelling System]] (or the Republic Spelling System after independence), used in the Dutch East Indies and later in independent Indonesia until 1972, was based on the [[Dutch alphabet]]. In 1972, as part of the effort of harmonizing spelling differences between the two countries, Indonesia and Malaysia each adopted a [[spelling reform]] plan, called the [[Perfected Spelling System]] (''Ejaan yang Disempurnakan'') in Indonesia and the [[New Rumi Spelling]] (''Ejaan Rumi Baharu''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu | authorlink = Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka | title = Ejaan Rumi Baharu Bahasa Malaysia | url = http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=ejaan+rumi+baharu&amp;d=8 | year = 2014 | accessdate = 2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Malaysia. Although the representations of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malaysian varieties, a number of minor spelling differences remain.

The names of letters differ between Indonesia and rest of the Malay-speaking countries. Indonesia follows the letter names of the [[Dutch alphabet]], while Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore follow the [[English alphabet]]. Regardless of the letter names, however, the letters represent the same sounds in all Malay-speaking countries. The Malay alphabet has a [[phonemic orthography]]; words are spelled the way they are pronounced, with few exceptions. The letters Q, V and X are rarely encountered, being chiefly used for writing [[loanword]]s.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Many vowels are pronounced (and were formerly spelt) differently in Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra (where Malay is native): ''tujuh'' is pronounced (and was spelt) ''tujoh'', ''rambut'' as ''rambot'', ''kain'' as ''kaen'', ''pilih'' as ''pileh'', etc., [e] and [o] are also allophones of /i/ and /u/ in closed final syllables in peninsular Malaysian and Sumatran. Many vowels were pronounced and formerly spelt differently that way also in East Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia.

In addition, there are [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s that are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:&lt;ref name=Omniglot&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/malay.htm Omniglot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palor''' (Falor, Paloor) is a language spoken in [[Senegal]]. The speakers of this language - the [[Palor people]] or Serer-Palor, are ethnically [[Serer people|Serers]] but they do not speak the [[Serer language|Serer-Sine language]]. Like the [[Lehar language|Lehar]], [[Saafi language|Saafi]], [[Noon language|Noon]] and [[Ndut language|Ndut]] languages, their language is classified as one of the [[Cangin languages]] attached to the [[Niger–Congo]] family. Palor is closer to Ndut.

A '''pejorative''' (also called a '''derogatory term''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/derogatory|title=Definition of derogatory|publisher=''[[Merriam Webster]]''|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''slur''', a '''term of abuse''', or a '''term of disparagement''') is a word or grammatical form expressing a negative connotation or a low opinion of someone or something, showing a lack of [[respect]] for someone or something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pejorative |title=Pejorative &amp;#124; Define Pejorative at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to express [[criticism]], [[hostility]], or [[wikt:disregard|disregard]]. A term can be regarded as pejorative in some social or cultural groups but not in others. Sometimes, a term may begin as a pejorative and eventually be adopted in a non-pejorative sense (or vice versa) in some or all contexts.

'''Name slurs''' can also involve an insulting or disparaging [[innuendo]],&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slur |title=Slur - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than being a direct pejorative. In some cases, a person's name can be redefined with an unpleasant or insulting meaning, or be applied to a group of people considered by anyone to be inferior or lower in social class, as a group label with a disparaging meaning.

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the word pejorative is derived from a [[Late Latin]] past participle stem of ''peiorare'', meaning "to make worse", from ''peior'' "worse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pejorative (adj.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pejorative|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melioration==

When a term begins as pejorative and eventually is adopted in a non-pejorative sense, this is called "melioration" in [[historical linguistics]]. It may also be called ''amelioration'', [[reclaiming]], or [[semantic change]].&lt;ref name=croom&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VD2-51PBJ21-1&amp;_user=489256&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2011&amp;_rdoc=2&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_origin=browse&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235970%232011%23999669996%233020754%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5970&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=11&amp;_acct=C000022721&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=489256&amp;md5=f94b3fbfef3504c7d540c69149e5bf56&amp;searchtype=a |last=Croom |first=Adam M. |title=Slurs |journal=Language Sciences |volume=33 |issue=3 |date=May 2011 |pages=343–358 |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2010.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples of melioration are "[[punk subculture|punk]]", "[[dude]]" and "[[nerd]]".

with scant resources and published ''Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas'' (1928–29).

==Early life==
Acharya Ramchandra Shukla was born on October 4, 1882, [[Basti district]] in a wealthy [[Brahmin]] family,. His father Chandrabali Shukla was a prestigious [[Tehsildar|Revenue Inspector]] (Kanoongo) at that time. Before he did his high school at London Mission School he learned [[Hindi]], [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]] at his house by qualified teachers and then for further study he came to [[Allahabad]] and continued his study; after that he wrote and published his valuable literature works and his experienced information.

==Biography==
The work of Shukla traces the genesis of Hindi poetry and [[prose]] since the 6th century and its development through Buddhist and Nath schools and the [[medieval]] contributions of [[Amir Khusro]], [[Kabirdas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Tulsidas]], stretching to the modern realism of [[Nirala]] and [[Premchand]].

In his assessment of Shukla (''Acharya Ramchandra Shukla aur Hindi Alochana'') eminent critic Dr. [[Ram Vilas Sharma]] emphasises the fact that the great writer opposed [[feudal]] and courtly literature as it did not give a true picture of the life of the common people and contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Mohan| last = Lal| title = Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature| publisher = [[Sahitya Akademi]]| year = 1992| pages = 820
| isbn = 978-81-260-1221-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works of literary criticism include ''Kavita Kya Hai'', the most widely read essay explaining poetry and poetics in his outstanding collection ''Chintamani'', published initially in two volumes as a collection of essays on emotions like [[anger]] and hatred. Recently his scattered and unpublished essays have been found and published as ''Chintamani-3'' edited by Namwar Singh and ''Chintamani-4'' by Kusum Chaturvedi.

To enrich the worldview of Hindi speakers, Acharya Shukla translated [[Edwin Arnold]]'s ''[[The Light of Asia]]'' into ''Buddha Charit'' (A biography of [[Gautam Buddha]] in Brij Bhasha verse) and German scholar [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s famous work ''The Riddles of Universe'' into ''Vishwa Prapanch'' where he added his own thought-provoking preface by comparing its findings with Indian philosophical systems.

These works signify that he did not restrict himself to be the foremost moderniser of the Hindi [[language]], literature and thought. He was involved with scientific temper-building by translating and updating works of science and history. In developing a scientific methodology to investigate the literary works of several centuries as creations of socio-economic and political conditions of the respective era, Acharya Shukla became a pathbreaker.

In his view true literature is not merely an expression of human consciousness as an end in itself but accounts for [[Lokmangal]], a concept defining progress of society where common people are supreme and their sufferings are best understood as purpose for amelioration: literature, through aesthetics, must address itself to the pains/woes of the downtrodden and underdog and work for human emancipation from exploitation of all kinds.

Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla was born on 4 October 1884 to Chandrabali Shukla in a small village—Agona, [[Basti district|Basti]], Uttar Pradesh—during British rule over India. He started his work in the world of letters with a poem and an article ''Prachin Bharatiyoin Ka Pahirava'' in Hindi and by writing in English his first published essay at the age of 17—''What Has India to do''. Keeping in the spirit of [[anti-imperialism]], in  1921, he wrote ''Non-co-operation and Non-mercantile Classes of India'' which was an attempt to look at the struggle of Indian classes in the set up of colonial and semi-feudal economy.

Acharya Shukla taught at [[Banaras Hindu University]]  [[Varanasi]] and chaired its department of Hindi during [[Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya]]'s period from 1937 until he died (1941). Although not a regular story writer, he wrote a long Hindi story "Gyarah Varsh Ka Samay" to inspire original writing. His collection of original poems ''Madhushrota'' includes his adolescent hunger for hills, rocks, waterfalls, crops and birds, and images of his childhood sphere. His famous work ''Sahitya ka Itihaas'' was later edited online by a group of eminent Hindi writers and translators, led by Sri Suresh Kumar Mishra "Uratrupt", writer and methodologist from Ranga Reddy, [[Andhra Pradesh]]. ''Hindi Sahitya ka Itihaas'' is considered as authentic Hindi literature.

Ram Chandra Shukla was married to Savitri Devi and had two sons, Keshav Chandra and Gokul Chandra, and three daughters, Durgavati, Vidhya and Kamla. He was a painter and designed his own house, which was incomplete when he died in 1941.

''Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla Sahitya Shodh Sansthan'', a [[research institute]] established in 1972 in his name, is a center of literary activities. It was built on the wish of his son Gokul Chandra Shukla and on the land provided by the Varanasi local authority. Later it got financial help from the state government of Uttar Pradesh for building and infrastructure. Its first secretary, [[Kusum Chaturvedi]], published a regular journal ''Naya Mandand'' which established a reputation for its special numbers on women, postmodernism, Dalit Sahitya, among others. Its articles and research papers are acclaimed in Hindi and Indian languages literature. After the death of Kusum Chaturvedi, a connoisseur of literature, Gyan Datta Chaturvedi became the secretary. After his death, Dr. Manjeet Chaturvedi, son of Kusum Chaturvedi and Gyan Datta Chaturvedi, professor, Banaras Hindu University took over as the Secretary (MANTRI) of Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla Sahitya Shodh Sansthan; its Chairperson (ADHYAKSHA) is Dr. Mukta, a famous author of Hindi stories. Kusum Chaturvedi and Mukta have produced a documentary for [[Doordarshan]] on Acharya Shukla and published his authentic biography.

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], '''Russell's paradox''' (also known as '''Russell's antinomy'''), discovered by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1901,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand, "Correspondence with Frege}. In Gottlob Frege ''Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence''. (Translated by Hans Kaal., University of Chicago Press,  Chicago, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. and Russell, B., ''The Principles of Mathematics'', 1903. 2d. ed. reprint, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, New York, 1996.)&lt;/ref&gt; showed that some attempted formalizations of the [[naïve set theory]] created by [[Georg Cantor]] led to a [[contradiction]]. The same paradox had been discovered in 1899 by [[Ernst Zermelo]]&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Rang, Wolfgang Thomas: Zermelo's Discovery of the "Russell Paradox", Historia Mathematica 8.&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not publish the idea, which remained known only to [[David Hilbert]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and other members of the [[University of Göttingen]]. At the end of the 1890s Cantor himself had already realized that his definition would lead to a contradiction, which he told Hilbert and [[Richard Dedekind]] by letter.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Purkert, Hans J. Ilgauds: ''Vita Mathematica - Georg Cantor'', Birkhäuser, 1985, {{ISBN|3-764-31770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to naive set theory, any definable collection is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. Let ''R'' be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.  If ''R'' is not a member of itself, then its definition dictates that it must contain itself, and if it contains itself, then it contradicts its own definition as the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. This contradiction is Russell's paradox. Symbolically:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Let } R = \{ x \mid x \not \in x \} \text{, then } R \in R \iff R \not \in R&lt;/math&gt;

In 1908, two ways of avoiding the paradox were proposed, Russell's [[type theory]] and the [[Zermelo set theory]], the first constructed [[axiomatic set theory]]. Zermelo's axioms went well beyond [[Gottlob Frege]]'s axioms of [[Axiom of extensionality|extensionality]] and unlimited [[set builder notation|set abstraction]], and evolved into the now-standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC). The essential difference between Russell's and Zermelo's solution to the paradox is that Zermelo altered the axioms of set theory while preserving the logical language in which they are expressed (the language of ZFC, with the [[Axiom schema of replacement#History|help of Thoralf Skolem]], turned out to be [[first-order logic]]) while Russell altered the logical language itself.&lt;ref name="FraenkelBar-Hillel1973"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.A. Fraenkel|author2=Y. Bar-Hillel|author3=A. Levy|title=Foundations of Set Theory|year=1973|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-088705-0|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal presentation==
Let us call a set "abnormal" if it is a member of itself, and "normal" otherwise.  For example, take the set of all [[square]]s in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. That set is not itself a square in the plane, and therefore is not a member of the set of all squares in the plane. So it is "normal". On the other hand, if we take the complementary set that contains all non-(squares in the plane),{{efn|As opposed to (non-squares) in the plane, which is the complement with the universe of "things in the plane".}} that set is itself not a square in the plane and so should be one of its own members as it is a non-(square in the plane). It is "abnormal".

Now we consider the set of all normal sets, ''R''. Determining whether ''R'' is normal or abnormal is impossible: if ''R'' were a normal set, it would be contained in the set of normal sets (itself), and therefore be abnormal; and if ''R'' were abnormal, it would not be contained in the set of all normal sets (itself), and therefore be normal. This leads to the conclusion that ''R'' is neither normal nor abnormal: Russell's paradox.

==Formal presentation==
Define Naive Set Theory (NST) as the theory of [[predicate logic]] with a binary [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; and the following axiom schema of [[unrestricted comprehension]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\exists y \forall x (x \in y \iff P(x))&lt;/math&gt;
for any formula ''P'' with only the variable ''x'' free.
Substitute &lt;math&gt;x \notin x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by [[existential instantiation]] (reusing the symbol ''y'') and [[universal instantiation]] we have

:&lt;math&gt;y \in y \iff y \notin y&lt;/math&gt;

a contradiction.  Therefore, NST is [[Consistency|inconsistent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Russell's Paradox|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year= 2014 |editor-last= Zalta|editor-first= Edward N.|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/russell-paradox/|last1= Irvine|first1=Andrew David|last2= Deutsch|first2= Harry }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Set-theoretic responses==
In 1908, [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed an [[axiomatic system|axiomatization]] of set theory that avoided the paradoxes of naive set theory by replacing arbitrary set comprehension with weaker existence axioms, such as his [[axiom of separation]] (''Aussonderung''). Modifications to this axiomatic theory proposed in the 1920s by [[Abraham Fraenkel]], [[Thoralf Skolem]], and by Zermelo himself resulted in the axiomatic set theory called [[ZFC]]. This theory became widely accepted once Zermelo's [[axiom of choice]] ceased to be controversial, and ZFC has remained the canonical [[axiomatic set theory]] down to the present day.

ZFC does not assume that, for every property, there is a set of all things satisfying that property. Rather, it asserts that given any set ''X'', any subset of ''X'' definable using [[first-order logic]] exists. The object ''R'' discussed above cannot be constructed in this fashion, and is therefore not a ZFC set. In some [[Von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory|extensions of ZFC]], objects like ''R'' are called [[proper class]]es.

ZFC is silent about types, although the [[Von Neumann universe|cumulative hierarchy]] has a notion of layers that resemble types. Zermelo himself never accepted Skolem's formulation of ZFC using the language of first-order logic. As José Ferreirós notes, Zermelo insisted instead that "propositional functions (conditions or predicates) used for separating off subsets, as well as the replacement functions, can be 'entirely ''arbitrary''' [ganz ''beliebig''];" the modern interpretation given to this statement is that Zermelo wanted to include [[higher-order logic|higher-order quantification]] in order to avoid [[Skolem's paradox]]. Around 1930, Zermelo also introduced (apparently independently of von Neumann), the [[axiom of foundation]], thus—as Ferreirós observes— "by forbidding 'circular' and 'ungrounded' sets, it [ZFC] incorporated one of the crucial motivations of TT [type theory]—the principle of the types of arguments". This 2nd order ZFC preferred by Zermelo, including axiom of foundation, allowed a rich cumulative hierarchy. Ferreirós writes that "Zermelo's 'layers' are essentially the same as the types in the contemporary versions of simple TT [type theory] offered by Gödel and Tarski. One can describe the cumulative hierarchy into which Zermelo developed his models as the universe of a cumulative TT in which transfinite types are allowed. (Once we have adopted an impredicative standpoint, abandoning the idea that classes are constructed, it is not unnatural to accept transfinite types.) Thus, simple TT and ZFC could now be regarded as systems that 'talk' essentially about the same intended objects. The main difference is that TT relies on a strong higher-order logic, while Zermelo employed second-order logic, and ZFC can also be given a first-order formulation. The first-order 'description' of the cumulative hierarchy is much weaker, as is shown by the existence of denumerable models (Skolem paradox), but it enjoys some important advantages."&lt;ref name="Ferreirós2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Ferreirós|title=Labyrinth of Thought: A History of Set Theory and Its Role in Modern Mathematics|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7643-8350-3|edition=2nd|at=§ Zermelo's cumulative hierarchy pp. 374-378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ZFC, given a set ''A'', it is possible to define a set ''B'' that consists of exactly the sets in ''A'' that are not members of themselves. ''B'' cannot be in ''A'' by the same reasoning in Russell's Paradox. This variation of Russell's paradox shows that no set contains everything.

Through the work of Zermelo and others, especially [[John von Neumann]], the structure of what some see as the "natural" objects described by ZFC eventually became clear; they are the elements of the [[von Neumann universe]], ''V'', built up from the [[empty set]] by [[transfinite recursion|transfinitely iterating]] the [[power set]] operation. It is thus now possible again to reason about sets in a non-axiomatic fashion without running afoul of Russell's paradox, namely by reasoning about the elements of ''V''. Whether it is ''appropriate'' to think of sets in this way is a point of contention among the rival points of view on the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

Other resolutions to Russell's paradox, more in the spirit of [[type theory]], include the axiomatic set theories [[New Foundations]] and [[Scott-Potter set theory]].

==History==
Russell discovered the paradox in May or June 1901.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xg6QpedPpcsC&amp;pg=PA350 |title=One hundred years of Russell's paradox |author=Godehard Link |page=350 |year=2004 |isbn=978-3-11-017438-0 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his own account in his 1919 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', he "attempted to discover some flaw in Cantor's proof that there is no greatest cardinal".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1920:136&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1902 letter,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ktC0UrG4V8C&amp;pg=PA253 |page=253 |year=1997 |title=The Frege reader |isbn=978-0-631-19445-3 |author=Gottlob Frege, Michael Beaney |accessdate=2016-02-22}}. Also van Heijenoort 1967:124–125&lt;/ref&gt; he announced the discovery to [[Gottlob Frege]] of the paradox in Frege's 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and framed the problem in terms of both logic and set theory, and in particular in terms of Frege's definition of [[function (mathematics)|function]]:{{efn|In the following, p.&amp;nbsp;17 refers to a page in the original ''Begriffsschrift'', and page 23 refers to the same page in van Heijenoort 1967}}{{efn|Remarkably, this letter was unpublished until van Heijenoort 1967—it appears with van Heijenoort's commentary at van Heijenoort 1967:124–125.}}

{{quote|There is just one point where I have encountered a difficulty. You state (p. 17 [p. 23 above]) that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let '''w''' be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can '''w''' be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. Therefore we must conclude that '''w''' is not a predicate. Likewise there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which, each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection [Menge] does not form a totality.}}

Russell would go on to cover it at length in his 1903 ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', where he repeated his first encounter with the paradox:&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:101&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Before taking leave of fundamental questions, it is necessary to examine more in detail the singular contradiction, already mentioned, with regard to predicates not predicable of themselves. ... I may mention that I was led to it in the endeavour to reconcile Cantor's proof...."}}

Russell wrote to Frege about the paradox just as Frege was preparing the second volume of his ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik''.&lt;ref&gt;cf van Heijenoort's commentary before Frege's ''Letter to Russell'' in van Heijenoort 1967:126.&lt;/ref&gt; Frege responded to Russell very quickly; his letter dated 22 June 1902 appeared, with van Heijenoort's commentary in Heijenoort 1967:126–127. Frege then wrote an appendix admitting to the paradox,&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary, cf van Heijenoort 1967:126 ; Frege starts his analysis by this exceptionally honest comment : "Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished.  This was the position I was placed in  by a letter of Mr Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion" (Appendix of ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, vol. II'', in ''The Frege Reader'', p.279, translation by Michael Beaney&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed a solution that Russell would endorse in his ''Principles of Mathematics'',&lt;ref&gt;cf van Heijenoort's commentary, cf van Heijenoort 1967:126. The added text reads as follows: " ''Note''. The second volume of Gg., which appeared too late to be noticed in the Appendix, contains an interesting discussion of the contradiction (pp. 253–265), suggesting that the solution is to be found by denying that two [[propositional function]]s that determine equal classes must be equivalent. As it seems very likely that this is the true solution, the reader is strongly recommended to examine Frege's argument on the point" (Russell 1903:522); The abbreviation Gg. stands for Frege's ''Grundgezetze der Arithmetik''. Begriffsschriftlich abgeleitet. Vol. I. Jena, 1893. Vol. II. 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; but was later considered by some to be unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Livio states that "While Frege did make some desperate attempts to remedy his axiom system, he was unsuccessful. The conclusion appeared to be disastrous...." Livio 2009:188. But van Heijenoort in his commentary before Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' describes Frege's proposed "way out" in some detail—the matter has to do with the " 'transformation of the generalization of an equality into an equality of courses-of-values. For Frege a function is something incomplete, 'unsaturated' "; this seems to contradict the contemporary notion of a "function in extension"; see Frege's wording at page 128: "Incidentally, it seems to me that the expression 'a predicate is predicated of itself' is not exact. ...Therefore I would prefer to say that 'a concept is predicated of its own extension' [etc]". But he waffles at the end of his suggestion that a function-as-concept-in-extension can be written as predicated of its function. van Heijenoort cites Quine: "For a late and thorough study of Frege's "way out", see ''Quine 1955''": "On Frege's way out", ''Mind 64'', 145–159; reprinted in ''Quine 1955b'': ''Appendix. Completeness of quantification theory. Loewenheim's theorem'', enclosed as a pamphlet with part of the third printing (1955) of ''Quine 1950'' and incorporated in the revised edition (1959), 253—260" (cf REFERENCES in van Heijenoort 1967:649)&lt;/ref&gt;  For his part, Russell had his work at the printers and he added an appendix on the [[Type theory|doctrine of types]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell mentions this fact to Frege, cf van Heijenoort's commentary before Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Heijenoort 1967:126&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Zermelo]] in his (1908) ''A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering'' (published at the same time he published "the first axiomatic set theory")&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Zermelo (1908a) ''Investigations in the foundations of set theory I in van Heijenoort 1967:199&lt;/ref&gt; laid claim to prior discovery of the [[antinomy]] in Cantor's naive set theory. He states: "And yet, even the elementary form that Russell&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; gave to the set-theoretic antinomies could have persuaded them [J. König, Jourdain, F. Bernstein] that the solution of these difficulties is not to be sought in the surrender of well-ordering but only in a suitable restriction of the notion of set".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190–191. In the section before this he objects strenuously to the notion of [[impredicativity]] as defined by Poincaré (and soon to be taken by Russell, too, in his 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' cf van Heijenoort 1967:150–182).&lt;/ref&gt; Footnote 9 is where he stakes his claim:

{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;''1903'', pp. 366–368. I had, however, discovered this antinomy myself, independently of Russell, and had communicated it prior to 1903 to  Professor Hilbert among others''.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Zermelo (1908) ''A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering'' in van Heijenoort 1967:183–198. Livio 2009:191 reports that Zermelo "discovered Russell's paradox independently as early as 1900"; Livio in turn cites Ewald 1996 and van Heijenoort 1967 (cf Livio 2009:268).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frege sent a copy of his ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'' to Hilbert; as noted above, Frege's last volume mentioned the paradox that Russell had communicated to Frege. After receiving Frege's last volume, on 7 November 1903, Hilbert wrote a letter to Frege in which he said, referring to Russell's paradox, "I believe Dr. Zermelo discovered it three or four years ago".  A written account of Zermelo's actual argument was discovered in the ''Nachlass'' of [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Rang and W. Thomas, "Zermelo's discovery of the 'Russell Paradox'", ''Historia Mathematica'', v. 8 n. 1, 1981, pp. 15–22. {{doi|10.1016/0315-0860(81)90002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] proposed to "dispose" of Russell's paradox as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it
cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx) could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition '''F(F(fx))''', in which the outer function '''F''' and the inner function '''F''' must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form '''O(fx)''' and the outer one has the form '''Y(O(fx))'''. Only the letter 'F' is common to the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if instead of '''F(Fu)''' we write '''(do) : F(Ou) . Ou = Fu'''. That disposes of Russell's paradox. (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', 3.333)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] wrote their three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' hoping to achieve what Frege had been unable to do. They sought to banish the paradoxes of [[naive set theory]] by employing a [[type theory|theory of types]] they devised for this purpose. While they succeeded in grounding arithmetic in a fashion, it is not at all evident that they did so by purely logical means. While ''Principia Mathematica'' avoided the known paradoxes and allows the derivation of a great deal of mathematics, its system gave rise to new problems.

In any event, [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1930–31 proved that while the logic of much of ''Principia Mathematica'', now known as [[first-order logic]], is [[Gödel's completeness theorem|complete]], [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]] is necessarily incomplete if it is [[consistent]]. This is very widely—though not universally—regarded as having shown the [[logicist]] program of Frege to be impossible to complete.

In 2001 A Centenary International Conference celebrating the first hundred years of Russell's paradox was held in Munich and its proceedings have been published.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Applied versions==
There are some versions of this paradox that are closer to real-life situations and may be easier to understand for non-logicians. For example, the [[barber paradox]] supposes a barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves. When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.

As another example, consider five lists of encyclopedia entries within the same encyclopedia:

{| class="wikitable"
|- valign="top"
| style="width:20%;"| List of articles about people:
*[[Don Knotts]]
*[[Don Nix]]
*[[Emperor Kōnin]]
*[[Hermann Hesse]]
*[[Isaac Newton]]
*[[Nikola Tesla]]
*[[Ptolemy VII of Egypt]]
*[[Rainie Yang]]
*[[Sherlock Holmes]]
*[[Socrates]]
| style="width:20%;"| List of articles starting with the letter L:
*[[L]]
*[[L!VE TV]]
*[[L&amp;H (disambiguation)|L&amp;H]]
*[[Leivonmäki]]
*[[London]]
...
*List of articles starting with the letter K
*List of articles starting with the letter L ''(itself; OK)''
*List of articles starting with the letter M
...
| style="width:20%;"| List of articles about places:
*[[Asia]]
*[[Enoshima]]
*[[Germany]]
*[[Leivonmäki]]
*[[Katase River]]
| style="width:20%;"| List of articles about Japan:
*[[Emperor Showa]]
*[[Enoshima]]
*[[Katase River]]
*[[Mount Fuji]]
*[[Tokyo]]
| style="width:20%;"| List of all lists that do not contain themselves:
*List of articles about Japan
*List of articles about people
*List of articles about places
...
*List of articles starting with the letter K
*List of articles starting with the letter M
...
*'''List of all lists that do not contain themselves?'''
|}

If the "List of all lists that do not contain themselves" contains itself, then it does not belong to itself and should be removed. However, if it does not list itself, then it should be added to itself.

While appealing, these [[layman]]'s versions of the paradox share a drawback: an easy refutation of the barber paradox seems to be that such a barber does not exist, or that the barber is a woman and therefore doesn't shave. The whole point of Russell's paradox is that the answer "such a set does not exist" means the definition of the notion of set within a given theory is unsatisfactory. Note the difference between the statements "such a set does not exist" and "it is an [[empty set]]". It is like the difference between saying "There is no bucket" and saying "The bucket is empty".

A notable exception to the above may be the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]], in which words and meaning are the elements of the scenario rather than people and hair-cutting. Though it is easy to refute the barber's paradox by saying that such a barber does not (and ''cannot'') exist, it is impossible to say something similar about a meaningfully defined word.

One way that the paradox has been dramatised is as follows:

:Suppose that every public library has to compile a catalogue of all its books. Since the catalogue is itself one of the library's books, some librarians include it in the catalogue for completeness; while others leave it out as it being one of the library's books is self-evident.

:Now imagine that all these catalogues are sent to the national library. Some of them include themselves in their listings, others do not. The national librarian compiles two master catalogues—one of all the catalogues that list themselves, and one of all those that don't.

:The question is: should these master catalogues list themselves? The 'Catalogue of all catalogues that list themselves' is no problem. If the librarian doesn't include it in its own listing, it remains a true catalogue of those catalogues that do include themselves. If he ''does'' include it, it remains a true catalogue of those that list themselves.

:However, just as the librarian cannot go wrong with the first master catalogue, he is doomed to fail with the second. When it comes to the 'Catalogue of all catalogues that don't list themselves', the librarian cannot include it in its own listing, because then it would include itself, and so belongs to the ''other'' catalogue, that of catalogues that do include themselves. However, if the librarian leaves it out, the catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can never be a true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves.

==Applications and related topics==

===Russell-like paradoxes===
As illustrated above for the barber paradox, Russell's paradox is not hard to extend. Take:

* A [[transitive verb]] &lt;V&gt;, that can be applied to its [[substantive]] form.

Form the sentence:

:The &lt;V&gt;er that &lt;V&gt;s all (and only those) who don't &lt;V&gt; themselves,

Sometimes the "all" is replaced by "all &lt;V&gt;ers".

An example would be "paint":

:The ''paint''er that ''paint''s all (and only those) that don't ''paint'' themselves.
or "elect"
:The ''elect''or ([[Group representation|representative]]), that ''elect''s all that don't ''elect'' themselves.

Paradoxes that fall in this scheme include:

* [[Barber paradox|The barber with "shave"]].
* The original Russell's paradox with "contain": The container (Set) that contains all (containers) that don't contain themselves.
* The [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] with "describer": The describer (word) that describes all words, that don't describe themselves.
* [[Richard's paradox]] with "denote": The denoter (number) that denotes all denoters (numbers) that don't denote themselves. (In this paradox, all descriptions of numbers get an assigned number. The term "that denotes all denoters (numbers) that don't denote themselves" is here called ''Richardian''.)

==Related paradoxes==
* The [[liar paradox]] and [[Epimenides paradox]], whose origins are ancient
* The [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]], showing that the original [[lambda calculus]] is inconsistent, by means of a self-negating statement
* [[Curry's paradox]] (named after [[Haskell Curry]]), which does not require [[negation]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6180">The '''Soiled Dove Plea''' was a speech delivered by the attorney [[Temple Lea Houston]] on behalf of a hopelessly guilty [[prostitution|prostitute]], Minnie Stacey, in 1899 in [[Woodward, Oklahoma]]. The accused prostitute was scheduled to be tried for prostitution one morning and the judge discovered she had neither attorney nor money. Houston agreed to defend her and delivered extemporaneously the Soiled Dove speech also known as the '''Plea for a Fallen Woman'''.  It is considered by many [[trial attorney]]s to be the perfect closing argument.  The all-male jury acquitted the accused by unanimous verdict as soon as they reached the jury room.

The speech was as follows: 

:"Gentlemen of the jury: You heard with what cold cruelty the prosecution referred to the sins of this woman, as if her condition were of her own preference. The evidence has painted you a picture of her life and surroundings. Do you think that they were embraced of her own choosing? Do you think that she willingly embraced a life so revolting and horrible? Ah, no! Gentlemen, one of our own sex was the author of her ruin, more to blame than she.

:Then let us judge her gently. What could be more pathetic than the spectacle she presents? An immortal soul in ruin! Where the star of purity once glittered on her girlish brow, burning shame has set its seal and forever. And only a moment ago, they reproached her for the depths to which she had sunk, the company she kept, the life she led. Now, what else is left her? Where can she go and her sin not pursue her? Gentlemen, the very promises of God are denied her. He said: "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest." She has indeed labored, and is heavily laden, but if, at this instant she were to kneel before us all and confess to her Redeemer and beseech His tender mercies, where is the church that would receive her? And even if they accepted her, when she passed the portals to worship and to claim her rest, scorn and mockery would greet her; those she met would gather around them their spirits the more closely to avoid the pollution of her touch. And would you tell me a single employment where she can realize "Give us our daily bread?"

:Our sex wrecked her once pure life. Her own sex shrink from her as they would the pestilence. Society has reared its relentless walls against her, and only in the friendly shelter of the grave can her betrayed and broken heart ever find the Redeemer's promised rest.

:They told you of her assumed names, as fleeting as the shadows on the walls, of her sins, her habits, but they never told you of her sorrows, and who shall tell what her heart, sinful though it may be, now feels? When the remembered voices of mother and sisters, whom she must see no more on this earth, fall again like music on her erring soul, and she prays God that she could only return, and must not—no—not in this life, for the seducer has destroyed the soul.

:You know the story of the prodigal son, but he was a son. He was one of us, like her destroyers; but for the prodigal daughter there is no return. Were she with her wasted form and bleeding feet to drag herself back to home, she, the fallen and the lost, which would be her welcome? Oh, consider this when you come to decide her guilt, for she is before us and we must judge her. They (the prosecution) sneer and scoff at her. One should respect her grief, and I tell you that there reigns over her penitent and chastened spirit a desolation now that none, no, none but the Searcher of all hearts can ever know.

:None of us are utterly evil, and I remember that when the [[yellow fever|Saffron Scourge]] swept over the city of Memphis in 1878, a courtesan there opened wide the doors of her gilded palace of sin to admit the sufferers, and when the scythe of the Reaper swung fast and pitiless, she was angelic in her ministering. Death called her in the midst of her mercies, and she went to join those she tried to save. She, like those the Lord forgave, was a sinner, and yet I believe that in the days of reckoning her judgment will be lighter than those who would prosecute and seek to drive off the earth such poor unfortunates as her whom you are to judge.

:They wish to fine this woman and make her leave. They wish to wring from the wages of her shame the price of this meditated injustice; to take from her the little money she might have—and God knows, gentlemen, it came hard enough. The old Jewish law told you that the price of a dog, nor the bite of such as she, should come not within the house of the Lord, and I say unto you that our justice, fitly symbolized by this woman's form, does not ask that you add to the woes of this unhappy one, one only asks at your hands the pitiful privilege of being left alone.

:The Master, while on Earth, while He spake in wrath and rebuke to the kings and rulers, never reproached one of these. One he forgave. Another he acquitted. You remember both—and now looking upon this friendless outcast, if any of you can say to her, 'I am holier than thou' in the respect which she is charged with sinning, who is he? The Jews who brought the woman before the Savior have been held up to execution for two thousand years. I always respected them. A man who will yield to the reproaches of his conscience as they did has the element of good in him, but the modern hypocrite has no such compunctions. If the prosecutors of the woman whom you are trying had brought her before the Savior, they would have accepted His challenge and each one gathered a rock and stoned her, in the twinkling of an eye. No, Gentlemen, do as your Master did twice under the same circumstances that surround you. Tell her to go in peace."&lt;ref name=Wikisource&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Soiled_Dove_Plea&lt;/ref&gt;

This speech is in the public domain worldwide because the author died at least 100 years ago.&lt;ref name=Wikisource/&gt;

'''''Sous rature''''' is a strategic philosophical device originally developed by [[Martin Heidegger]]. Usually translated as 'under erasure', it involves the crossing out of a word within a text, but allowing it to remain legible and in place. Used extensively by [[Jacques Derrida]], it signifies that a word is "inadequate yet necessary";&lt;ref&gt;Madan Sarup, ''An Introductory Guide to Post-Structuralism and Postmodernism'' p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; that a particular [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]] is not wholly suitable for the concept it represents, but must be used as the constraints of our language offer nothing better.

In the philosophy of [[deconstruction]], ''sous rature'' has been described as the typographical expression that seeks to identify sites within texts where key terms and concepts may be paradoxical or self-undermining, rendering their meaning undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, V.E. &amp; Winquist, C.E. 2001, Encyclopaedia of Postmodernism, Taylor &amp; Francis, London, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey|Belsey C]] 2001, ''Critical Practice'' 2nd ed., Routledge, London, p116&lt;/ref&gt; To extend this notion, deconstruction and the practice of ''sous rature'' also seek to demonstrate that meaning is derived from difference, not by reference to a pre-existing notion or freestanding idea.&lt;ref&gt;Belsey, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Sous rature'' as a literary practice originated in the works of German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976). The practice of placing words or terms under erasure first appeared in Heidegger's work ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', Heidegger's lecture course of 1929/30. And subsequently in a letter he penned to [[Ernst Jünger]] in 1956 titled "Zur Seinsfrage" (The Question of Being), in which Heidegger seeks to define [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Spivak, GC]] 1997, “Translator’s Preface” in Derrida, J. 1967, ''Of Grammatology'', Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the letter, Heidegger also begins to speculate about the problematic nature of defining anything, let alone words.  In particular, the meaning of the term ‘Being’ is contested and Heidegger crosses out the word, but lets both the deletion and the word remain. “Since the word is inaccurate, it is crossed out. Since it is necessary, it remains legible.”&lt;ref&gt;Spivak, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Heideggerian model, erasure expressed the problem of presence and absence of meaning in language. Heidegger was concerned with trying to return the absent meaning to the present meaning and the placing of a word or term under erasure “simultaneously recognised and questioned the term’s meaning and accepted use”.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 113"&gt;Taylor, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) adopted this technique and further explored the implications of Heidegger's erasure and its application in the wider setting of deconstructive literary theory. Derrida extended the problem of presence and absence to include the notion that erasure does not mark a lost presence, rather the potential impossibility of presence altogether - in other words, the potential impossibility of univocity of meaning ever having been attached to the word or term in the first place. Ultimately, Derrida argued, it was not just the particular signs that were placed under erasure, but the whole system of [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 113"/&gt;

The phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are realized as [[approximant consonant|approximants]] (namely {{IPA|[{{IPA link|β̞}}, {{IPA link|ð̞}}, {{IPA link|ɣ˕}}]}}, hereafter represented without the [[Relative articulation#Raised and lowered|downtack]]) or [[fricative consonant|fricatives]]&lt;ref&gt;The continuant allophones of Spanish {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} have been traditionally described as voiced ''fricatives''
(e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1918}}, who (in §100) describes the air friction of {{IPA|[ð]}} as being "''tenue y suave''" ('weak and smooth'); {{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Dalbor|1969/1997}}; and {{Harvcoltxt|Macpherson|1975|p=62}}, who describes {{IPA|[β]}} as being "...with audible friction"). However, they are more often described as ''approximants'' in recent literature, such as {{Harvcoltxt|D'Introno|Del Teso|Weston|1995}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|Fernández Planas|Carrera Sabaté|2003}}; and {{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2005|p=43}}. The difference hinges primarily on air turbulence caused by extreme narrowing of the opening between [[manner of articulation|articulators]], which is present in fricatives and absent in approximants. {{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|2004}} displays a sound spectrogram of the Spanish word ''abogado'' showing an absence of turbulence for all three consonants.&lt;/ref&gt; in all places except after a pause, after a [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]], or—in the case of {{IPA|/d/}}—after a [[lateral consonant]]; in such contexts they are realized as voiced [[stop consonant|stops]].&lt;ref name="carrera257"/&gt;

The phoneme {{IPA|/ʝ/}} is realized as an approximant in all contexts except after a pause, a nasal, or a lateral. In these environments, it may be realized as an [[affricate consonant|affricate]] ({{IPAblink|ɟʝ}}).&lt;ref name="carrera258"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|Fernández Planas|Carrera Sabaté|2003|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trager"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trager|1942|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approximant allophone differs from non-syllabic {{IPA|/i/}} in a number of ways; it has a lower [[formant|F2]] amplitude, is longer, can only appear in the syllable onset (including word-initially, where non-syllabic {{IPA|/i/}} normally never appears), is a [[voiced palatal fricative|palatal fricative]] in emphatic pronunciations, and is unspecified for rounding (e.g. ''v'''iu'''da'' {{IPA|[ˈbjuða]}} 'widow' vs ''a'''yu'''da'' {{IPA|[aˈʝʷuða]}} 'help').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|2004|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two also overlap in distribution after {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}: ''en'''ye'''sar'' {{IPA|[eɲɟʝeˈsaɾ]}} ('to plaster') ''an'''ie'''go'' {{IPA|[aˈnjeɣo]}} ('flood').&lt;ref name="Trager" /&gt; Although there is dialectal and ideolectal variation, speakers may also exhibit other near-minimal pairs like ''ab'''ye'''cto'' ('abject') vs ''ab'''ie'''rto'' ('opened').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bowen|Stockwell|1955|p=236}} cite the minimal pair '''''ya''' visto'' {{IPA|[(ɟ)ʝa ˈβisto]}} ('I already dress') vs '''''y ha''' visto'' {{IPA|[ja ˈβisto]}} ('and he has seen')&lt;/ref&gt; There are some [[#Alternations|alternations]] between the two, prompting scholars like {{Harvcoltxt|Alarcos Llorach|1950}}&lt;ref&gt;cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; to postulate an [[archiphoneme]] {{IPA|/{{serif|I}}/}}, so that ''ley'' {{IPA|[lei̯]}} would be transcribed phonemically as {{IPA|/ˈle{{serif|I}}/}} and ''leyes'' {{IPA|[ˈleʝes]}} as {{IPA|/ˈle{{serif|I}}es/}}.

In a number of varieties, including some American ones, a process parallel to the one distinguishing non-syllabic {{IPA|/i/}} from consonantal {{IPA|/ʝ/}} occurs for non-syllabic {{IPA|/u/}} and a rare consonantal {{IPA|/w̝/}}.&lt;ref name="Trager" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Generally {{IPA|/w̝/}} is {{IPA|[ɣʷ]}} though it may also be {{IPA|[βˠ]}} ({{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|Lorentz|1977|p=590}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1961}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Near-minimal pairs include ''des'''hue'''sar'' {{IPA|[dezw̝eˈsaɾ]}} ('to bone') vs. ''des'''ue'''llo'' {{IPA|[deˈsweʎo]}} ('skinning'), ''son '''hue'''vos'' {{IPA|[ˈsoŋ ˈw̝eβos]}} ('they are eggs') vs ''son n'''ue'''vos'' {{IPA|[ˈsoⁿ ˈnweβos]}} ('they are new'),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''''hua'''ca'' {{IPA|[ˈ(ɡ)w̝aka]}} ('Indian grave') vs '''''u o'''ca'' {{IPA|[ˈwoka]}} ('or goose').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bowen|Stockwell|1955|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many young Argentinians have no distinct {{IPA|/ɲ/}} phoneme and use the {{IPA|/ni/}} sequence instead, thus making no distinction between ''huraño'' and ''uranio'' (both {{IPA|[uˈɾanjo]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Coloma|2018|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phoneme {{IPA|/ʎ/}} (as distinct from {{IPA|/ʝ/}}) is found in some areas in [[Peninsular Spanish|Spain]] (mostly northern and rural) and some areas of [[Latin American Spanish|South America]] (mostly highlands).

Most speakers in Spain (except for Western Andalusia and all Canary Islands), including the variety prevalent on radio and television, have both {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} (''distinción''). However, speakers in Latin America and those parts of southern Spain have only {{IPA|/s/}} (''seseo''). Some speakers in southernmost Spain (especially coastal Andalusia) have only {{IPAblink|s̄}} (a consonant similar to {{IPA|/θ/}}) and not {{IPA|/s/}} (''ceceo''). This "ceceo" is not entirely unknown in the Americas, especially in coastal Peru. The phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} has three different pronunciations ("laminal s", "apical s" or "apical dental s") [[#Realization of /s/|depending on dialect]].

The phonemes {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolars]] ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|t̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪}}]}}).&lt;ref name="carrera257"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|Fernández Planas|Carrera Sabaté|2003|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} becomes [[dental consonant|dental]] {{IPA|[s̪]}} before denti-alveolar consonants,&lt;ref name="carrera258"/&gt; while {{IPA|/θ/}} remains [[interdental consonant|interdental]] {{IPA|[θ̟]}} in all contexts.&lt;ref name="carrera258"/&gt;

Before front vowels {{IPA|/i, e/}}, the velar consonants {{IPA|/k, ɡ, x/}} (including the lenited allophone of {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) are realized as post-palatal {{IPA|[{{IPA link|k̟}}, {{IPA link|ɡ˖}}, {{IPA link|x̟}}, {{IPA link|ɣ˕˖}}]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canellada|Madsen|1987|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some authors,&lt;ref&gt;For example {{Harvcoltxt|Chen|2007}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hamond|2001}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/x/}} is [[Voiceless velar fricative#Voiceless post-velar fricative|post-velar]] or [[Voiceless uvular fricative|uvular]] in the Spanish of northern and central Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chen|2007|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hamond|2001|p=?}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Scipione|Sayahi|2005|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|Vincent|1988|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others&lt;ref&gt;such as {{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|Fernández Planas|Carrera Sabaté|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe {{IPA|/x/}} as velar in European Spanish, with a [[uvular consonant|uvular]] allophone ({{IPAblink|χ}}) appearing before {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} (including when {{IPA|/u/}} is in the syllable onset as {{IPA|[w]}}).&lt;ref name="carrera258"/&gt;

A common pronunciation of {{IPA|/f/}} in nonstandard speech is the [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] {{IPAblink|ɸ}}, so that '''''f'''uera'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈɸweɾa]}} rather than {{IPA|[ˈfweɾa]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Boyd-Bowman|1953|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton15"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Flórez|1951|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kany|1960|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lenz|1940|p=92 et seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zapata Arellano|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some Extremaduran, western Andalusian, and American varieties, this softened realization of {{IPA|/f/}}, when it occurs before {{IPA|/w/}}, is subject to merger with {{IPA|/x/}}; in some areas the homophony of ''fuego''/''juego'' is resolved by replacing ''fuego'' with ''lumbre'' or ''candela''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mott|2011|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penny|2000|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA|/ʃ/}} is a marginal phoneme that occurs only in loanwords; many speakers have difficulty with this sound, tending to replace it with {{IPA|/tʃ/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}. In a number of dialects (most notably, Northern Mexican Spanish, informal Chilean Spanish, and some Caribbean and Andalusian accents) {{IPAblink|ʃ}} occurs, as a [[Lenition|deaffricated]] {{IPA|/tʃ/}}.&lt;ref name="cotton15"/&gt; In parts of Argentina and Uruguay, {{IPAblink|ʃ}} is used instead of [ʝ] and [ʎ], a form of [[yeísmo]].

===Consonant neutralizations===
Some of the [[phonemic contrast]]s between consonants in Spanish are lost in certain phonological environments, and especially in syllable-final position. In these cases the phonemic contrast is said to be [[Phoneme#Neutralization and archiphonemes|neutralized]].

====Sonorants====
=====Nasals and laterals=====
The three [[nasal stop|nasal phonemes]]—{{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, and {{IPA|/ɲ/}}—maintain their contrast when in syllable-initial position (e.g. ''ca'''m'''a'' 'bed', ''ca'''n'''a'' 'grey hair', ''ca'''ñ'''a'' 'sugar cane'). In syllable-final position, this three-way contrast is lost as nasals assimilate to the [[place of articulation]] of the following consonant&lt;ref name="carrera258"/&gt;—even across a word boundary;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cressey|1978|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, if a nasal is followed by a pause rather than a consonant, it is realized for most speakers as alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} (though in Caribbean varieties this may instead be {{IPAblink|ŋ}} or an omitted nasal with nasalization of the preceding vowel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|MacDonald|1989|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus {{IPA|/n/}} is realized as {{IPA|[m]}} before labial consonants, and as {{IPAblink|ŋ}} before velar ones.

Similarly, {{IPA|/l/}} assimilates to the place of articulation of a following [[coronal consonant]], i.e. a consonant that is interdental, dental, alveolar, or palatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1918|p=§111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalbor 1980"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dalbor|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Introno|Del Teso|Weston|1995|pp=118–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assimilatory nasal and lateral allophones are shown in the following table:

=====Rhotics=====
The [[alveolar trill]] {{IPAblink|r}} and the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPAblink|ɾ}} are in phonemic contrast word-internally between vowels (as in ''ca'''rr'''o'' 'car' vs ''ca'''r'''o'' 'expensive'), but are otherwise in [[complementary distribution]]. Only the trill can occur after {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, or  {{IPA|/s/}} (e.g. ''al'''r'''ededor'', ''en'''r'''iquecer'', ''Is'''r'''ael''), and word-initially (e.g. '''''r'''ey'' 'king'). After a stop or fricative consonant (but not {{IPA|/s/}}), only the tap can occur (e.g. ''t'''r'''es'' 'three', ''f'''r'''ío'' 'cold').

In syllable-final position, inside a word, the tap is more frequent, but the trill can also occur (especially in emphatic&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Introno|Del Teso|Weston|1995|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; or oratorical&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; style) with no semantic difference—thus ''arma'' ('weapon') may be either {{IPA|[ˈaɾma]}} (tap) or {{IPA|[ˈarma]}} (trill).&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''word''-final position the rhotic is usually:
* either a tap or a trill when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[r ~ ɾ]}} ''paterno'' ('paternal love'), the former being more common;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2005|pp=182–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a tap when followed by a vowel-initial word, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[ɾ]}} ''eterno'' ('eternal love').

When two rhotics occur consecutively across a word or prefix boundary, they result in one trill, so that ''da rocas'' ('s/he gives rocks') and ''dar rocas'' ('to give rocks') are either neutralized, or distinguished by a longer trill in the latter phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2005|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tap/trill alternation has prompted a number of authors to postulate a single [[Underlying representation|underlying]] [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic]]; the intervocalic contrast then results from [[gemination]] (e.g. ''tierra'' {{IPA|/ˈtieɾɾa/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈtjera]}} 'earth').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bowen|Stockwell|Silva-Fuenzalida|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bonet|Mascaró|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Obstruents====
The phonemes {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/s/}},&lt;ref name="carrera258"/&gt; and {{IPA|/f/}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|p=37 n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Introno|Del Teso|Weston|1995|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; become voiced before voiced consonants as in ''jazmín'' ('Jasmine') {{IPA|[xaðˈmin]}}, ''rasgo'' ('feature') {{IPA|[ˈrazɣo]}}, and ''Afganistán'' ('[[Afghanistan]]') {{IPA|[avɣanisˈtan]}}. There is a certain amount of free variation in this so that ''jazmín'' can be pronounced {{IPA|[xaθˈmin]}} or {{IPA|[xaðˈmin]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both in casual and in formal speech, there is no phonemic contrast between [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced and voiceless]] consonants placed in syllable-final position. The merged phoneme is typically pronounced as a relaxed, voiced [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] or [[Approximant consonant|approximant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1918|loc=§98, §125}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a variety of other realizations are also possible. So the clusters -''bt''- and -''pt''- in the words ''obtener'' and ''optimista'' are pronounced exactly the same way:
* ''o'''b'''tener'' {{IPA|/obteˈner/ &gt; [oβteˈner]}}
* ''o'''p'''timista'' {{IPA|/obtiˈmista/ &gt; [oβtiˈmista]}}
Similarly, the spellings ''-dm-'' and ''-tm-'' are often merged in pronunciation, as well as -''gd''- and -''cd''-:
* ''a'''d'''minículo'' {{IPA|/admiˈnikulo/ &gt; [aðmiˈnikulo]}}
* ''a'''t'''mosférico'' {{IPA|/admosˈfeɾiko/ &gt; [aðmosˈfeɾiko]}}
* ''amí'''g'''dala'' {{IPA|/aˈmiɡdala/ &gt; [aˈmiɣðala]}}
* ''ané'''c'''dota'' {{IPA|/aˈneɡdota/ &gt; [aˈneɣðota]}}

==Vowels==

Spanish has five vowels {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} (the same that are found in [[Asturian language #vowels|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language#Vowels|Aragonese]], [[Basque language#Vowels|Basque]] and [[Leonese dialect#Phonology and writing|Leonese]]). Each occurs in both stressed and unstressed syllables:&lt;ref name="carrera256"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|Fernández Planas|Carrera Sabaté|2003|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Nevertheless, there are some distributional gaps or rarities. For instance, an unstressed [[high vowel]] in the final syllable of a word is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=78, 145}}. Examples include words of Greek origin like ''énfasis'' {{IPA|/ˈenfasis/}} ('emphasis'); the clitics ''su'' {{IPA|/su/}}, ''tu'' {{IPA|/tu/}}, ''mi'' {{IPA|/mi/}}; the three Latin words ''espíritu'' {{IPA|/esˈpiɾitu/}} ('spirit'), ''tribu'' {{IPA|/ˈtɾibu/}} ('tribe'), and ''ímpetu'' {{IPA|/ˈimpetu/}} ('impetus'); and affective words like ''mami'' {{IPA|/ˈmami/}} and ''papi'' {{IPA|/ˈpapi/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of substratal Quechua, at least some speakers from southern Colombia down through Peru can be analyzed to have only three vowel phonemes {{IPA|/i, u, a/}}, as the close {{IPA|[i, u]}} are continually confused with the mid {{IPA|[e, o]}}, resulting in pronunciations such as {{IPA|[dolˈsoɾa]}} for ''dulzura'' ('sweetness'). When Quechua-dominant bilinguals have {{IPA|/e, o/}} in their phonemic inventory, they realize them as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}}, which are heard by outsiders as variants of {{IPA|/i, u/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of those features are viewed as strongly non-standard by other speakers.

===Allophones===
Phonetic nasalization occurs for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal, e.g. ''cinco'' {{IPA|[ˈθiŋko]}} ('five').&lt;ref name="carrera256"/&gt;

Arguably, Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish have ten phonemic vowels, with each of the above vowels paired by a lowered or fronted and lengthened version, e.g. ''la madre'' {{IPA|[la ˈmaðɾe]}} ('the mother') vs. ''las madres'' {{IPA|[læ̞ː ˈmæ̞ːðɾɛː]}} ('the mothers').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|p=?}}. The first {{IPA|/a/}} in ''madres'' also undergoes this fronting process as part of a vowel harmony system. See [[#Realization of /s/]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these are more commonly analyzed as allophones triggered by an underlying {{IPA|/s/}} that is subsequently deleted.

====Exact number of allophones====
There is no agreement among scholars on how many vowel allophones Spanish has; an often&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|Fernández Planas|Carrera Sabaté|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulated number is five {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|e̞}}, {{IPA link|o̞}}, {{IPA link|a̠}}]}}.

Some scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Such as {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, state that Spanish has ''eleven'' allophones: the close and mid vowels have close {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|e}}, {{IPA link|o}}]}} and open {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i̞}}, {{IPA link|u̞}}, {{IPA link|ɛ}}, {{IPA link|ɔ}}]}} allophones, whereas {{IPA|/a/}} appears in front {{IPAblink|a}}, central {{IPAblink|a̠}} and back {{IPAblink|ɑ}} variants. These symbols appear only in the narrowest variant of phonetic transcription; in more broad variants, only the symbols {{IPA|[i, u, e, o, a]}} are used,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nowikow|2012|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that is the convention adopted in this article as well (save for this section, for the sake of clarity).

Tomás Navarro Tomás describes the distribution of said eleven allophones as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1918}}, cited on [http://liceu.uab.cat/~joaquim/phonetics/fon_esp/IPA_vow_sp.html Joaquim Llisterri's site]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Close vowels {{IPA|/i, u/}}

** The central allophone {{IPAblink|a̠}} appears in all other cases, e.g. in the word ''c'''a'''s'''a''''' {{IPA|[ˈka̠sa̠]}}

According to Eugenio Martínez Celdrán, however, systematic classification of Spanish allophones is impossible due to the fact that their occurrence varies from speaker to speaker and from region to region. According to him, the exact degree of openness of Spanish vowels depends not so much on the phonetic environment, but rather on various external factors accompanying speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|1984|pp=289, 294, 301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish has six falling [[diphthong]]s and eight rising diphthongs.  While many diphthongs are historically the result of a recategorization of vowel sequences (hiatus) as diphthongs, there is still lexical contrast between diphthongs and [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|Hualde|2007|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also some lexical items that vary amongst speakers and dialects between hiatus and diphthong: words like ''biólogo'' ('biologist') with a potential diphthong in the first syllable and words like ''diálogo'' with a stressed or pretonic sequence of {{IPA|/i/}} and a vowel vary between a diphthong and hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|Hualde|2007|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|Hualde|2007}} hypothesize that this is because vocalic sequences are longer in these positions.

In addition to [[synalepha]] across word boundaries, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs in fast speech; when this happens, one vowel becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel, in which case they fuse together) as in ''poeta'' {{IPA|[ˈpo̯eta]}} ('poet') and ''maestro'' {{IPA|[ˈmae̯stɾo]}} ('teacher').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez Celdrán|Fernández Planas|Carrera Sabaté|2003|pp=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the relatively rare diphthong {{IPA|/eu/}} may be reduced to {{IPA|[u]}} in certain unstressed contexts, as in ''Eufemia'', {{IPA|[uˈfemja]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of verbs like ''aliviar'' ('relieve'), diphthongs result from the suffixation of normal verbal morphology onto a stem-final {{IPA|/j/}} (that is, ''aliviar'' would be |{{IPA|alibj}}| + |{{IPA|ar}}|).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=99–101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with verbs like ''ampliar'' ('to extend') which, by their verbal morphology, seem to have stems ending in {{IPA|/i/}}.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=147–148}} for a more extensive list of verb stems ending in both high vowels, as well as their corresponding semivowels.&lt;/ref&gt;  Spanish also possesses [[triphthong]]s like {{IPA|/wei/}} and, in dialects that use a second person plural conjugation, {{IPA|/jai/}}, {{IPA|/jei/}}, and {{IPA|/wai/}} (e.g. ''buey'', 'ox'; ''cambiáis'', 'you change'; ''cambiéis'', '(that) you may change'; and ''averiguáis'', 'you ascertain').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-syllabic {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} can be reduced to {{IPA|[ʝ]}}, {{IPA|[w̝]}}, as in ''beatitud'' {{IPA|[bʝatiˈtuð]}} ('beatitude') and ''poetisa'' {{IPA|[pw̝eˈtisa]}} ('poetess'), respectively; similarly, non-syllabic {{IPA|/a/}} can be completely elided, as in (e.g. ''ahorita'' {{IPA|[oˈɾita]}} 'right away').  The frequency (though not the presence) of this phenomenon differs amongst dialects, with a number having it occur rarely and others exhibiting it always.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt| Bowen|Stockwell|1955|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosody==
Spanish is usually considered a [[Syllable-timed language#Syllable timing|syllable-timed language]]. Even so, stressed syllables can be up to 50% longer in duration than non-stressed syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Quilis|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although pitch, duration, and loudness contribute to the perception of stress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; pitch is the most important in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|García-Bellido|1997|p=492}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Contreras|1963}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Quilis|1971}}, and the ''Esbozo de una nueva gramática de la lengua española.'' (1973) by the ''Gramática de la Real Acedemia Española''&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary stress occurs on the [[Ultima (linguistics)|penultima]] (the next-to-last syllable) 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time, stress falls on the ultima and antepenultima (third-to-last syllable).&lt;ref name="Lleó"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lleó|2003|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonverbs are generally [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the penultimate syllable for vowel-final words and on the final syllable of consonant-final words. Exceptions are marked orthographically (see below), whereas regular words are underlyingly phonologically marked with a stress feature [+stress].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hochberg|1988|p=684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to exceptions to these tendencies, particularly learned words from Greek and Latin that feature antepenultimate stress, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s which contrast solely on stress such as ''sábana'' ('sheet') and ''sabana'' ('savannah'), as well as ''límite'' ('boundary'), ''limite'' ('[that] he/she limit')&lt;!-- sic: "limit" is subjunctive here --&gt; and ''limité'' ('I limited').

Lexical stress may be marked orthographically with an [[acute accent]] (''ácido'', ''distinción'', etc.).  This is done according to the mandatory stress rules of [[Spanish orthography]], which are similar to the tendencies above (differing with words like ''distinción'') and are defined so as to unequivocally indicate where the stress lies in a given written word.  An acute accent may also be used to differentiate homophones, such as ''mi'' (my), and ''mí'' (me). In such cases, the accent is used on the homophone that normally receives greater stress when used in a sentence.

Lexical stress patterns are different between words carrying verbal and nominal inflection: in addition to the occurrence of verbal affixes with stress (something absent in nominal inflection), underlying stress also differs in that it falls on the last syllable of the inflectional stem in verbal words while those of nominal words may have ultimate or penultimate stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|García-Bellido|1997|pp=473–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, amongst sequences of clitics suffixed to a verb, the rightmost clitic may receive secondary stress, e.g. ''búscalo'' {{IPA|/ˈbuskaˌlo/}} ('look for it').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|García-Bellido|1997|p=486}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1917|pp=381–382, 385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternations==
A number of alternations exist in Spanish that reflect diachronic changes in the language and arguably reflect [[morphophonological]] processes rather than strictly phonological ones.  For instance, a number of words alternate between {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}} or {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/x/}}, with the latter in each pair appearing before a front vowel:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" | word
! gloss

|-
| análo'''g'''o || {{IPA|/aˈnaloɡo/}} || 'analogous' || analo'''g'''ía || {{IPA|/analoˈxia/}} || 'analogy'
|}

Note that the conjugation of most verbs with a stem ending in {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ɡ/}} does ''not'' show this alternation; these segments do not turn into {{IPA|/θ/}} or {{IPA|/x/}} before a front vowel:

|-
| casti'''g'''o || {{IPA|/kasˈtiɡo/}} || 'I punish' || casti'''gu'''e || {{IPA|/kasˈtiɡe/}} || '(that) I/he/she punish (subjunctive)'
|}

There are also alternations between unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} and stressed {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/we/}} respectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| t'''o'''stó || {{IPA|/tosˈto/}} || 'he toasted' || t'''ue'''sto || {{IPA|/ˈtwesto/}} || 'I toast'
|}

Likewise, in a very small number of words, alternations occur between the palatal sonorants {{IPA|/ʎ ɲ/}} and their corresponding alveolar sonorants {{IPA|/l n/}} (''doncella''/''doncel'' 'maiden'/'youth', ''desdeñar''/''desdén'' 'to scorn'/'scorn').  This alternation does not appear in verbal or nominal inflection (that is, the plural of ''doncel'' is ''donceles'', not *''doncelles'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pensado|1997|pp=595–597}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the result of geminated {{IPA|/ll/}} and {{IPA|/nn/}} of [[Vulgar Latin]] (the origin of {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, respectively) degeminating and then depalatalizing in coda position.&lt;ref name="Pensado"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pensado|1997|p=608}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words without any palatal-alveolar allomorphy are the result of historical borrowings.&lt;ref name="Pensado" /&gt;

Other alternations include {{IPA|/ks/}} ~ {{IPA|/x/}} (''ane'''x'''o'' vs ''ane'''j'''o''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/kt/}} ~ {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (''no'''ct'''urno'' vs ''no'''ch'''e'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here the forms with {{IPA|/ks/}} and {{IPA|/kt/}} are historical borrowings and the forms with {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} forms are inherited from Vulgar Latin.

There are also pairs that show antepenultimate stress in nouns and adjectives but penultimate stress in synonymous verbs (''vómito'' 'vomit' vs. ''vomito'' 'I vomit').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonotactics==
{{ref improve section|date=April 2016}}
Spanish syllable structure can be summarized as follows; parentheses enclose optional components:
* (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) V (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;))

Spanish [[Syllable#Structure|syllable structure]] consists of an optional syllable onset, consisting of one or two consonants; an obligatory syllable nucleus, consisting of a vowel optionally preceded by and/or followed by a [[semivowel]]; and an optional syllable coda, consisting of one or two consonants.  The following restrictions apply:

* Onset
** First consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): Can be any consonant, including a liquid ({{IPA|/l, r/}}).
** Second consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): If and only if the first consonant is a stop {{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, ɡ/}} or a voiceless labiodental fricative {{IPA|/f/}}, a second consonant, always a liquid {{IPA|/l, r/}}, is permitted. Onsets {{IPA|/tl/}} and {{IPA|/dl/}} occur only in loanwords.
* Nucleus
** Semivowel (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)
** Vowel (V)
** Semivowel (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Coda
** First consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): Can be any consonant
** Second consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;): Must be {{IPA|/s/}}. A coda combination of two consonants appears only in loanwords (mainly from Classical Latin) but never in words inherited from Vulgar Latin.
** Medial codas assimilate place features of the following onsets and are often stressed.&lt;ref name="Lleó278"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lleó|2003|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximal onsets include '''''tr'''ansporte'' {{IPA|/tɾansˈpor.te/}}, '''''fl'''aco'' {{IPA|/ˈfla.ko/}}, '''''cl'''ave'' {{IPA|/ˈkla.be/}}.

Maximal nuclei include ''b'''uey''''' {{IPA|/buei/}}, ''Urug'''uay''''' {{IPA|/u.ɾuˈɡuai/}}.

Maximal codas include ''i'''ns'''talar'' {{IPA|/ins.taˈlar/}}, ''pe'''rs'''pectiva'' {{IPA|/pers.pekˈti.ba/}}.

In many dialects, a coda cannot be more than one consonant (one of n, r, l or s) in informal speech. Realizations like {{IPA|/trasˈpor.te/}}, {{IPA|/is.taˈlar/}}, {{IPA|/pes.pekˈti.ba/}} are very common, and in many cases, they are allowed even in formal speech.

Because of the phonotactic constraints, an epenthetic {{IPA|/e/}} is inserted before word-initial clusters beginning with {{IPA|/s/}} (e.g. ''escribir'' 'to write') but not word-internally (''transcribir'' 'to transcribe'),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cressey|1978|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby moving the initial {{IPA|/s/}} to a separate syllable. The epenthetic {{IPA|/e/}} is pronounced even when it is not reflected in spelling (e.g. the surname of [[Carlos Slim]] is pronounced {{IPA|/esˈlin/}}). While Spanish words undergo word-initial epenthesis, cognates in Latin and Italian do not:

* Lat. ''status'' {{IPA|/ˈsta.tus/}} ('state') ~ It. ''stato'' {{IPA|/ˈsta.to/}} ~ Sp. '''''e'''stado'' {{IPA|/esˈta.do/}}
* Lat. ''splendidus'' {{IPA|/ˈsplen.di.dus/}} ('splendid') ~ It. ''splendido'' {{IPA|/ˈsplen.di.do/}} ~ Sp. '''''e'''spléndido'' {{IPA|/esˈplen.di.do/}}
* Fr. ''slave'' {{IPA|/slav/}} ('Slav') ~ It. ''slavo'' {{IPA|/ˈsla.vo/}} ~ Sp. '''''e'''slavo'' {{IPA|/esˈla.bo/}}

Spanish syllable structure is phrasal, resulting in syllables consisting of phonemes from neighboring words in combination, sometimes even resulting in elision. The phenomenon is known in Spanish as ''enlace''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elearnspanishlanguage.com/pronunciation/enlace.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  For a brief discussion contrasting Spanish and English syllable structure, see {{Harvcoltxt|Whitley|2002|pp=32–35}}.

==Acquisition as a first language==

===Phonology===
[[Phonological development]] varies greatly by individual, both those developing regularly and those with delays. However, a general pattern of acquisition of phonemes can be inferred by the level of complexity of their features, i.e. by sound classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cataño|Barlow|Moyna|2009|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hierarchy may be constructed, and if a child is capable of producing a discrimination on one level, he/she will also be capable of making the discriminations of all prior levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cataño|Barlow|Moyna|2009|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first level consists of stops (without a voicing distinction), nasals, {{IPA|[l]}}, and optionally, a non-lateral approximant. This includes a [[Labial consonant|labial]]/[[Coronal consonant|coronal]] place difference (for example, {{IPA|[b]}} vs {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} vs {{IPA|[β]}}).
* The second level includes voicing distinction for oral stops and a [[Coronal consonant|coronal]]/[[Dorsal consonant|dorsal]] place difference. This allows for distinction between {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, and {{IPA|[k]}}, along with their voiced counterparts, as well as distinction between {{IPA|[l]}} and the approximant {{IPA|[j]}}.
* The third level includes fricatives and/or affricates.
* The fourth level introduces liquids other than {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[ɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. It also introduces {{IPA|[θ]}}.
* The fifth level introduces the trill {{IPA|[r]}}.

This hierarchy is based on production only, and is a representation of a child’s capacity to produce a sound, whether that sound is the correct target in adult speech or not. Thus, it may contain some sounds that are not included in the adult phonology, but produced as a result of error.

Spanish-speaking children will accurately produce most [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]] at a relatively early age. By around three-and-a-half years, they will no longer productively use phonological processes the majority of the time. Some common error patterns (found 10% or more of the time) are [[cluster reduction]], liquid simplification, and stopping. Less common patterns (evidenced less than 10% of the time) include [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatal fronting]], [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], and final [[Deletion (phonology)|consonant deletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Goldstein|Iglesias|1998|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical phonological analyses of Spanish consider the consonants {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} the [[Underlying representation|underlying phonemes]] and their corresponding approximants {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}}, and {{IPA|[ɣ]}} allophonic and derivable by [[phonological rule]]s. However, approximants may be the more basic form because monolingual Spanish-learning children learn to produce the continuant contrast between {{IPA|[p t k]}} and {{IPA|[β ð ɣ]}} before they do the lead voicing contrast between {{IPA|[p t k]}} and {{IPA|[b d ɡ]}}.&lt;ref name="Macken80b"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Macken|Barton|1980b|p=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In comparison, English-learning children are able to produce adult-like voicing contrasts for these stops well before age three.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Macken|Barton|1980b|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allophonic distribution of {{IPA|[b d ɡ]}} and {{IPA|[β ð ɣ]}} produced in adult speech is not learned until after age two and not fully mastered even at age four.&lt;ref name="Macken80b"/&gt;

The [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}} is one of the most difficult sounds to be produced in Spanish and as a result is acquired later in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carballo|Mendoza|2000|p=588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the alveolar trill is acquired and developed between the ages of three and six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carballo|Mendoza|2000|p=589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children acquire an adult-like trill within this period and some fail to properly acquire the trill.  The attempted trill sound of the poor trillers is often perceived as a series of [[Alveolar flap|taps]] owing to hyperactive tongue movement during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carballo|Mendoza|2000|p=596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trill is also very difficult for those learning Spanish as a second language, sometimes taking over a year to produce properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leibowitz|first1=Brandon|title=Spanish Phonology|url=http://www.fluencyfox.com/spanish-phonology/|publisher=Fluency Fox|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codas===
One research study found that children acquire medial [[Syllable coda|codas]] before final codas, and stressed codas before unstressed codas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lleó|2003|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since medial codas are often stressed and must undergo place assimilation, greater importance is accorded to their acquisition.&lt;ref name="Lleó278"/&gt; [[Liquid (linguistics)|Liquid]] and [[Nasal stop|nasal]] codas occur word medially and at the ends of frequently-used function words, so they are often acquired first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lleó|2003|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosody===
Research suggests that children overgeneralize stress rules when they are reproducing novel Spanish words and that they have a tendency to stress the penultimate syllables of antepenultimately stressed words, to avoid a violation of nonverb stress rules that they have acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hochberg|1988|p=683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the most frequent words heard by children have irregular stress patterns or are verbs, which violate nonverb stress rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hochberg|1988|p=685}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complicates stress rules until ages three to four, when stress acquisition is essentially complete, and children begin to apply these rules to novel irregular situations.

==Dialectal variation==
Some features, such as the pronunciation of voiceless stops {{IPA|/p t k/}}, have no dialectal variation.&lt;ref name="cotton55"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are numerous other features of pronunciation that differ from dialect to dialect.

===''Yeísmo''===
{{main|Yeísmo}}
One notable dialectal feature is the merging of the [[voiced palatal fricative]] {{IPAblink|ʝ}} (as in ''a'''y'''er'') with the [[palatal lateral approximant]] {{IPAblink|ʎ}} (as in ''ca'''ll'''e'') into one phoneme (''[[yeísmo]]''), with {{IPA|/ʎ/}} losing its laterality. While the distinction between these two sounds has traditionally been a feature of Castilian Spanish, this merger has spread throughout most of Spain in recent generations, particularly outside of regions in close linguistic contact with Catalan and Basque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Coloma|2011|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish America, most dialects are characterized by this merger, with the distinction persisting mostly in parts of Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and northwestern Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Coloma|2011|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other parts of Argentina, the phoneme resulting from the merger is realized as {{IPAblink|ʒ}};&lt;ref name="carrera258"/&gt; and in [[Buenos Aires]] the sound has recently been devoiced to {{IPAblink|ʃ}} among the younger population; the change is spreading throughout Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Latin American Spanish|last= Lipski|first= John|authorlink= |year= 1994|publisher= Longman Publishing|location= New York|isbn= |page= 170|pages= |accessdate=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Seseo'', ''ceceo'' and ''distinción''===
{{main|Seseo}}
[[File:IberianSeseo2a.PNG|thumb|upright=1.36|Map showing the presence or absence of {{IPA|[θ]}} in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Areas in light green are either ''seseo'' zones for Spanish and Galician or areas where other languages, not having the {{IPA|[s] / [θ]}} contrast, are spoken]]

Speakers in northern and central Spain, including the variety prevalent on radio and television, have both {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} (''distinción'', 'distinction'). However, speakers in Latin America, Canary Islands and some parts of southern Spain have only {{IPA|/s/}} (''seseo''), which in southernmost Spain is pronounced {{IPA|[θ]}} and not {{IPA|[s]}} (''ceceo'').&lt;ref name="carrera258"/&gt;

====Realization of {{IPA|/s/}}====
The phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} has three different pronunciations depending on the dialect area:&lt;ref name="carrera258"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalbor 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Obaid|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# An {{lcons|apical}} [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant|alveolar retracted fricative]] (or "[[apico-alveolar consonant|apico-alveolar]]" fricative) {{IPA|[s̺]}} sounds a bit like English {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and is characteristic of the northern and central parts of [[Spain]] and is also used by many speakers in Colombia's [[Antioquia department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Flórez|1957|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A {{lcons|laminal}} [[voiceless alveolar grooved fricative|alveolar grooved fricative]] {{IPA|[s]}}, much like the most common pronunciation of English {{IPA|/s/}}, is characteristic of western Andalusia (e.g. [[Málaga]], [[Seville]], and [[Cádiz]]), Canary Islands, and Latin America.
# An {{lcons|apical|}} [[Voiceless corono-dentoalveolar sibilant|dental grooved fricative]] {{IPA|[s̄]}} (ad hoc symbol), which has a lisping quality and sounds something like a cross between English {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}} but is different from the {{IPA|/θ/}} occurring in dialects that distinguish {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}}. It occurs in eastern Andalusia like in [[Granada]], [[Huelva]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]] and [[Almería]]. It occurs only in dialects with [[ceceo]].

Obaid describes the apico-alveolar sound as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Obaid|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|There is a Castilian ''s'', which is a voiceless, concave, apicoalveolar fricative: the tip of the tongue turned upward forms a narrow opening against the alveoli of the upper incisors. It resembles a faint {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and is found throughout much of the northern half of Spain.}}

Dalbor describes the apico-dental sound as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dalbor|1980|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|{{IPA|[s̄]}} is a voiceless, corono-dentoalveolar groove fricative, the so-called ''s coronal'' or ''s plana'' because of the relatively flat shape of the tongue body&amp;nbsp;... To this writer, the coronal {{IPA|[s̄]}}, heard throughout Andalusia, should be characterized by such terms as "soft," "fuzzy," or "imprecise," which, as we shall see, brings it quite close to one variety of {{IPA|/θ/}}&amp;nbsp;... Canfield has referred, quite correctly, in our opinion, to this {{IPA|[s̄]}} as "the lisping ''coronal-dental''," and Amado Alonso remarks how close it is to the post-dental {{IPA|[θ̦]}}, suggesting a combined symbol {{IPA|[θ&lt;sup&gt;ṣ&lt;/sup&gt;]}} to represent it.}}

In some dialects, {{IPA|/s/}} may become the approximant {{IPA|[ɹ]}} in the syllable coda (e.g. ''doscientos'' {{IPA|[doɹˈθjen̪tos]}} 'two hundred').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|2004|p=436}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Fougeron|1999}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Browman|Goldstein|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many places, it [[Debuccalization|debuccalizes]] to {{IPA|[h]}} in final position (e.g. ''niños'' {{IPA|[ˈniɲoh]}} 'children'), or before another consonant (e.g. ''fósforo'' {{IPA|[ˈfohfoɾo]}} 'match') so the change occurs in the [[Syllable coda|coda]] position in a syllable.

From an autosegmental point of view, the {{IPA|/s/}} phoneme in Madrid is defined only by its ''voiceless'' and ''fricative'' features. Thus, the point of articulation is not defined and is determined from the sounds following it in the word or sentence. In Madrid, the following realizations are found: {{IPA|/pesˈkado/}} &gt; {{IPA|[pexˈkao]}} and {{IPA|/ˈfosfoɾo/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈfofːoɾo]}}. In parts of southern Spain, the only feature defined for {{IPA|/s/}} appears to be ''voiceless'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://jotamartin.byethost33.com/alpi_aspira_e.php Isogloss map for ''s aspiration'' in the Iberian Peninsula]&lt;/ref&gt; it may lose its oral articulation entirely to become {{IPA|[h]}} or even a geminate with the following consonant ({{IPA|[ˈmihmo]}} or {{IPA|[ˈmimːo]}} from {{IPA|/ˈmismo/}} 'same').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Obaid|1973|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish, word-final {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/x/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[h]}}) regularly weaken, and the preceding vowel is lowered and lengthened:&lt;ref name="Vicente"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{IPA|/is/}} &gt; {{IPA|[i̞ː]}} e.g. ''mis'' {{IPA|[mi̞ː]}} ('my' pl)
: {{IPA|/es/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɛː]}} e.g. ''mes'' {{IPA|[mɛː]}} ('month')
: {{IPA|/as/}} &gt; {{IPA|[æ̞ː]}} e.g. ''más'' {{IPA|[mæ̞ː]}} ('plus')
: {{IPA|/os/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɔː]}} e.g. ''tos'' {{IPA|[tɔː]}} ('cough')
: {{IPA|/us/}} &gt; {{IPA|[u̞ː]}} e.g. ''tus'' {{IPA|[tu̞ː]}} ('your' pl)

A subsequent process of [[vowel harmony]] takes place so ''lejos'' ('far') is {{IPA|[ˈlɛxɔ]}}, ''tenéis'' ('you [plural] have') is {{IPA|[tɛˈnɛi]}} and ''tréboles'' ('clovers') is {{IPA|[ˈtɾɛβɔlɛ]}} or {{IPA|[ˈtɾɛβolɛ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lloret|2007|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coda simplification===
Southern European Spanish (Andalusian Spanish, Murcian Spanish, etc.) and several lowland dialects in Latin America (such as those from the Caribbean, Panama, and the Atlantic coast of Colombia) exhibit more extreme forms of simplification of coda consonants:
* word-final dropping of {{IPA|/s/}} (e.g. ''compás'' {{IPA|[komˈpa]}} 'musical beat' or 'compass')
* word-final dropping of nasals with nasalization of the preceding vowel (e.g. ''ven'' {{IPA|[bẽ]}} 'come')
* {{IPA|/r/}} in the infinitival morpheme (e.g. ''comer'' {{IPA|[koˈme]}} 'to eat')
* the occasional dropping of coda consonants word-internally (e.g. ''doctor'' {{IPA|[doˈto(r)]}} 'doctor').&lt;ref name="Guitart"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guitart|1997|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dropped consonants appear when additional suffixation occurs (e.g. ''compa'''s'''es'' {{IPA|[komˈpase]}} 'beats', ''ve'''n'''ían'' {{IPA|[beˈni.ã]}} 'they were coming', ''come'''r'''emos'' {{IPA|[komeˈɾemo]}} 'we will eat'). Similarly, a number of coda assimilations occur:
* {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} may neutralize to {{IPA|[j]}} (e.g. [[Cibao|Cibaeño]] Dominican ''celda''/''cerda'' {{IPA|[ˈsejða]}} 'cell'/'bristle'), to {{IPA|[l]}} (e.g. Caribbean Spanish ''alma''/''arma'' {{IPA|[ˈalma]}} 'soul'/'weapon', Andalusian Spanish ''sartén'' {{IPA|[salˈtẽ]}}), to {{IPA|[r]}} (e.g. Andalusian Spanish ''alma''/''arma'' {{IPA|[ˈarma]}}) or, by complete regressive assimilation, to a copy of the following consonant (e.g. ''pulga''/''purga'' {{IPA|[ˈpuɡːa]}} 'flea'/'purge', ''carne'' {{IPA|[ˈkanːe]}} 'meat').&lt;ref name="Guitart" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/x/}}, (and {{IPA|/θ/}} in southern Peninsular Spanish) and {{IPA|/f/}} may be debuccalized or elided in the coda (e.g. ''los amigos'' {{IPA|[lo(h) aˈmiɣo(h)]}} 'the friends').&lt;ref name="Guitart1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guitart|1997|p=517}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stops and nasals may be realized as velar (e.g. Cuban and Venezuelan ''étnico'' {{IPA|[ˈeɡniko]}} 'ethnic', ''himno'' {{IPA|[ˈiŋno]}}).&lt;ref name="Guitart1" /&gt;

Final {{IPA|/d/}} dropping (e.g. ''mitad'' {{IPA|[miˈta]}} 'half') is general in most dialects of Spanish, even in formal speech.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The deletions and neutralizations show variability in their occurrence, even with the same speaker in the same utterance, so nondeleted forms exist in the underlying structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guitart|1997|pp=515, 517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects may not be on the path to eliminating coda consonants since deletion processes have been existing for more than four centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guitart|1997|pp=518, 527}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Boyd-Bowman|1975}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Labov|1994|p=595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Harvcoltxt|Guitart|1997}} argues that it is the result of speakers acquiring multiple phonological systems with uneven control like that of second language learners.

In Standard European Spanish, the voiced obstruents {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} before a pause are devoiced and laxed to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|β̥˕}}, {{IPA link|ð̥˕}}, {{IPA link|ɣ̊˕}}]}}, as in ''clu'''b''''' {{IPA|[kluβ̥˕]}} ('[social] club'), ''se'''d''''' {{IPA|[seð̥]}} ('thirst'), ''zigza'''g''''' {{IPA|[θiɣˈθaɣ̊˕]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wetzels|Mascaró|2001|p=224}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, word-final {{IPA|/b/}} is rare, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} even more so. They are restricted mostly to loanwords and foreign names, such as the first name of former [[Real Madrid]] sports director [[Predrag Mijatović]], which is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpɾeð̞ɾaɣ̊˕]}}; and after another consonant, the voiced obstruent may even be deleted, as in ''iceberg'', pronounced {{IPA|[iθeˈβeɾ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Spanish Dictionary'' (Oxford University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loan sounds===
The fricative {{IPA|/ʃ/}} may also appear in borrowings from other languages, such as [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]&lt;ref name="blanch29"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lope Blanch|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ávila|2003|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the affricates {{IPAslink|t͡s}} and {{IPAslink|t͡ɬ}} also occur in Nahuatl borrowings.&lt;ref name="blanch29"/&gt;

{{Linguistics}}

'''Speech''' is human vocal [[communication]] using [[language]]. Each language uses [[phonetic]] combinations of a limited set of perfectly articulated and individualized [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., "role" or "hotel"), and using those words in their semantic character as  words in the [[lexicon]] of a [[language]] according to the [[Syntax|syntactic]] constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional [[Speech_act|speech act]]s, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use [[Elocution|enunciation]], [[Intonation_(linguistics)|intonation]], degrees of [[Loudness|loudness]], [[Tempo|tempo]], and other non-representational or [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] aspects of vocalization to convey meaning.  In their speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through [[Accent_(sociolinguistics)|accent]]), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychic states (emotions or moods), physico-psychic states (sobriety or [[Alcohol_intoxication|drunkenness]], normal consciousness and [[Trance|trance]] states), education or experience, and the like.  

Although people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people [[Profanity|swear]] they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something.  There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People [[Talking to oneself|talk to themselves]] sometimes in acts that are a development of what some [[psychologist]]s (e.g., [[Lev Vygotsky]]) have maintained is the use in thinking of silent speech in an [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|interior monologue]] to vivify and organize [[cognition]], sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person.  Solo speech can be used [[Memorization|to memorize]] or to test one's memorization of things, and in [[Prayer|prayer]] or in [[Meditation|meditation]] (e.g., the use of a [[Mantra|mantra]]).

Researchers study many different aspects of speech:  speech production and [[speech perception]] of the [[sounds]] used in a [[language]], [[speech repetition]], [[speech error]]s, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in [[children]]'s enlargement of their [[vocabulary]], and what different areas of the [[human brain]], such as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for  [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication studies]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[speech pathology]], [[otolaryngology]], and [[acoustics]].  
Speech compares with [[written language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{American Heritage Dictionary|https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=speech|Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called [[diglossia]]. 

The evolutionary [[origin of language|origins of speech]] are unknown and subject to much debate and [[speculation]]. While [[Animal language|animals also communicate]] using vocalizations, and trained [[apes]] such as [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] and [[Kanzi]] can use simple [[Sign_language|sign language]], no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.

== Production ==
{{main|Speech production|Linguistics}}

Speech production is a multi-step process by which thoughts are generated into spoken utterances. Production involves the selection of appropriate words and the appropriate form of those words from the lexicon and morphology, and the organization of those words through the syntax. Then, the phonetic properties of the words are retrieved and the sentence is uttered through the articulations associated with those phonetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levelt|first=Willem J. M.|date=|year=1999|title=Models of word production|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]] ([[articulatory phonetics]]), [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] refers to how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by [[manner of articulation]] and [[place of articulation]]. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. [[Pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]], implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|last=Catford|first=J.C.|last2=Esling|first2=J.H.|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Kieth|edition=2nd|location=Amsteram|pages=425–442|chapter=Articulatory Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is primarily used for the production of [[consonant]]s, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as [[Voicing (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[nasalization]]. For any [[place of articulation]], there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several [[homorganic]] consonants.

Normal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the [[lung]]s, which creates [[phonation]] in the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]], which is then modified by the [[vocal tract]] and mouth into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]], of which there are three types: [[esophageal speech]], pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as [[Donald Duck talk]]).

=== Speech errors ===
{{main|Speech error}}

Speech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children. Speech errors come in many forms and are often used to provide evidence to support hypotheses about the nature of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Mouton|year=1973|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=11–46|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, speech errors are often used in the construction of models for language production and [[Language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. For example, the fact that children often make the error of over-regularizing the -ed past tense suffix in English (e.g. saying 'singed' instead of 'sang') shows that the regular forms are acquired earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Kim|last2=Juola|first2=Patrick|date=|year=1999|title=A connectionist model of english past tense and plural morphology|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–490|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2304_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|last2=Paradis|first2=Johanne|date=|title=Acquiring Regular and Irregular Past Tense Morphemes in English and French: Evidence From Bilingual Children|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=62|issue=1|pages=170–197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech errors associated with certain kinds of aphasia have been used to map certain components of speech onto the brain and see the relation between different aspects of production: for example, the difficulty of [[expressive aphasia]] patients in producing regular past-tense verbs, but not irregulars like 'sing-sang' has been used to demonstrate that regular inflected forms of a word are not individually stored in the lexicon, but produced from affixation of the base form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullman|first=Michael T.|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2005|title=Neural correlates of lexicon and grammar: Evidence from the production, reading, and judgement of inflection in aphasia.|url=|journal=Brain and Language|volume=93|pages=185–238|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
{{main|Speech perception}}

Speech perception refers to the processes by which humans can interpret and understand the sounds used in language. The study of speech perception is closely linked to the fields of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand [[spoken language]]. Research into speech perception also has applications in building [[speech recognition|computer systems that can recognize speech]], as well as improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to Language Development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech perception is [[Categorical perception|categorical]], in that people put the sounds they hear into categories rather than perceiving them as a spectrum. People are more likely to be able to hear differences in sounds across categorical boundaries than within them. A good example of this is [[Voice-onset time|voice onset time]] (VOT). For example, Hebrew speakers, who distinguish voiced /b/ from voiceless /p/, will more easily detect a change in VOT from -10 ( perceived as /b/ ) to 0 ( perceived as /p/ ) than a change in VOT from +10 to +20, or -10 to -20, despite this being an equally large change on the VOT spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishon-Rabin|first=Liat|last2=Rotshtein|first2=Shira|last3=Taitelbaum|first3=Riki|date=|year=2002|title=Underlying Mechanism for Categorical Perception: Tone-Onset Time and Voice-Onset Time Evidence of Hebrew Voicing|url=|journal=Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–134|doi=10.1515/jbcpp.2002.13.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repetition==
{{main|Speech repetition}}

In speech repetition, speech being heard is quickly turned from sensory input into motor instructions needed for its immediate or delayed vocal imitation (in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]]). This type of mapping plays a key role in enabling children to expand their spoken vocabulary. Masur (1995) found that how often children repeat novel words versus those they already have in their lexicon is related to the size of their lexicon later on, with young children who repeat more novel words having a larger lexicon later in development. Speech repetition could help facilitate the acquisition of this larger lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masur|first=Elise|year=1995|title=Infants' Early Verbal Imitation and Their Later Lexical Development|url=|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286–306|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems involving speech==
{{See also|Speech-language pathology}}

There are several organic and psychological factors that can affect speech. Among these are:

#Diseases and disorders of the [[lung]]s or the [[vocal cords]], including [[paralysis]], respiratory infections (bronchitis), [[vocal fold nodules]] and [[cancer]]s of the lungs and throat.
#Diseases and disorders of the [[brain]], including [[alogia]], [[aphasia]]s, [[dysarthria]], [[dystonia]] and [[speech processing]] disorders, where impaired [[motor planning]], nerve transmission, phonological processing or perception of the message (as opposed to the actual sound) leads to poor speech production.
#Hearing problems, such as [[otitis media|otitis media with effusion]], and listening problems, [[auditory processing disorder]]s, can lead to phonological problems.
#Articulatory problems, such as [[relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisping]], [[cleft palate]], [[ataxia]], or [[nerve]] damage leading to problems in [[Manner of articulation|articulation]]. [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[tic]]s can also affect speech. Various [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired [[tongue disease]]s can affect speech as can [[motor neuron disease]].
#In addition to [[dysphasia]], [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]] and [[auditory processing disorder]] can impede the quality of auditory perception, and therefore, expression.  Those who are [[deafness|Hard of Hearing]] or deaf may be considered to fall into this category.

==Brain physiology==

=== The classical model ===
[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|180x180px|Broca's and Wernicke's areas.]]

The classical or [[Wernicke–Geschwind model|Wernicke-Geschwind model]] of the language system in the brain focuses on [[Broca's area]] in the inferior [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[Wernicke's area]] in the posterior [[superior temporal gyrus]] on the [[Lateralization of brain function|dominant hemisphere]] of the brain (typically the left hemisphere for language). In this model, a linguistic auditory signal is first sent from the [[auditory cortex]] to Wernicke's area. The [[lexicon]] is accessed in Wernicke's area, and these words are sent via the [[arcuate fasciculus]] to Broca's area, where morphology, syntax, and instructions for articulation are generated. This is then sent from Broca's area to the [[motor cortex]] for articulation.&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, A. (2005). "Wernicke--GeschwindModel". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Broca]] identified an approximate region of the brain in 1861 which, when damaged in two of his patients, caused severe deficits in speech production, where his patients were unable to speak beyond a few monosyllabic words. This deficit, known as Broca's or [[expressive aphasia]], is characterized by difficulty in speech production where speech is slow and labored, function words are absent, and syntax is severely impaired, as in [[telegraphic speech]]. In expressive aphasia, speech comprehension is generally less affected except in the comprehension of grammatically complex sentences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hillis, A. E., &amp; Caramazza, A. (2005). "Aphasia". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Wernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], who in 1874 proposed a connection between damage to the posterior area of the left superior temporal gyrus and aphasia, as he noted that not all aphasic patients had suffered damage to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to)|publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co|year=1995|isbn=90-272-1893-5|volume=4|location=Amsterdam|pages=69–89|chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875)|author=Wernicke K.|editor=Paul Eling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to Wernicke's area produces Wernicke's or [[receptive aphasia]], which is characterized by relatively normal syntax and prosody but severe impairment in lexical access, resulting in poor comprehension and nonsensical or [[Jargon aphasia|jargon speech]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern research ===
Modern models of the neurological systems behind linguistic comprehension and production recognize the importance of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, but are not limited to them nor solely to the left hemisphere. &lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351-1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, multiple streams are involved in speech production and comprehension. Damage to the left [[lateral sulcus]] has been connected with difficulty in processing and producing morphology and syntax, while lexical access and comprehension of irregular forms (e.g. eat-ate) remain unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perception of Speech: from sound to meaning.|last=Tyler|first=Lorraine K.|last2=Marslen-Wilson|first2=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-956131-5|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=Brian C.

Moreover, the circuits involved in human speech comprehension dynamically adapt with learning, for example, by becoming more efficient in terms of processing time when listening to familiar messages such as learned verses&lt;ref name="CervantesConstantino_&amp;_Simon_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simon|first2=JZ|year=2018|title=Restoration and Efficiency of the Neural Processing of Continuous Speech Are Promoted by Prior Knowledge|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=56|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2018.00056 |last1=Cervantes Constantino|first1=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23201">'''S. V. Petersen''' (1914-1987) was an [[Afrikaans]]-language South African [[poet]] and [[author]], educator and founding principal of the High School Spes Bona in [[Athlone]], [[Cape Town]]. He was the first person of colour whose poetry and prose were published in [[South Africa]].

==Life and Work==
Sydney Vernon Petersen was born on 22 June 1914 in [[Riversdale, Western Cape|Riversdale]], a town in the south of the [[Western Cape]] Province of [[South Africa]]. He was the second child in a family of five children, of which all five later became teachers.  His father was a saddler and harness maker, his mother a homemaker. Motivated mainly by their mother all of the children obtained, at least, their degree in Education. Petersen visited the local Berlin Mission School until 1926, completing his schooling in Cape Town at the [[Trafalgar High School (Cape Town)|Trafalgar High School]]. He excelled in athletics and sports throughout his student days. During his final year in high school a pastor, Reverend Kohl of the Lutheran Mission Church, he felt, had a particularly good influence on his personal development.&lt;ref NAME="Terblanche"&gt;Article by Erika Terblanche SV Petersen (1914–1987) 2008-12-15, 
https://archive.today/20130424005528/http://www.argief.litnet.co.za/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=cause_dir_news_item&amp;cause_id=1270&amp;news_id=57677&amp;cat_id=284#selection-339.1-339.16 Retrieved 26.05.2018&lt;/ref&gt; At this time there were very limited opportunities for children of colour to obtain a proper schooling (in 1929 only around 600 children were enrolled in high school within the Union of South Africa) and it was a great achievement, despite these limitations, for him to obtain such results,&lt;ref&gt;Hein Willemse in an article in ''Tydskrif vir Letterkunde’’, January 2010 (Vol 47 no.2) http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0041-476X2010000200003&lt;/ref&gt; made possible through his strong personal drive and the support of his parents and people like Reverend Kohl. As a young child, he made daily deliveries of bread and as a teenager did manual labour for a living and contribute to its training costs.

On completing school, he studied at the Battswood Training College, [[Wynberg, Cape Town|Wynberg]], where he qualified as a teacher in 1933. His first teaching post was in [[Ladismith]] in the Cape Province. Two years later he was back in Cape Town teaching at the Berlin Mission School in Searle Street [[District Six]]. He began attending evening classes at the [[University of Cape Town]] for his Bachelor’s Degree with majors in Afrikaans, English and Mathematics, befriending the Afrikaans poet [[I.D. du Plessis]]. On graduating in 1940 he obtained the University Medal for Afrikaans. Later he obtained a B.Ed. degree from the same university. As a teacher, he served from 1939 as an assistant in the secondary school Battswood, while lecturing in the Training College Battswood and from 1945 as head of the same institution's primary school. In January 1947, he founded the Athlone High School where he remained principal until his retirement in 1974. After his retirement, he accepted a temporary post in the Department of Education at the Hewat Education College in [[Crawford, Cape Town|Crawford]] and in 1981 he lectured at the Teacher Training College in [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville]], where he was employed until 1983. His wife, Mavis, was also a teacher and the couple had a son, Sydney, named after his father.

In 1959 Petersen was appointed a member of the US - SA leadership program and travelled with his family to [[America]], where he lectured at several university colleges in New York and Chicago. His hosts noticed he was writing his reports by hand, so the bought him a typewriter, with which he wrote for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Terblanche/&gt; He travelled to [[Ghana]], [[Israel]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. In April 1960, he spent a year abroad as a guest of the Dutch-South African Society. From 1969 on he was also invited by the governments of Germany and the Netherlands to visit educational centres in these countries. In 1982 he was appointed to the advisory board of the [[SABC]] He died of kidney failure in [[Groote Schuur Hospital]], Cape Town on October 30, 1987.

==The Writer==
Already in primary school he started to write prose in addition to poetry. After 1940, short stories and sketches appeared in ‘’Naweek’’, ’’Suid-Afrika’’, ’’Die Huisgenoot’’ and ''Tydskrif vir Letterkunde''. His short stories ''Repos ailleurs'' and ''Kaapstad'' are included in the volume ''Geseënd is julle'' (Blessed Are You), edited by S. J. Malan and W.H. Vos. The short story ''Verbode vrugte''  (Forbidden Fruit), was published in 1943 in ''Die Naweek'' and included by Daniel Hugo in his collection ''Tydskrif 2''. Its theme of racially mixed marriage, dealt with in rather more jovial than confrontational fashion, was daring for the time.
From the same period dates the novel ''As die Son Ondergaan'' (When the Sun Goes Down), a story about the demise of a young brown man (Frans) in the city. The gifted young man, unable to realise his ambition to become a teacher, left his home in the countryside for city, hoping to get a paying job. He is swallowed up in the urban industrial machine and makes friends with the wrong crowd of people. His morality undermined by drinking and sex, he marries a flighty young woman, Karolien. Deserted by his so-called friends and his wife, he is given over to drink. Then his parents come for him. By returning to his old, familiar environment he can at last, overcome his spiritual crisis. For the first time in African literature, the race issue is here addressed from the point of view of people of colour, the emotional impact emphasised. This problem, however, remains largely in the background, the destruction and preservation of the protagonist representing not a symbolic example of the coloured people's struggle, but rather a more universally human development. The novel shows a far more nuanced characterization than the stereotyping of so many previous writers. 

In 1946 ''As die Son Ondergaan'' was awarded the prize in a nationwide contest of prose writing offered by the magazine ''Kern'' a part of the ''Unie-Volkspers''. Along with [[PJ Philander]] he authored school textbooks for geography and history.

However, it is his poems that make the greatest contribution to Afrikaans literature. In his work, the brown people, with their varied feelings of resistance and resignation, receive for the first time, their own voice in African literature. His writing style initially draws more on the older poets and their national type of verse, rather than the ''Dertigers'' or ''Viertigers'' (Afrikaans poets of the thirties and forties) with their more personal issues. Many verses in his early collections are impressive in their simplicity and dramatic impact through the use of dialogue. In tone wry and bitter and filled with deep emotion, presented however, in a naturally sober and direct manner. Yet the technique in these poems still largely stems from the generation before the thirties.

''Die Enkeling'' (The individual) makes its impact more through the authenticity of feeling about the suffering of coloured people, than the quality of the poems, which technically, are not yet truly poetry. It is especially the poignant poem ''Bede'' (Prayer) that revolts against "the accursed penalty of a dark skin" and concludes with the speaker praying for the fortitude to accept his fate, should this indeed be God's will. ''Opstand'' (Revolt) describes far more how difficult it is to acquiesce and be silent. In ''Roepende stemme'' (Calling voices) a chorus cries out, questioning how long the oppression will continue, each commentator responding by placing the calls within a greater reality. ''Die arbeider'' (The labourer) is a largely successful portrayal of a human character. A poem like ''Die vreemde'' (The stranger) is typifies the protest and resentment caused by the inferior position coloured people hold within society, while the theme of ''Drinklied'' (Drinking song) speaks of trying to escape reality through alcohol. In a second edition, he omits a number of his more youthful verses - ''Worsteling'', ''Vergewe... Vergeet? '', ''Elegie'' and ''Die winterwind'' - but makes no further changes.

''Die stil kind'' (The quiet child) &lt;ref&gt;Grové, A.P. ''Standpunte'' Jaargang 4, no.2, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; evinces considerable artistic progress, with the tone of the poems less harsh. As its title states, the dreaming child is portrayed as a lonely individual, while verses describe with deep emotion the ravaged victims of poverty. ''Riversdal'' shows nine women who wash white people's clothes by the river, with word and rhythm used to great effect. ‘’Voorteken’’ (Pre-ordained) outlines the loneliness of the coloured people, knowing that their life is doomed to heavy labour and unfulfilment. ‘’Motorrit '' (Road trip) expresses the sense of release when the narrator in his car leaves the city behind him, free in the speed of the car and the presence of nature, while ''Rondebosch'' likewise depicts the freedom of nature. ''Die loper'' (The runner) portrays the struggle of the intellectual coloured man, and ''Slotsom'' (Conclusion) concludes that, in death, no difference between the races exists.

After a long hiatus, Petersen began publishing again after 1960 with ''Die kinders van Kain''  (The Children of Cain), ''Suiderkruis'' (Southern Cross), ''Nag is verby'' (Night is over) and ''Laat kom dan die wind'' (Late the Wind Then Comes).  The finest verses in these collections wittily portray city types, while those of resistance against racial discrimination resound far more powerfully.&lt;ref&gt;Antonissen, Rob “Standpunte”, Nuwe reeks 32, Desember 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''Die kinders van Kain''&lt;ref&gt;Antonissen, Rob ''Kern en tooi'' Nasou Beperk Eerste uitgawe Eerste druk Elsiesrivier 1963&lt;/ref&gt; immediately points to those excluded from the rest of society. The collection reflects the progress of his first two books and in depicting the provocation, the melancholy and loneliness of the brown people and can be seen as an important milestone in African poetry. The statement of most of the poems is sober and less desperate, while a larger number a number contain a transcendent purity. Beautiful poems include ''Kinders van Kain'' (where the fate of those kicked out is contrasted with the promise of the New Day); ''Die drumpel'' (The threshold), in which the harsh manner in which coloured people are treated is challenged by an accusation that, as a racial group, they originated from the immoral behaviour of white pioneers; ''Kinderland'' (Childhood), with its melancholy about the utterly lost dreams of childhood; and ''Die veles'' (The many) follows the path of common people through life in rather a witty manner. ''Bergies'' (Mountain dwellers) is also noteworthy, with its witty imagery of this marginalised sector of society, while ''Windermere''  touches the social needs of the people. ''Kaapse naweek'' describes the superficial lifestyle of revellers. ''Die toring Babel'' (The Tower of Babel) makes of discrimination not simply a local but a universal issue, while ''Kamee'' (Cameo) portrays the cheerfulness of the brown woman in the midst of her suffering.

''Suiderkruis''&lt;ref&gt;Antonissen, Rob ''Standpunte'' Nuwe reeks 66, Augustus 1966&lt;/ref&gt;, in two sections, contains poems about of the memories of a youth in the rural areas. on the one hand and events within the contemporary urban environment on the other. Each section ends with a suite of five poems, ''Ballade'' - a series about the “platteland”, the countryside, and one on the “Confession of the city dweller” showing the contrasts in the feeling of freedom. Memories of country life find expression in poignant poetic memoirs such as  ''Tuiskoms'' (Homecoming) and ''Sekelgat'', where former joys are played off against the sadness of remembrance. Well portrayed are also the marginalised of the city, ''Koerante-verkopertjie'' (News vendor) and ''Die doofstomme'' (The deaf-mute).

''Alleenstryd'' (“Single combat” or “the lonely struggle”)&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, T.T. ''Tydskrif vir Letterkunde'', Nuwe reeks 18 no. 2, Mei 1980&lt;/ref&gt; is a label he himself finds appropriate for poetry up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, T.T. “Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe” Jaargang 20 no. 2, Junie 1980&lt;/ref&gt; It fits the loneliness and the life struggles to which his poems give voice, characterised in the progression from rural nature verses to the more realistically-oriented poems of city life.

''Nag is verby''&lt;ref&gt;Brink, André P. ''Standpunte'' Nuwe reeks 154, Augustus 1981&lt;/ref&gt;, dedicated to I.D. du Plessis&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, T.T. ''Tydskrif vir Letterkunde'' Nuwe reeks 19 no. 2, Mei 1981&lt;/ref&gt; deals with how the question of skin colour can dominate one’s judgements on the value and dignity of the human being, &lt;ref&gt;Cilliers-Preller, Rika ''Die Transvaler'' 12 Januarie 1981&lt;/ref&gt;and the search for one’s own identity in trying to find the sense of security that was present in the parental home. .&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, T.T. ''Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe'' Jaargang 21 no. 2, Junie 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes poems of resistance, landscape poetry, poems of remembrance and travel, the latter inspired by journeys both at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Nienaber, C.J.M. ''Beeld'' 17 November 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  The title reflects a optimistic outlook, a move away from a situation of frustration to one of greater hope and equality, which is also reflected in the content of the poems. The title poem develops a prophetic vision of human freedom. Noteworthy poems are ''Stadsmens'' (City dweller), depicting the hand-to-mouth existence of this group; ''Kaapse Vlak'' (Cape Flats) about the violent death of a young boy; and ''Landelik'' (Rural), beautiful images from this carefree and simple world. There are also several memory verses, the best of them, ''Drie dromertjies'' (Three little drummers), ''Die witborskraai'' (The pied crow) and ''Sekelmaan'' (The sickle moon).

His last collection&lt;ref&gt;Brink, André P. “Rapport” 23 Maart 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
''Laat kom dan die wind'', received generally negative criticism. It includes poems of travel, childhood memories, longings for a bygone way of life and images of city personages.

In 1962 he published in the Netherlands a collection of English verses or aphorisms, ''Meditations on the brink: dedicated with reverence to the life-work of Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven'', based largely on the anthroposophical theories of Rudolf Steiner. It is his only such publication in English, speaks of his meeting with [[Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven]] and describes insights he gained through him. This he re-published under his own name in South Africa in 1980.

In 1967, Dr. W.H. Vos compiled a volume, ''Keurverse'' (Selected poems) from the poetry of Petersen and PJ Philander. His poems are included in several anthologies, including ''Groot verseboek'', ''Die Afrikaanse poësie in ’n duisend en enkele gedigte'', ''Digterstemme'', ''Afrikaanse verse'', ''Uit ons digkuns'', ''Uit ons letterkunde'', ''Digters en digkuns'', ''Die junior digbundel'', ''Woordpaljas'', ''My Afrikaanse verseboek'', ''Die goue vreugde'', ''Voorspraak'' en ''Junior verseboek'', also providing a poem for the collection ''Verse vir Opperman''. He also published poems in magazines such as ''Standpunte'' en ''Tydskrif vir Letterkunde''.

== Tributes==
In 1950 the SABC dedicated an episode of ''Ons skrywers en digters aan die woord'' (Our writers and poets of the word) to his work. The South African Academy for Science and Art in 1959 awarded him a medal of honour for his contribution to Afrikaans culture and he received the Crown Medal for his educational work. In 1977, he was proposed for membership of the South African Academy for Science and Art, but the Academy took so long to come to a decision that seven members resigned in protest. When the Academy finally approached him to become a member, he turned this down due to ill health. In 1982 the State President awarded him the Decoration for Meritorious Service and in 1986 he was elected a member of the Society of Dutch Literature in Leiden in the Netherlands. Shortly after his death, he was declared honorary citizen of his native village Riversdale, together with Alba Bouwer and Dalene Matthee. A radio play about him was compiled by Chris Swanepoel under the title ''Kind van die dal'' (Child of the valley) and broadcast on the South African Broadcasting Corporation's Afrikaans Service in 1989. The composer Hendrik Hofmeyr set to music two of his poems in 1997, ''Kinderland'' and ''Die veles'' from the volume ''Die kinders van Kain''  and in 2005 further songs set to music by Hofmeyr were sung at the “Woordfees “(Festival of the Word) in Stellenbosch.

She is regarded as an important voice in Hindi poetry in the generations born after 1950. According to poet and critic [[Ashok Vajpeyi]], "Teji Grover shapes her language away from the prevalent idiom of Hindi poetry. In her poetry language acquires a form which is unique..."&lt;ref&gt;See, Ashok Vajpeyi's preface to Teji Grover and Rustam Singh, ''Teji aur Rustam Ki Kavitaen'', selected poems of both poets, New Delhi: HarperCollins, {{ISBN|978-81-7223-879-7}}, Hindi-language. Accessed on 17 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her poems have been translated into many Indian and foreign languages.

Grover's fiction is known for its intertextual weaving and the seamless blending of dream and reality, the time past, present and future and the mythological and everyday in such a way that writing comes to predominate every thing else. As the Polish Hindi scholar Kamila Junik has written about her novel ''Neela'' (Blue), "All the characters write. All the events are being written. The existence is being written as well. There is no other world beyond writing."&lt;ref&gt;Kamila Junik, "Teji Grover's ''Blue''", ''Cracow Indological Studies'', Vol. 12 (ed. Halina Marlewicz), Ksiegarnia Akademicka, Krakow, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her numerous translations, Teji Grover has introduced some of the most significant modern Scandinavian writers and poets to the Hindi reader, such as [[Knut Hamsun]], [[Tarjei Vesaas]], [[Jon Fosse]], [[Kjell Askildsen]], Gunnar Björling, [[Hans Herbjørnsrud]], [[Lars Amund Vaage]], [[Edith Södergran]], [[Harry Martinson]], [[Tomas Tranströmer]], Lars Lundkvist, and [[Ann Jäderlund]], as also the controversial French writer [[Marguerite Duras]].

An abstract painter, Grover uses organic and natural colours; the latter she makes herself.&lt;ref&gt;See, Pen to Brush, Review of Jo Nahi Hai, solo show in Delhi http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/pen-to-brush/Accessed{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} on 17 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tobian''' (Tobian: ''ramarih Hatohobei'', literally "the language of Tobi") is the language of [[Tobi (island)|Tobi]], one of the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]] of Palau, and the main island of [[Hatohobei]] state. Tobian is a [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian language]] spoken by approximately 150 people.

Tobian and the dialects of [[Sonsorol]], [[Merir]], and [[Pulo Anna]], the other inhabited Southwest Islands, are closely related to the languages spoken in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] outer islands of [[Yap]] and [[Truk Lagoon]].

These days most Tobian speakers live in [[Echang]], a hamlet of [[Koror]], the former capital of Palau. Tobian and [[Sonsorolese language|Sonsorolese]] are very close, and appear to be gradually merging towards a new dialect called "Echangese"{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

* animal = ''mar''

'''Kalaimamani Vikiraman''' is the pseudonym of '''Subarayar Vembu''' (19 March 1928 – 1 December 2015), a prolific [[Tamil language|Tamil]] writer and journalist.

== Biography ==
He was born to Subarayar and Lashmiammal. His father was an employee of [[Southern Railway (India)|Southern Railways]] during British rule and was one of the surveyors who was responsible for the construction of the [[Pamban Bridge]]. His father also worked for Sudeshamitran, a Tamil daily under the editorship of Bharathiyaar.

== Early years ==
He was always interested in journalism, especially handwritten magazines in his school days. In his high school, he started publishing a magazine called Tamil Chudar which was acclaimed by [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]], [[Rajaji]] and A.K. Gopal Chettiyar.

He has travelled extensively to places like Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Paris, Dubai, Rome and places of historical significance in India.

== Journalism ==
He worked for a weekly magazine called Velli Mani from 1946–1947, for Tamizh Pannai in 1948.  He edited arguably the longest surviving Tamil literary monthly magazine, [[Amudasurabhi]], for over five decades (1951–2003). He started a fortnightly Tamil literary magazine [[Illakiyapeedam]] in 1997 and is its editor and publisher.
He was also the editor of the following magazines: Kuruvi (children's weekly), Sundari (fortnightly), [[Mangalam Weekly|Mangalam]] (weekly) and Tamil Arasi (weekly).

== Works ==
Vikiraman is known more for his novels, particularly [[historical novels]], than for his short stories. He edited arguably the longest surviving Tamil literary magazine, Amudasurabhi, for well over five decades (1949–2002). He is perhaps the only Tamil writer who has tried his hand in almost every genre, in addition to novel and short story, drama, poetry, travelogue and essay. He has also written stories for children and books on history for the youth in simple Tamil.

His first historical novel, ''Udayachandran'', appeared in 1957 and he has added 33 more in the four succeeding decades. The most famous of these has been ''[[Nandipurathu Nayagi]]'', first serialised in Amudasurabi during 1957–59, and published in book form in 1964. Nandipurathu Nayagi is in fact a sequel to ''[[Ponniyin Selvan]]'' of his better-known contemporary and mentor, [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]], whose influence on Vikiraman is quite significant in respect of both historical novels and short stories.

With more than 150 short stories in 62 years to his credit, Vikiraman continues to write fiction for [[Ilakkiya Peetam]], which he presently edits. Although he has received many accolades including the [[Kalaimamani]] title from the Tamil Nadu Government and an award from Tamil University, Thanjavur, for his literary achievements, he has admittedly a grievance that he is known only as a novelist and journalist, and not as a short story writer among the Tamil readers. And hence this collection of his 70 short stories, as he reveals his mind in ''Kathaiyin Kathai'', a sort of preface to the volume. Not an unjust grievance anyway, in this fast-track cultural ambience in which literature is loved more for its entertainment value, forcing the long, time-consuming novel to yield ground to short story as a form of literary expression. Judged from J.B. Priestley's observation that "at its best, the short story offers us a wonderfully clear little window through which we can see something of the lights and shadows, the heights and depths of life in this world," a substantial number of the stories in this collection pass the test.
