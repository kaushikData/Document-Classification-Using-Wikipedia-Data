'''''A Cock and Bull Story''''' (marketed in Australia, New Zealand and the United States as '''''Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story''''') is a 2005 British comedy film directed by [[Michael Winterbottom]]. It is a [[Story within a story|film-within-a-film]], featuring [[Steve Coogan]] and [[Rob Brydon]] playing themselves as egotistical actors during the making of a screen adaptation of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s 18th century [[metafiction]]al novel ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]''. [[Gillian Anderson]] and [[Keeley Hawes]] also play themselves in addition to their ''Tristram Shandy'' roles. Since the book is about a man attempting but failing to write his autobiography, the film takes the form of being about failing to make the film.

== Plot ==
The film depicts [[Steve Coogan]] playing himself as an arrogant actor with low self-esteem and a complicated love life. Coogan is playing the eponymous role in an adaptation of ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'' being filmed at a stately home. He constantly spars with actor [[Rob Brydon]], who is playing Uncle Toby and believes his role to be of equal importance to Coogan's, calling himself the "co-lead".

The film incorporates several sequences from ''Tristram Shandy''. Not all of these are part of the film-within-the-film. The latter are limited to the story of Tristram's conception, birth and christening; Uncle Toby's experiences at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|Battle of Namur]] and Tristram's sudden and accidental [[circumcision]] at the age of three. Uncle Toby's wooing of Widow Wadman (Gillian Anderson) takes place in a sequence dreamed by Steve Coogan and after the cast and crew have viewed the "completed" film ending, with Walter Shandy fainting at the sight of his wife giving birth, the question "How does the book end?" is followed by the concluding scene of the novel, in which Yorick says "It is a story about a Cock and a Bull – and the best of its kind that ever I heard!" Yorick is not in the film-within-the-film; in this scene he is played by [[Stephen Fry]], who appears elsewhere in the film as Patrick, a caricatured version of the actual curator at [[Shandy Hall]]. The DVD extras include a scene of Fry talking with the curator he portrays.

==Soundtrack==
The film's soundtrack is notable for featuring numerous excerpts from [[Nino Rota]]'s score for the [[Federico Fellini]] film ''[[8½]]'', itself a self-reflexive work about the making of a film. Other non-diegetic musical references are made to ''[[Amarcord]]'', ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'', ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'' and ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''. [[Michael Nyman]], composer of ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'' provides a new arrangement of the [[Handel]] [[Sarabande]] featured in the latter film, while the tracks of ''The Draughtsman's Contract'' (the original soundtrack recordings, the score has been re-recorded numerous times) serve as a [[temp track]] to film of the Sterne material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6506">'''Reverend Dr Andrew Clark''' (7 June 1856 – 24 March 1922) was a [[Church of England]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], a prodigious editor of literary and historical texts, and is now well known for his lengthy [[diary]] of the [[First World War]].

==Life==
Born in Dollarfield, near [[Dollar, Scotland|Dollar]], Clackmannanshire, Scotland, Clark was educated at the [[University of St Andrews]], then at the University of Oxford. He matriculated from [[Balliol College]] but won a scholarship at [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;M. Webb, ''From Downing Street to the Trenches : First-Hand Accounts of the Great War, 1914-1916'', Oxford : Bodleian Library, 2014, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; He read [[Greats]] and graduated with a First in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Calendar 1895'', Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1985, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was elected to a Fellowship at Lincoln College in 1880 and ordained in 1884. He was Chaplain of Lincoln and vicar of two Oxford churches, [[All Saints Church, Oxford|All Saints]] and [[St Michael at the North Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Webb, ''From Downing Street to the Trenches : First-Hand Accounts of the Great War, 1914-1916'', Oxford : Bodleian Library, 2014, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 he took up the position of parish priest in [[Great Leighs]], [[Essex]], held in the patronage of Lincoln College.

When in Oxford Clark began editing numerous works for the [[Oxford Historical Society]], including four volumes of the ''Register of the University of Oxford'' (1887–89), three volumes of [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]]'s ''History of the City of Oxford'' (1889–99) and five volumes of the ''Life and Times of Anthony Wood'' (1891-1900); and then six volumes for the [[Early English Text Society]], the ''English Register of Godstow Nunnery'' (1905–11), the ''English Register of [[Oseney Abbey]]'' (1907-13) and ''Lincoln Diocese Documents'' (1914). His two volumes of ''[[Brief Lives|Aubrey's Brief Lives]]'' (1898) were a scholarly (but censored) edition.  It was, no doubt, his deep experience of the writings of Aubrey and Wood that led him to appreciate the importance of popular belief, gossip and hearsay, and prompted his greatest work in chronicling the sensation of living through the Great War in Essex.

Although he was absent in [[Oxford]] when war was declared in 1914, he decided to keep a detailed diary of "Echoes of the Great War" in his village. The diary records the sights and sounds of the war in rural Essex, the activities of Clark's friends, relatives and acquaintances, and rumours relating to the war. The full diary (extending beyond the end of the war) runs to 92 volumes, and is held in the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford: a condensed version was published by James Munson as ''Echoes of the Great War'' (OUP, 1985). Extracts from the diaries relating to those commemorated on the Great Leighs War Memorial are available via the external link below.

In addition to his diary, Clark kept clippings during the war under the title 'English Words In Wartime', which are also held (along with other records sent by Clark) in the Bodleian. In addition to his volumes of historical records he also published and some original books, such as ''The Colleges of Oxford'' (1891), ''Lincoln'' (College Histories, 1898), and ''A Bodleian Guide for Visitors'' (1906). Clark was a contributor to the ''[[Essex Review]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2382">The '''Annals of Boyle''', also '''Cottonian Annals''', are a [[chronicle]] of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Ireland]]. The entries span the years up to 1253. It is considered one of the works that forms [[The Chronicle of Ireland]], although in summary form compared to others.

[[Robin Flower]] wrote in ''[[Revue Celtique]]'' 44 (1927) 344: 
:'The MS is the original chronicle of the [[Premonstratensian]] house of the Holy Trinity on the Island named after it in Loch Cé, founded on an earlier chronicle, perhaps that of [[Boyle, County Roscommon|Boyle]]. It remained in Holy Trinity till the secularization of that house, being used by the writers of the [[Annals of Lough Cé|Annals of Loch Cé]], who worked for the MacDermots. It passed into the hands of the Croftons with the other property of the house, and while in their hands was seen by Ussher, who probably called it the Annals of Boyle, which it has been known as ever since. From the Croftons, it passed to [[Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison|Oliver St. John, Viscount Grandison of Limerick]], who gave it to [[Sir Robert Bruce Cotton|Sir Robert Cotton]] before 1630 and, with his library, it came into the British Museum in 1753 with a number of other Irish manuscripts and manuscripts of Irish interest.'
The Annals used the [[Irish language]], with some entries in [[Latin]]. Because the Annals copied its sources verbatim, the annals are useful not just for historians, but also for linguists studying the evolution of the Irish language.

It was founded in 1999 by [[Rachel Levitsky]] as a reading series at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)|Bluestockings]] in New York, NY. The [[reading series]] quickly expanded to a matrix of readings, publications, and informal salons, featuring avant-garde feminist writing, with an emphasis on hybrid and [[Language poets|language-focused]] writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the press operates as a non-hierarchical collaborative, publishing books and hosting literary events with attention to diversity in its roster of authors and editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicole|first1=Disser|title=Independent Presses Not Immune to Diversity Problems that Plague the Rest of the Publishing Industry|url=http://www.bkmag.com/2014/10/22/independent-presses-not-entirely-immune-to-diversity-problems-that-plague-the-rest-of-the-publishing-industry/|website=www.bkmag.com|publisher=Brooklyn Magazine|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Belladonna* was started as a reading and salon series at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)]] on New York City’s Lower East Side in August 1999. The first publications were postcards by [[kari edwards]] for the May 4, 2000 reading at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)]]. Following the edwards postcards, and in collaboration with Boog Literature, Belladonna* began to publish commemorative "chaplets" (staple-bound pamphlets typically with fewer pages than a chapbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/poetry/resources/chapbook_publishers/|title=Chapbook Publishers - Poetry Society of America|website=www.poetrysociety.org|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced in very small print runs) of its readers' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitsky|first=Rachel|date=2010-08-04|title=Belladonna Books|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/389102|journal=American Book Review|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=5–5|doi=10.1353/abr.0.0122|issn=2153-4578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Belladonna* published chapbooks by [[Erica Hunt]] and [[Akilah Oliver]] and co-published its first full-length book, ''Four from Japan: Contemporary Poetry &amp; Essays by Women'', in collaboration with [https://www.pw.org/small_presses/litmus_press Litmus Press].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.litmuspress.org/books/four-from-japan/|title=Litmus Press|website=www.litmuspress.org|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Belladonna* published its first full-length books independently: ''Open Box'' by [[Carla Harryman]] and ''Mauve Sea-Orchids'', a book of poems in Spanish and English with facing page translations, by [[Lila Zemborain]] (translated by [[Rosa Alcalá]] and [[Mónica de la Torre]]). In celebration of its ten-year anniversary in 2009, Belladonna* published The Elders Series—eight multiply authored [[Perfect bound|perfect-bound]] books highlighting the continuity and transformation of the ideas, poetics, and artistic/political concerns of its poets' circle. Each book was conceived as "an anthology and a conversation between the guest curator and the elder(s) she hosts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Belladonna* has published, on average, two full-length books and 14 chaplets a year.

== Awards ==

In 2009, ''Bharat Jiva'' by [[kari edwards]] (co-published with Litmus Press) was a finalist for the [[Lambda Literary Award]] in Transgender Literature. Erica Doyle's ''Proxy'' was a 2013 finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in Lesbian Poetry and a winner of the [[Poetry Society of America]]'s Norma Farber First Book Award in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/03/and-the-winner-is-r-erica-doyles-proxy-wins-norma-farber-first-book-award|title=AND THE WINNER IS.... r. erica doyle's Proxy Wins Norma Farber First Book Award! by Harriet Staff|date=2018-04-04|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaTasha N.

== Readings ==

The Belladonna* reading series is foundational to the press's history and mission, predating even the first publications. The series is run by the reading series curators. Since 1999, curators have included Marcella Durand and Rachel Levitsky, erica kaufman, Emily Skillings, Krystal Languell, Jamila Wimberly, Cara Benson, Ariel Goldberg, LaTasha N. Nevada Diggs, Saretta Morgan, Chia-Lun Chang, Ana Paula, and Asiya Wadud. Belladonna* collaborates on the series with performance venues, academic institutions, arts and literary organizations, such as [[Abrons Arts Center|Abrons Art Center]], Asian American Writers' Workshop, Berl's Brooklyn Poetry Shop, BGSQD, Bluestockings, [[Bowery Poetry Club]], [[Brooklyn Art Library]], [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Brooklyn Public Library]], Bryant Park Reading Series, [[CUNY Graduate Center]], [[Dixon Place]], [[Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts|Eugene Lang College]], Housing Works Bookstore, La Casa Azul Bookstore, Lambda Literary, The Lesbian Herstory Archives, McNally Jackson, [[The Poetry Project]], [[Pioneer Works]], Pratt Institute, [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queen's College]], St. Mark's Bookstore, Unnameable Books, and [[ZieherSmith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/events/|title=Events {{!}} B E L L A D O N N A *|website=www.belladonnaseries.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belladonna* documents its reading series through audio and visual recordings, as well as through the production of short-run chaplets for each of its readers. There are over 230 individually numbered chaplets in the series. The majority are single-authored pamphlets of under 15 pages. Several chaplets are multiply authored and many contain both texts and images. The chaplets are produced in a limited run of 150 copies. When copies sell out, Belladonna* uploads a reading PDF of the chaplet so that the out-of-print work is freely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/chaplets/|title=Chaplets {{!}} B E L L A D O N N A *|website=www.belladonnaseries.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of Belladonna’s readings are recorded and available for streaming or downloading at [[PennSound]], an online project committed to preserving audio archives of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Belladonna.php|title=Pennsound:Belladonna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Belladonna's readers and chaplet authors are noted poets and writers, such as: [[Fanny Howe]] (#5), [[Mei-mei Berssenbrugge]] (#8), [[Lynne Tillman]] (#19), [[Anne Waldman]] (#26), [[Rosmarie Waldrop]] (#29), [[Alice Notley]] (#36), [[Lydia Davis]] (#40), [[Elaine Equi]] (#41), [[Maggie Nelson]] (#42), [[Anne Tardos]] (#47), [[Michelle Naka Pierce]] (#48), [[Leslie Scalapino]] (#50), [[Caroline Bergvall]] (#56), [[Susan Howe]] (#68), [[Lisa Robertson]] (#75), [[Ann Lauterbach]] (#85), [[Myung Mi Kim]] (#86), [[Dawn Lundy Martin]] (#89), [[Marjorie Welish]] (#91), [[Rae Armantrout]] (#92), Anna Moschovakis (#102), [[Evie Shockley]] (#104), [[Jean Day]] (#114), [[Dodie Bellamy]] (#116), [[Bhanu Kapil]] (#28 and #127), [[Eileen Myles]] (#38 and #128), [[Cecilia Vicuña]] (#131), [[Carmen Giménez Smith]] (#132), [[Renee Gladman]] (#65 and #133), [[Juliana Spahr]] (#144), and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/chaplets/|title=Chaplets {{!}} B E L L A D O N N A *|website=www.belladonnaseries.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Articles ==
Belladonna* has been featured in many publications including American Review of Books, [[Poets &amp; Writers]], and [[Rain Taxi]], among others.

* In a special chapbook issue of American Book Review (Mar/Apr 2005), Corinne Robins reviewed five Belladonna* chaplets in an article called "Belladonna*: The Deadly Night Shades of Experimental Women’s Poetry”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robins|first1=Corinne|title=Belladonna*: The Deadly Night Shades of Experimental Women's Poetry|journal=American Book Review|date=April 2005|volume=26|issue=3|url=http://americanbookreview.org/issueContent.asp?id=15|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2005, Byron Coley and [[Thurston Moore]] had this to say about the Belladonna* chaplet series: "Each zine is a succinct piece by a female poet, all of whom share a common sense of adventure and active consciousness. Great writing from Anne Waldman, Eileen Myles, Nada Gordon, Lynne Tillman, Lisa Jarnot, Rosemarie Waldrop and so many others. So if you’re in the market for deadly nightshade, this is the place for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Thurston|last2=Coley|first2=Byron|title=Bull Tongue: Exploring the Voids of All Known Undergrounds|url=http://arthurmag.com/2011/02/22/bull-tongue-by-byron-coley-thurston-moore-from-arthur-no-14-jan-2005/|website=Arthur|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canongate Myth Series''''' is a series of short novels in which ancient [[Mythology|myths]] from myriad cultures are reimagined and rewritten by contemporary authors. The project was conceived in 1999 by [[Jamie Byng]], owner of the independent foundation Scottish publisher [[Canongate Books]], and the first three titles in the series were published on 21 October 2005.&lt;ref name= "cbc"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/10/21/mythproject_051021.html "World's top writers recruited to rewrite ancient tales"], CBC.ca, 21 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the initial novellas received mixed-to-positive reviews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/books/authors/wintersonjeanette/weight?q=weight "Weight"], Metacritic.com Retrieved on 29 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/books/authors/atwoodmargaret/penelopiad?q=penelopiad "The Penelopiad"], Metacritic.com  Retrieved on 29 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "nyt"&gt;Alexander, Caroline.

The series is intended to have an international focus, with contributing authors that have included Russian writer [[Victor Pelevin]] and Israeli author [[David Grossman]]. Also, the first title in the series, [[Karen Armstrong]]'s ''[[A Short History of Myth]]'', was published the same day in 33 countries and 28 languages, in what ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called "the biggest simultaneous publication ever".&lt;ref name= "post"/&gt; As of 2008, nine books have been published in the series, with Byng hoping to eventually publish 100.&lt;ref name= "official"/&gt;

Three titles were published in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2007: ''[[Binu and the Great Wall]]'' by [[Su Tong]], ''[[Girl Meets Boy]]'' by [[Ali Smith]], and ''[[Where Three Roads Meet]]'' by [[Salley Vickers]]. Installments in the series are also forthcoming from the authors [[A. S. Byatt]],&lt;ref name= "cbc"/&gt; [[Chinua Achebe]] and [[Natsuo Kirino]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/7ba47e26-46aa-11da-b8e5-00000e2511c8.html FT.com / Arts &amp; weekend / Books – Myth understood&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Faber]]'s contribution, ''[[The Fire Gospel]]'', was published in 2008. 2009 saw the publication of ''[[Baba Yaga Laid an Egg]]'' by [[Dubravka Ugrešić]] and ''[[The Hurricane Party]]'' by [[Klas Östergren]].

The '''Catalogue of Life''' is an online database that provides the world’s most comprehensive and authoritative index of known species of animals, plants, fungi and micro-organisms. It was created in 2001 as a partnership between the global [[Species 2000]] and the American [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System]]. The catalogue is available in twelve languages and is used by research scientists, citizen scientists, educators, and policy makers.&lt;ref name=harmon2016/&gt; The catalogue is used by the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]], the [[Barcode of Life Data System]], [[Encyclopedia of Life]], and the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]].&lt;ref name=banki2018/&gt; The catalogue currently compiles data from 168 peer-reviewed taxonomic databases, that are maintained by specialist institutions around the world. As of 2018, the catalogue lists 1.8m of the world's 1.9m named [[species]].&lt;ref name=COL2018/&gt;

==Structure==
The Catalogue of Life employs a simple data structure to provide information on synonymy, grouping within a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic hierarchy]], common names, distribution and ecological environment.&lt;ref name=COL2018/&gt;

The Catalogue provides a dynamic edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/|title=Catalogue of Life - 30th October 2017 : Search all names|website=www.catalogueoflife.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is updated monthly (and in which data can change without tracking of those changes) and an Annual Checklist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/|title=Catalogue of Life - 2017 Annual Checklist : Search all names|website=www.catalogueoflife.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a dated, verifiable reference for the usage of names and associated data.  Development of the Catalogue of Life was funded through the Species 2000 europa (EuroCat),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sp2000europa.org/|title=Species 2000 europa - Welcome to Species 2000 europa|date=3 February 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203100153/http://sp2000europa.org/|archivedate=3 February 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4d4Life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4d4life.eu/|title=Home - 4D4Life|first=|last=Admin|website=www.4d4life.eu}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; i4Life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i4life.eu/|title=i4life: Indexing For Life|website=www.i4life.eu|access-date=4 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613041431/http://i4life.eu/|archive-date=13 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; projects in 2003-2013, and currently by the [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]], Leiden, the Netherlands and Species Files group at [[Illinois Natural History Survey]], [[Champaign-Urbana]] IL, USA.

==Usage==
Much of the use of the Catalogue is to provide a backbone taxonomy for other global data portals and biological collections. Through the i4Life project it has formal partnerships with [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]], [[European Nucleotide Archive]], [[Encyclopedia of Life]], European [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life]], [[IUCN Red List]], and Life Watch.  
The public interface includes both search and browse functions as well as offering multi lingual services.&lt;ref name=banki2018/&gt;

The catalogue listed 300,000 species by 2003, 500,000 species by 2005, and over 800,000 species by 2006.&lt;ref name=cachuela2006/&gt; As of 2018, the catalogue lists 1.8m of the world's 1.9m named [[species]].&lt;ref name=COL2018/&gt; There are an estimated 14m species, however this number is not certain as there is a lack of data on the possible number of insect, nematode, bacteria and fungus species.&lt;ref name=UNEP2002/&gt;

==Catalogue of Life Plus==
In 2015, an expert panel presented a consensus hierarchical classification of life. The classification embraces 1.6 million species provided by more than 3,000 taxonomists. The unified, coherent, hierarchically-ranked system is known as the Catalogue of Life.&lt;ref name=ruggiero2015/&gt;

In the same year, the Catalogue of Life, Barcode of Life Data System, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Encyclopedia of Life, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility commenced building a single shared authoritative nomenclature and taxonomic foundation that could be used to order and connect biodiversity data. COL+ will develop a clearinghouse covering scientific names across all life, provide a single taxonomic view, and provide an avenue for feedback from content authorities.&lt;ref name=banki2018/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7465">An '''SSH server''' is a software program which uses the [[secure shell]] protocol to accept connections from remote computers. [[SSH File Transfer Protocol|SFTP]]/[[Secure copy|SCP]] file transfers and remote terminal connections are popular use cases for an SSH server. This article compares a selection of popular servers.

==Platform==

The [[operating system]]s or [[virtual machine]]s the SSH servers are designed to run on without [[emulator|emulation]]; there are several possibilities:

* ''No'' indicates that it does not exist or was never released.
* ''Partial'' indicates that while it works, the server lacks important functionality compared to versions for other OSs but may still be under development.
* ''Beta'' indicates that while a version is fully functional and has been released, it is still in development (e.g. for stability).
* ''Yes'' indicates that it has been officially released in a fully functional, stable version.
* ''Dropped'' indicates that while the server works, new versions are no longer being released for the indicated OS; the number in parentheses is the last known stable version which was officially released for that OS.
* ''Included'' indicates that the server comes pre-packaged with or has been integrated into the operating system.

The list is not exhaustive, but rather reflects the most common platforms today.

'''Consistency''' is a term used in the [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] and [[paper]] [[Papermaking|making]] industry.

The consistency of a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;C = x/(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''C'' is consistency, ''x'' is the [[mass]] of pulp, and ''y'' is the mass of the rest of the suspension (usually mainly composed of water).

'''''"Crónica X"''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkɾonika ˈekis}}) is the name given by [[Mesoamerica]]n researchers to a postulated primary-source early 16th century historical work on the traditional history of the [[Aztec]] and other central [[Mexico|Mexican]] peoples, which some researchers theorize formed the basis for several other extant 16th century documents.  The chronicle's author is unknown and the work has been lost, if indeed it ever existed, but it is thought to have been used as a source for several other chronicles that contain striking similarities, among these the Chronicles of Fray [[Diego Durán]], [[Juan de Tovar]] and [[Jose de Acosta]].

The similarities between the materials and scope of documents such as the [[Codex Durán|Durán]], [[Codex Tovar|Tovar]] and [[Codex Acosta|Acosta]] [[Mesoamerican literature|codices]] were first noted by Robert Barlow in 1945, which led him to postulate that they all must have had a particular source in common, which he denoted as ''Crónica X''.

'''DIRKS''', an acronym for '''Designing and Implementing Recordkeeping Systems''', is a [https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/publications/17383 comprehensive manual] outlining the process for creating [[records management]] systems including various business information records and transactions as outlined in the [[Australian Standard]] for Records Management - AS ISO 15489.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macintosh|first1=Stephen|last2=Real|first2=Lynne|title=DIRKS: Putting ISO 15489 to Work|journal=The Information Management Journal|date=April 2007|pages=50–56|url=http://www.arma.org/bookstore/files/Macintosh_Real.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; DIRKS was developed by the [[National Archives of Australia]] in collaboration with the [[State Records Authority of New South Wales]].

The manual consists of two parts, part one is the user's guide and part two is the set of steps themselves. DIRKS is an eight-step process in which all aspects, or as many as possible, of a business are studied in order to achieve a complete [[records management]] practice. In addition to these eight steps DIRKS includes several templates and questionnaires to guide one through the DIRKS methodology.

DIRKS was replaced in 2007 at the Australian Commonwealth level, but continues to be in use at state level in New South Wales as a non-tool to assist the public sector in complying with the [[State Records Authority of New South Wales]] State Records Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DIRKS and the State Records Act |url=http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/recordkeeping/advice/designing-implementing-and-managing-systems/dirks-manual/dirks-and-the-state-records-act |website=NSW Government State Records |publisher=The State Records Authority of New South Wales, Australia |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916165532/http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/recordkeeping/advice/designing-implementing-and-managing-systems/dirks-manual/dirks-and-the-state-records-act |archivedate=16 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps of the DIRKS methodology==

* '''Step A: Preliminary investigation;'''
Before a preliminary investigation occurs DIRKS suggests a pre-preliminary investigation is performed where it is established if there is a need for a [[records management]] program at the organization and is there support for a record keeping system to be put in place. If so the preliminary investigation can take place. There are four components to the DIRKS preliminary investigation.
# Determine the scope of the preliminary investigation
# Collect Information
# Document the research of the investigation
# Report to Senior Management

* '''Step B: Analysis of business activity;'''
The purpose of Step B is to create a set of advisory statements from which an analysis of the organization's business activities can be determined. DIRKS suggests a set of systematic approaches to analyze an organization in a systematic way in order to reveal various business activities, how they are completed and who completes them.

* '''Step C: Identification of recordkeeping requirements;'''
Step C has two main objectives. The first is to determine an organization's requirements in creation and retention of records of its business activities. The second objective is to document the determined requirements in a clear manner that can be used as a reference in the future.

* '''Step D: Assessment of existing systems;'''
The main objective of Step D is to assess the existing recordkeeping systems and any other related information management systems that have the capacity to capture and maintain records. This assessment is to identify weaknesses and strengths within the existing system.

* '''Step E: Identification of strategies for recordkeeping;'''
The main objective of Step E is to determine which policies, procedures, standards and various other tools will help the organization achieve its recordkeeping goals. With these strategies established a model for both record management and recordkeeping can be created.

* '''Step F: Design of a recordkeeping system;'''
The objective in Step F is to use the information gained in steps A through E a plan can be developed that fulfills the requirements set out in Step C. The design should repair any faults found in Step D and include a full plan for integrating the new recordkeeping system

* '''Step G: Implementation of a recordkeeping system;'''
The objective of Step G is put the recordkeeping system that was designed in Step F in place.

* '''Step H: Post-implementation review.'''
The objective of Step H is to measure the effectiveness of the installed system and to make sure that in practice in fulfills all requirements as established and documented throughout the DIRKS manual.

'''Daniel Silvan Evans''' (11 January 1818 – 12 April 1903) was a Welsh clergyman, scholar and [[Lexicography|lexicographer]]. Educated at the [[Brecon Congregational Memorial College|Independent College]] in [[Brecon]], Silvan Evans worked as a schoolmaster for five years. On marriage he conformed to the Established Church, studying at [[St David's College, Lampeter]], where he became Lecturer in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Ordained [[deacon]] in 1848 and priest the following year he served curacies at [[Llandegwning]] parish in [[Llŷn Peninsula|Llŷn]] and from 1852 to 1862 at nearby [[Llangian]], Caernarfonshire. In 1862 he was appointed to the living of [[Llanymawddwy]], Merioneth.

During these years Silvan Evans published ''Blodeu Ieuainc'' (1843), ''Telynegion'' (1846), edited ''Elfennau Gallofyddiaeth'' (1850), ''Elfennau Seryddiaith'' (1851). In 1853 he published [[Ellis Wynne]]'s ''Gweledigaethau y Bardd Cwsg''. He also edited ''Y Brython'' from 1858 to 1860 and published articles in ''Y Gwyddoniadur''. 1856 saw the publication of ''Llythyraeth yr Iaith Gymraeg''.

From Llanymawddwy Evans published ''Gwaith Walter Evans'' ("The Work of Walter Evans", i.e. [[Gwallter Mechain]]), edited ''Y Marchog Crwydrad: Hen Ffuglith Gymreig''. In 1868 his translation of [[William Forbes Skene]]'s ''[[Four Ancient Books of Wales|The Four Ancient Books of Wales]]'' appeared. He edited "Gwilym Lleyn" in the Cambrian Bibliography in 1868 and published three articles in ''[[Revue Celtique]]'' in 1870 and 1875. In 1870 Silvan Evans translated a [[Breton language|Breton]] liturgical text, ''Liherieu hag Avielei''. He edited ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'' from 1871 to 1875.

In 1876 Silvan Evans was collated to the living of [[Llanwrin]], Montgomeryshire. He assisted [[Thomas Stephens (historian)|Thomas Stephens]] with his monumental composition ''Literature of the Kymry'', co-edited a new edition of ''Llyfr Gweddi Cyffredin'' (the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in Welsh), and in 1878 edited [[Lewis Morris (1701–1765)|Lewis Morris]]'s ''Celtic Remains''. Through his son-in-law, Benjamin Williams, Vicar of [[Llanover]], Monmouthshire, he was associated with [[Lady Llanover]]'s attempt to rekindle Welshness on her model estate. These years were saddened by the loss of six of his seven children, and by his wife's fatal accident in 1889.

From 1878 to 1884 Evans held a post as part-time Professor of Welsh at [[University College, Aberystwyth]]. Honours accrued, e.g. a D.Litt. from the University of Wales, collation as Prebendary of Llanfair (18/91) and subsequently (1889) as Chancellor of [[Bangor Cathedral]].
 
Evans is best known for his work on the Welsh language, including his concise English–Welsh dictionary (1858) and the extensive Dictionary (''Geiriadur Cymraeg'') which he began publishing in 1887 and on which he continued to work until his death, at which time he was working on the letter E. His son, [[John Henry Silvan Evans]], joined him in his labours.

According to [[Thomas Parry (author)|Thomas Parry]] (''History of Welsh Literature to 1900''), Silvan Evans coined the word "telyneg" to render the English "lyric", hence the title of an early work, ''Telynegion'' (1846), which apparently contained translations from [[Anacreon]], [[Sappho]], [[Ovid]], French sonnets, and the work of English poets, especially [[Lord Byron]]. Parry judges Silvan Evans to have been overmuch influenced by [[William Owen Pughe]]'s Dictionary in his use of vocabulary. However, R. E. Hughes in the ''[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]'' (1959) claims that Evans "gradually became emancipated" from Pughe's work.

The '''Encyclopédistes''' were members of the [[Société des gens de lettres]], a French writer's society, who contributed to the development of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' from June 1751 to December 1765 under editors [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].  The composition of the 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of [[Typography|plates]] of the ''Encyclopédie'' was the work of over 150 authors belonging, in large part, to the intellectual group known as the [[philosophe]]s. They promoted the advancement of science and secular thought and supported tolerance, rationality, and open-mindedness of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

More than a hundred encyclopédistes have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Kafker and Serena Kafker, ''The Encyclopedists as Individuals: A Biographical Dictionary of the Authors of the Encyclopédie'' (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; They were not a unified group, neither in ideology nor social class.&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Kafker, ''The Encyclopedists as a Group: A Collective Biography of the Authors of the Encyclopédie'' (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Below some of the contributors are listed in alphabetical order, by the number of articles that they wrote, and by the identifying "signature" by which their contributions were identified in the ''Encyclopédie''.

Beyond the known collaborators – at least in name – many articles are not signed and certain authors expressed a desire to remain anonymous.  Other authors, Allard or Dubuisson  for example, remain a mystery to us. Moreover, the sporadic research into the quotations, borrowings, and plagiarisms in the ''Encyclopédie'' – the illustrations as well as the text – illuminate a group of "indirect" collaborators.

==Contributors==

===Denis Diderot===
Diderot had just finished the translation of ''A Medicinal Dictionary'' by [[Robert James (physician)|Robert James]] when the publicist [[André le Breton]] charged him, on 16 October 1747, to resume the project of translating the English [[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|''Cyclopaedia'']] that [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]] could not successfully complete. Diderot undertook the history of ancient philosophy, wrote the ''Prospectus'' and the [[Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot#System of Human Knowledge|''System of Human Knowledge'']], and, with D'Alembert, revised all the articles.

===Le chevalier de Jaucourt===
[[Louis de Jaucourt]] is little known in other respects but was one of the principal authors in the disciplines of economics, literature, medicine, and politics.

===D'Alembert===
[[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] is the author of the [[Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot|''Preliminary Discourse'']] and of several articles.  In 1752 d'Alembert, who was tired of the mocking, cries of indignation, and religious persecution against the ''Encyclopédie'', retired from the encyclopedic undertaking.  Subsequently, his contributions were limited to the subject of mathematics, a sensible topic in the eyes of censors.

'''''Fallout''''' is a [[RTÉ]] two-part fictional, doom laden,&lt;ref name="Edie.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edie.net/news/1/Irish-battle-fallout-from-nuclear-TV-show/11367/ |title=Irish battle fallout from nuclear TV show |website=Edie.net |date=26 April 2006 |access-date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[docudrama]]. It deals with the [[nuclear fallout]] following a hypothetical disaster in the [[Sellafield|Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant]] in [[Cumbria]] on the [[Great Britain|British]] coast of the [[Irish Sea]]. The [[docu-drama]] suggests that, due to a changing wind direction, [[Ireland]] would bear the brunt of the British accident. The docu-drama was based on the false premise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpii.ie/Site/Media/Press-Releases/RTE-s-docudrama-scenario-could-not-happen-accordin.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015024743/http://www.rpii.ie/Site/Media/Press-Releases/RTE-s-docudrama-scenario-could-not-happen-accordin.aspx |archive-date=15 October 2013 |df= }} (?) The [[Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland]] (RPII) has said that the scenario as depicted in tonight’s RTÉ drama, Fallout, could not happen. The RPII, who viewed the drama...has analysed the scenario as depicted and has concluded that it is not possible for such an accident to occur in Sellafield.&lt;/ref&gt; that such an accident as depicted in the drama could happen and that parts of Ireland would need to be evacuated following a serious accident at Sellafield.&lt;ref name="Edie.net" /&gt; Dr Ann McGarry, chief executive of the [[Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland]], said: "The scenario envisaged in the programme is not realistic and grossly exaggerates the amount of radioactivity that could reach Ireland. The RPII cannot envisage any realistic scenario that would cause the radiation levels in Ireland to reach the concentrations as what was depicted in the drama"&lt;/ref&gt; Following the dramatized accident, the docu-drama depicts Irish evacuation riots, [[societal collapse]] and widespread health impacts.&lt;ref  name="Edie.net" /&gt;

==Episodes==

===Part one===
Part One aired on 23 April 2006, and focuses on the immediate aftermath of the incident and the implications which may arise for the Irish population. The plot is released in the style of "breaking news" (from both [[RTÉ News]] and [[BBC News 24]]) and as footage captured by a documentary crew and various [[camera phone]] video clips from eyewitnesses.

===Part two===
Part Two aired 24 April 2006 and is set a year later, dealing with more long-term repercussions such as the social and economic climate. The main characters are revisited and interviewed.

==Criticism==
[[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] [[Dick Roche]] criticized the show for "portraying Irish people as barbaric".&lt;ref&gt;http://feeds.irelandnews.net/?rid=e6c341fe9d4593b2&amp;cat=aba4168066a10b8d&amp;f=1&lt;/ref&gt; The accident scenario is considered outlandish.&lt;ref name="Edie.net" /&gt; In addition, the Irish government are currently attempting through a court action to close the Sellafield nuclear plant; the topic of the programme may be regarded as being ''[[sub judice]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[File:Svc3.jpg|550px]]&lt;br&gt;
When attempting to stem leaks found in the Sellafield facility, an explosion occurs. This sets off a further chain of explosions in the HASTs (Highly Active Storage Tank), resulting in the release of a highly radioactive plume. A north-easterly wind carries this [[radioactive]] material over the Irish Sea, which hits [[Ireland]]'s eastern coast, particularly [[County Louth]] and the [[Dublin]] area (Ireland's main population centre) causing widespread chaos.

However, this is not a credible scenario (for Sellafield at least). While a chemical explosion occurred in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[fission product]] waste storage tank in 1957, this was due to the decomposition of [[red oil]] or alternatively the ignition of an [[acetate]] / [[nitrate]] mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/news/russia/1995/fbust037_95011.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014709/http://fas.org/news/russia/1995/fbust037_95011.htm |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Sellafield no acetate or other chemical [[fuel]] is added to the liquid waste, which is stored in tanks for a short time before being converted to [[glass]]. The waste does not undergo any violent chemical reaction when it is dried out and heated with [[pyrex]] glass in a furnace. The [[Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland]] also voiced criticisms at the time of airing,&lt;ref name="Edie.net" /&gt; Dr Ann McGarry, chief executive of the [[Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland]], said:&lt;ref name="Edie.net" /&gt; {{quote| "The scenario envisaged in the programme is not realistic and grossly exaggerates the amount of radioactivity that could reach Ireland. The RPII cannot envisage any realistic scenario that would cause the radiation levels in Ireland to reach the concentrations as what was depicted in the drama".}} The RPII was also concerned that the programme appeared to suggest that evacuation would be the appropriate response to an accident at Sellafield. With Dr. McGarry explaining that International best practice indicates that evacuation would not be required as Ireland is at sufficient distance from the British nuclear facilities, that radiation levels arising from an accident would never be sufficiently high to give rise to the effects displayed in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpii.ie/Site/Media/Press-Releases/RTE-s-docudrama-scenario-could-not-happen-accordin.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015024743/http://www.rpii.ie/Site/Media/Press-Releases/RTE-s-docudrama-scenario-could-not-happen-accordin.aspx |archivedate=15 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fonthill Letter''' is a letter sent by Ordlaf, [[ealdorman]] of [[Wiltshire]], to King [[Edward the Elder]] (r. 899-924) detailing a property dispute between Ordlaf and Aethelhelm Higa, a rival claimant. While Ordlaf is never explicitly identified as the author, it is apparent due to tenses and position of the speaker throughout the letter. The property in question was five [[Hide (unit)|hide]]s of the Fonthill Estate in Ordlaf's county, which Ordlaf had given to the [[Bishop of Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gretsch|first=Metchthild|title=The Language of the Fonthill Letter|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2314040|publisher=''Anglo-Saxon England'' 23 (1994)|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the letter is not exactly dated, it is suggested that the dispute took place from approximately 897-899/901. This means it starts within the final years of Alfred's reign and the formative period of King Edward the Elder.

The letter, which survives in the original or a contemporary copy, largely believed to be an elaborate copy, traces the intricate history of the estate's ownership, telling of its former owner Helmstan, Ordlaf's Godson and a twice convicted thief of [[King Alfred]]'s intervention, and of how the land subsequently passed into Ordlaf's sole ownership after Helmstan's second conviction for stealing a neighbour's oxen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hough|first=Carole|title=Cattle Tracking in the Fonthill Letter|jstor=580682|publisher=''The English Historical Review'' 115 (2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Great Ridge wood near Chicklade - geograph.org.uk - 465121.jpg|thumb|alt=text|View of Great Ridge wood, part of the Fonthill Estate]]
The letter was intended to be used as evidence in the ongoing lawsuit between Ordlaf and Higa over ownership of the land. Eventually, the letter served its purpose when Higa withdrew from the suit.

The letter is clearly not the work of a professional scribe or experienced writer due to numerous edits and corrections.

== Figures ==
Ealdorman Ordlaf, a grandson of a West Saxon ealdorman, he was probably appointed in the latter years of King Alfred's reign. He is regularly relied upon by Helmstan to support him and pardon him from the crimes he commits.

Helmstan's crimes take the form of first stealing a belt from [[Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians|Aethelred]] which initially leads to the dispute as Aethelhelm Higa can then claim the land should be forfeited to him. King Alfred at this point intervenes and grants Helmstan the right to maintain ownership. This did, however, damage Helmstan's standing and his consequent conviction for cattle-stealing was therefore magnified and his previous ill repute was raised during the second stage of the dispute.

Aethelhelm Higa is throughout the letter seen as the rival claimant. Very little is known about him although it is possible he was a descendent of either Aethelwulf and Aethelthryth or heir of Oswulf. In either case it seems he believed he should inherit the land by right and thus following Helmstan's conviction attempts to claim the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Fonthill Letter|last = Keynes|first = Simon|date = 1992|journal = Words, Texts and manuscripts: studies in Anglo-Saxon culture presented to Helmut Gneuss on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
The letter begins by following the conventional introduction for addressing the king and outlining the main purpose of the document, mainly the outlining of how the land at Fonthill was passed around.

According to Keynes the story began in the last year or so of King Alfred’s reign, when Helmstan stole a belt belonging to a certain Aethelred. Although not detailed, it already shows Helmstan to have thief tendencies and this becomes important further into the letter. (He would then be treated in law as a man of ill-repute.) The importance of remaining ‘oath-worthy’ was therefore lost for Helmstan and his later conviction for cattle stealing brought up his previous crime and required Ordlaf to become involved.

Following the initial accusations, Helmstan called on Ordlaf (godfather) to support him and his involvement then brought in Alfred as an inconsequential piece of land would never largely require his personal dedication.

Alfred granted Helmstan entitlement to proceed with establishing his ownership but this still did not ensure asecure sense. Higa and Helmstan were ordered to reach an agreement. In the arbitration of the dispute, Helmstan once again can be accused of stealing as he never appears on a charter for his ownership of land and he may therefore have stolen the relevant charters from the rightful owner. However, these proved enough to ensure Helmstan maintained right to the land. This links to a treatise from the reign of King Edgar, the importance of proof of possession is greater than the one who attempts to claim the land.

On a specific date, Helmstan began to worry about the requisite oath; this resulted in him again calling on Ordlaf and offering him the land in exchange for assistance{{snd}} effectively a bribe, even though Ordlaf attempts to describe it as otherwise in the letter. After again succeeding in holding on to the land, the deed was given to Ordlaf (showing how Anglo-Saxon transfer of land would be related to the relevant title-deed).

After an unknown period of time, Helmstan was caught stealing cattle and leading them from Fonthill (now Ordlafs estate) to his own neighbouring land. He was caught, however, after being scratched by a bramble attempting to run away from his pursuer.

Due to his previous convictions and substantial evidence against him, Helmstan could no longer avoid conviction and Ordlaf could no longer assist him. All his goods were taken and land forfeited. This section of the letter does, however, raise the debate about Helmstan’s status and it is possible that he held a large area of land nearby and as such had a much more prominent presence in the locality, this points to him potentially being much more than a petty thief.

This did, however, mean that Ordlaf resumed possession of the five hides. A general principle of Anglo-Saxon law therefore emerges that any bookland would pass to the king on forfeiture while any land held on loan would revert to its rightful owner (although this may not have been universal and other claimants may emerge, thus a motivation for this letter perhaps).

Helmstan never regained Fonthill but, after Alfred’s death and swearing an oath at his grave, Edward reversed his outlawry and granted him some property.

Following this, Ordlaf promptly returns to authority over Fonthill but trades this with the bishop for 5 hides in Lydiard. Keynes’s section 15 thus sees Ordlaf appeal to the king to maintain the status quo as his new land relies on the continuance of the bishop holding Fonthill (which is still noted as belonging to the bishop of Winchester in 1066 and 1086)

An endorsement on the letter after it had been folded is then added described Higa withdrawing from his suit against the bishop but the exact nature of this is unknown.

This chronology owes much to the work of Simon Keynes and his analysis of the Fonthill Letter.

== Importance to Historians ==
The letter would not have been significant at the time and would not have become a topic within the headlines of the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon chronicle.]] However, historians now place great emphasis on the lessons it teaches about the working of Anglo-Saxon law and legal practices. It first received attention from Kentish antiquary [[William Somner]] and the letters text first appeared in print in the 1840 publication of [[John Mitchell Kemble|John Mitchell Kemble's]] ''Codex Diplomaticus.'' It has now been approached by many historians with prominent examples being [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Dorothy Whitelock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = English Historical Documents c.500-1042, 2nd Edition|last = Whitelock|first = Dorothy|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 544–547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document shows the earliest example of sent from an Anglo-Saxon layman to the king, it also shows the importance of kindred ties within Anglo-Saxon society as highlighted by the consistent support offered by Ordlaf for his godson Helmstan. The letter also raises concerns of corruption and abuse of power as seen through Helmstan's ability to twist proceedings through connections with powerful figures such as Ordlaf.

== Notes ==
If looking for an accurate translation, then Whitelock's  work in English Historical Documents offers an easy way to understand the events of the source material. Similarly, Simon Keyne's analysis of the document in 16 separate sections make understanding what can be a confusing document and otherwise easier task.

'''Frommer's''' is a [[travel]] guidebook series created by [[Arthur Frommer]]. Frommer's has expanded to include more than 350 guidebooks across 14 series, as well as other media including the radio show ''Frommer's Travel Show'' and the website Frommers.com. In 2017, Frommer's celebrated its 60th anniversary of guidebook publishing.&lt;ref name="50 years" /&gt; Since May 2007, Arthur Frommer has been blogging about travel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://frommers.com/blog/| title=Arthur Frommer Online| accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Frommers.com website.

== History ==
In 1957, Arthur Frommer, a young [[corporal]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], wrote a travel guide for American GIs in Europe, and then produced a civilian version called ''Europe on $5 a Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://travel.latimes.com/daily-deal-blog/index.php/on-the-spot-arthur-f-4369/|title=

It was the first travel guide to show Americans that they could afford to travel in Europe.
Arthur Frommer returned to the United States and began practicing law. During that time, he continued to write and also began to self-publish guidebooks to additional destinations, including New York, Mexico, Hawaii, Japan and the Caribbean. In 1977, Frommer’s trademark was sold to [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], Inc. [[Pearson plc|Pearson]] bought the reference division of Simon &amp; Schuster in 1998 and sold it to [[International Data Group|IDG Books]] in 1999. [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] acquired IDG Books (renamed Hungry Minds) in 2001. Arthur’s daughter, Pauline Frommer, was writing her own series of travel guidebooks and continuing the Frommer’s travel legacy.&lt;ref name="50 years"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20070513/ai_n19113916/|title=

On August 13, 2012, it was announced that [[Google]] was acquiring Frommer's for an undisclosed sum of money.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444772404577587131075164366 "Google to Buy Frommer's Travel Brand"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604102253/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444772404577587131075164366.html |date=June 4, 2013 }} August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2013, it was reported that Google ended the manufacturing of Frommer's guidebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clampet|first1=Jason|title=Google Is Quietly Pulling The Plug On Frommer’s Print Travel Guidebooks|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/google-is-quietly-pulling-the-plug-on-frommers-print-travel-guidebooks-2013-3|accessdate=August 4, 2015|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2013, it was announced that the Frommer's brand has been reacquired by Arthur Frommer and his daughter Pauline Frommer.&lt;ref name="Frommer's BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22024603 | title=Google 'sells Frommer's guides business back to founder' | accessdate=April 5, 2013 | work=BBC News | date=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; . In July 2013, Arthur Frommer struck a deal with [[Publishers Group West]] to distribute and promote Frommer's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bosman|first1=Julie|title=Sold Back to Its Founder, Frommer’s to Publish Anew|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/business/media/sold-back-to-its-founder-frommers-to-publish-anew.html|accessdate=August 4, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Frommer's guides are now once again available wherever books are sold. Frommer's EasyGuide to New York City has been the best selling guide to Gotham since its debut in 2014.

'''''Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine''''' is an American [[textbook]] of [[internal medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simonson|first=MT|title=Product review. Harrison's Online.|journal=National network (Dallas, Tex.)|date=July 2000|volume=25|issue=1|pages=28–9|pmid=11184336}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1950, it is in its 19th edition (published in April 2015 by [[McGraw-Hill Professional]] {{ISBN|978-0071802154}}) and comes in two volumes. Although it is aimed at all members of the medical profession, it is mainly used by [[internist]]s and junior doctors in this field, as well as [[medical student]]s. It is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative books on internal medicine and has been described as the "most recognized book in all of medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malani|first=Preeti N.|title=Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=7 November 2012|volume=308|issue=17|pages=1813|doi=10.1001/jama.308.17.1813-b|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1389591|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is named after [[Tinsley R. Harrison]] of [[Birmingham, Alabama]], who served as [[editor-in-chief]] of the first five editions and established the format of the work: a strong basis of clinical medicine interwoven with an understanding of [[pathophysiology]].

==History==
It was published in 1950.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/12/tinsley_harrison_draft.html|title=Legendary Tinsley Harrison - UAB med school pioneer, doctor, teacher - subject of new bio|work=AL.com|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creator and editor Tinsley Harrison's quotation appeared on the first edition of this book in 1950: {{cquote|No greater opportunity or obligation can fall the lot of a human being than to be a physician. In the care of suffering he needs technical skill, scientific knowledge and human understanding. He who uses these with courage, humility and wisdom will provide a unique service to his fellow man and will build an enduring edifice of character within himself. The physician should ask of his destiny no more than this and he should be content with no less.}}

The 17th edition of the textbook is dedicated to George W. Thorn, who was editor of the first seven editions of the book and editor in chief of the eighth edition. He died in 2004.

The 18th edition of the book was edited by  [[Anthony Fauci]], Dennis Kasper, [[Stephen Hauser]], J. Larry Jameson and Joseph Loscalzo. New chapters added include "Systems Biology in Health and Disease," "The Human Microbiome," "The Biology of Aging," and "Neuropsychiatric Illnesses in War Veterans."

Prior to globalization of the Internet, its assignment of domain names was administered within the research and academic communities, through the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] ('''IANA''').  As the Internet grew to a global service, in the 1990s, there was increasing pressure to add more "generic" top-level domain names, beyond the initial set, such as .com and .org and the two-letter country codes.  Extensive debate within the Internet operational community did not resolve this.  Finally, a composite group was formed, to create a proposal for the enhancement.  The '''International Ad Hoc Committee''' ('''IAHC''') was composed of members named by a variety of Internet and International sponsoring organizations.

The IAHC had a limited charter: "The IAHC is an international multi-organization effort for specifying and implementing policies and procedures relating to iTLD." ('international' TLDs are now called 'generic' TLDs, or gTLDs.)

== Sponsoring Organizations ==
*[[Internet Society]] (ISOC)
*[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA)
*[[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB)
*[[Federal Networking Council]] (FNC)
*[[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU)
*[[International Trademark Association]] (INTA)
*[[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO)

Members of IAHC:
*Sally Abel
*Dave Crocker
*Perry E. Metzger
*Jun Murai
*Hank Nussbacher
*Robert Shaw
*Donald M. Heath
*Geoff Huston
*George Strawn
*David W. Maher
*Albert Tramposch
*Committee outside counsel was Stuart Levi

== Results ==
The IAHC produced a draft proposal with a number of administrative recommendations, beyond the set of candidate gTLD names.  These included:

* Use of the term generic topic-level domain (gTLD), rather than "international" TLD
* A registrary/registrar model, as currently employed under [[ICANN]]
* A policy for resolution of trademark-related domain name disputes that became the basis for the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) that is currently part of [[ICANN]] policies.
* Notification of name assignments prior to issuance, in case of trademark concerns

The group's work culminated in a "Memorandum of Understanding". It describes a procedure of allocation and administration for domain names, specifically [[top-level domains]]. The "Generic Top Level Domain Memorandum of Understanding" ('''gTLD-MoU''') was open to signature by any organization, with approximately 226 groups doing so.

The organization was dissolved on 1 May 1997. Its effort was subsumed under the authority of [[ICANN]].  When
the U.S. government's activities concerning Internet Domain Name administration issued its preliminary "[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/domainname130.htm Green Paper]" in 1998, the efforts of the
IAHC were not referenced.  However the final "White Paper" gave credit to the
IAHC efforts: "The IAHC issued a draft plan in December
1996 that introduced unique and thoughtful concepts for the evolution of
DNS administration." The structure of ICANN, including the UDRP and the registrar/registry construct, was
ultimately based on the substance of the proposals in the IAHC gTLD-MoU.

== Proposed TLDs ==
The IAHC proposed seven new top-level domains:

{| align="center" 
|-
||&lt;code&gt;.arts&lt;/code&gt;||culture and entertainment
|-
||&lt;code&gt;.firm&lt;/code&gt;||businesses
|-
||&lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt;||information services
|-
||&lt;code&gt;.nom&lt;/code&gt;||personal nomenclature
|-
||&lt;code&gt;.rec&lt;/code&gt;||recreation and entertainment
|-
||&lt;code&gt;.store&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||businesses selling goods
|-
||&lt;code&gt;.web&lt;/code&gt;||World Wide Web related
|}
The gTLD-MoU interim Policy Oversight Committee replaced &lt;code&gt;.store&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;.shop&lt;/code&gt;.

The IAHC and gTLD-MOU effort did not produce implementation of these names. (The &lt;code&gt;[[.info]]&lt;/code&gt; that now exists came from a later proposal under ICANN.)

      <comment>Surely this whole claim about him being "one of the founding fathers of modern anthropology" must be removed. It is totally uncited and is never mentioned in the body. I cannot find a source for it and it seems highly dubious, given that hardly any anthropologists today take more than a minute fraction of what Frazer wrote seriously.</comment>

'''Sir James George Frazer''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OM|FRS|FRSE|FBA}}&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|eɪ|z|ər}}; 1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941) was a Scottish [[social anthropologist]] and [[folklore studies|folklorist]]&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; influential in the early stages of the modern studies of [[mythology]] and [[comparative religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard, "Frazer, Leach, and Virgil: The Popularity (and Unpopularity) of the Golden Bough," ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', '''34'''.2 (April 1992:203–224).&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous work, ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890), documents and details the similarities among magical and religious beliefs around the globe. Frazer posited that human belief progressed through three stages: primitive magic, replaced by religion, in turn replaced by science.

==Personal life==

He was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, the son of Daniel F. Frazer, a chemist, and his wife, Katherine Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer attended school at Springfield Academy and [[Larchfield Academy]] in [[Helensburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaques Waardenburg. 1999. ''Classical Approaches to the Study of Religion. Aims, Methods and Theories of Research,'' Volume I: ''Introduction and Anthology'', p244. New York : Walter de Gruyter. {{ISBN|3-11-016328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with honours in [[Classics]] (his dissertation was published years later as ''The Growth of [[Plato]]'s Ideal Theory'') and remained a Classics Fellow all his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=FRSR874JG|name=Frazer, James George}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Trinity, he went on to study law at the [[Middle Temple]], but never practised.

Four times elected to Trinity's [[Title Alpha Fellowship]], he was associated with the college for most of his life, except for a year, 1907–1908, spent at the [[University of Liverpool]]. He was knighted in 1914, and a [[Frazer Lecture|public lectureship]] in social anthropology at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Glasgow and Liverpool was established in his honour in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/addresstosirjame00slsn#page/n1/mode/2up Address to Sir James George Frazer on the occasion of the foundation, in his honour, of the Frazer Lectureship in Social Anthropology in the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow and Liverpool (1920)].&lt;/ref&gt; He was, if not blind, then severely visually impaired from 1930 on. He and his wife, Lilly, died in [[Cambridge]] within a few hours of each other. They are buried at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish Burial Ground]] in [[Cambridge]], England.

His sister Isabella Katherine Frazer married the mathematician [[John Steggall]] [[FRSE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer is commonly interpreted as an atheist in light of his criticism of [[Christianity]] and especially [[Roman Catholicism]] in ''The Golden Bough''. However, his later writings and unpublished materials suggest an ambivalent relationship with [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==His work==

The study of [[mythology|myth]] and religion became his areas of expertise. Except for visits to Italy and Greece, Frazer was not widely travelled. His prime sources of data were ancient histories and questionnaires mailed to missionaries and imperial officials all over the globe. Frazer's interest in social anthropology was aroused by reading [[E. B. Tylor]]'s ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) and encouraged by his friend, the biblical scholar [[William Robertson Smith]], who was comparing elements of the Old Testament with early Hebrew folklore.

Frazer was the first scholar to describe in detail the relations between [[myths and rituals]]. His vision of the annual sacrifice of the [[Year-King]] has not been borne out by field studies. Yet ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', his study of ancient cults, rites, and myths, including their parallels in early Christianity, continued for many decades to be studied by modern mythographers for its detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;D Daiches ed., ''Companion to Literature 1'' (1968) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition, in two volumes, was published in 1890; and a second, in three volumes, in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;R Fraser Intro, ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. xl&lt;/ref&gt; The third edition was finished in 1915 and ran to twelve volumes, with a supplemental thirteenth volume added in 1936. He published a single-volume abridged version, largely compiled by his wife Lady Frazer, in 1922, with some controversial material on Christianity excluded from the text.&lt;ref&gt;For the history of ''The Golden Bough'' see R. Fraser, ''The Making of The Golden Bough: The Origins and Growth of an Argument'' (London, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The work's influence extended well beyond the conventional bounds of academia, inspiring the new work of psychologists and psychiatrists. [[Sigmund Freud]] cited ''Totemism and Exogamy'' frequently in his own ''[[Totem and Taboo]]: Resemblances Between the Psychic Lives of Savages and Neurotics''.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Totem and Taboo: Resemblances Between the Psychic Life of Savages and Neurotics,'' trans., A.A. Brill (London: Routledge and Sons, 1919), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolic cycle of life, death and rebirth which Frazer divined behind myths of many peoples captivated a generation of artists and poets. Perhaps the most notable product of this fascination is [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922).

Frazer's pioneering work&lt;ref&gt;"For those who see Frazer's work as the start of [[Social anthropology|anthropological study]] in its modern sense, the site and the cult of Nemi must hold a particular place: This&lt;!--capitalised in original--&gt; colourful but minor backwater of Roman religion marks the source of the discipline of [[Social anthropology]]", remarks Mary Beard, in noting the critical reassessment of Frazer's work following [[Edmund Leach]], "Frazer, Leach, and Virgil: The Popularity (and Unpopularity) of the Golden Bough," ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', 34.2 (April 1992:203–224), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticised by late 20th-century scholars. For instance, in the 1980s [[Edmund Leach]] wrote a series of critical articles, one of which was featured as the lead in ''[[Anthropology Today]]'', vol. 1 (1985).&lt;ref&gt;Leach, "Reflections on a visit to Nemi: did Frazer get it wrong?", ''Anthropology Today'' '''1''' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised ''The Golden Bough'' for the breadth of comparisons drawn from widely separated cultures, but often based his comments on the abridged edition, which omits the supportive archaeological details. In a positive review of a book narrowly focused on the ''[[Cult (religion)|cultus]]'' in the Hittite city of Nerik, J. D. Hawkins remarked approvingly in 1973, "The whole work is very methodical and sticks closely to the fully quoted documentary evidence in a way that would have been unfamiliar to the late Sir James Frazer."&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, reviewing Volkert Haas, ''Der Kult von Nerik: ein Beitrag zur hethitischen Religionsgeschichte'', in ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London'' 
'''36'''.1 (1973:128).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, ''The Golden Bough'' has been criticized for what are widely perceived as [[imperialism|imperialist]], [[anti-Catholic]], classist and racist elements, including Frazer's assumptions that European peasants, [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Africa|Africans]] represented fossilized, earlier stages of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Chidester (2014), p. x-xi, 5, 8; and Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important work by Frazer is his six-volume commentary on the Greek traveller Pausanias' description of Greece in the mid-2nd century AD. Since his time, archaeological excavations have added enormously to the knowledge of ancient Greece, but scholars still find much of value in his detailed historical and topographical discussions of different sites, and his eyewitness accounts of Greece at the end of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date =December 2012}}

===Theories of Religion and Cultural Evolution===
Among the most influential elements of the third edition of ''The Golden Bough'' is Frazer's theory of [[cultural evolution]] and the place Frazer assigns religion and [[magic (supernatural)|magic]] in that theory. Frazer's theory of cultural evolution was not absolute and could reverse, but sought to broadly describe three (or possibly, four) spheres through which cultures were thought to pass over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Carneiro | first = Robert L. | title = Evolutionism in Cultural Anthropology: A Critical History | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2003 | page = 29|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IJdNDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Carneiro+Evolutionism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHx6HD8KbcAhWsd98KHRbnC9MQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false | isbn = 0429980302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the possibility of a fourth stage see Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 146-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frazer believed that, over time, culture passed through three stages, moving from magic, to religion, to science. Frazer's classification notably diverged from earlier anthropological descriptions of cultural evolution, including that of [[Auguste Comte]], because he claimed magic was both initially separate from religion and invariably preceded religion.&lt;ref&gt;Chidester (2014), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt; He also defined magic separately from belief in the supernatural and superstition, presenting an ultimately ambivalent view of its place in culture.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 142-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer believed that magic and science were similar because both shared an emphasis on experimentation and practicality; indeed, his emphasis on this relationship is so broad that almost any disproven scientific hypothesis technically constitutes magic under his system.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski (2014), n. pag.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to both magic and science, Frazer defined religion in terms of belief in personal, supernatural forces and attempts to appease them. As historian of religion Jason Josephson-Storm describes Frazer's views, Frazer saw religion as "a momentary aberration in the grand trajectory of human thought."&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He thus ultimately proposed - and attempted to further - a narrative of [[secularization]] and one of the first social-scientific expressions of a [[disenchantment]] narrative.

At the same time, Frazer was aware that both magic and religion could persist or return. He noted that magic sometimes returned so as to become science, such as when [[alchemy]] underwent a revival in Early Modern Europe and became [[chemistry]]. On the other hand, Frazer displayed a deep anxiety about the potential of widespread belief in magic to empower the masses, indicating fears of and biases against lower-class people in his thought.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 145-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin-of-death stories==
{{main|Origin-of-death myth}}
Frazer collected stories from throughout the British Empire and devised four general classifications into which many of them could be grouped:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mythology: Myths, Legends and Fantasies |author1=Janet Parker |author2=Alice Mills |author3=Julie Stanton |page=306 |chapter=Myths of Death |isbn=978-1-77007-453-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Struik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jgf&gt;{{citation |title=The Belief in Immortality and The Worship of the Dead |author=J. G. Frazer |isbn=978-1-4400-4514-1 |publisher=Macmillan |year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Story of the Two Messengers===
This type of story is common in Africa.  Two messages are carried from the supreme being to mankind: one of eternal life and one of death.  The messenger carrying the tidings of eternal life is delayed, and so the message of death is received first by mankind.&lt;ref name=jgf/&gt;

The [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people of Southern Africa, such as the [[Zulu people|Zulu]], tell that [[Unkulunkulu]], the Old Old One, sent a message that men should not die, giving it to the [[chameleon]].  The chameleon was slow and dawdled, taking time to eat and sleep.  Unkulunkulu meanwhile had changed his mind and gave a message of death to the lizard who travelled quickly and so overtook the chameleon.  The message of death was delivered first and so, when the chameleon arrived with its message of life, mankind would not hear it and so is fated to die.&lt;ref name=jgf/&gt;

Because of this, Bantu people, such as the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]], punish lizards and chameleons.  For example, children may be allowed to put tobacco into a chameleon's mouth so that the [[nicotine]] poisons it and the creature dies, writhing while turning colours.&lt;ref name=jgf/&gt;

Variations of the tale are found in other parts of Africa.  The [[Kamba people|Akamba]] say the messengers are the chameleon and the [[robin-chat|thrush]] while the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] say they are the goat and the sheep.&lt;ref name=jgf/&gt;

The [[Bura-Pabir language|Bura people]] of northern [[Nigeria]] say that, at first, neither death nor disease existed but, one day, a man became ill and died.  The people sent a worm to ask the sky deity, Hyel, what they should do with him.  The worm was told that the people should hang the corpse in the fork of a tree and throw mush at it until it came back to life.  But a malicious lizard, Agadzagadza,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Eva M. Thury |author2=Margaret K. Devinney |year=2005 |title=Introduction to Mythology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-517968-2 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; hurried ahead of the worm and told the people to dig a grave, wrap the corpse in cloth, and bury it. The people did this. When the worm arrived and said that they should dig up the corpse, place it in a tree, and throw mush at it, they were too lazy to do this, and so death remained on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopedia of World Mythology |author=Arthur Cotterell |chapter=Death comes into the world |quote=Long ago, there was no such thing as death. All were therefore surprised when a man died. They sent a worm to the sky to ask Hyel, the supreme deity (Bura, Pabir/Nigeria), what they should do. |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-7607-2855-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation |last=Scheub |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold Scheub |title=The African storyteller: stories from African oral traditions |year=1990 |publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-8403-6037-3 |page=52 |quote= the Bura people [...] had an unusually full system of culture embedded in their folk tales.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Bura story has the common mythic [[motif (narrative)|motif]] of a vital message which is diverted by a [[trickster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Scheub |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold Scheub |title=Meanings: Manual for the African Storyteller |year=1994 |publisher=Kendall/Hunt |isbn=978-0-8403-9934-2 |page=27 |quote=The motif is a venerable mythic motif, the interrupted message, and raises the question of what would have happened if only, if only . . . A worm, in this incarnation of the motif, is to inform the humans that life is everlasting. But a trickster of a lizard overtakes the worm, and gives the wrong message: humans are evanescent. So it is that death comes permanently into the world. And the storyteller adds a scene in which the onus for death is placed entirely on the backs of humans: people are too lazy to retrieve the corpse and hang it on a tree.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moon phase calendar 2005.png|thumb|upright|The phases of the moon]]

In [[Togoland]], the messengers were the dog and the frog, and, as in the Bura version, the messengers go first from mankind to God to get answers to their questions.&lt;ref name=jgf/&gt;

===The Story of the Waxing and Waning Moon===
The [[lunar phase|moon]] regularly seems to disappear and then return.  This gave primitive peoples the idea that man should or might return from death in a similar way.  Stories that associate the moon with the origin of death are found especially around the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] region.  In [[Fiji]], it is said that the moon suggested that mankind should return as he did. But the rat god, ''Ra Kalavo'', would not permit this, insisting that men should die like rats. In Australia, the [[Wotjobaluk]] aborigines say that the moon used to revive the dead until an old man said that this should stop. The [[Cham people (Asia)|Cham]] have it that the goddess of good luck used to revive the dead, but the sky-god sent her to the moon so she could not do this any more.&lt;ref name=jgf/&gt;

[[File:Nerodia sipedon shedding.JPG|thumb|upright|A snake shedding its skin]]

===The Story of the Serpent and his Cast Skin===
Animals which [[moulting|shed their skin]], such as [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s, appeared to be immortal to primitive people.  This led to stories in which mankind lost the ability to do this.  For example, in [[Vietnam]], it was said that the [[Jade Emperor]] sent word from heaven to mankind that, when they became old, they should shed their skins while the serpents would die and be buried.  But some snakes overheard the command and threatened to bite the messenger unless he switched the message, so that man would die while snakes would be eternally renewed.  For the natives of the island of [[Nias]], the story was that the messenger who completed their creation failed to [[fasting|fast]] and ate bananas rather than crabs. If he had eaten the latter, then mankind would have shed their skins like crabs and so lived eternally.&lt;ref name=jgf/&gt;

[[File:The Lost Gardens of Heligan - geograph.org.uk - 1328024.jpg|thumb|upright|Dead banana plants]]

===The Story of the Banana===
The [[banana]] plant bears its fruit on a stalk which dies after bearing.  This gave people such as the Nias islanders the idea that they had inherited this short-lived property of the banana rather than the immortality of the crab.  The natives of [[Poso]] also based their myth on this property of the banana. Their story is that the creator in the sky would lower gifts to mankind on a rope and, one day, a stone was offered to the first couple. They refused the gift as they did not know what to do with it and so the creator took it back and lowered a banana.  The couple ate this with relish, but the creator told them that they would live as the banana, perishing after having children rather than remaining everlasting like the stone.&lt;ref name=jgf/&gt;

==Reputation and criticism==
===Misleading use of scientific terminology===
Frazer frequently used scientific terminology and analogies to describe ritual practices.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|pages=43–46}} For instance, he wrote: "accordingly in these cases the oath, or whatever the ceremony may be, is purely magical in character. The man absorbs the valuable properties of the stone just as he might absorb electrical force from a battery; he is, to say, petrified by the stone in the one case, just as he is electrified by the electricity in the other."{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=43}} In other cases, he conflated magic and science altogether, speaking of the "magic wand of science".{{sfn|Larsen|2014|pages=43–44}} He often baldly characterized magical rituals as "infallible" without clarifying that this is merely what believers in the rituals thought.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=44}}

Frazer always wanted to portray himself as a careful and scientific writer.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|pages=37–46}} He wrote vivid descriptions of magical practices with the intention to repel readers, but, instead, these descriptions more often allured them.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=46}} Classicist [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] once commented that, if one wishes to go out and buy a copy of Frazer's ''Golden Bough'', that person's best bet is in an occult bookshop.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=46}}

==="Christianization" of non-Christian cultures===
One of the most longstanding criticisms of Frazer is that he applied western European Christian ideas, theology, and terminology to non-Christian cultures, thereby distorting those cultures to make them appear more Christian.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|pages=46–48}} In one extreme case, Frazer took the word "[[scapegoat]]", originally coined in English to describe the specific ritual briefly mentioned in the [[Book of Leviticus]] {{bibleverse-nb|Leviticus|16:8}}, and applied it to cultures all around the world from all different time periods.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=46}} Frazer routinely described non-Christian religious figures by equating them with Christian ones.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=47}} For instance, he speaks of "the [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentot]] [[Adam]]" and "[[Deucalion]], the Greek [[Noah]]".{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=47}} Frazer particularly applied Christian terms to [[functionaries]], for instance calling the elders of the Njamus of [[East Africa]] "equivalent to the [[Levites]] of Israel"{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=47}} and the [[Dalai Lama|Grand Lama]] of [[Lhasa]] "the Buddhist [[Pope]]... the [[God-man (Christianity)|man-god]] who bore his people's sorrows, the [[Good Shepherd]] who laid down his life for the sheep".{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=47}} He routinely uses the specifically Christian theological terms "[[born again]]", "new birth", "[[baptism]]", "[[Infant baptism|christening]]", "[[sacrament]]", and "unclean" in reference to non-Christian cultures.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=47}}

When Frazer's Australian colleague [[Walter Baldwin Spencer]] requested to use native terminology to describe [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal Australian]] cultures, arguing that doing so would be more accurate, since the Christian terms were loaded with Christian connotations that would be completely foreign to members of the cultures he was describing, Frazer insisted that he should use Judeo-Christian terms instead, telling him that using native terms would be off-putting and would seem pedantic.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=47}} A year later, Frazer excoriated Spencer for refusing to equate the non-estrangement of Aboriginal Australian [[totem]]s with the Christian doctrine of [[reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]].{{sfn|Larsen|2014|pages=47–48}} When Spencer, who had actually studied the aboriginals firsthand, objected that the ideas were not even remotely similar, Frazer insisted that they were exactly equivalent.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=48}} Based on these exchanges, historian [[Timothy Larsen]] concludes that Frazer's deliberate use of Judeo-Christian terminology in the place of native terminology was not to make native cultures seem less strange, but rather to make Christianity seem more strange and barbaric.{{sfn|Larsen|2014|page=48}}

'''Joconde''' is the central database created in 1975 and now available online, maintained by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]], for objects in the collections of the main French public and private museums listed as ''Musées de France'', according to article L. 441-1 of the ''Code du patrimoine'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006159946&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006074236&amp;dateTexte=20090506|title=Code du patrimoine - Legifrance|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; amouting to more than 1,200 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/joconde/fr/apropos/presentation-joconde.htm|title=Joconde - catalogue - présentation|website=www2.culture.gouv.fr|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"La Joconde" is the French name of the [[Mona Lisa]], which like about half of the collections of the [[Louvre]], is included in the database, as one of 295 items by (42 including 6 paintings), after, or connected with [[Leonardo da Vinci]].  By November 2012, Joconde contained over 475,000 object listings online and over 290,000 with images,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/joconde/fr/decouvrir/nouveaute.htm Latest counts, top of "New" page] Joconde, accessed 20 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; from 366 collections in France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/joconde/fr/apropos/presentation-joconde.htm Joconde] "Presentations", and "New"&lt;/ref&gt; including 209,350 drawings, 63,547 paintings, 34,561 prints, 34,102 sculptures or 16,631 costumes and their accessories and is still expanding.

The database is not only dedicated to the information of the public but as well to the needs of the administrators and curators of the museums, thanks to the online presentation of professional tools to facilitate notably the museums collections cataloguing and state inventory (''récolement''). This explains the great precision of the listings. Since the museums participate on a voluntary basis to the regular enrichment of the database, some can present a large part of their collection, while others appear only because of the mere permanent deposits made by the first ones.

Live on the French [[Minitel]] system from 1992, the database went online to the [[World Wide Web]] in 1995. Originally just for objects from the [[fine arts]] and [[decorative arts]], in 2004 Joconde was united with what had been separate databases for objects from [[archeology]] and [[ethnology]].  It comes under the "Direction des Musées de France" (DMF) section of the Ministry.

The listing details are highly structured, using a special vocabulary, which allows for very specific and accurate searches, helped as well by the index.  A small number of the best known objects have a prose commentary.  Not all images are in colour, especially for the archaeological collections.  When an object created after the 19th century has no image this is most often for copyright reasons.

'''Mainstreaming''', in the context of [[education]], is the practice of placing students with special education services in a general education classroom during specific time periods based on their skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/mainstreaming.html] Definition of mainstreaming, accessed October 11, 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5OWiMG?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/mainstreaming.html Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means general education classes are combined with [[special education]] classes. Schools that practice mainstreaming believe that students with special needs who cannot function in a general education classroom to a certain extent belong in the special education environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weac.org/resource/june96/speced.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014004553/http://www.weac.org/resource/june96/speced.htm |archivedate=2007-10-14 |df= }} Mainstreaming: "Special needs students "belong" in the special classroom", accessed October 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to a special education classroom, often called a "self-contained classroom or [[resource room]]", is valuable to the student with a disability. Students have the ability to work one-to-one with special education teachers, addressing any need for remediation during the school day. Many researchers, educators and parents have advocated the importance of these classrooms amongst political environments that favor their elimination.&lt;ref&gt;The Effectiveness of Resource Programming
Sindelar and Deno ''J Spec Educ''.1978; 12: 17-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of both philosophy of [[inclusion (education)|educational inclusion]] assert that educating children with disabilities alongside their non-disabled peers fosters understanding and tolerance, better preparing students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school.&lt;ref&gt;IDEA Funding Coalition, "IDEA Funding: Time for a New Approach," Mandatory Funding Proposal, Feb. 20 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Children with special needs may face social stigma as a result of being mainstreamed, but also may help them socially develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theclassroom.com/advantages-disadvantages-mainstreaming-special-education-children-25659.html|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages to Mainstreaming Special Education Children|website=The Classroom.com|author=Carissa Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Benefits to students with disabilities===


*''Higher academic achievement:'' Mainstreaming has shown to be more academically effective than exclusion practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weac.org/resource/june96/speced.htm Special Education Inclusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014004553/http://www.weac.org/resource/june96/speced.htm |date=2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, The National Research Center on Learning Disabilities found that graduation rates of all students with disabilities in the U.S. increased by 14% from 1984 to 1997, although this report does not differentiate between students enrolled in mainstreaming, inclusive, or segregated programs.&lt;ref&gt;(2006). Mainstreaming Deaf Students. Independent School, 66, 6. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from EBSCOhost database.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to a [[resource room]] for direct instruction has shown to be effective in increasing students academic skills and thus increasing the abilities applied by students in a general education setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = B.J.F. | last2 = Poon | first2 = L.W. | year = 2001 | title = Effects of structure strategy training and signalling on recall of text | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 140–160 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.93.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to full-time placement in a special education class or [[special school]], both part-time and full-time placement in the regular classroom have been shown to improve academic achievement in students with mild academic disabilities, as well as to improve their long-term behavior.&lt;ref&gt;NA Madden, RE Slavin (1983). ''Review of Educational Research'', Vol. 53, No. 4, 519-569&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Higher self-esteem:'' By being included in a regular-paced education setting, students with disabilities have shown to be more confident and display qualities of raised self-efficacy. All students in California who went to a different school prior to attending a mainstreaming program were asked to fill out an assessment of their old school as compared to inclusion program. The assessments showed that out of all students with disabilities 96% felt they were more confident, 3% thought they had the same experience as an excluded student, and 1% felt they had less self-esteem. Overall, students felt that they were equal to their peers and felt that they should not be treated any differently.&lt;ref&gt;(2007). Twenty-five years of progress in educating children with disabilities through IDEA. National Research Center on Learning Disabilities. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from http://www.nrcld.org/resources/osep/historyidea.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Better social skills:'' Any kind of inclusion practice, including mainstreaming, allows students with disabilities to learn social skills through observation, gain a better understanding of the world around them, and become a part of the "regular" community. Mainstreaming is particularly beneficial for children with autism and ADHD. By interacting with same-aged non-disabled children, children with autism were observed to be six times more likely to engage in social relations outside of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolfberg | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Schuler | first2 = A.L. | year = 1999 | title = Fostering peer interaction, imaginative play and spontaneous language in children with autism | url = | journal = Child Language Teaching &amp; Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 41–52 | doi=10.1191/026565999667036164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because children with autism spectrum disorders have severely restricted interests and abnormalities in communication and social interaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tidmarsh | first1 = L. | last2 = Volkmar | first2 = F. | year = 2003 | title = Diagnosis and epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders | url = https://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/tidmarsh.asp | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the increased interaction with typical children may be beneficial to them. The same 1999 study showed that students with Down's syndrome were three times more likely to communicate with other people.

Mainstreaming also benefits other children.  It opens the lines of communication between those students with disabilities and their peers.  If they are included into classroom activities, all students become more sensitive to the fact that these students may need extra assistance.

===Benefits to non-disabled students===
Some people believe that educating non-disabled students and students with disabilities together creates an atmosphere of understanding and tolerance that better prepares students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school. Students without disabilities who engaged in an inclusive physical education program reported increases in self-concept, tolerance, self-worth, and a better understanding of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suomi | first1 = J. | last2 = Collier | first2 = D. | last3 = Brown | first3 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Factors affecting the social experiences of students in elementary physical education classes | url = | journal = Journal of Teaching in Physical Education | volume = 22 | issue = 2| page = 186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The students also reported that the inclusion program was important because it prepared them to deal with disability in their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Block | first1 = M. E. | year = 1999 | title = Are children with disabilities receiving appropriate physical education?. | url = | journal = Teaching Exceptional Children | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 18–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive aspects that come from inclusion are often attributed to contact theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = L. | last2 = James | first2 = A. | last3 = Ludwa | first3 = N. | year = 2004 | title = The impact of inclusion in general physical education for all students | url = | journal = Journal of Physical Education | volume = 75 | issue = 5| pages = 37–55 | doi=10.1080/07303084.2004.10607238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact theory asserts that frequent, meaningful, and pleasant interactions between people with differences tend to produce changes in attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chu | first1 = D. | last2 = Griffey | first2 = D. | year = 1985 | title = The contact theory of racial integration: The case of sport | url = | journal = Sociology of Sport Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 323–333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Although mainstreaming in education has been shown to provide benefits, there are also disadvantages to the system.

===Tradeoff with non-disabled students's academic education===
One potentially serious disadvantage to mainstreaming is that a mainstreamed student may require much more attention from the teacher than non-disabled students in a general class.  Time and attention may thus be taken away from the rest of the class to meet the needs of a single student with special needs.  The effect that a mainstreamed student has on the whole class depends strongly on the particular disabilities in question and the resources available for support.  In many cases, this problem can be mitigated by placing an aide in the classroom to assist the student with special needs, although this raises the costs associated with educating this child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peertuition.com Manzitti, Edward T.;]&lt;/ref&gt; The added cost of an aide in a classroom to meet needs of special education students can be offset by not funding a teacher in a wholly separate classroom when mainstreaming does not occur.

Teachers are encouraged to teach the entire class differently.  This includes being less abstract and more concrete in content, changing lighting, simplifying the design of the classroom, and having a predictable structure and routine rather than novelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Sue|title=A List of Typical Special Ed. Accommodations|url=http://specialed.about.com/od/iep/a/accomod.htm|website=About.com|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Accommodations for IEPs|url=https://www.teachervision.com/special-education/printable/5596.html|website=teachervision.com|publisher=The Council for Exceptional Children|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm to academic education of students with disabilities===
Parents{{Who|date=October 2015}} fear that general education teachers do not have the training and skills to accommodate special needs students in a general education classroom setting.  However, professional training and supportive services can usually address these concerns{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}. Some research has suggested teachers who are not aware of—and later may choose not to adopt—modifications needed for students with special needs are also more resistant to having these students in class.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, B.,&amp; Weil, M. (1986). Models of teaching (3rd ed.) Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to regression of the students with disabilities as well as overall decreased classroom productivity.

=== Teacher-student interactions ===
It has been seen that general educators provide 98.7% of their teaching time doing whole class interactions. Students with disabilities have been known to require a significant more amount of individual attention with the classroom teacher. Children with disabilities spend twice as much time in whole-class activities as in one-to-one activities due to the amount of whole-class teaching, yet these students are half as likely to engage in whole-class learning activities such as writing, reading and participating showing that whole group activities do not  meet the needs of students with disabilities as much as individual work would.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=David Lansing|date=2014-10-01|title=An examination of teacher–student interactions in inclusive classrooms: teacher interviews and classroom observations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-3802.12021/abstract|journal=Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=264–273|doi=10.1111/1471-3802.12021|issn=1471-3802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues===
Compared to fully included students with disabilities, those who are mainstreamed for only certain classes or certain times may feel conspicuous or socially rejected by their classmates.  They may become targets for bullying.  Mainstreamed students may feel embarrassed by the additional services they receive in a regular classroom, such as an aide to help with written work or to help the student manage behaviors.  Some students with disabilities may feel more comfortable in an environment where most students are working at the same level or with the same supports.  In the United States, students with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s are [[disability bullying|more frequently the target of bullying]] than non-autistic students, especially when their educational program brings them into regular contact with non-autistic students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen above, there are many social issues; however, a buddy system has been shown to improve these issues. Through having a buddy system an upper school student will be paired with a younger child preferable with a disability by doing this the younger student is provided with a positive relationship with a fellow student even though they are older. Through the buddy system the younger student will learn the benefits of having and sustaining a positive and supportive friendship, learns to value opinion just by having the upper school student around. These social issues are improved due to the upper school student helping to alter the social experiences of the younger child through this formed friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rider|first=Louise|date=2000-12-01|title=Peer Education in Mainstream Secondary Education: Using ‘Buddying’ to Address Social and Behavioural Issues|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0122.00173/abstract|journal=Pastoral Care in Education|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=3–7|doi=10.1111/1468-0122.00173|issn=1468-0122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs ===
Schools are required to provide special education services but may not be given additional financial resources.  The per-student cost of special education is high.  The U.S.'s 2005 Special Education Expenditures Program (SEEP) indicates that the cost per student in special education ranges from a low of $10,558 for students with learning disabilities to a high of $20,095 for students with multiple disabilities. The average cost per pupil for a regular education with no special education services is $6,556. Therefore, the average expenditure for students with learning disabilities is 1.6 times that of a general education student.

Careful attention must be given as well to combinations of students with disabilities in a mainstreamed classroom.  For example, a student with [[conduct disorder]] may not combine well with a student with [[autism]], while putting many children with dyslexia in the same class may prove to be particularly efficient.

===Special consequences for deaf students===
Deafness is a low-incidence disability, which means that a deaf child will often be the only student in the classroom with hearing loss.&lt;ref name="Stinson 1999 163–174"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stinson|first=Michael|author2=Antia, Shirin|title=Considerations in Educating Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in Inclusive Settings|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|date=Summer 1999|volume=4|issue=3|pages=163–174|url=http://jdsde.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/163.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2011-04-04|doi=10.1093/deafed/4.3.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a special set of issues in the mainstream classroom. While students with other disabilities may experience isolation and bullying by their non-disabled peers, they often share a common language. This is not the case for deaf students. Very few people in the mainstream academic setting know sign language, which means the communication barrier is large and can have negative effects on both academic achievement and social development.  
* ''Social skills'' are key to a child's healthy development and later success as an adult.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Wyatte|title=Decrease of Deaf Potential in a Mainstreamed Environment|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/hall.html|publisher=Rochester Institute of Technology|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many studies find good academic results for deaf children placed in a mainstream classroom, research also shows that mainstreamed deaf children experience higher degrees of isolation and psychological problems in comparison to deaf students who associate with other deaf peers.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; In order for friendships to form, communication is a necessity.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; For deaf children unable to use effective communication methods with the people around them, the difficulty in acquiring new friendships typically leads to isolation and a decrease in self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; A study of preschool children showed that hearing preschoolers did not appear to adjust how they communicated with deaf children. Instead, they continued to use simple speech, which was effective with hearing, but not deaf, partners. This shows the isolation of the deaf child, and discredits the idea that the hearing and deaf child's communication skills will be enhanced by interaction with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vandell|first=Deborah Lowe|author2=George, Linda B.|title=Social Interaction in Hearing and Deaf Preschoolers: Successes and Failures in Initiations|journal=Child Development|date=June 1981|volume=52|issue=2|pages=627–635|jstor=1129183|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1981.tb03089.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases, hearing children do not understand what it means when another child is deaf. This leads to frustration when a deaf child's speech is not clear or when the deaf child asks for continuous repetition. Communication strategies that are culturally acceptable to the deaf child, such as banging on a table or physically touching another person, can also cause the deaf child to be rejected by his or her peers because such behaviors are not always considered acceptable in mainstreaming hearing culture.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; Research has suggested that the placement of a deaf child in special schools or classes may be more desirable for deaf students than for those with other disabilities. This is primarily because of the greater social benefits for the students.&lt;ref name="Stinson 1999 163–174"/&gt;
* The ''residual knowledge'' that hearing children can access is often lost on deaf children. A hearing child can listen in on adult conversations, TV, radio and the news to learn things that are not specifically taught or told to them.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; This is not the case with the deaf child, who, in a hearing environment, can only learn what is directly communicated to them. This often leads to gaps in general knowledge, which can be both harmful to academic success and social interactions.
* The ''effect of mainstreaming on Deaf culture'' is also a key issue for [[Deaf rights movement#Deaf culture movement|Deaf culture advocates]]. The rate of children enrolled in residential schools for the deaf is declining, as many hearing parents send their child to a mainstream school in hopes of preparing their child for life in the hearing world. In the past, Deaf schools and clubs served as the center for [[Deaf culture]]. Traditions, stories, and values developed and were fostered in these settings, but because of the low incidence of deafness, this same environment cannot be duplicated in the mainstream setting. Aside from the decreased socialization of a deaf child in a hearing school, Deaf community advocates also worry that the disappearance of residential Deaf schools will lead to a weakening of Deaf culture and of the community.

==Alternatives: what mainstreaming is not==
The alternatives to mainstreaming for special needs students are separation, inclusion, and excluding the student from school.  Normally, the student's individual needs are the driving force behind selecting mainstreaming or another style of education.

Mainstreaming does not involve putting a child full-time in a [[special school]].

Mainstreaming does not involve placing a child full-time in a regular classroom.  A student who spends the entire day in a regular classroom with non-disabled peers is considered [[inclusion (education)|fully included]].  Most students with mild levels of disabilities such as dyslexia or [[attention deficit disorder]], or with non-cognitive disabilities such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|diabetes]] are fully included.

Mainstreaming does not involve teaching the child outside of school.  A student who is taught in an institution (such as a hospital) or at home (such as while recovering from a serious illness) is excluded.  Such a student may receive individual instruction or may attend small group instruction.  A student who is excluded from school may or may not have been [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from the school.

==History of mainstreaming in US schools==
{{See also|Inclusion (education)}}

Before the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) was enacted in 1975, U.S. public schools educated only 1 out of 5 children with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Back to School"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2000/backtoschool_1.htm |title=NCD - Back to School on Civil Rights: Advancing the Federal Commitment to Leave No Child Behind |accessdate=2008-02-13 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 200,000&lt;ref name="Back to School"/&gt; children with disabilities such as [[deafness]] or [[mental retardation]] lived in state institutions that provided limited or no educational or rehabilitation services,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Ellen, Fran O’Reilly, Tom Fiore, Marking the Progress of IDEA Implementation, published by the Office of Special Education Programs.  URL: {{cite web|url=http://nclid.unco.edu/Resources/IDEA_Progress.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202938/http://nclid.unco.edu/Resources/IDEA_Progress.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} , Retrieved June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and more than a million children were excluded from school.&lt;ref name="Back to School"/&gt;  Another 3.5 million children with disabilities attended school but did not receive the educational services they needed.&lt;ref name="Back to School"/&gt;  Many of these children were segregated in special buildings or programs that neither allowed them to interact with non-disabled students nor provided them with even basic academic skills.

The EHA, later renamed the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA), required schools to provide specialized educational services to children with disabilities.  The ultimate goal was to help these students live more independent lives in their communities, primarily by mandating access to the general education standards of the public school system.

Initially, children with disabilities were often placed in heterogeneous "special education" classrooms, making it difficult for any of their difficulties to be addressed appropriately.  In the 1980s, the mainstreaming model began to be used more often as a result of the requirement to place children in the [[least restrictive environment]] (Clearinghouse, E. 2003).   Students with relatively minor disabilities were integrated into regular classrooms, while students with major disabilities remained in segregated special classrooms, with the opportunity to be among normal students for up to a few hours each day.  Many parents and educators favored allowing students with disabilities to be in classrooms along with their nondisabled peers.

In 1997, IDEA was modified to strengthen requirements for properly integrating students with disabilities.  The [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]]s must more clearly relate to the general-education curriculum, children with disabilities must be included in most state and local assessments, such as [[High school graduation examination in the United States|high school exit exams]], and regular progress reports must be made to parents.  All public schools in the U.S. are responsible for the costs of providing a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] as required by federal law.   Mainstreaming or inclusion in the regular education classrooms, with supplementary aids and services if needed, are now the preferred placement for all children.  Children with disabilities may be placed in a more restricted environment only if the nature or severity of the disability makes it impossible to provide an appropriate education in the regular classroom.

It has been estimated that in the year of 2009 there has been 292,600 children attending school within Australia that has been diagnosed with a disability also within this year it has been seen that there had been a higher rate of participation within school activities coming from children with a disability compared to children without one. It has been shown that almost one in ten boys within schools (186,000) had been diagnosed with a disability where the level of girls within a school (106,600) diagnosed with a disability was around one in sixteen. Within mainstream schools it has been shown that primary schools had a higher number of students with disabilities with a high 9.1% where students within secondary schools where only 7.4% had a disability. Out of the 71,000 students attending school with a disability 64.7% have been known to have a severe or core-activated limitation. It has also been proven that special needs children within Australia demonstrate higher academic outcomes when in a mainstream school where they have been given opportunities to engage in higher academic levels and activities.  Having children with a disability in a mainstream school has also been shown to increase in independent communication and motor skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4429.0main+features100302009|title=Main Features - Children At School With Disability|last=Statistics|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|website=www.abs.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural History of the Canary Islands''' (French: '''''Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries''''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicos.org/Publication/1033|title=Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries|publisher=Tropicos}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book with illustrations and written descriptions of botany from the [[Canary Islands]], it was written in collaboration by [[Philip Barker-Webb|Philip Barker Webb]] and [[Sabin Berthelot]].  It was published in Paris between 1836 and 1850 and are divided into four sections and 71 parts.  The work was the most important text about the Canary Islands in the 19th century in the field of natural sciences.&lt;ref name="Orotava Foundation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Relancio Menéndez|first1=Alberto|last2=Breen|first2=Michael|year=2006|title=Historia natural de las Islas Canarias de Philip Barker Webb y Sabino Berthelot: una introducción|place=La Orotava|publisher=Canarian Orotava Foundation|isbn=978-84-611-0807-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berthelot drago franchy.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Great [[dragon tree]] by Franchy in [[La Orotava]], with different ages, one of the illustrations in the book]]
The text was originally written in French, it saved a large part of Phytographia Canariensis (Canarian Phytography), it was later written in Latin.  In addition to the two main authors, it took part in an important scientific composition which was carried into dedicated parts, zoology and botany of the islands.&lt;ref name="Orotava Foundation"/&gt; The work includes more than 430 pages including engravings and drawings made by the most prestigious draughtsmen and engravers of the time (one of them was the English [[J.J. Williams]]) and makes up of one of the greatest attractive works, where it contributed to a science text of the first half of the 19th century, it continued to have interests, even validity, in areas with cartography, the systematic botany and geo-botany, also in certain different Canarian zoology. The themes of the work is very broad and surpasses which was traditionally for natural history - a name which was later replaced with natural sciences, for which more of it broadened the three kingdoms of nature, geology, botany and zoology), dedicaded a part of the work to physical, botanical, economic and human geography, and questions of history and ethnography of the Canaries.&lt;ref name="Orotava Foundation"/&gt;

[[Philip Barker-Webb]], on one of his trips to the Brazilian expedition, planned a short visit to the Canary Islands, instead, he stayed for a longer time.  During his time in the islands between 1828 and 1920, he recollected the specimens from the area and together with [[Sabin Berthelot]], he made an encyclopedic like work which took about 20 years to complete.  One of the other contributors to the work included [[Justin Pierre Marie Macquart]] and [[Alfred Moquin-Tandon]].

A '''news conference''' or '''press conference''' is a [[media event]] in which newsmakers invite journalists to hear them speak and, most often, ask questions. A '''joint press conference''' instead is held between two or more talking sides.

==Practice==
In a news conference, one or more speakers may make a statement, which may be followed by questions from reporters. Sometimes only questioning occurs; sometimes there is a statement with no questions permitted.

A [[media event]] at which no statements are made, and no questions allowed, is called a [[photo op]]. A government may wish to open their proceedings for the media to witness events, such as the passing of a piece of legislation from the government in parliament to the senate, via a media availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gc.ca/cfmx/view/en/index.jsp?articleid=222219&amp; Canada News Centre - Centre des nouvelles du Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Television]] stations and networks especially value news conferences: because today's TV news programs air for hours at a time, or even continuously, assignment editors have a steady appetite for ever-larger quantities of footage.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

{{listen|filename=The_Moment_of_Truth_Press_Conference.ogg|title=An example of a press conference held by political activists|pos=left}}

News conferences are often held by [[politicians]] (such as the [[President of the United States]]); by sports teams; by celebrities or film studios; by commercial organizations to promote products; by [[lawyer|attorney]]s to promote [[lawsuit]]s; and by almost anyone who finds benefit in the free publicity afforded by media coverage. Some people, including many police chiefs, hold news conferences reluctantly in order to avoid dealing with reporters individually.

A news conference is often announced by sending an advisory or [[news release]] to [[assignment editor]]s, preferably well in advance. Sometimes they are held spontaneously when several reporters gather around a newsmaker.

News conferences can be held just about anywhere, in settings as formal as the [[White House]] room set aside for the purpose to as informal as the street in front of a crime scene. Hotel conference rooms and courthouses are often used for news conferences.  Sometimes such gatherings are recorded for press use and later released on an [[interview disc]].

==U.S. Presidential press conference==
When the President of the United States holds a press conference, he takes questions from the [[press pool]] in a specific order: first wire services, then broadcast networks, and afterwards national newspapers, newsmagazines, video and, lastly, regional newspapers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
In crisis situations, this order holds a special value because it offsets all burning questions at that particular moment.

==Media day==
Media day is a special press conference event where rather than holding a conference after an event to field questions about the event that has recently transpired, a conference is held for the sole purpose of making newsmakers available to the media for general questions and photographs often before an event or series of events (such as an athletic season) occur. In athletics, teams and leagues host media days prior to the season and may host them prior to special events during the season like all-star games and championship games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/sights-and-sounds-media-day.html|title=Sights and sounds from Media Day|accessdate=2013-10-27|date=2013-09-27|publisher=[[NBA.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/102512aac.html|title=Wolverines Attend Big Ten Media Day in Chicago|accessdate=2013-10-25|date=2012-10-25|work=MGoBlue.com|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7931">[[File:NYS-Notary-Seal.jpg|thumb|An [[Paper embossing|Embossed]] Notary Seal. This type of seal is no longer legally sufficient in New York State.]]

'''[[Notary public|Notaries public]]''' in [[New York (state)|New York]] are commissioned by the [[Secretary of State of New York]] after passing a short examination in [[law]] and [[legal procedure|procedure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/notary1.htm Welcome to the Division of Licensing from the NY Secretary of State's official government website]&lt;/ref&gt; A notary's commission is received from and kept on file with the [[county clerk]] of the county in which they reside or do business, but notaries are empowered to actually perform their duties anywhere in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piombino|first1=Alfred E.|title=Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for New York|date=2011|publisher=East Coast Publishing|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Notaries must be residents of the state ''or'' have a work/business address in the state.&lt;ref name="Exec"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DOS&gt;[http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/lawbooks/notary.html Notary Public License Law from the NY Secretary of State's official government website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011040617/http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/lawbooks/notary.html |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attorney at law (United States)|Attorneys at law]] may automatically be appointed notaries simply by submitting the filing fee.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt; Someone who is a commissioner or inspector of elections may also be a notary.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Elections Law §§ 3-200, 3-400.&lt;/ref&gt;  One designated employee of the county clerk may be appointed a notary without taking the test.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Public Officers Law § 534.&lt;/ref&gt;  A state legislator may also be a notary, without any conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;1927 Op. (N.Y.) Atty. Gen. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the passage of the [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|Married women's property acts]] in the mid-19th century, a married woman can be a notary.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Real Property Law § 302.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Certain persons ''cannot'' be commissioned as a notary public in New York.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;  These include a non-citizen,&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;N.Y. Executive Law § 130.&lt;/ref&gt; someone who has neither a residence nor a business in New York,&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt; a person convicted of certain felonies,&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt; a person removed from office as notary or commissioner of deeds,&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Executive Law § 140.&lt;/ref&gt; and a convicted draft dodger.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Public Officers Law § 3.&lt;/ref&gt; By a New York law that bars them from holding any other office, [[sheriff]]s may not be appointed notaries.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Const&gt;[[New York Constitution]] Article XIII, § 13(a)&lt;/ref&gt; The above general conditions can however be remedied with a release from the state after a certificate of good conduct is issued or by executive pardon.

==Powers==
New York notaries are empowered to administer [[oath]]s and [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]]s (including [[oath of office|oaths of office]]),&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Public Officers Law §§ 10, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; to take [[affidavit]]s and [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s,&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. CPLR Rule 3113.&lt;/ref&gt; to receive and certify acknowledgments or proof of deeds, mortgages and powers of attorney and other instruments in writing.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Real Property Law §§ 290 (3),298, 302, 303, 304, 306, 309.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notaries may also demand acceptance or payment of foreign and inland bills of exchange, promissory notes and obligations in writing.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Executive Law § 135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, they can witness the opening of a safe deposit box and provide an inventory of the contents.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Banking Law § 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

New York Notaries may not issue certified copies of official documents (i.e. birth certificate, marriage certificate, bankruptcy discharge, etc.); notably (as emphasized by official publications) they may ''not'' certify copies of documents (for instance, "I hereby certify that this is a true and correct copy...," is beyond the authority of a New York State notary). However, a notary may sign a form of affidavit on a copy where the document's custodian signs and swears to the authenticity of the document (usually a government issued picture ID). This can suffice as a "[[Certified copy#Notarized Copies of Identification in Non-Certifying States|notarized copy]]" in most instances, but is not a certified copy.  A notary cannot prepare legal documents, offer any advice, or review documents for legality (even offering an opinion as to whether a document needs notarization is considered to be "practicing law without a license" in New York); and they may ''not'' solemnize marriages. Further, a notary is not needed to witness a will:  in New York, two witnesses, who do not need to be notaries, must attend the will signing ceremony and be able to attest to the mental competence of the testator.  A notary may, however, notarize a self-proving affidavit signed by the maker of the will and the two witnesses, which will facilitate the proof of the will in probate.

==Seal or stamp==
New York does not require that notaries use an official seal or stamp - the embossed seal is now a decorative addition to a document rather than a requirement of law, and is itself insufficient for a notarization. New York notaries may write in black ink, or may stamp with a rubber stamp, the required information for notarization: their name; the words "Notary Public, State of New York"; the county in which they are qualified (that is, the county in which the county clerk holds their original certificate and signature card); the county which additional signature certificates are filed (done for convenience of authenticating their notarizations); the date that the notary's commission expires (commissions are renewed every four years); and, only if qualified in New York City (the counties of The Bronx, Richmond, Kings, Queens and New York) a registration number. This information, with the notary's signature and the date and place of notarization are required for a legal notarization. 


==Renewal Of Notary Commission==
In New York, a Notary Public commission is granted for a four-year term. Other than the pre-qualification examination, no continuing education is required.  There is a $60.00 re-appointment fee required every 4 years and paid to the County Clerk of the Notary Public.  The renewal application is posted to the Notary approximately 3 months prior to the expiration.  The commission may be renewed up until 6 months after the expiration date without
re-qualifying for non-military personnel; a grace period extends for 12 months after the Honorable Discharge of a member of the United States Military.

&lt;/pre&gt;
''A typical layout for a notary's rubber stamp, for use beneath the notary's signature.''

Notaries may charge fees (the maximum is $2) for certain acts, but many choose to either personally waive them, or their employers have a policy of not permitting the notary to charge patrons (I.e., clients and customers of their company, agency or firm; for example, many banks have notaries on duty to serve their depositors for free).&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Executive Law § 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each county clerk also has a notary on duty in the clerk's office to serve the public at no charge.

As of April, 2017, New York State had approximately 291,000 commissioned notaries public.

Cities in the State of New York appoint and commission an officer called a Commissioner of Deeds, which can be applied for with the respective City Clerk's office and is appointed by the City Council.

'''Nursing documentation''' is the record of [[Nursing|nursing care]] that is planned and delivered to individual [[Patient|clients]] by qualified nurses or other [[caregiver]]s under the direction of a qualified nurse.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart C, Currell R, Grant MJ. Hardiker NR. Nursing record systems: Effects on nursing practice and healthcare outcomes. Cochrane Data- base of Systematic Reviews 2009; (1): 1–66.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; It contains information in accordance with the steps of the [[nursing process]]. Nursing documentation is the principal clinical information source to meet legal and professional requirements,&lt;ref&gt;Daskein R,Moyle W, Creedy D.Aged-care nurses' knowledge of nursing documentation: An Australian perspective. Journal of Clinical Nursing 2009; 18: 2087–2095.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most significant components in nursing care. Quality nursing documentation plays a vital role in the delivery of quality nursing care services through supporting better communication between different care team members to facilitate continuity of care and safety of the clients.

==Purposes==
* A [[Medical record|written record]] of the history, treatment, care, and response of the client while under the care of a health care provider.
* A guide for reimbursement of care costs.
* Evidence of care in a court of law. A legal record that can be used as evidence of events that occurred or treatments given.
* Show the use of the nursing process. It contains observations by the nurses about the client's condition, care, and treatment delivered.
* Provides data for quality assurance studies and shows progress toward expected outcomes.

== Documentation of the nursing process ==
{{See also|Nursing process}}

The internationally accepted nursing process consists of five steps: [[Nursing assessment|assessment]], nursing problem/diagnosis, goal, intervention and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Björvell C,Thorell-Ekstrand I.Wredling R.Development of an audit instrument for nursing care plans in the client record. Quality in Health Care 2000; 9: 6–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing process model provides the theoretical framework for nursing documentation. A nurse can follow this model to assess the clinical situation of a client and record a constructive document for nursing communication.

==Content==
Nursing documentation mainly consists of a client's background information or nursing history referred as admission form, numerous [[Assessment for Effective Intervention|assessment forms]], nursing care plan and progress notes. These documents record the client's data captured at the relevant stages of the [[nursing process]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, W., &amp; Smith, B. (n.d). Nursing documentation: Frameworks and barriers. Contemporary Nurse, 41(2), 160-168.&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections describe the concept, aim, possible structure and content of these nursing documents using the example of nursing documentation in Australian residential [[aged care]] homes.

=== Admission ===
An [[admission note|admission form]] is a fundamental record in nursing documentation. It documents a client's status, reasons why the client is being admitted, and the initial instructions for that client's care.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;"General Info". Archived from the original on 12 March 2009. Retrieved 2009-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; The form is completed by a nurse when a client is admitted to a [[Health facility|health care facility]].

The admission form provides the basic information to establish foundations for further nursing assessment. It usually contains the general data about a client, such as name, gender, age, birth date, address, contact, identification information (ID) and some situational descriptions about marriage, work or other background information. Based on the different nursing care provider's requirements, this form may also record [[Family history (medicine)|family history]], [[past medical history]], [[History of the present illness|history of present illness]], and allergies (see Figure 1).
[[File:Figure 1. A sample admission.png|thumb|Figure 1. A sample admission form for an Australian residential aged care home.]]

=== Assessment ===
The documentation of nursing assessment is the recording of the process about how a judgment was made and its related factors, in addition to the result of the judgment. It makes the process of nursing assessment visible through what is presented in the documentation content.&lt;ref&gt;Oroviogoicoechea C., Elliott B. &amp; Watson S. (2008) Review: evaluating information systems in nursing. Journal of Clinical Nursing 17, 567–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

During nursing assessment, a nurse systematically collects, verifies, analyses and communicates a health care client's information to derive a nursing diagnosis and plan individualized nursing care for the client.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp J., Taylor C., Potter PA. &amp; Perry A.G. (2005) POTTER and PERRY'S fundamentals of nursing (2nd ed). Elsevier Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Complete and accurate nursing assessment determines the accuracy of the other stages of the nursing process.&lt;ref name="White L. 2002"&gt;White L. (2002) Documentation and the Nursing Process. Delmar Learning, Clifton Park, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

The nursing documents may contain a number of assessment forms. In an assessment form, a licensed [[Registered nurse|Registered Nurse]] records the client's information, such as physiological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual status (see Figure 2). The accuracy and completeness of nursing assessment determine the accuracy of care planning in the nursing process.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;L. White, Documentation and the Nursing Process, Delmar Learning, Clifton Park, NY, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nursing care plan ===
The [[nursing care plan]] (NCP) is a clinical document recording the nursing process, which is a systematic method of planning and providing care to clients.&lt;ref name="White L. 2002"/&gt; It was originally developed in hospitals to guide nursing students or junior nurses in providing care to client; however, the format was task-oriented rather than nursing-process-based.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood D. (1996) Nursing care plans: issues and solutions. Nursing Management 27(3), 33-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the NCP is widely used in nursing in various clinical and educational settings as a tool to direct individualized nursing care for clients.&lt;ref&gt;Neilson T., Peet M., Ledsham R. &amp; Poole J.

The nurses make nursing care plans based on the assessments they have completed previously with a client. There are many ways of structuring nursing care plans in correspondence with the different needs of nursing care in different nursing specialties. For example, a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home may be structured with several sections under each care domain such as pain, mobility, lifestyle, nutrition and continence. The information is recorded in free-text style, and various terms are used singly or in combination to name each of the four sections in the formats that are used by a facility during a particular period (Figure 3).

=== Progress notes ===
A [[progress note]] is the record of nursing actions and observations in the nursing care process.&lt;ref&gt;"UW Internal Medicine Residency Program". Retrieved 2009-04-10&lt;/ref&gt; It helps nurses to monitor and control the course of nursing care.
[[File:Figure 3-1. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 3-1. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home.]]
Generally, nurses record information with a common format. Nurses are likely to record details about a&amp;nbsp;client's clinical status or achievements during the course of the nursing care.
[[File:Figure 4. A sample progress note in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 4. A sample progress note in an Australian residential aged care home.]]

== Recording format ==

=== Paper-based nursing documentation ===
The paper-based nursing documentation has been in place for decades. Client's data are recorded in paper documents. The information in these documents needs to be integrated for sense-making in a nursing decision.

=== Electronic nursing documentation ===
Electronic nursing documentation is an electronic format of nursing documentation an increasingly used by nurses. [[Electronic health record|Electronic nursing documentation systems]] have been implemented in health care organizations to bring in the benefits of increasing access to more complete, accurate and up-to-date data and reducing redundancy, improving communication and care service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Y, Yu P, Shen J. The benefits of introducing electronic health records in residential aged care facilities:A multiple case study. Interna- tional Journal of Medical Informatics 2012; 81: 690–704.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison of the quality of paper-based and electronic documentation ===
Electronic nursing documentation systems are able to produce somewhat better quality data in comparison with paper-based systems, in certain respects depending on the characteristics of the systems and the practice of the various study settings. The common benefits of electronic documentation systems include the improvement of comprehensiveness in documenting the nursing process, the use of standardized language and the recording of specific items about particular client issues and relevance of the message. In addition, electronic systems can improve legibility, dating and signing in nursing records.

For the documentation of nursing assessment, the electronic systems significantly increased the quantity and comprehensiveness of documented assessment forms in each record. In regard to the NCP, the electronic standardized NCPs were graded with a higher total quality score than its paper-based counterpart. In addition, in comparison with the paper-based documentation systems, the electronic systems, due to their automatic functions, were able to improve the format, structure and process features of documentation quality such as legibility, signing, dating, crossing out error and space with a single line and resident identification on every page.

Paper-based documentation has been found to be inferior in comparison with electronic documentation. This is caused by the inherent nature of paper being difficult to update, time-consuming in a recording. Thus, the records are often incomplete, illegible, repetitive and missing signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Ammenwerth E,Eichstadter R,Haux R et al.A randomized evaluation of a computer-based nursing documentation system. Method Inform Med 2001; 40: 61–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 3-2. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 3-2. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home]]
Electronic nursing documentation systems have the potential to improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in comparison with paper-based documentation, as demonstrated in a comparative study of electronic and paper-based nursing admission forms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wang, N., Yu, P., &amp; Hailey, D. (2012). Description and comparison of quality of electronic versus paper-based resident admission forms in Australian aged care facilities. International Journal of Medical Informatics, doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.11.011&lt;/ref&gt; However, improvement in documentation quality is not necessarily to be brought about by the introduction of electronic nursing documentation system to replace paper-based documentation. For example, Wang et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that although the electronic nursing assessment form contained more documented assessment forms, which covered a wider range of resident care needs, they did not perform better than the previous [null paper-based assessment forms according to] the quality criteria of [null completeness] and timeliness. Therefore, further work on the usage of the electronic documentation systems may focus on improving form design and usage. There is also a need for improvement in compliance with standards in order to better meet the clients' care needs.

== Quality of nursing documentation ==

A study by the National Client Safety Agency (NPSA)&lt;ref&gt;National Clients Safety Agency (2007) Recognising and responding appropriately to early signs of deterioration in hospital clients. NPSA, London. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://tinyurl.com/yk8ao5x&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Accessed 20 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; found that poor standards of documentation were a contributory factor in the failure to detect clients who were clinically deteriorating. Nurses are responsible for maintaining accurate records of the care they provide and are accountable if information is incomplete and inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Owen K (2005) Documentation in nursing practice. Nurs Stand 19(32): 48–9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a quality standard is required for recording of nursing documentation.

The systematic review of nursing documentation audit studies in different settings&lt;ref&gt;Wang N, Hailey D, Yu P. Quality of nursing documentation and approaches to its evaluation: A mixed-method systematic review.Journal of Advanced Nursing 2011; 67: 1858–1875.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the following relevant quality characteristics of nursing documentation:

* Quality of documentation structure and format: relates to constructive features and physical presentation of records such as quantity, completeness, legibility, read- ability, redundancy and the use of abbreviations. 
* Quality of documentation process: the procedural issues of capturing client data such as nurse's signature and designation, date, chronological order, timeliness, regularity of documentation and concordance between documentation and reality. 
* Quality of documentation content: refers to the message from data about a care process. It is concerned with the comprehensiveness, appropriateness and the relation- ship of the five steps of the nursing process. The care issue recorded at each step is also considered.

== Standardized nursing terminology ==
[[NANDA|North American&amp;nbsp;Nursing Diagnosis&amp;nbsp;Association (NANDA)]] nursing diagnosis:

NANDA International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) is a professional organization of nurses standardized nursing terminology that was officially founded in 1982 and develops, researches, disseminates and refines the nomenclature, criteria, and taxonomy of nursing diagnoses.

[[Nursing Interventions Classification|Nursing intervention classification (NIC)]]:

The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) is a care classification system which describes the activities that nurses perform as a part of the planning phase of the nursing process associated with the creation of a nursing care plan.

[[Nursing Outcomes Classification|Nursing outcome classification (NOC)]]:

The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a classification system which describes client outcomes sensitive to nursing intervention.

The [[Omaha&amp;nbsp;System]]:

The Omaha System is a standardized health care terminology consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), a care plan/services component (Intervention Scheme), and an evaluation component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes).

International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP):

The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) is a collaborative project under the auspices of the International Council of Nurses. The ICNP provides a structured and defined vocabulary as well as a classification for nursing and a framework into which existing vocabularies and classifications can be cross-mapped to enable comparison of nursing data.&lt;ref&gt;Wake, M., &amp; Coenen, A. (1998). Nursing diagnosis in the international classification for nursing practice (icnp).&amp;nbsp;''International Journal of Nursing Knowledge,''&amp;nbsp;''5''(4), 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structured documentation ==
Structured documentation takes the form of pre-printed guidelines for specific aspects of care and can, therefore, focus nursing care upon diagnoses, treatment aims, client outcomes and evaluations of care.&lt;ref&gt;Dahm M, Wadensten B (2008) Nurses' experiences of and opinions about using standardised care plans in electronic health records; a questionnaire study. J Clin Nurs 17(16): 2137–45&lt;/ref&gt; It can improve client care by replacing the practice of vague, narrative style entries by nurses with cohesive and accurate information determined by the format of the care plan.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Irvine K, Tracey M, Scott A, Hyde A, Butler M, MacNeela P (2006) Discursive practices in the documentation of client assessments. Journal of Advanced Nursing 53(2): 151–9&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; The clarity of the recorded information also facilitates clinical auditing and evaluation of documentation practices through.&lt;ref&gt;Saranto K, Kinnunen U (2009) Evaluating nursing documentation-research designs and methods: systematic review. J Adv Nurs 65(3): 464–76&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the introduction of structured documentation and care plans are seen as a means by which nurses can raise standards of record-keeping practice.&lt;ref&gt;Law L, Akroyd K, Burke L (2010) Improving nursing documentation and record-keeping in stoma care. Br J Nurs 19(21): 1328–32&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre''' is a station on [[Paris Métro Line 1|lines 1]] and [[Paris Métro Line 7|7]] of the [[Paris Métro]].

It is one of the eight original stations opened as part of the first section of line 1 between [[Porte de Vincennes (Paris Métro)|Porte de Vincennes]] and [[Porte Maillot (Paris Métro)|Porte Maillot]] on 19 July 1900, under the name ''Palais Royal''. The line 7 platforms were opened on 1 July 1916 with the extension of the line from [[Opéra (Paris Métro)|Opéra]]. It was the southern terminus of the line until it was extended to [[Pont Marie (Paris Métro)|Pont Marie]] on 16 April 1926. The station was given its current name in 1989, soon after the opening of the new entrance to the [[Louvre Museum]]. It is named after the nearby [[Palais Royal]] and the ''Louvre''.

The entrance on Place Colette was redesigned by [[Jean-Michel Othoniel]], as the {{lang|fr|"Kiosque des noctambules"}} (Kiosk of the night-walkers), and completed in October 2000 for the centenary of the Métro.  Two [[cupola]]s of the {{lang|fr|"Kiosque des noctambules"}} (one representing the day, the other the night) are made of colored glass beads that are threaded to structure of aluminum.  They make an unexpected and original work in the very traditional environment of the ''Place Colette''.

Attractions accessible from this metro station include the Louvre, the ''[[Place du Carrousel]]'', and the ''[[Carrousel du Louvre]]'' shopping mall.

'''Peter Douglas Nicholls''' (8 March 1939 – 6 March 2018)&lt;ref&gt;Clément Solym. [https://www.actualitte.com/article/monde-edition/mort-de-peter-nicholls-editeur-de-l-encyclopedie-de-la-science-fiction/87651 "Mort de Peter Nicholls, éditeur de l'Encyclopédie de la science-fiction"]. 6 March 2018. Retrieved 2018-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Australia]]n literary scholar and critic. He was the creator and a co-editor of ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' with [[John Clute]].&lt;ref  name="sfejan2018" /&gt;

==Early career==
Born in [[Melbourne]], Victoria, he spent two decades from 1968 to 1988 as an [[expatriate]], first in the US, and then the UK.&lt;ref name="locus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://locusmag.com/2018/03/peter-nicholls-1939-2018/|title=Peter Nicholls (1939–2018)|publisher=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |accessdate=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholls' early career was as a literary academic, originally with the [[University of Melbourne]]. He first travelled to the US in 1968 on a [[Harkness Fellowship]] in film making, and has scripted television documentaries.&lt;ref name="sfejan2018" /&gt; His significant contributions to [[science fiction]] scholarship and criticism began in 1971, when he became the first Administrator of the [[Science Fiction Foundation]] (UK), a position he held until 1977.&lt;ref name="locus"/&gt; He was editor of its journal, ''[[Foundation (journal)|Foundation: The Review of Science Fiction]]'', from 1974 to 1978.&lt;ref name="locus"/&gt;

==''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''==
In 1979, Nicholls edited ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (published in the US as ''The Science Fiction Encyclopedia''), with [[John Clute]] as associate editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6738820 ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' edited by Peter Nichols and John Clute], National Library of Australia website. Retrieved 2018-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2018|reason=The target page at NLA doesn't now mention the 1979 first edition, nor the US edition.}} 

Most of its 730,000 words were written by Nicholls, Clute and two contributing editors.{{cn|date=November 2018}} It won the 1980 [[Hugo Award]] in the Nonfiction Book category.&lt;ref name="Hugo80"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1980-hugo-awards/|title=1980 Hugo Awards|publisher=World Science Fiction Society|accessdate=2010-04-19|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVVD8JTi?url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1980-hugo-awards|archivedate=7 May 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A completely revised, updated, and greatly expanded version of the ''Encyclopedia'', co-edited with Clute, was published in 1993, and won the 1994 Hugo in the same category.&lt;ref name="locus"/&gt;  A further updating of the work, with revisions and corrections, was later issued in CD-ROM format.&lt;ref name="locus"/&gt; The third edition, with Clute and [[David Langford]], was released online as a beta text in October 2011.&lt;ref name="locus"/&gt;

==Other work==
Nicholls' other major publications include: ''Science Fiction at Large'' (1976; reprinted 1978 under the title ''Explorations of the Marvellous''), a collection of essays edited by Nicholls from a 1975 symposium; ''The Science in Science Fiction'' (1983) edited by Nicholls and written by him with [[David Langford]] and [[Brian Stableford]]; and ''Fantastic Cinema'' (1984; published in the US as ''The World of Fantastic Films'').&lt;ref name="locus"/&gt; 

He won several awards for his scholarship, including the [[Science Fiction Research Association]]'s Pilgrim Award (1980), an [[Eaton Award]] (1995) and a Peter McNamara Award (2006).&lt;ref name="locus"/&gt; He broadcast film and book reviews on BBC Radio from 1974 and worked as a publisher's editor 1982–1983.&lt;ref name="sfejan2018"/&gt;

Nicholls was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 2000, which gradually curtailed his activities.&lt;ref name="sfejan2018"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clute|first1=John|last2=Nicholls|first2=Peter|title=Nicholls, Peter|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/archives/nicholls_peter/158418|website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |accessdate=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film on his interest and work in science fiction, titled ''The What-If Man'', was completed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roninfilms.com.au/feature/444/what-if-man.html ''The What If Man'' (2004)]. Ronin Films (roninfilms.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power posing''' is a discredited hypothesis in [[psychology]] that claims that by assuming a "powerful" [[Posture (psychology)|posture]], subjects can induce positive hormonal and behavioral changes. It was introduced in a 2010 paper by Dana Carney, [[Amy Cuddy]], and Andy Yap.&lt;ref&gt;Carney DR, Cuddy AJ, Yap AJ, "Power posing: brief nonverbal displays affect neuroendocrine levels and risk tolerance" ''Psychol Sci.'' 2010 Oct;21(10):1363-8''. doi: 10.1177/0956797610383437.&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea has been referred to as pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/mindthebrain/2017/06/14/calling-out-pseudoscience-radically-changing-the-conversation-about-amy-cuddys-power-posing-paper/|title=Calling out pseudoscience, radically changing the conversation about Amy Cuddy's power posing paper|work=Mind the Brain|date=June 14, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have reported being unable to replicate power posing effects in follow-up studies.&lt;ref name="Ranehill_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simonsohn_Simmons_2016" /&gt; In 2017 alone, 11 studies were published that were unable to reproduce the effect found by Cuddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Tracy |title=Sajid Javid and the strange science behind power poses |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2018/may/01/sajid-javid-and-the-strange-science-behind-power-poses |website=the Guardian |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=en |date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been described as an example of the [[replication crisis]] in psychology, in which initially seductive theories could not be replicated on follow-up tests.&lt;ref name="Ioannidis 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ioannidis|first1=John P. A.|title=Why Most Published Research Findings Are False|journal=PLoS Medicine|date= August 30, 2005|volume=2|issue=8|pages=e124|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124|pmc=1182327}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dana Carney, the lead author of the original article, issued a statement in 2016 abandoning the theory: "I do not believe that 'power pose effects' are real...the evidence against the existence of power poses is undeniable", while Cuddy has continued work on it.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carney_nd_Myposition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal Dahl Amy Cuddy's Response" /&gt;

In 2018 Cuddy, with two other authors, published additional research; the paper had been submitted in August 2016, a revised version was submitted in November 2017, and the paper published online on April 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuddy|first1=Amy J.

== Initial claims ==
The initial research on power posing was published in 2010. The authors claimed that high-power poses "produce power". The study included 42 participants, who were coached by researchers to assume a physical position of power. Hormone levels were measured before and after, and the authors stated that they found an increase in [[testosterone]] and a decrease in [[cortisol]] after posing.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=doi_2010_sage&gt;{{cite journal |title=Power Posing: Brief Nonverbal Displays Affect Neuroendocrine Levels and Risk Tolerance |first1=Dana R. |last1=Carney |first2=Amy J.C. |last2=Cuddy |first3=Andy J. |last3=Yap |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |url=https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4679/power.poses_.PS_.2010.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |number=10 |pages=1363–1368|doi=10.1177/0956797610383437 |date=January 10, 2010 |quote="These findings suggest that, in some situations requiring power, people have the ability to "fake it 'til they make it." Over time and in aggregate, these minimal postural changes and their outcomes potentially could improve a person's general health and well-being. This potential benefit is particularly important when considering people who are or who feel chronically powerless because of lack of resources, low hierarchical rank in an organization, or membership in a low-power social group."}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Replication failure ==
A 2015 article, published in ''Psychological Science'' by Ranehill et al. refuted findings in Carney et al. (2010).&lt;ref name="Ranehill_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ranehill |first1=Eva |last2=Dreber |first2=Anna |last3=Johannesson |first3=Magnus |last4=Leiberg |first4=Susanne |last5=Sul |first5=Sunhae |last6=Weber |first6=Roberto A. |date=May 26, 2015 |title=Assessing the Robustness of Power Posing: No Effect on Hormones and Risk Tolerance in a Large Sample of Men and Women |journal=Psychological Science |pmid=25810452 |doi=10.1177/0956797614553946 |volume=26 |number=5 |pages=653-6 |url=http://datacolada.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5110-Ranehill-Dreber-Johannesson-Leiberg-Sul-Weber-PS-2015-Assessing-the-robustness-of-power-posing-no-effect-on-hormones-and-risk-rolerance-in-a-large-sample-of-men-and-women.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carney strongly favored the publication of the Ranehill case of failed replication in her review of the article.&lt;ref name=Carney_nd_Myposition/&gt;

The statistical methods that may have led to the original erroneous findings were reviewed by noted researchers including [[Uri Simonsohn]] and Joseph P. Simmons of the [[Wharton School]] in their 2016 paper and concluded that previous research failed to "suggest the existence of an effect once we account for [[selective reporting]]".&lt;ref name="Simonsohn_Simmons_2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Power Posing: P-Curving the Evidence |series=Psychological Science (forthcoming) |date=June 10, 2016 |first1=Joseph P. |last1=Simmons |work=Data Colada |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2791272 |access-date=October 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Another failed replication"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelman|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Gelman|title=Another failed replication of power pose|url=http://andrewgelman.com/2016/10/22/30294/|website=Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond "power pose""&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelman|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Gelman|title= Beyond "power pose": Using replication failures and a better understanding of data collection and analysis to do better science |url=http://andrewgelman.com/2017/10/18/beyond-power-pose-using-replication-failures-better-understanding-data-collection-analysis-better-science/|website=Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the years that followed, attempts were made by various research groups to apply power posing manipulation in different contexts. The results did not support the assumptions made by Cuddy et al. In a 2016 study by Garrison et al. the effect of posture manipulation was combined with dominant vs. submissive gaze. Despite a large sample size, no effect was found on risk taking and, in contrast to original expectations, adopting an expansive pose reduced feelings of power.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, K. E., Tang, D., &amp; Schmeichel, B. J. (2016). [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616652209 Embodying power: A preregistered replication and extension of the power pose effect.] Social Psychological and Personality Science, '''7(7)''', 623-630 {{doi|10.1177/1948550616652209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deuter et al. (2016) investigated the effect of cognitive role taking and Cuddy's power posing manipulation in the [[Trier Social Stress Test]]; although role taking had an influence on the cortisol and testosterone response after stress, the posture manipulation had no effect on hormonal, behavioral or subjective measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deuter |first1=Christian Eric|last2=Schächinger|first2=Hartmut|last3=Best|first3=Daniel|last4=Neumann|first4=Roland|date=September 2016 |title=Effects of two dominance manipulations on the stress response: Cognitive and embodied influences |journal=Biological Psychology |pmid=27381928|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.06.004 |volume=119|number= |pages=184-189 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051116301958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where influences on hormones were found, these were sometimes opposite to the predicted direction. In a study conducted by Smith et al. in 2017, participants had to compete in a challenging task while the had to assume high or low power poses. The authors report no main effect of pose type on testosterone, cortisol, risk or feelings of power. However, they found an interaction between pose type and competition outcome on testosterone: while winners assigned to a high-power pose had small rise in testosterone levels. Yet, losers had a reduction in testosterone after holding high-power poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X1630023X|title=Winners, losers, and posers: The effect of power poses on testosterone and risk-taking following competition|first1=Kristopher|last1=Smith|first2=Coren |last2=Apicella|year=2017|publisher=|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=92|via=|pmid=27840104|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other scientists have attempted to come up with an explanation for how the effect could have been found, by excluding factors such as gender-based differences in hormone levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2011.00009/full|title=The Essential Implications of Gender in Human Behavioral Endocrinology Studies|first=Steven J.|last=Stanton|year=2017|publisher=|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=5|via=Frontiers|doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2011.00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Carney published a statement on the University of California, Berkeley website, stating that she no longer believed the effect was valid.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html |title=When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy |first=Susan |last=Dominus |date=October 18, 2017 |work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carney_nd_Myposition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/dana_carney/pdf_my%20position%20on%20power%20poses.pdf |format=PDF |title=My position on "Power Poses" |first=Dana R. |last=Carney |access-date=October 19, 2017 |date=nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal co-author"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title='Power Posing' Co-author: 'I Do Not Believe That 'Power Pose' Effects Are Real'|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/09/power-poses-co-author-i-dont-think-power-poses-are-real.html|website=New York magazine|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal Dahl Amy Cuddy's Response"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|last2=Dahl|first2=Melissa|title=Here Is Amy Cuddy's Response to Critiques of Her Power-Posing Research|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/09/read-amy-cuddys-response-to-power-posing-critiques.html|website=New York magazine|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Cesario, an associate professor of psychology at [[Michigan State University]], who co-edits ''Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology'', arranged a special issue on power posing that published in June 2017; the issue included eleven new studies, along with a meta-analyses, which found that the effect of power posing on power behaviors was not replicated.&lt;ref name="Simonsohn_Simmons_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/02/power-poses-research-false/ |title='Power Poses' Researcher Dana Carney Now Says Effects are "Undeniably" False |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=October 2, 2016  |first=David Z. |last=Morris }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time_2017"&gt;{{cite news |title='Power Poses' Don't Actually Work.

==Public attention==
The concept gained attention after a [[TED talk]] given by Cuddy in 2012, where she demonstrated the posture and argued for its benefits.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEDGlobal|url=http://conferences.ted.com/TEDGlobal2012/program/speakers.php|work=Program Speakers, 2012|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] and [[Oprah]] discussed "power posing".&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"/&gt; By 2017, Cuddy's 2012 TED talk on had become "TED's second-most popular" and had been viewed by about 47 million viewers.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"/&gt;  Cuddy said that she felt that the idea appealed to her given her experience of recovering from head trauma in a car accident, which she said helped develop her interest in "studying how people can become their aspirational selves...How can you become a self that you are not now?"&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy" /&gt;  

An extensive series of articles on power posing replication was published by [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] by Jesse Singal and other contributors in its ''Science of Us'' section.&lt;ref name="Singal Dahl Amy Cuddy's Response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal co-author" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Interesting House-of-Cards Element to the Fall of Power Poses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Why People Love(d) Power Posing: A Science of Us Conversation" /&gt;

Cuddy reported experiencing harassment, including death threats, after the findings were refuted.&lt;ref name="Interesting House-of-Cards Element to the Fall of Power Poses"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=There's an Interesting House-of-Cards Element to the Fall of Power Poses|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/09/the-fall-of-power-poses-has-a-house-of-cards-aspect-to-it.html|website=New York magazine|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Why People Love(d) Power Posing: A Science of Us Conversation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romm|first1=Cari|last2=Baer|first2=Drake|last3=Singal|first3=Jesse|last4=Dahl|first4=Melissa|title=Why People Love(d) Power Posing: A Science of Us Conversation|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/09/what-to-do-now-if-power-poses-used-to-help-you.html|website=New York magazine|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How Should We Talk About Amy Cuddy, Death Threats, and the Replication Crisis?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=How Should We Talk About Amy Cuddy, Death Threats, and the Replication Crisis?|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/04/amy-cuddy-death-threats.html|website=New York magazine|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Ed Miliband]] showed interest in the concept, telling a Policy Network seminar at the [[London Stock Exchange]] that "Predistribution is about saying we cannot allow ourselves to be stuck with permanently being a low-wage economy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19508785 BBC News - Predistribution: The Labour leader's latest Big Idea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been seen as resulting from a recognition that were Labour to return to government they would not be able to reverse all Coalition cuts and implement traditional redistributive policies due to the poor state of the economy and instead need to focus on policies that make "work pay" for the poorest in society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hxDeEzAzPYnM6xyxSf9Fb2GIAlMA?docId=N0408791346854705929A The Press Association: No more high spending: Miliband&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Tristram Hunt]], a Labour MP, called for predistribution in his chapter in ''[[Purple Labour|The Purple Book]]'' as a way to reform the economy whilst having fiscal restraint and fellow Purple Book contributor [[Rachel Reeves]] used the term in a June 2012 [[Progress (organisation)|Progress]] article.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2012/06/28/labours-economic-cause/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Lord Wood of Anfield]], an adviser to Miliband, has argued that the "pre-distribution" agenda is necessary because "In the face of rising inequality, declining social mobility and stagnating real wages for middle-income earners, there are limits to what redistribution can achieve on its own".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/09/responsible-capitalism-labour-david-cameron&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name=guardian-20130612&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/reinvigorate-centre-left-predistribution |title=How to reinvigorate the centre-left? Predistribution |author=Jacob Hacker |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 June 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hacker described the three major themes of predistribution in a UK environment:
* getting the macroeconomy right, particularly by encouraging long-term investment
* providing good quality public services, particularly healthcare and investing in skills of the young
* discovering new ways to control the market-economy, such as worker empowerment, steps beyond the minimum wage such as the right to know what co-worker groups earn, and the formation of worker groups other than unions

==Criticism==
There has been discussion of whether predistribution is practical. BBC Political Correspondent Ian Watson argues that a predistributive policy might, for instance, require a business (when bidding for a government contract) to pay the [[living wage]] rather than the [[national minimum wage]], something that may be difficult during times of [[austerity]] although Watson's argument has been countered by the independent [[Commission on Living Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19503451 BBC News - Ed Miliband unveils 'predistribution' plan to fix economy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have gone so far as to suggest that the concept of predistribution has simply been invented, and lacks any real substance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://labour-uncut.co.uk/2012/09/07/predistribution-is-another-meaningless-phrase-in-place-of-actual-policy/ Predistribution is just a meaningless word in place of actual policy « Labour Uncut&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4392">[[Image:Kings Proclamation 1775 08 23.png|thumb|A 1775 printing of the proclamation]]
The '''Proclamation of Rebellion''', officially titled '''A Proclamation for Suppressing Rebellion and Sedition''', was the response of [[George III of Great Britain]] to the news of the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] at the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Issued August 23, 1775, it declared elements of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] in a state of "open and avowed [[rebellion]]". It ordered officials of the [[British Empire]] "to use their utmost endeavours to withstand and suppress such rebellion". The Proclamation also encouraged subjects throughout the Empire, including those in Great Britain, to report anyone carrying on "traitorous correspondence" with the rebels so that they could be punished.

The Proclamation was written before Colonial Secretary [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]] had been given a copy of the [[Olive Branch Petition]] from the Continental Congress. Because the king refused to receive the petition, the Proclamation effectively served as an answer to the petition.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Maier, ''American Scripture'' (New York: Knopf, 1997), 24–25, 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 1775, North's Cabinet expanded on the Proclamation in the [[Speech from the Throne]] read by the King at the [[opening of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/amrev/shots/address.html&lt;/ref&gt; The speech insisted that rebellion was being fomented by a "desperate conspiracy" of leaders whose claims of allegiance to him were insincere; what the rebels really wanted, he said, was to create an "independent Empire". The speech indicated that the King intended to deal with the crisis with armed force, and was even considering "friendly offers of foreign assistance" to suppress the rebellion without pitting Briton against Briton. A pro-American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists towards independence, something that many colonial leaders had insisted they did not desire.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Continental Congress]] issued a response to the Proclamation on December 6, saying that while they had always been [[Allegiance|loyal to the king]], the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] never had any [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] claim to [[authority]] over them, because the colonies were not democratically represented.  Congress argued that it was their duty to continue resisting [[Coercive Acts|Parliament's violations]] of the [[British Constitution]], and that they would retaliate if any supporters in Great Britain were punished for "favouring, aiding, or abetting the cause of American liberty". Congress maintained that they still hoped to avoid the "calamities" of a "civil war".

The Proclamation and the Speech from the Throne undermined moderates in the Continental Congress such as [[John Dickinson]], who had been arguing that the king would find a way to resolve the dispute between the colonies and Parliament. When it became clear that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator, colonial attachment to the Empire was weakened, and a movement towards declaring independence became a reality, culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] on [[Fourth of July|July 4, 1776]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1752">The '''''Radziwiłł Chronicle''''' (or '''Königsberg Chronicle''') is one of the [[Old East Slavic]] [[illuminated manuscript]] held by the Library of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. It is a 15th-century copy of a 13th-century original. Its name is derived from the Princes [[Radziwiłł]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (later, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]), who kept it in their [[Nesvizh Castle]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The work reveals the history of [[Kievan Rus']] and its neighbors from the fifth to the early 13th century in pictorial form, representing events described in the [[manuscript]] with more than 600 colour illustrations. Among [[letopis|East Slavic chronicles]], the ''Radziwiłł'' is distinguished for the richness and quantity of its illustrations, which may derive from the 13th-century original. The chronicle includes the ''[[Tale of Bygone Years]]'' and extends it with yearly entries until 1206.

The '''''Records of the Grand Historian''''',&lt;!--Chinese in infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; also known by its [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name '''''Shiji''''', is a monumental [[Chinese historiography|history of ancient China]] and the world finished around 94 BC by the [[Han dynasty]] official [[Sima Qian]] after having been started by his father, [[Sima Tan]], Grand Astrologer to the imperial court. The work covers the world as it was then known to the Chinese and a 2500-year period from the age of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] to the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] in the author's own time.{{sfnb|Nienhauser|2011|pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYM3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA486&amp;dq=Historiography+Chinese+shiji&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zFVIVJyXMoSTyASojYHoDw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Shiji&amp;f=false 463-464]}}

The ''Records'' has been called a "foundational text in Chinese civilization".{{sfnp|Hardy|1999|p=xiii}} After [[Confucius]] and the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor of Qin]], "Sima Qian was one of the creators of Imperial China, not least because by providing definitive biographies, he virtually created the two earlier figures."{{sfnp|Hardy|1999|pp=xiii, 3}}  The ''Records'' set the model for the 24 subsequent [[Twenty-Four Histories|dynastic histories of China]]. In contrast to Western historical works, the ''Records'' do not treat history as "a continuous, sweeping narrative", but rather break it up into smaller, overlapping units dealing with famous leaders, individuals, and major topics of significance.{{sfnp|Durrant|1986|p=689}}

==History==
{{further|Chinese historiography}}
The work that became ''Records of the Grand Historian'' was begun by [[Sima Tan]], the Grand Astrologer (''Taishi'' {{lang|zh|太史}}) of the [[Han dynasty]] court during the late 2nd century{{sbc}}. After his death in 110{{sbc}}, it was continued and completed by his son and successor [[Sima Qian]], who is generally credited as the work's author.{{sfnp|Hulsewé|1993|pp=405-06}}{{sfnp|Durrant|2001|pp=502-03}}  Sima Qian is known to have completed the ''Records'' before his death in c. 86{{sbc}}, with one copy residing in the imperial capital of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]) and the other copy probably being stored in his home.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=897}}  

Details of the ''Records''{{apostrophe}} early reception and circulation are not well known.{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=102}}  A number of 1st century BC authors, such as the scholar Chu Shaosun ({{lang|zh|褚少孫}}; fl. 32{{ndash}}7{{sbc}}), added interpolations to the ''Records'', and may have had to reconstruct portions of it: ten of the original 130 chapters were lost in the Eastern Han period (AD 25{{ndash}}220) and seem to have been reconstructed later.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=897}}

Beginning in the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] (420{{ndash}}589) and the [[Tang dynasty]] (607{{ndash}}918), a number of scholars wrote and edited commentaries to the ''Records''.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=897}}  Most 1st millennium editions of the ''Records'' include the commentaries of Pei Yin ({{lang|zh|裴駰}}, 5th century), [[Sima Zhen]] (early 8th century), and Zhang Shoujie ({{lang|zh|張守節}}, early 8th century).{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=898}}{{sfnp|Hulsewé|1993|p=407}}  The primary modern edition of the ''Records'' is the [[Zhonghua Book Company]] edition of 1959 (revised in 1982), and is based on an edition prepared by the Chinese historian [[Gu Jiegang]] in the early 1930s.{{sfnp|Hulsewé|1993|p=409}}

===Manuscripts===
There are two known surviving fragments of ''Records'' manuscripts from before the Tang dynasty, both of which are preserved in the [[Ishiyama-dera]] temple in [[Ōtsu|Ōtsu, Japan]].  Portions of at least nine Tang dynasty manuscripts survive: three fragments discovered among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] in the early 20th century, and six manuscripts preserved in Japanese temples and museums, such as the [[Kōzan-ji]] temple in [[Kyoto]] and the [[Tōyō Bunko]] museum in [[Tokyo]].  A number of woodblock printed editions of the ''Records'' survive, the earliest of which date to the [[Song dynasty]] (960{{ndash}}1297).{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=898}}

{{see also|List of Records of the Grand Historian chapters}}

In all, the ''Records'' is about 526,000 [[Chinese characters]] long, making it four times longer than [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' and longer than the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hardy |first=Grant |title=Can an Ancient Chinese Historian Contribute to Modern Western Theory? The Multiple Narratives of Ssu-Ma Ch'ien |journal=History and Theory |year=1994 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=20–38 |jstor=2505650}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=708}}

Sima Qian conceived and composed his work in self-contained units, with a good deal of repetition between them. His manuscript was written on [[bamboo slips]] with about 24 to 36 characters each, and assembled into bundles of around 30 slips. Even after the manuscript was allowed to circulate or be copied, the work would have circulated as bundles of bamboo slips or small groups. [[Endymion Wilkinson]] calculates that there were probably between 466 and 700 bundles, whose total weight would have been {{Convert|88|-|132|lb|kg}}, which would have been difficult to access and hard to transport. Later copies on silk would have been much lighter, but also expensive and rare. Until the work was transferred to paper many centuries later, circulation would have been difficult and piecemeal, which accounts for many of the errors and variations in the text.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=708}}

Sima Qian organized the chapters of ''Records of the Grand Historian'' into five categories, which each comprise a section of the book.

; Basic Annals
: The "Basic Annals" (''běnjì'' {{lang|zh|本紀}}) make up the first 12 chapters of the ''Records'', and are largely similar to records from the ancient Chinese court chronicle tradition, such as the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}} The first five cover either periods, such as the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors#Five Emperors|Five Emperors]], or individual dynasties, such as the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}}  The last seven cover individual rulers, starting with the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor of Qin]] and progressing through the first emperors of the [[Han dynasty]].{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}} In this section, Sima chose to also include ''de facto'' rulers of China, such as [[Xiang Yu]] and [[Empress Lü Zhi|Empress Dowager Lü]], while excluding rulers who never held any real power, such as [[Emperor Yi of Chu]] and [[Emperor Hui of Han]].{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=111–112}}
; Tables
: Chapters 13 to 22 are the "Tables" (''biǎo'' {{lang|zh|表}}), which are one genealogical table and nine other chronological tables.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}}  They show reigns, important events, and royal lineages in table form, which Sima Qian stated that he did because "the chronologies are difficult to follow when different genealogical lines exist at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;''Shiji'' 130: 3319, cited in {{harvp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each table except the last one begins with an introduction to the period it covers.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}}
; Treatises
: The "Treatises" (''shū'' {{lang|zh|書}}, sometimes called "Monographs") is the shortest of the five ''Records'' sections, and contains eight chapters (23&amp;ndash;30) on the historical evolution of ritual, music, [[pitch pipe]]s, the calendar, astronomy, sacrifices, rivers and waterways, and financial administration.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}}
; Hereditary Houses
: The "Hereditary Houses" (''shìjiā'' {{lang|zh|世家}}) is the second largest of the five ''Records'' sections, and comprises chapters 31 to 60. Within this section, the earlier chapters are very different in nature than the later chapters.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}} Many of the earlier chapters are chronicle-like accounts of the leading states of the [[Zhou dynasty]], such as the states of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Lu (state)|Lu]], and two of the chapters go back as far as the [[Shang dynasty]].{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}}  The later chapters, which cover the Han dynasty, contain biographies.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}}
; Ranked Biographies
: The "Ranked Biographies" (''lièzhuàn'' {{lang|zh|列傳}}, usually shortened to "Biographies") is the largest of the five ''Records'' sections, covering chapters 61 to 130, and accounts for 42% of the entire work.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}} The 69 "Biographies" chapters mostly contain biographical profiles of about 130 outstanding ancient Chinese men, ranging from the moral paragon [[Boyi and Shuqi|Boyi]] from the end of the Shang dynasty to some of Sima Qian's near contemporaries.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}} About 40 of the chapters are dedicated to one particular man, but some are about two related figures, while others cover small groups of figures who shared certain roles, such as assassins, caring officials, or Confucian scholars.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}} Unlike most modern biographies, the accounts in the "Biographies" give profiles using anecdotes to depict morals and character, with "unforgettably lively impressions of people of many different kinds and of the age in which they lived."{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}} The "Biographies" have been popular throughout Chinese history, and have provided a large number of set phrases still used in modern Chinese.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=706}}

==Style==
[[File:Sima Qian (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|Sima Qian]]

Unlike subsequent official historical texts that adopted [[Confucian]] doctrine, proclaimed the divine rights of the emperors, and degraded any failed claimant to the throne, Sima Qian's more liberal and objective prose has been renowned and followed by poets and novelists. Most volumes of ''Liezhuan'' are vivid descriptions of events and persons. Sima Qian sought out stories from those who might have closer knowledge of certain historical events, using them as sources to balance the reliability and accuracy of historical records. For instance, the material on [[Jing Ke]]'s attempt at assassinating the [[Qin Shi Huang|King of Qin]] incorporates an eye-witness account by Xia Wuju ({{lang|zh|夏無且}}), a physician to the king of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] who happened to be attending the diplomatic ceremony for Jing Ke, and this account was passed on to Sima Qian by those who knew Xia.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=191, 240}}

It has been observed that the diplomatic Sima Qian has a way of accentuating the positive in his treatment of rulers in the Basic Annals, but slipping negative information into other chapters, and so his work must be read as a whole to obtain full information. For example, the information that [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] (later Emperor Gaozu of Han), in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from [[Xiang Yu]]'s men, pushed his own children off his carriage to lighten it, was not given in the emperor's biography, but in the biography of Xiang Yu. He is also careful to balance the negative with the positive, for example, in the biography of [[Empress Lü Zhi|Empress Dowager Lu]] which contains lurid accounts of her cruelty, he pointed out at the end that, despite whatever her personal life may have been, her rule brought peace and prosperity to the country.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95–98}}

==Source materials==
Sima's family were hereditary historians to the Han emperor. Sima Qian's father [[Sima Tan]] served as Grand Historian, and Sima Qian succeeded to his position. Thus he had access to the early Han dynasty archives, edicts, and records. Sima Qian was a methodical, skeptical historian who had access to ancient books, written on [[bamboo and wooden slips]], from before the time of the Han dynasty. Many of the sources he used did not survive. He not only used archives and imperial records, but also interviewed people and traveled around China to verify information. In his first chapter, "Annals of the Five Emperors," he writes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctext.org/shiji/wu-di-ben-ji |title=Annals of the Five Emperors |script-title=zh:五帝本紀 |publisher=Chinese Text Project |website=ctext.org |quote={{lang|zh|余嘗西至空桐，北過涿鹿，東漸於海，南浮江淮矣，至長老皆各往往稱黃帝、堯、舜之處，風教固殊焉，總之不離古文者近是。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Historian used ''The Annals of the Five Emperors'' ({{lang|zh|五帝系諜}}) and the ''[[Classic of History]]'' as source materials to make genealogies from the time of the [[Yellow Emperor]] until that of the [[Gonghe (regency)|Gonghe regency]] (841-828 BC). Sima Qian often cites his sources. For example, in the first chapter, "Annals of the Five Emperors", he writes, "I have read the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' and the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]''." In his 13th chapter, "Genealogical Table of the Three Ages," Sima Qian writes, "I have read all the genealogies of the kings (''dieji'' {{lang|zh|谍记}}) that exist since the time of the Yellow Emperor." In his 14th chapter, "Yearly Chronicle of the Feudal Lords", he writes, "I have read all the royal annals (''chunqiu li pudie'' {{lang|zh|春秋曆譜諜}}) up until the time of [[King Li of Zhou]]." In his 15th chapter, "Yearly Chronicle of the Six States," he writes, “I have read the Annals of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] (''qin ji'' {{lang|zh|秦記}}), and they say that the [[Quanrong]] [a barbarian tribe] defeated [[King You of Zhou]] [ca 771 BC]."

In the 19th chapter, he writes, "I have occasion to read over the records of enfeoffment and come to the case of Wu Qian, the marquis of Bian...." (The father of Marquis Bian, Wu Rui, was named king (wang) of [[Changsha]] in [[Hunan]] for his loyalty to Gaozu. See article on [[Zhao Tuo]]). In his chapter on the patriotic minister and poet [[Qu Yuan]], Sima Qian writes, "I have read [Qu Yuan's works] ''[[Li Sao]]'', ''[[Tianwen]]'' ("Heaven Asking"), ''Zhaohun'' (summoning the soul), and ''Ai Ying'' ([[Lament for Ying]])". In the 62nd chapter, "Biography of Guan and of Yan", he writes, "I have read Guan's ''Mu Min'' ({{lang|zh|牧民}} - "Government of the People", a chapter in the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]''), ''Shan Gao'' ("The Mountains Are High"), ''Chengma'' ([[chariot]] and horses; a long section on war and economics), ''Qingzhong'' (Light and Heavy; i.e. "what is important"), and ''Jiufu'' (Nine Houses), as well as the ''Spring and Autumn Annals of Yanzi''." In his 64th chapter, "Biography of [[Sima Rangju]]", the Grand Historian writes, "I have read Sima's Art of War." In the 121st chapter, "Biographies of Scholars", he writes, "I read the Imperial Decrees that encouraged education officials."
[[File:Records of the Grand Historian.jpg|thumb|Chapter 2, ''Annals of Xia'' (Ming dynasty edition)]]

Sima Qian wrote of the problems with incomplete, fragmentary and contradictory sources. For example, he mentioned in the preface to chapter 15 that the chronicle records of the feudal states kept in the [[Zhou dynasty]]'s archive were burnt by [[Qin Shi Huang]] because they contained criticisms and ridicule of the Qin state, and that the Qin annals were brief and incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ctext.org/shiji/liu-guo-nian-biao#n5146 |trans-title=Chronological table of the six kingdoms |script-title=zh:六國年表 |publisher=Chinese Text Project |website=ctext.org |quote={{lang|zh|秦既得意，燒天下詩書，諸侯史記尤甚，為其有所刺譏也。詩書所以復見者，多藏人家，而史記獨藏周室，以故滅。惜哉，惜哉！獨有秦記，又不載日月，其文略不具。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th chapter he mentioned that the chronologies and genealogies of different ancient texts "disagree and contradict each other throughout". In his 18th chapter, Sima Qian writes, "I have set down only what is certain, and in doubtful cases left a blank."&lt;ref&gt;''Records of the Grand Historian'', vol. ''Han Dynasty I'', translated by [[Burton Watson]] (Columbia University, Revised Edition, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability and accuracy==
Scholars have questioned the historicity of legendary kings of the ancient periods given by Sima Qian. Sima Qian began the ''Shiji'' with an account of the five rulers of supreme virtue, the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Emperors]], who modern scholars, such as those from the [[Doubting Antiquity School]], believe to be originally local deities of the peoples of ancient China.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=16–17}}  Sima Qian sifted out the elements of the supernatural and fantastic which seemed to contradict their existence as actual human monarchs, and was therefore criticized for turning myths and folklore into sober history.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=16–17}}

However, according to [[Joseph Needham]], who wrote in 1954 on Sima Qian's accounts of the kings of the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600&amp;ndash;c. 1050 BC): {{quote|It was commonly maintained that Ssuma Chhien [Sima Qian] could not have adequate historical materials for his account of what had happened more than a thousand years earlier. One may judge of the astonishment of many, therefore, when it appeared that no less than twenty-three of the thirty rulers' name were to be clearly found on the indisputably genuine [[Anyang]] [[oracle bones|bones]]. It must be, therefore, that Ssuma Chhien [Sima Qian] did have fairly reliable materials at his disposal—a fact which underlines once more the deep historical-mindedness of the Chinese—and that the Shang dynasty is perfectly acceptable.|Joseph Needham&lt;ref name=needham&gt;{{cite book |author=Needham, Joseph. |year=1954 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 1, Introductory Orientations |publisher= Cambridge University Press  |isbn=0-521-05799-X  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNXZGQVdz_gC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While some aspects of Sima Qian's history of the Shang dynasty are supported by inscriptions on the oracle bones, there is, as yet, no clear corroborating evidence from archaeology on Sima Qian's history of the [[Xia dynasty]].

There are also discrepancies of fact such as dates between various portions of the work. This may be a result of Sima Qian's use of different source texts.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|p=113}}

==Transmission and supplementation by other writers==
After ca. 91 BC, the more-or-less completed manuscript was hidden in the residence of the author's daughter, Sima Ying ({{lang|zh|司馬英}}), to avoid destruction under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] and his immediate successor [[Emperor Zhao of Han|Emperor Zhao]]. The ''Shiji'' was finally disseminated during the reign of [[Emperor Xuan of Han|Emperor Xuan]] by Sima Qian's grandson (through his daughter), Yang Yun ({{lang|zh|楊惲}}), after a hiatus of around twenty years.

The changes in the manuscript of the ''Shiji'' during this hiatus have always been disputed among scholars. That the text was more or less complete by ca. 91 BC is established in the Letter to Ren'an ({{lang|zh|報任安書}}), composed in the Zhenghe ({{lang|zh|征和}}) era of Emperor Wu's reign.  In this letter, Sima Qian describes his work as "spanning from the time of the Yellow Emperor to the present age and consisting of ten tables, twelve basic annals, eight treatises, thirty chapters on hereditary houses, and seventy biographies, together totaling 130 chapters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%A0%B1%E4%BB%BB%E5%B0%91%E5%8D%BF%E6%9B%B8 |trans-title=Letter to Ren'an |script-title=zh:報任少卿書 |lang=zh |website=Wikisource |quote={{lang|zh|報任少卿書：『上計軒轅，下至于茲，為十表，本紀十二，書八章，世家三十，列傳七十，凡百三十篇。』}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These numbers are likewise given in the postface to ''Shiji''.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=56–67}}

After his death (presumably only a few years later), few people had the opportunity to see the whole work. However, various additions were still made to it. The historian [[Liu Zhiji]] reported the names of a total of fifteen scholars supposed to have added material to the ''Shiji'' during the period after the death of Sima Qian. Only the additions by Chu Shaosun ({{lang|zh|褚少孫}}, c.105 - c.30 BC) are clearly indicated by adding "Mr Chu said," (Chu xiansheng yue, {{lang|zh|褚先生曰}}). Already in the first century AD, [[Ban Biao]] and [[Ban Gu]] claimed that ten chapters in ''Records of the Grand Historian'' were lacking. &lt;!--must have been completed later .--&gt; A large number of chapters dealing with the first century of the Han dynasty (i.e. the 2nd century BC) correspond exactly to the relevant chapters from the ''[[Book of Han]]'' (''Hanshu''). It is unclear whether those chapters initially came from the ''Shiji'' or from the ''Hanshu''. Researchers Yves Hervouet (1921-1999) and [[A.F.P. Hulsewé]] argued that the originals of those chapters of the ''Shiji'' were lost and they were later reconstructed using the corresponding chapters from the ''Hanshu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hulsewé, A.

==Editions==
The earliest extant copy of ''Records of the Grand Historian'', handwritten, was made during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period (420 – 589 AD). The earliest printed edition, called ''Shiji jijie'' ({{lang|zh|史記集解}}, literally ''Records of the Grand Historian, Collected Annotations''), was published during the [[Northern Song dynasty]]. [[Huang Shanfu]]'s edition, printed under the [[Southern Song dynasty]], is the earliest collection of the ''Sanjiazhu'' commentaries on ''Records of the Grand Historian'' ({{lang|zh|三家注}}, literally: ''The Combined Annotations of the Three Experts'').

In modern times, the [[Zhonghua Book Company]] in [[Beijing]] has published the book in both [[simplified Chinese]] and [[traditional Chinese]] editions. The 1959 (2nd ed., 1982) ''Sanjiazhu'' edition (based upon the Jinling Publishing House edition, ''vide infra'') contains commentaries interspersed among the main text and is considered to be an authoritative modern edition.

The most well known [[rare book|editions]] of the ''Shiji'' are:

[[File:RidersAlmanac1758.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Title page]] of Rider's British Merlin 1758.]]
'''''Rider's British Merlin''''' was one of the earliest almanacs to be published, issued from 1656 until at least 1830.

==Content==
The almanac contained the [[calendar]], [[weather]], and [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[astrology|astrological]] information that a typical almanac of the period would contain. The pages for each month of the year were accompanied by advice on what, and [[nutrition|what not to eat]] and drink, and otherwise how to keep in good health. There were horticultural notes with abundant attention paid to herbs, fruit and vegetables.

The lengthiest sections of this little book listed annual fairs in England and Wales of fixed and moveable date. The first would generally be associated with a [[saint's day]], while the second would be of the type "second Monday in October". This list of town names and dates represented important information in the days before Agricultural Advisers, Trade Fairs and Job Offices, when the fairs played an important role not only in buying and selling, but also in exhibiting innovations in husbandry, in information exchange and in the hiring of labor.

==Who Was "Rider"?==
It is generally held that Cardanus Rider is a pseudonym, and near-anagram: the letters rearrange as Ric_ard Saunder_. Richard Saunders was an English physician and astrologer, born in 1613, and who died (sources differ) either in 1675, 1687, or 1692.

The National Archives in London hold a book by Saunders on palmistry, with horoscopes; also attributed to him is ''The Astrological Judgment and Practice of Physick'', published in 1677, although the fact that it includes charts from as early as 1616 to 1618 has led doubts to be cast on the actual authorship. Be that as it may, its subject matter was dear to the heart of "Cardanus Rider"; it stands as one of the earliest astro-medical treatises in the English language. Using the terminology of his day, the writer speaks of humours and winds, of conditions hot, cold or dry, of the cholerick and melancholy, of illnesses produced by the planets in the various signs of the zodiac, when to administer medicines based on planetary hours, and much more.

In modern heraldry, a '''royal cypher''' is a [[monogram]]-like device of a country's reigning [[Monarch|sovereign]], typically consisting of the initials of the monarch's name and title, sometimes interwoven and often surmounted by a crown.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]] (Fifth edition; 2002), Volume 1, p. 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; Where such a cypher is used by an emperor or empress, it is called an ''imperial cypher''. In the system used by various [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the title is abbreviated as ''R'' for ''rex'' or ''regina'' ([[Latin]] for ''king'' and ''queen''). Previously, ''I'' stood for ''imperator'' or ''imperatrix'' (Latin words for ''emperor'' and ''empress'') of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fotw.flaggen-profi.de/flags/gb-nav.html| last=Morley| first=Vincent| title=United Kingdom: Royal Navy| publisher=Flags Of The World| accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Boutell| first=Charles| authorlink=Charles Boutell|author2=Wheeler-Holohan, V. | title=Boutell's Manual of Heraldry| publisher=F.

==Commonwealth realms==
The use of a royal cypher in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s originates in the [[United Kingdom]], where the public use of the royal initials dates at least from the early [[Tudor period]], and was simply the initial of the sovereign with, after [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign, the addition of the letter ''R'' for ''[[Monarch|Rex]]'' or ''[[Queen regnant|Regina]]''. The letter ''I'' for ''[[Imperatrix]]'' was added to [[Queen Victoria]]'s monogram after she became [[Empress of India]] in 1877. The initials{{snd}} which had no set pattern or form of lettering laid down{{snd}} were usually shown in company with the royal arms or crown as on the king's manors and palaces{{snd}} such as those of Henry VIII on the gatehouse of [[St James's Palace]]. The purpose seems to have been simply to identify an individual sovereign, as the royal coat of arms was often used by successive monarchs. The initials were used mostly on government papers, duty stamps and similar objects, and were sometimes surmounted by a stylised version of the [[Tudor Crown]] or, more recently, [[St Edward's Crown]]. In [[Scotland]], the [[Crown of Scotland]] appears in place of the Imperial Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Boutell| first=Charles| authorlink=Charles Boutell|author2=Fox-Davies, A.C. | title=The Handbook to English Heraldry| publisher=Echo Library| date=21 July 2008| url=http://www.4crests.com/heraldrybook5.html| isbn=978-1-4068-2770-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though royal symbols differ among the sixteen [[Commonwealth realm]]s, as they are separate monarchies, the one sovereign uses the same cypher throughout all of his or her countries. Distinction continues to be made between the personal cypher and the simpler, more workaday public initials, the former being the sovereign's own monogram and the latter simply a means of identifying a reign. Nowadays, the initials are also called the royal cypher, but, to aid clarification, the monogram is referred to as the royal cypher interlaced and reversed.

The present Queen's cypher is ''E{{sc|II}}R'', standing for ''[[Elizabeth II]] Regina''. Cyphers for other members of the [[Commonwealth realm#Royal family|Royal Family]] are designed by the [[College of Arms]] or [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] and are subsequently approved by the Queen. These cyphers have been incorporated by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] into the various [[royal standards of Canada]]. The use in Canada of the reigning monarch's cypher, which is sometimes uniquely surrounded by a garland of [[Maple leaf|maple leaves]], is as a symbol not only of the sovereign him or herself, but of Canada's full sovereignty as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=MacLeod| first=Kevin S.| authorlink=Kevin S.

Its also found on post offices and some government buildings Australia.

==Elsewhere==
Other royal houses have also made use of royal or imperial cyphers.  Ottoman sultans had a calligraphic signature, their [[tughra]].

All the [[monarch]]s of Europe's six other surviving kingdoms use cyphers, with royal crowns above them.{{fact|date=May 2017}} [[Harald V of Norway]] uses the letter H crossed with the Arabic numeral 5; [[Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden]] uses the letters C and G overlapping with the Roman numeral XVI below them; [[Felipe VI of Spain]] uses the letter F with the Roman numeral; and [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] uses the letter M with the Arabic numeral 2 and the letter R (for Regina) below it. [[Philippe of Belgium]] uses the letters P and F intertwined, referring to the fact that his name is Philippe in [[French language|French]], but Filip in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the two main languages in Belgium. [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]] and his [[Queen Maxima]] share a joint cypher consisting of the letter W entwined with the letter M.

King [[Vajiralongkorn]] of [[Thailand]] uses a cypher made up of his initials in [[Thai alphabet|Thai script]] ("ว.ป.ร." VPR{{snd}} Vajiralongkorn Parama Rajadhiraj, an equivalent of Vajirarongkorn Rex).

'''Schmidt v Holland''' [1982] 2 NZLR 406 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the issue of notice of cancellation of a [[contract]], where a contract has been breached.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Schmidts agreed to purchase the Holland's property. Later, the Schmidt's decided to buy someone else's property, and as a result the Schmidt's indicated to the Hollands, that they did not plan to purchase their property.

As a consequence, the Holland's treated their sales contract as being cancelled, and later sold their property to a 3rd party, and sued the Schmidts for the loss in the resale.

The Schmidts disputed liability, on the basis that as the Hollands had not actioned the formality of informing them that they had accepted their repudiation of the contract, they could not treat the contract as legally cancelled.

==Decision==
The High Court ruled that as the Schmidt's were not formally advised by the Holland's that they had cancelled the contract, they were not liable for the loss on resale. At the same time, a sympathetic Hardie Boys J stated "The result is hard on the Hollands, for they were not at fault, and their position could so easily have been protected".

Footnote: The courts have subsequently shown willingness to avoid such rulings, such as in [[Chatfield v Jones]] (1990) 3 NZLR 285

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7292">'''Schostal''' Photo Agency (Agentur Schostal) was an [[Austria]]n press [[photo agency]], named for its founder, Robert F. Schostal.

==Photographers==
The Agency represented 408 photographers. Some are still of renown, such as [[Trude Fleischmann]], Kitty Hoffmann, {{ill|Manassé|de|Atelier Manassé}}, Dr {{ill|Paul Wolff (photographer)|de|Paul Wolff|lt=Paul Wolff}}, [[Karel Hájek]], [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], Georges Sand, {{ill|Willem van de Poll|nl}}, Bert Longworth, [[Germaine Krull]], [[Yva]], [[Dora Kallmus|Madame d'Ora]] and [[Lotte Jacobi]]. Especially for the latter Jewish photographers, Schostal was one of the few business to circumvent the [[Volksgemeinschaft|Nazi Reich Chamber of Culture]] (nationalsozialistische Reichskulturkammer) ban on their employment.

==History==
Schostal Photo Agency (Agentur Schostal) was founded in 1929 with the aim of producing and distributing photographs both locally and globally. With more than one million photos covering a wide variety of subjects, it was one of the great agencies of the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hackett, Sophie. "Schostal Agency: Outstanding Significance and National Importance." Report presented at the Photography Curatorial Committee meeting, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, November, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters were in [[Wieden]], the 4th district of [[Vienna]] in the former office of Wiener Photo-Kurier.  Schostal had representatives and offices in major European cities Paris, Milan, Berlin and Stockholm.

The main customers were print media, including magazines such as ''[[Die Dame]]'', ''[[Die Woche]]'' and ''[[UHU (magazine)|Uhu]]'' in Austria, "Moderne Welt", "{{ill|Die Bühne|de}}", "{{ill|Wiener Salonblatt|de}}" and "[[Wiener (magazine)|Wiener Magazin]]" to which Schostal supplied images relating to culture, fashion and glamor. From 1929 it was the Austrian representative of the Keystone Press Agency (London, New York).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In March 1938 German troops invaded Austria. Robert Schostal quickly made a bid to flee the country for Paris where his brother lived, leaving behind the Schostal Agency photographs, but was betrayed and arrested in [[Klagenfurt]]. He was released after Studio Madame d'Ora made representations on his behalf, paying for a visa for him and his mother to come to France, though he instead traveled to the United States. Walter Schostal arranged for customers outside of Germany and Austria to invoice their office in Paris instead of Vienna, but with France's declaration of war in 1939, the Paris branch had to close and in 1941 the entire Schostal family reunited in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

in Vienna, though his close relations with Nazi officials of the Reichspressekammer Friedrich Gondosch, also a photographer and whose pictures are in the collection, was able to take over the Schostal agency&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Milena Grief, "Agentur Schostal: Mit den Fotos Kehrt die Erinnerung zurück." Rundbrief Fotografie 9, no. 2. (June 2002), 30 - 33.&lt;/ref&gt;. The photographs were subsequently used for propaganda, rebranded with the stamp "Wien Bild" followed by the banner ''P.P.P. Photos für Presse und Propaganda'' ('PPP photos for press and propaganda').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fold3.com, Records of the Property Control Branch of the U.S. Allied Commission for Austria (USACA), 1945–1950, (DN1929: National Archives and Records Administration, 2010), Accessed August 3, 2018 www.fold3.com/image/306841193.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], in 1948, the agency, which was then under Soviet control, closed. Robert made unsuccessful efforts from America to recover the archive. However, some of the photos were hidden in a basement,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and Friedrich Gondosch vanished, perhaps fearing reprisal.

==Rediscovery==
In 1992, an unnamed Swiss art dealer discovered approximately 130,000 well-preserved photographs bearing the Schostal Agency stamp, more than 40 years after the agency went out of business in 1948.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Parts of the collection that were discovered in 1992 were sold or auctioned off to various institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rebecca Madamba (2008) The Schostal Agency: A Finding Aid for the Schostal Agency Collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Thesis of the Honours Bachelors of Arts, Studies in Arts and Culture, Concentration in Curatorial Studies, Brock University.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Historical Museum]] bought 40,000 photos in 1995, The Hamburg Museum of Arts and Crafts bought 350 fashion photographs, and some went to the [[Austrian National Library]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Milena Greif, "Agentur Schostal: Mit den Fotos Kehrt die Erinnerung zurück,"Rundbrief Fotografie 9, no. 2 (June 2002), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isolated prints bearing the Schostal agency stamp have surfaced intermittently at art auctions. A bulk of the photographs are owned by the Austrian publisher {{ill|Christian Brandstätter|de||WD=}}, the founder of IMAGNO Brandstätter Institute, a leading historical picture agency in Austria that has 300,000 Schostal photographs in their holdings. How this company acquired the majority of photographs is unknown, as the number in its collection surpasses the 130,000 prints discovered in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagno.at/index.php?15899009221058995083.00001858274625|title=IMAGNO brandstätter images|website=Imagno.at|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of this collection, 5,066 gelatin silver prints, 58 information sheets, and 34 photograph envelopes made between 1927 and 1945, was anonymously donated to the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] (AGO) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Madamba (2014) The Schostal Agency: A Finding Aid for the Schostal Agency Collection at the Art Gallery Of Ontario.

{{Nihongo3|"The Camellia Girl"|少女椿|'''Shōjo Tsubaki'''}} was a [[Stock character|stock]] [[protagonist]] of ''[[kamishibai]]'' during its revival in early [[Shōwa period]] [[Japan]] attributed to a creator known as Seiun, though the plagiarism and retelling in sundry variants that was the norm for popular-proving tales make its origin uncertain. Generally speaking, the character is a stereotypical [[Adolescence|adolescent]] or [[Preadolescence|preadolescent]] [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingénue]], a daughter of a penniless family who goes from the frying pan of selling [[camellia]]s on the streets to the fire of being bought and sold and forced to perform in a [[revue]] show.

The character is known to western, and indeed contemporary Japanese, audiences predominantly by way of [[Suehiro Maruo]]'s ''[[ero guro]]'' reinterpretation in [[comic]]s including a [[graphic novel]] of the same name published in English translation as '''''Mr. Arashi's Amazing Freak Show''''' and [[Hiroshi Harada]]'s film based on Maruo's version, screened at [[film festival]]s and released on [[DVD-Video]] with English subtitles as '''''Midori'''''. The graphic novel is considered a classic of Maruo's 1920s-inspired brand of ''ero guro'' and its [[Out-of-print book|out-of-print]] English edition has become much sought-after; the film is also infamous in itself and for the elaborate expanded cinema presentations it was originally only shown in, though it has been allowed to screen in conventional [[movie theater]]s and even released on home video outside Japan. A [[live action]] [[film adaptation]] of the manga was released in Japan in May 2016.

==Comics==
The comics and film's version of the story follows the misadventures of a girl called Midori who, after losing her mother, joins a [[funfair]] [[freak show]]. She is harassed, abused and humiliated by everyone else in the show, until the appearance of a dwarf magician-hypnotist.

==Anime film==

{{Nihongo|'''''Midori'''''|地下幻燈劇画 少女椿|Chika Gentō Gekiga: Shōjo Tsubaki|roughly "[[wikt:underground culture|Underground]] [[Slide projector|Projected]] [[Gekiga|Dramatic Pictures]]: Maiden Camellia"}} is a 1992 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] [[Independent animation|independent]] ''ero guro'' adult horror [[film]] by Hiroshi Harada, based on Suehiro Maruo's comic version of the ''kamishibai'' standard. The film, which Harada scripted and directed under the pseudonym of {{Nihongo|Hisaaki Etsu|絵津久秋|Etsu Hisaaki}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/地下幻燈劇画%E3%80%80少女椿&lt;/ref&gt; and whom he presents as a lost filmmaker he worked on it under,&lt;ref&gt;http://zipangufest.com/films/2010/midori-the-girl-in-the-freak-show&lt;/ref&gt; consists primarily of paintings and [[cel]]s of drawings by Harada held, panned or zoomed over with [[music]], [[sound effect]]s and [[voice acting]] and occasional touches of [[traditional animation]].

The film is considered partially [[Lost film|lost]]: it was banned to outside countries on account of depicting imagery illegal at the time and seized, with some sequences surviving only in standard definition from [[Telecine|telecining]] prior.

===Production===
The film was single-handedly created by Hiroshi Harada. Given the subject matter, Harada had found it impossible to gain sponsors. He then used all of his life savings to make the film over a five-year period. Over 5,000 separate sheets of animation were hand-drawn by Harada.

===Screenings===
The film was for many years very rare to see at all as Harada will only screen ''Midori'' in Japan if the venue is presented as a carnival freak show; the original film has been destroyed and only a handful of bootleg video copies were known to exist. In 2006, however, a [[DVD region code|region 2]]-locked, [[PAL]]-style [[DVD-Video]] of the film with subtitles in French, English, Spanish, Italian and German was released in France by Ciné Malta.

==Live action film==
A [[live action]] [[film adaptation]] of the manga directed by TORICO and starring {{Interlanguage link multi| Risa Nakamura|ja|3=中村里砂}} was released in Japan in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-11/midori-shojo-tsubaki-horror-manga-gets-live-action-film-starring-risa-nakamura/.98570|title= Midori/Shōjo Tsubaki Horror Manga Gets Live-Action Film Starring Risa Nakamura|date= February 11, 2016|accessdate= March 14, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cast members include [[Shunsuke Kazama]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Misaki Morino|ja|3=森野美咲}}, [[Sug|Takeru]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Daichi Saeki|ja|3=佐伯大地}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=355676|title= 少女椿(2016)|accessdate= March 14, 2016|work= allcinema|publisher= Stingray|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Song and Silence: A Guidebook to Rogues and Bards''''' is an optional rulebook for the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|3rd edition]] of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', and notable for its [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] format.

==Contents==
The ''Song and Silence'' guidebook provides supplemental information for characters belonging to the [[Rogue (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Rogue]] and [[Bard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Bard]] base classes. This book contained tips for creating and playing characters of the aforementioned class, as well as a large number of prestige classes.

==Publication history==
This book was written by [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]] and [[John D. Rateliff]] and published in 2001 by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. Cover art was by [[Todd Lockwood]], with interior art by [[David Roach (comics)|David Roach]] and [[Wayne Reynolds]].

Although it was not updated to 3.5 Edition, most of the prestige classes were reintroduced in the 3.5 supplemental source book ''[[Complete Adventurer]]'', and a few in ''[[Complete Arcane]]''.

==Reception==
The reviewer from ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' noted the [[prestige class]]es in the book, and felt that it offered "some jim-dandies in this one", including the [[thief-acrobat]], and the Fang of Lolth, "which starts with the assumption that a PC tries to access an artifact not meant for humanoids with a Use Magic Device roll. Hijinks ensue." The reviewer continued: "The rest of the prestige classes, while they are interesting and fulfill crucial roles, do not make stretch the genre my motor run and the way that the Fang of Lolth does. Yes, the crime-fighting Vigilante, the Robin Hood-ish Outlaw of the Crimson Road, and the swashbuckly Dread Pirate do exactly what a prestige class is meant to do: help to define a setting."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2588&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The British Museum is Falling Down''''' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a [[comic novel]] by British author [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] about a 25-year-old poverty-stricken student of [[English literature]] who, rather than work on his [[thesis]] (entitled "The Structure of Long Sentences in Three Modern English Novels") in the [[British Museum Reading Room|reading room]] of the [[British Museum]], is distracted time and again from his work and who gets into all kinds of trouble instead.

==Summary==
Set in [[Swinging London]], the novel describes one day in the life of Adam Appleby, who lives in constant fear that his wife might be [[pregnancy|pregnant]] again with a fourth child. As [[Catholicism|Catholics]], they are denied any form of [[contraception]] and have to play "[[Natural family planning|Vatican roulette]]" instead. Adam and Barbara have three children: Clare, Dominic, and Edward; their friends ask if they "intend working through the whole alphabet".

In the course of only one busy day several chances to make some money present themselves to Adam. For example, he is offered the opportunity to edit a deceased scholar's unpublished [[manuscript]]s; however, when he eventually has a look at them, he feels uncomfortable, realizing that the man's writings are worthless drivel. Also, at the house in [[Bayswater, London|Bayswater]] where he is supposed to get the papers, Adam has to cope with an assortment of weird characters ranging from [[butcher]]s to a young [[virgin]] intent on seducing him.

Lodge's novel makes extensive use of [[pastiche]], incorporating passages where both the motifs and the styles of writing used by various authors are imitated.  For instance, there is a [[Franz Kafka|Kafkaesque]] scene in which Adam has to renew his ticket for the British Museum Reading Room. The final chapter of the novel is a [[monologue]] by Adam's wife in the style of [[Molly Bloom's soliloquy]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

This use of different styles mirrors [[James Joyce]]'s ''Ulysses'', a work that is also about a single day. When Lodge's novel first came out quite a number of reviewers and critics, not appreciating the literary allusions, found fault with Lodge for his unhomogeneous writing.&lt;ref&gt;David Lodge: "Afterword" (1980). ''The British Museum is Falling Down'' ([[Penguin Books]], 1983), p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States diplomatic cables leak''', widely [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|known as]] '''Cablegate''', began on Sunday, 28 November 2010&lt;ref&gt;Wikileaks [https://wikileaks.org/cablegate.html "Secret US Embassy Cables"]&lt;/ref&gt; when [[WikiLeaks]]—a non-profit organization that publishes submissions from anonymous [[whistleblowers]]—began releasing [[Classified information in the United States|classified]] [[Diplomatic cable|cables]] that had been sent to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] by 274 of its consulates, embassies, and [[diplomatic missions]] around the world. Dated between December 1966 and February 2010, the cables contain diplomatic analysis from world leaders, and the diplomats' assessment of host countries and their officials.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Dylan.

On July 30, 2013, [[Chelsea Manning]] was convicted for theft of the cables and violations of the [[Espionage Act]], in a [[United States v. Manning|court martial proceeding]], and sentenced to 35 years imprisonment. She was released on May 17, 2017, after 7 years total confinement, after her sentence had been commuted by President Obama earlier that year.   

The first document, the so-called [[Contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak (Region — Europe)#Iceland|Reykjavik 13 cable]], was released by WikiLeaks on 18 February 2010, and was followed by the release of State Department profiles of Icelandic politicians a month later.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Steven Lee.

On 28 November, the first 220 cables were published under this agreement by ''[[El País]]'' ([[Spain]]), ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' ([[Germany]]), ''[[Le Monde]]'' ([[France]]), ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[United Kingdom]]) and ''[[The New York Times]]'' ([[United States]]).&lt;ref name=Shane28Nov2010&gt;Shane, Scott and Lehren, Andrew W.

The remaining cables were published in September 2011 after a series of events compromised the security of a WikiLeaks file containing the cables. This included WikiLeaks volunteers placing an encrypted file containing all WikiLeaks data online as "insurance" in July 2010, in case something happened to the organization.&lt;ref name=DBD192&gt;Domscheit-Berg, Daniel. ''Inside WikiLeaks''. Doubleday 2011, pp. 192–195.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011 [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] of ''The Guardian'' published the encryption [[passphrase]] in a book; he had received it from Assange so he could access a copy of the Cablegate file, and believed the passphrase was a temporary one, unique to that file. In August 2011, a German magazine, ''Der Freitag'', published some of these details, enabling others to piece the information together and decrypt the Cablegate files. The cables were then available online, fully unredacted. In response, WikiLeaks decided on 1 September 2011 to publish all 251,287 unedited documents.&lt;ref name="Greenwald2Sep2011"&gt;Greenwald, Glenn.

The publication of the cables was the third in a series of U.S. classified document "mega-leaks" distributed by WikiLeaks in 2010, following the [[Afghan War documents leak]] in July, and the [[Iraq War documents leak]] in October. Over 130,000 of the cables are unclassified, some 100,000 are labeled "confidential", around 15,000 have the higher classification "secret", and none are classified as "top secret" on the [[Classified information in the United States#Levels of classification used by the U.S. government|classification scale]].&lt;ref name=Shane28Nov2010 /&gt; Reactions to the leak in 2010 varied. Western governments expressed strong disapproval, while the material generated intense interest from the public and journalists. Some political leaders referred to Assange as a criminal, while blaming the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] for security lapses. Supporters of Assange referred to him in November 2010 as a key defender of free speech and freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Sanburn, Josh.

In June 2010, the magazine ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' reported that the U.S. State Department and embassy personnel were concerned that [[Chelsea Manning|Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning]], a United States Army soldier charged with the unauthorized download of classified material while stationed in Iraq, had leaked diplomatic cables. WikiLeaks rejected the report as inaccurate: "Allegations in ''Wired'' that we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S. embassy cables are, as far as we can tell, incorrect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Kim Zetter|Zetter, Kim]]; [[Kevin Poulsen|Poulsen, Kevin]]|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/state-department-anxious/|title=State Department Anxious About Possible Leak of Cables to Wikileaks|work=Wired|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer (6 June 2010).

However, during that same month (June 2010), ''The Guardian'' had been offered "half a million military dispatches from the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. There might be more after that, including an immense bundle of confidential diplomatic cables", and [[Alan Rusbridger]], the editor of ''The Guardian'' had contacted [[Bill Keller]], editor of ''The New York Times'', to see if he would be interested in sharing the dissemination of the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Wikileaks-t.html?ref=world |work=The New York Times |first=Bill |last=Keller |title=The Times's Dealings With Julian Assange |date=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning was suspected to have uploaded all that was obtained to WikiLeaks, which chose to release the material in stages so as to have the greatest possible impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.dd19.de/static/html/faq.html |title=Cable Viewer |publisher=wikileaks.dd19.de |accessdate=3 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207094056/http://wikileaks.dd19.de/static/html/faq.html |archivedate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Guardian'', all the diplomatic cables were marked "Sipdis", denoting "secret internet protocol distribution", which means they had been distributed via the closed U.S. [[SIPRNet]], the U.S. Department of Defense's classified version of the civilian internet.&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tisdall, Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-china-reunified-korea|title=Wikileaks Cables Reveal China 'Ready To Abandon North Korea' – Leaked Dispatches Show Beijing Is Frustrated with Military Actions of 'Spoiled Child' and Increasingly Favours Reunified Korea|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 November 2010|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than three million U.S. government personnel and soldiers have access to this network.&lt;ref&gt;Borger, Julian; [[David Leigh (journalist)|Leigh, David]].

{{main article|Contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak}}

The contents of the U.S. diplomatic cables leak describe in detail events and incidents surrounding international affairs from 274 embassies dating from 28 December 1966 to 28 February 2010. The diplomatic cables revealed numerous unguarded comments and revelations: critiques and praises about the host countries of various U.S. embassies, discussion and resolutions towards ending ongoing tension in the Middle East, efforts for and resistance against [[nuclear disarmament]], actions in the [[War on Terror]], assessments of other threats around the world, dealings between various countries, U.S. [[Intelligence (military)|intelligence]] and [[counterintelligence]] efforts, U.S. support of dictatorship and other diplomatic actions.

The leaked cables revealed that diplomats of the U.S. and Britain eavesdropped on [[Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] in the weeks before the U.S.-led [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], in apparent violation of international treaties prohibiting spying at the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Registration required|date=January 2011}} [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29spy.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home "U.S. Expands Role of Diplomats in Spying"].

===September 2011 release of unredacted cables===
In August 2010, Assange gave ''Guardian'' journalist [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] an encryption key and a URL where he could locate the full Cablegate file. In February 2011, shortly before Domscheit-Berg's book appeared, he and [[Luke Harding]], another ''Guardian'' journalist, published ''[[WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy]]'' via Guardian Books. In it, Leigh revealed the encryption key Assange had given him.&lt;ref name=Greenwald2Sep2011/&gt;

The key to the document is: {{code|ACollectionOfDiplomaticHistorySince_1966_ToThe_PresentDay#}}.&lt;ref name=unredacted_us&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/09/unredacted_us_d.html#comments |title=Schneier on Security: Unredacted U.S. Diplomatic WikiLeaks Cables Published |publisher=Schneier.com |date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theatlanticwire&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikileaks Is Suing the Guardian Over a Security Breach |first=Connor |last=Simpson |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2011/08/wikileaks-suing-guardian-over-security-breach/41979/ |newspaper=[[The Atlantic Wire]] |date=31 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64QHvKQPz?url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2011/08/wikileaks-suing-guardian-over-security-breach/41979/ |archivedate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not yet{{when|date=April 2017}} clear how or when the encrypted file itself was released inadvertently. So far it appears that it was released to [[bittorrent]] as part of a mirror file for the WikiLeaks web server&lt;ref name=unredacted_us/&gt; on which it had been placed to aid in transferring the file from WikiLeaks to Leigh, and either not removed due to oversight, or mirrored by other WikiLeaks staff before it could be removed. The password leaked in Leigh's book is not the password for the whole of the "insurance file" which WikiLeaks published in a separate event. It also remains unclear if during the transfer process the file was exposed publicly under the assumption that it is acceptable to transfer an encrypted file in plain sight so long as the key remains secret. {{cn|date=April 2017}}

Their reasoning, according to [[Glenn Greenwald]] in ''Salon'', was that government intelligence agencies were able to find and read the files, while ordinary people-including journalists, whistleblowers, and those directly affected-were not.

According to [[Arbor Networks]], an Internet-analyst group, the DDoS attack accounted for between two and four [[gigabit]]s per second (Gbit/s) of additional traffic to the WikiLeaks host network, compared to an average traffic of between twelve and fifteen Gbit/s under ordinary conditions.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; The attack was slightly more powerful than ordinary DDoS attacks, though well below the maximum of 60 to 100&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s of other major attacks during 2010.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; The attack was claimed to have been carried out by a person by the name of "[[The Jester (hacktivist)|Jester]]", who describes himself as a "[[hacktivism|hacktivist]]". Jester took credit for the attack on Twitter, stating that WikiLeaks "threaten[ed] the lives of our troops and 'other assets'".&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Kevin Poulsen|Poulsen, Kevin]]|title=Cyber Attack Against WikiLeaks Was Weak|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/wikileaks-attack/|work=Wired|accessdate=29 November 2010|date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter / Jester: www.wikileaks.org – TANGO...|url=https://www.twitter.com/th3j35t3r/status/8928679056900096|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=29 November 2010|date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dropping of hosting, finance services, and accessibility===
[[Amazon.com]] removed WikiLeaks from its servers on 1 December 2010 at 19:30 [[GMT]], and the latter website was unreachable until 20:17 GMT when the site had defaulted to its Swedish servers, hosted by [[Bahnhof]].

Official efforts by the U.S. government to limit access to, conversation about, and general spread of the cables leaked by WikiLeaks were revealed by leading media organizations.

In response to perceived federal and [[corporate censorship]] of the cable leaks, internet group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] attacked several of such websites via DDOS attacks. So far, the websites of the Swedish prosecutor, PostFinance (the Swiss post-office banking company), MasterCard and Visa have all been targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |publisher=Yahoo!

===Manipulation of news based on WikiLeaks cables===
On 9 December 2010, major Pakistani newspapers (such as ''[[The News International]]'', ''[[The Express Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Daily Jang]]'') and television channels carried stories that claimed to detail U.S. diplomats' assessments of senior Indian generals as "vain, egotistical and genocidal", also saying "India's government is secretly allied with [[Hindu]] fundamentalists", and that "Indian spies are covertly supporting Islamist militants in Pakistan's tribal belt and [[Balochistan]]."&lt;ref name="fakecab"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Declan|title=Pakistani Media Publish Fake WikiLeaks Cables Attacking India – Comments Alleged To Be from WikiLeaks US Embassy Cables Say Indian Generals Are Genocidal and New Delhi Backs Militants|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/09/pakistani-newspaper-fake-leaks-india|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 December 2010|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the cables revealed any such assessments. The claims were credited to an [[Islamabad]]-based news service agency that frequently ran pro-[[Pakistan Army]] stories.&lt;ref name="fakecab"/&gt;

Later, ''The News International'' admitted the story "was dubious and may have been planted", and ''The Express Tribune'' offered "profuse" apologies to readers.&lt;ref name="pakapol"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Declan|title=WikiLeaks Fake Cables – Pakistani Newspapers Admit They Were Hoaxed – Papers Apologise to Readers for Publishing Anti-Indian Comments Alleged To Have Been Said by US Officials|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/10/wikileaks-fake-cables-pakistan-apologies|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 December 2010|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urdu language|Urdu-language]] papers such as the ''Daily Jang'', however, declined to retract the story.&lt;ref name="pakapol"/&gt;

===Twitter subpoena===
{{Main article|Twitter subpoena}}
On 14 December 2010, a U.S. federal court subpoenaed Twitter for extensive information regarding WikiLeaks, but also put on a [[gagging order]]. The order was said to be part of an "ongoing criminal investigation", and required information regarding the Twitter accounts of WikiLeaks, Assange, Manning, [[Rop Gonggrijp]], [[Jacob Appelbaum]] and [[Birgitta Jonsdottir]]. According to ''[[Salon.com]]'' journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]], the court "gave Twitter three days to respond and barred the company from notifying anyone, including the users, of the existence of the Order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]]|title=DOJ Subpoenas Twitter Records of Several WikiLeaks Volunteers |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/01/07/twitter/index.html |date=7 January 2011 |work=Salon.com |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter requested that it be allowed to notify the users, giving them ten days to object. The court order was unsealed on 5 January 2011, and Jonsdottir decided to publicly fight the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rushe, Dominic|title=Icelandic MP Fights US Demand for Her Twitter Account Details – Birgitta Jonsdottir Brands Efforts by US Justice Department To Access Her Private Information 'Completely Unacceptable'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/08/us-twitter-hand-icelandic-wikileaks-messages |date=8 January 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=11 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tunisian revolution and Arab Spring===
The cable leaks have been pointed to as a catalyst for the [[Tunisian Revolution|2010–2011 Tunisian revolution]] and government overthrow. ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine said, "We might also count Tunisia as the first time that WikiLeaks pushed people over the brink."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The First WikiLeaks Revolution? |first=Elizabeth |last=Dickinson |url=http://wikileaks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/13/wikileaks_and_the_tunisia_protests |newspaper=Foreign Policy |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, ''The New York Times'' said, "The protesters...found grist for the complaints in leaked cables from the United States Embassy in Tunisia, released by WikiLeaks, that detailed the self-dealing and excess of the president's family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tunisia Leader Flees and Prime Minister Claims Power |first=David A. |last=Kirkpatrick |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/world/africa/15tunis.html?_r=2&amp;hp |newspaper=The New York Times |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikileaks Real Impact in Tunisia |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/wikileaks-real-impact-in-tunisia/70339/ |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tunisia: The WikiLeaks connection |first=Ian |last=Black |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/15/tunisia-wikileaks-ghannouchi |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely believed that the Tunisian revolution then spread to other parts of the Middle East, turning into the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/13/amnesty-international-wikileaks-arab-spring Amnesty International hails WikiLeaks and Guardian as Arab spring 'catalysts' | World news].

'''Ware v Johnson''' [1984] 2 NZLR 518 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding where both parties entering into a contract make the same mistake (often referred to as a common mistake) when a contract is formed, under section 6(1)(a)(ii) of the [[Contractual Mistakes Act 1977]].

==Background==
Johnson, a builder by trade, dabbled part-time in converting lifestyle blocks into Kiwifruit orchards, and selling them.

In 1979, he purchased a lifestyle block, planting 1605 kiwifruit vines, and sold the orchard for $365,000 the following year in 1980 to the Wares.

At the time of the purchase, the vines seemed healthy, but the following year the vines growth appeared to be stunted. The Johnsons got several experts to investigate, and were advised that the problem was caused by the application of a weed spray called Krovar and were advised to rip out all the vines, remove 30&amp;nbsp;cm of topsoil, and replant the vines.

When Mr Ware asked Mr Johnson if he has sprayed Krovar on the vines, he denied ever using it. However, during the trial, he admitted he had sprayed it about 10% of the orchard. A neighbor also testified at the trial that Johnson had told he that he had sprayed Krovar there as well.

The Wares eventually sued the Johnsons for the loss.

==Held==
After 23 days in court, the judge ruled that on the balance of probabilities that Johnson did use Krovar on the orchard, thus making Johnson liable for damages for this loss. Pritchard J said "This provision relates to common mistake - where both parties labour under the same mistake. By requiring as a condition of relief that both parties be "influenced in their respective decisions", the Act cannot mean that both parties must be induced by the mistake to enter into the contract". The judge awarded damages for loss of profits of $206,913.42, although the judge reduced this by $48,000 for the interest they owed the Johnsons for a mortgage on the farm.

'''''Zhongyuan Yinyun''''' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:中|中]][[wikt:原|原]][[wikt:音|音]][[wikt:韻|韻]]|s=[[wikt:中|中]][[wikt:原|原]][[wikt:音|音]][[wikt:韵|韵]]|p=Zhōngyuán Yīnyùn}}), literally meaning "Rhymes of the central plain",{{Sfn|Norman|1988|pp=48-50}} is a [[rime book]] from the [[Yuan dynasty]] compiled by Zhou Deqing (周德清) in 1324.{{Sfn|Kaske|2008|p=44}} An important work for the study of [[historical Chinese phonology]], it testifies many phonological changes from [[Middle Chinese]] to [[Old Mandarin]], such as the reduction and disappearance of final [[stop consonant]]s and the reorganization of the [[tonal language|tones]].{{Sfn|Norman|1988|pp=48-50}} Though often termed a "[[rime dictionary]]", the work does not provide meanings for its entries.

==Background==
''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' continued the tradition of ''[[Qieyun]]'' and other rime books. However, due to the phonological changes took place from the [[Sui dynasty]] to the [[Yuan dynasty]], the information needed to be updated in accordance with the then phonological system.

From the middle of the 13th century to the end of the 14th century, [[Beiqu]] (北曲, Northern Verse) underwent quick development. The author of [[Sanqu]], Zhou Deqing, delved into the research on Beiqu, discovering that it created many problems by not adhering to the rules of classical poetic composition. He thought that in order to better develop Beiqu, one would need to make a definite standard, especially in respect to language. According to his own experience, he was able to propose a set of rules for composing and reciting Běiqǔ, which came to be known as ''Zhongyuan Yinyun''.

==Structure==
[[File:Zhongyuan Yinyun 侵尋 rhyme group.png|thumb|right|upright=2|Rhyme group 侵尋 (-im, -əm), divided into four tones]]
In the earlier rime books, characters are first grouped by tone, then by rime. However, in ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'', the selected 5,866 characters, commonly rhymed in songs of the time, are first grouped into 19 rime groups, then further into [[four tones|four tonal groups]]: [[Tone name|ping sheng yin]] (陰平 "feminine level tone"), [[Tone name|ping sheng yang]] (陽平 "masculine level tone"), [[Tone name|shang sheng]] (上聲 "rising tone"), [[Tone name|qu sheng]] (去聲 "departing tone"). The traditional [[entering tone|ru sheng]] (入聲 "entering tone") is assigned to three groups according to contemporary rules in some modern [[Ji-Lu Mandarin]] dialects. This novel way of dividing the traditional four tones is known as "dividing the level tones into ''yin'' and ''yang'', assigning the entering tone to the other three tones" (平分陰陽，入派三聲). 

Within each rime-tonal group, homophonic characters are further grouped together, with each homophonic group separated by an empty circle. As a common character, whose pronunciation every literate person is supposed to know, is used to head each homophonic group, ''[[fanqie]]'' spelling is not employed, as in the earlier rime books, for indicating the pronunciations of the characters. 

Zhou regarded the principal works of the Four Great Yuan Playwrights (元曲四大家 ''Yuanqu si dajia'') as foundational to verse in general; he considered their works to be "rimes joined with nature, words able to connect with the language of the world" (韻共守自然之音，字能通天下之語), and at the same time also distinguished where the playwrights used rimes in non-standard places.

The second half of the ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'', ''Zhèngyǔ Zuòcí Qǐlì'' (正語作詞起例), employs various examples to explain in detail both the rime charts' methods of use as well as issues concerning Beiqu's creation, standards and other aspects.

==Influence==
In respect to contemporaneous and later Beiqu works, ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' has played a very strong guiding role; moreover, many later rhyme works have regarded it as a model on which they based their interpretations.  Up until the flourishing of [[Nanguan music|Nanqu]] ("Southern Verse"), ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' still held a tremendous influence.
