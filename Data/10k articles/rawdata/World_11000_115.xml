[[Image:Asian Highway 7.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of Asian Highway 7]]
'''Asian Highway 7''' ('''AH7''') is a route in the [[Asian Highway Network]]. It runs from [[Yekaterinburg]], Russia to [[Karachi]], Pakistan. All together, it is {{convert|5,868|km|abbr=on}} long. It passes from [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].

The AH7 shares its route between [[Merke]] (Kazakhstan) and [[Kara-Balta]] (Kyrgyzstan) about a hundred kilometers along with the [[AH5]]. In [[Kabul]] (Afghanistan) AH7 stops, but reaches to the city of [[Kandahar]] though [[AH1]], where the AH7 resumes its route towards Pakistan.

According to the manual of the Asian Highway Project in 2002 almost the entire route is paved. Only a distance of 72 km in Kyrgyzstan and a piece of 83 kilometers in Tajikistan are unpaved. As of 2017, the entire route in Kyrgyzstan is paved.

In Pakistan AH7 (N25 - Pakistan Road Networks) enters at Chaman. It passes through Qila Abdullah, Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Khuzdar, Uthal, Goth Hussain and Hub, ending at Karachi. In Pakistan N25 is also called RCD ([[Regional Cooperation for Development]]) Highway.Maintained by National Highway Athuroty

'''"A Man Without Love"''' was the [[United Kingdom|British]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]].

The song is a ballad, with McKellar comparing a man without love and a man with love. He explains that a man without love is "only half a man, this nothing", and a man "with love is everything in life".

For the performance of the song in [[Luxembourg]], McKellar wore the traditional [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[kilt]].

"A Man Without Love" peaked at no. 30 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in March 1966.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

'''Agenda 2000''' was an action programme of the European Union whose main objectives were to reform the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and [[Regional policy of the European Union|Regional policy]], and establish a new financial framework for the years 2000–06 with a view to the then upcoming Eastern [[Enlargement of the European Union]].

Its stated goals were:
# "to update the European Model of Agriculture"
# "to narrow the gaps in wealth and economic prospects between regions "
# "to honour priorities while enjoying only very modest increases in budget income until 2006"

The reforms were first outlined in the documents with the title "Agenda 2000" published by the [[European Commission|Commission]] in July 1997. Reforms were finally agreed by the 15 EU countries at the [[European Council]] meeting in Berlin in March 1999. Detailed legislation was later drafted and agreed to by all of the [[EU institutions]].

[[File:2005net oda.PNG|thumb|600px|A map of official development assistance distribution in 2005.]]

In [[international relations]], '''aid''' (also known as '''international aid''', '''overseas aid''', '''foreign aid''' or '''foreign assistance''') is – from the perspective of governments – a voluntary transfer of [[resources]] from one [[country]] to another.

Aid may serve one or more functions: it may be given as a signal of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] approval, or to strengthen a [[military]] [[Allies|ally]], to reward a [[government]] for behaviour desired by the [[Donation|donor]], to extend the donor's cultural influence, to provide [[infrastructure]] needed by the donor for resource extraction from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of [[commerce|commercial]] access. Countries may provide aid for further  diplomatic reasons. [[Humanitarianism|Humanitarian]] and [[altruism|altruistic]] purposes are at least partly responsible for the giving of aid.{{efn|name=Lancaster, pp. 4–5|Lancaster, pp. 4–5.}}

Aid may be given by individuals, private organizations, or governments. Standards delimiting exactly the types of transfers considered "aid" vary from country to country. For example, the United States government discontinued the reporting of military aid as part of its foreign aid figures in 1958.{{efn|Lancaster, p. 67: "In 1957 the administration (with congressional support) separated economic from military assistance and created a Development Loan Fund (DLF) to provide concessional credits to developing countries world-wide (i.e. not, as in the past, just those in areas of potential conflict with Moscow) to promote their long-term growth."}} The most widely used measure of aid is "[[Official Development Assistance]]" (ODA).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Definitions and purpose==
The [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines its aid measure, Official Development Assistance (ODA), as follows: "ODA consists of flows to developing countries and multilateral institutions provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies, each transaction of which meets the following test: a) it is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective, and b) it is concessional in character and contains a grant element of at least 25% (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/dac-glossary.htm#ODA|title=DAC Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896808.pdf|title=The DAC in Dates, 2006 Edition. Section, "1972".|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foreign aid has increased since the 1950s and 1960s (Isse 129){{Definition needed|date=July 2018}}. The notion that foreign aid increases economic performance and generates economic growth is based on Chenery and Strout's Dual Gap Model (Isse 129). Chenerya and Strout (1966) claimed that foreign aid promotes development by adding to domestic savings as well as to foreign exchange availability, this helping to close either the savings-investment gap or the export-import gap. (Isse 129).

Carol Lancaster defines ''foreign aid'' as "a voluntary transfer of public resources, from a government to another independent government, to an NGO, or to an international organization (such as the World Bank or the UN Development Program) with at least a 25 percent grant element, one goal of which is to better the human condition in the country receiving the aid."{{efn|Carol Lancaster. ''Foreign Aid.'' 2007. p.9.}}

Lancaster also states that for much of the period of her study (World War II to the present) "foreign aid was used for four main purposes: diplomatic [including military/security and political interests abroad], developmental, humanitarian relief and commercial."{{efn|Carol Lancaster.

Most [[official development assistance]] (ODA) comes from the 30 members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/dacmembers.htm#members|title=DAC members - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about $135&amp;nbsp;billion in 2013. A further $15.9&amp;nbsp;billion came from the [[European Commission]] and non-DAC countries gave an additional $9.4&amp;nbsp;billion. Although development aid rose in 2013 to the highest level ever recorded, a trend of a falling share of aid going to the neediest sub-Saharan African countries continued.&lt;ref name=OECD-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Aid to developing countries rebounds in 2013 to reach an all-time high|url=http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/aid-to-developing-countries-rebounds-in-2013-to-reach-an-all-time-high.htm|publisher=OECD|accessdate=18 October 2014|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Top 10 aid donor countries (2013) ===
{{Main|List of development aid country donors}}

Official development assistance (in absolute terms) contributed by the top 10 DAC countries is as follows. [[European Union]] countries together gave $70.73 billion and EU Institutions gave a further $15.93 billion.&lt;ref name=OECD-2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development and cooperation|url=http://europa.eu/pol/dev/index_en.htm|publisher=European Union|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union accumulated a higher portion of GDP as a form of foreign aid than any other economic union.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=New York|year=2014|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York|pages=516–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Union]] countries that are members of the Development Assistance Committee gave 0.42% of GNI (excluding the $15.93 billion given by EU Institutions).&lt;ref name=OECD-2013 /&gt;

==Types==
The type of aid given may be classified according to various factors, including its intended purpose, the terms or conditions (if any) under which it is given, its source, and its level of urgency.

===Intended purpose===
Official aid may be classified by types according to its intended purpose. [[Military aid]] is material or logistical assistance given to strengthen the military capabilities of an [[Allies|ally]] country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/184843895|title=Securing tyrants or fostering reform? : U.S. internal security assistance to repressive and transitioning regimes|date=2006|publisher=RAND Corp|others=Jones, Seth G., 1972-, International Security and Defense Policy Center., Open Society Institute.|isbn=9780833042620|location=Santa Monica, CA|oclc=184843895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanitarian aid]] is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises such as a [[natural disaster]] or a [[man-made disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/data-guides/defining-humanitarian-aid|title=Defining humanitarian assistance|work=Development Initiatives|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms or conditions of receipt===
Aid can also be classified according to the terms agreed upon by the [[Donation|donor]] and receiving countries. In this classification, aid can be a [[gift]], a [[Grant (money)|grant]], a low or no interest loan, or a combination of these. The terms of foreign aid are oftentimes influenced by the motives of the giver: a sign of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] approval, to reward a [[government]] for behaviour desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to enhance [[infrastructure]] needed by the donor for the extraction of resources from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of [[commerce|commercial]] access.{{efn|name=Lancaster, pp. 4–5}}

===Sources===
Aid can also be classified according to its source. While government aid is generally called foreign aid, aid that originates in institutions of a religious nature is often termed [[faith-based foreign aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2006-10-08|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/08/bush_brings_faith_to_foreign_aid/?page=2|title=Bush brings faith to foreign aid|work=Boston.com|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aid from various sources can reach recipients through bilateral or multilateral delivery systems. "Bilateral" refers to government to government transfers. "Multilateral" institutions, such as the World Bank or [[UNICEF]], pool aid from one or more sources and disperse it among many recipients.

International aid in the form of gifts by individuals or businesses (aka, "private giving") are generally administered by [[charities]] or [[philanthropic organization]]s who batch them and then channel these to the recipient country.

===Urgency===
Aid may be also classified based on urgency into emergency aid and development aid. Emergency aid is rapid assistance given to a people in immediate distress by individuals, organizations, or governments to relieve suffering, during and after man-made emergencies (like [[war]]s) and [[natural disaster]]s. The term often carries an international connotation, but this is not always the case. It is often distinguished from [[development aid]] by being focused on relieving suffering caused by natural disaster or conflict, rather than removing the root causes of poverty or vulnerability. Development aid is aid given to support development in general which can be [[economic development]] or social development in [[developing countries]]. It is distinguished from [[humanitarian aid]] as being aimed at alleviating poverty in the long term, rather than alleviating suffering in the short term.

====Emergency aid====
[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Humanitarian aid in Rajan Kala, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|250px|U.S. soldiers unload humanitarian aid for distribution to the town of Rajan Kala, Afghanistan, 5 December 2009]] The provision of emergency humanitarian aid consists of the provision of vital services (such as food aid to prevent [[starvation]]) by aid agencies, and the provision of funding or in-kind services (like logistics or transport), usually through aid agencies or the government of the affected country. Humanitarian aid is distinguished from [[humanitarian intervention]], which involves armed forces protecting civilians from violent oppression or [[genocide]] by state-supported actors.

The United Nations [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) is mandated to coordinate the international humanitarian response to a natural disaster or complex emergency acting on the basis of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182|title=A/RES/46/182 - E|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Geneva Conventions]] give a mandate to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Committee of the Red Cross]] and other impartial humanitarian organizations to provide assistance and protection of civilians during times of war.  The ICRC, has been given a special role by the [[Geneva Conventions]] with respect to the visiting and monitoring of prisoners of war.

====Development aid====

Development aid is given by governments through individual countries' [[international aid agencies]] and through [[multilateralism|multilateral]] institutions such as the [[World Bank]], and by individuals through [[:Category:Development charities|development charities]]. For donor nations, development aid also has strategic value;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.borgenmagazine.com/10-accomplishments-us-foreign-aid/|title=10 Accomplishments of U.S. Foreign Aid - BORGEN|date=2013-10-09|work=BORGEN|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved living conditions can positively effects global security and economic growth. [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) is a commonly used measure of developmental aid.

===Intended use===
Aid given is generally intended for use by a specific end. From this perspective it may be called: 
* Project aid: Aid given for a specific purpose; e.g. building materials for a new school.
* Programme aid: Aid given for a specific sector; e.g. funding of the education sector of a country.
** [[Budget support]]: A form of Programme Aid that is directly channelled into the financial system of the recipient country.
* Sector-wide Approaches (SWAPs): A combination of Project aid and Programme aid/Budget Support; e.g.  support for the education sector in a country will include both funding of education projects (like school buildings) and provide funds to maintain them (like school books).
* [[Technical assistance]]: Aid involving highly educated or trained personnel, such as doctors, who are moved into a developing country to assist with a program of development. Can be both programme and project aid.
* Food aid: Food is given to countries in urgent need of food supplies, especially if they have just experienced a natural disaster. Food aid can be provided by importing food from the donor, buying food locally, or providing cash.
* [[Medical research|International research]], such as research that used for the [[green revolution]] or [[vaccine]]s.

==Official development assistance==
{{Main|Official development assistance}}

Official development assistance (ODA) is a term coined by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) to measure aid. ODA refers to aid from national governments for promoting economic development and welfare in low and middle income countries. ODA can be bilateral or multilateral. This aid is given as either [[grant (money)|grants]], where no repayment is required, or as concessional [[loan]]s, where interest rates are lower than market rates.{{efn|name=Table 1 p. 13|Lancaster uses either ODA or ODA plus OA ("Official Assistance" – another DAC government-aid category) as her main statistic. She considers it better to add the OA but very often just uses the ODA figure alone; e.g., for Table 1.1 (p. 13), Table 2.2 (p. 39) and Table 2.3 (p. 43). In any case the difference is now moot since the DAC recently merged the two categories.}}

Loan repayments to multilateral institutions are pooled and redistributed as new loans. Additionally, debt relief, partial or total cancellation of loan repayments, is often added to total aid numbers even though it is not an actual transfer of funds. It is compiled by the Development Assistance Committee. The [[United Nations]], the [[World Bank]], and many [[scholar]]s use the DAC's ODA figure as their main aid figure because it is easily available and reasonably consistently calculated over time and between countries.{{efn|name=Table 1 p. 13}} The DAC classifies aid in three categories:
* [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA): Development aid provided to [[developing countries]] (on the "Part I" list) and [[international organizations]] with the clear aim of [[economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official development assistance – definition and coverage|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm|publisher=OECD|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Official Aid'' (OD): Development aid provided to developed countries (on the "Part II" list).
* ''Other Official Flows'' (OOF): Aid which does not fall into the other two categories, either because it is not aimed at development, or it consists of more than 75% loan (rather than grant).

Aid is often ''pledged'' at one point in time, but ''disbursements'' (financial transfers) might not arrive until later.

In 2009, [[South Korea]] became the first major recipient of ODA from the [[OECD]] to turn into a major donor. The country now provides over $1 billion in aid annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2011/11/30/giving-foreign-aid-helps-korea/|title=Giving Foreign Aid Helps Korea - The Asia Foundation|date=30 November 2011|website=asiafoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Not included as international aid==
Most monetary flows between nations are not counted as aid. These include market-based flows such as [[foreign direct investment]]s and [[portfolio investment]]s, [[remittance]]s from [[migrant worker]]s to their families in their home countries, and [[military aid]]. In 2009, aid in the form of remittances by migrant workers in the [[United States]] to their international families was twice as large as that country's humanitarian aid.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=894664&amp;story_id=14586906|title=Migration and development: The aid workers who really help|publisher=economist.com|accessdate=2012-01-16|date=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The World Bank]] reported that, worldwide, foreign workers sent $328 billion from richer to poorer countries in 2008, over twice as much as official aid flows from OECD members.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; The United States does not count military aid in its foreign aid figures.

==Improving aid effectiveness==
{{Further|Aid effectiveness}}
The [[Aid effectiveness#Historical background|High Level Forum]] is a gathering of aid officials and representatives of donor and recipient countries. Its [[Aid effectiveness#Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, February 2005|Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]] outlines rules to improve the quality of aid.

===Conditionalities===
{{Main|Conditionality}}
{{See also|Tied aid}}
A major proportion of aid from donor nations is [[tied aid|tied]], mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the donor country.

The [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], as primary holders of developing countries' debt, attach [[structural adjustment]] [[Conditionality|conditionalities]] to loans which generally include the elimination of state subsidies and  the [[privatization]] of [[state services]]. For example, the [[World Bank]] presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for [[fertilizer]] even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices.&lt;ref name=Malawi&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html|title=Ending famine simply by ignoring the experts|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Celia W.|last=Dugger|date=2007-12-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511212026/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html| archivedate= 11 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Malawi]], almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=Malawi/&gt; In the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states, the reconfiguration of public financing in their [[transition economy|transition to a market economy]] called for reduced spending on health and education, sharply increasing poverty.&lt;ref name=Soviet&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0D8163FF931A25753C1A9669C8B63|title=Study Finds Poverty Deepening in Former Communist Countries|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-28|date=2000-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Transition: The First Ten Years – Analysis and Lessons for Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union'', The World Bank, Washington, DC, 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm|title=Child poverty soars in eastern Europe|publisher=BBC News|date=2000-10-11|accessdate=2011-05-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110512034826/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm| archivedate= 12 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their April 2002 publication, Oxfarm Report reveals that aid tied to trade Liberalization by the donor countries such as the European Union with the aim of achieving economic objective is becoming detrimental to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/bp22_eutrade.htm|title=Oxfam - Trade - Europe's Double Standards|date=April 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003013638/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/bp22_eutrade.htm|archivedate=2003-10-03|deadurl=yes|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the EU subsidizes its agricultural sectors in the expense of Latin America who must liberalize trade in order to qualify for aid. Latin America, a country with a comparative advantage on agriculture and a great reliance on its agricultural export sector, loses $4 billion annually due to EU farming subsidy policies. Carlos Santiso advocates a "radical approach in which donors cede control to the recipient country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santiso|first=Carlos|date=Fall 2001|title=Good Governance and Aid Effectiveness: The World Bank and Conditionality|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Santiso/publication/228959367_Good_Governance_and_Aid_Effectiveness_The_World_Bank_and_Conditionality/links/0046353c3507f03aa9000000.pdf|journal=The Georgetown Public Policy Review|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cash aid versus in-kind aid===
A report by a High Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers found that only 6% of aid is delivered in the form of cash or vouchers.&lt;ref name=cashpanel&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/9876-cash-transfers-humanitarian-vouchers-aid-emergencies|title=Doing cash differently: how cash transfers can transform humanitarian aid|website=ODI}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there is a growing realization among aid groups that, for locally available goods, giving cash or cash vouchers instead of imported goods is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver aid.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: Give cash, not food?|date=4 June 2008|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence shows that cash can be more transparent, more accountable, more cost effective, help support local markets and economies, and increase financial inclusion and give people more digity and choice.&lt;ref name=cashpanel/&gt; Sending cash is cheaper as it does not have the same transaction costs as shipping goods. Sending cash is also faster than shipping the goods. In 2009 for sub-Saharan Africa, food bought locally by the WFP cost 34 percent less and arrived 100 days faster than food sent from the United States, where buying food from the United States is required by law.&lt;ref name=fixes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/when-food-isnt-the-answer-to-hunger/|title=When food isn't the answer to hunger|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=24 April 2013|first=Tina|last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cash aid also helps local food producers, usually the poorest in their countries, while imported food may damage their livelihoods and risk continuing hunger in the future.&lt;ref name=fixes/&gt;

The [[World Food Program]] (WFP), the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|website=wfp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coordination ===
While the number of Non-governmental Organization have increased dramatically over the past few decades, fragmentation in aid policy is an issue.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; Because of such fragmentation, health workers in several African countries, for example, say they are so busy meeting western delegates that they can only do their proper jobs in the evening.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

One of the Paris Declaration's priorities is to reduce systems of aid that are "parallel" to local systems.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; For example, [[Oxfam]] reported that, in Mozambique, donors are spending $350 million a year on 3,500 technical consultants, which is enough to hire 400,000 local civil servants, weakening local capacity.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;  Between 2005 and 2007, the number of parallel systems did fall, by about 10% in 33 countries.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; In order to improve coordination and reduce parallel systems, the Paris Declaration suggests that aid recipient countries lay down a set of national development priorities and that aid donors fit in with those plans.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

===Aid priorities===
Laurie Garret,  author of the article "The Challenge of Global Health" points out that the current aid and resources are being targeted at very specific, high-profile diseases, rather than at general public health.  Aid is "stovepiped" towards narrow, short-term goals relating to particular programs or diseases such as increasing the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatment, and increasing distribution of bed nets. These are band aid solutions to larger problems, as it takes healthcare systems and infrastructure to create significant change.  Donors lack the understanding that effort should be focused on broader measures that affect general well being of the population, and substantial change will take generations to achieve. Aid often does not provide maximum benefit to the recipient, and reflects the interests of the donor.&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=86|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, consider the breakdown, where aid goes and for what purposes.  In 2002, total gross foreign aid to all developing countries was $76 billion.  Dollars that do not contribute to a country's ability to support basic needs interventions are subtracted.  Subtract $6 billion for debt relief grants. Subtract $11 billion, which is the amount developing countries paid to developed nations in that year in the form of loan repayments.  Next, subtract the aid given to middle income countries, $16 billion.  The remainder, $43 billion, is the amount that developing countries received in 2002.  But only $12 billion went to low-income countries in a form that could be deemed budget support for basic needs.&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt; When aid is given to the [[Least Developed Countries]] who have good governments and strategic plans for the aid, it is thought that it is more effective.&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt;

===Logistics===
[[Humanitarian aid]] is argued to often not reach those who are intended to receive it. For example, a report composed by the World Bank in 2006 stated that an estimated half of the funds donated towards health programs in sub-Saharan Africa did not reach the clinics and hospitals. Money is paid out to fake accounts, prices are increased for transport or warehousing, and drugs are sold to the black market. Another example is in Ghana, where approximately 80% of donations do not go towards their intended purposes. This type of corruption only adds to the criticism of aid, as it is not helping those who need it, and may be adding to the problem.&lt;ref name="Garrett"/&gt; Only about one fifth of U.S. aid goes to countries classified by the OECD as ‘least developed.’&lt;ref name="Singer"/&gt; This "pro-rich" trend is not unique to the United States.&lt;ref name="Sachs"&gt;Sachs, Jeffrey D. 2005. The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;Singer, Peter. 2009. [[The Life You Can Save]]. New York:Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Collier, "the middle income countries get aid because they are of much more commercial and political interest than the tiny markets and powerlessness of the bottom billion."&lt;ref name="Collier"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyKIteKMNXUC|title=The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It|last=Collier|first=Paul|date=2007-05-25|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199740949|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that, at the most basic level, aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty.&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singer"/&gt;

The logistics in which the delivery of humanitarian occurs can be problematic. For example, an earthquake in 2003 in [[Bam, Iran]] left tens of thousands of people in need of disaster zone aid. Although aid was flown in rapidly, regional belief systems, cultural backgrounds and even language seemed to have been omitted as a source of concern. Items such as religiously prohibited pork, and non-generic forms of medicine that lacked multilingual instructions came flooding in as relief. An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing more problems than it solves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habibzadeh|first=Farrokh|last2=Yadollahie|first2=Mahboobeh|last3=Kucheki|first3=Maryam|date=August 2008|title=International aid in disaster zones: help or headache?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673608611575|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|issue=9636|pages=374|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61157-5|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering transparency, the amount of aid that is recorded accurately has risen from 42% in 2005 to 48% in 2007.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

===Improving the economic efficiency of aid===
Currently, donor institutions make proposals for aid packages to recipient countries.  The recipient countries then make a plan for how to use the aid based on how much money has been given to them.  Alternatively, [[Non-governmental organizations|NGO]]'s receive funding from private sources or the government and then implement plans to address their specific issues. According to Sachs, in the view of some scholars, this system is inherently ineffective.&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt;

According to Sachs, we should redefine how we think of aid.  The first step should be to learn what developing countries hope to accomplish and how much money they need to accomplish those goals.  Goals should be made with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in mind for these furnish real metrics for providing basic needs.  The "actual transfer of funds must be based on rigorous, country-specific plans that are developed through open and consultative processes, backed by [[good governance]] in the recipient countries, as well as careful planning and evaluation."&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt;

Possibilities are also emerging as some developing countries are experiencing rapid economic growth, they are able to provide their own expertise gained from their recent transition. This knowledge transfer can be seen in donors, such as Brazil, whose $1 billion in aid outstrips that of many traditional donors.&lt;ref name="ODI1"&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Lidia Cabral|author2=Julia Weinstock|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/5120-brazil-emerging-aid-player|title=Brazil: an emerging aid player|date=October 2010|website=ODI|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil provides most of its aid in the form of technical expertise and knowledge transfers.&lt;ref name="ODI1"/&gt; This has been described by some observers as a 'global model in waiting'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cabral|first=Lidia|date=2010-07-21|url=https://www.odi.org/comment/4952-brazils-development-cooperation-south-global-model-waiting|title=Brazil’s development cooperation with the South: a global model in waiting|work=ODI|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
A very wide range of interpretations are in play ranging from the argument that foreign aid has been a primary driver of development, to a complete waste of money. A middle of the road viewpoint is that aid has shown modest favorable impacts in some areas especially regarding health indicators, agriculture, disaster relief, and post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zdCgAAQBAJ|title=The Great Surge: The Ascent of the Developing World|last=Radelet|first=Steven|date=2015-11-10|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781476764788|language=en|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical studies have produced widely differing assessments of the correlation between aid and economic growth, and no firm consensus has emerged to suggest that foreign aid generally does boost growth. Some studies find a positive correlation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Juselius|first=Katarina|last2=Møller|first2=Niels Framroze|last3=Tarp|first3=Finn|date=2013-01-07|title=The Long-Run Impact of Foreign Aid in 36 African Countries: Insights from Multivariate Time Series Analysis*|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.12012|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|language=en|volume=76|issue=2|pages=153–184|doi=10.1111/obes.12012|issn=0305-9049}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others find either no correlation or a negative correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/foreign-aid-and-growth-new-evidence|title=Does foreign aid affect growth?|last=Dreher|first=Axel|last2=Eichenauer|first2=Vera|date=2015-10-18|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-05-28|last3=Gehring|first3=Kai|last4=Langlotz|first4=Sarah|last5=Lohmann|first5=Steffen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Africa, Asante (1985) gives the following assessment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Summing up the experience of African countries both at the national and at the regional levels it is no exaggeration to suggest that, on balance, foreign assistance, especially foreign capitalism, has been somewhat deleterious to African development. It must be admitted, however, that the pattern of development is complex and the effect upon it of foreign assistance is still not clearly determined. But the limited evidence available suggests that the forms in which foreign resources have been extended to Africa over the past twenty-five years, insofar as they are concerned with economic development, are, to a great extent, counterproductive.{{efn|Asante, p. 265}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peter Singer]] argues that over the last three decades, "aid has added around one percentage point to the annual growth rate of the bottom billion." He argues that this has made the difference between "stagnation and severe cumulative decline."&lt;ref name="Singer"/&gt;  Aid can make progress towards reducing poverty worldwide, or at least help prevent cumulative decline. Despite the intense criticism on aid, there are some promising numbers. In 1990, approximately 43 percent of the world's population was living on less than $1.25 a day and has dropped to about 16 percent in 2008. Maternal deaths have dropped from 543,000 in 1990 to 287,000 in 2010. Under-five mortality rates have also dropped, from 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Provost|first=Claire|title=Millennium Development Goals – The Key Datasets You Need to Know|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/31/millennium-development-goals-key-datasets.|accessdate=1 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these numbers alone sound promising, there is a gray overcast: many of these numbers actually are falling short of the Millennium Development Goals. There are only a few goals that have already been met or projected to be met by the 2015 deadline.

The economist [[William Easterly]] and others have argued that aid can often distort incentives in poor countries in various harmful ways. Aid can also involve inflows of money to poor countries that have some similarities to inflows of money from natural resources that provoke the [[resource curse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Paul|date=September 2006|title=Is Aid Oil?

[[James Shikwati]], a [[Kenya]]n economist, has argued that foreign aid causes harm to the recipient nations, specifically because aid is distributed by local politicians, finances the creation of corrupt government such as that led by Dr Fredrick Chiluba in Zambia bureaucracies, and hollows out the local economy.  In an interview in Germany's ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine, Shikwati uses the example of food aid delivered to Kenya in the form of a shipment of [[maize|corn]] from America. Portions of the corn may be diverted by corrupt politicians to their own tribes, or sold on the black market at prices that undercut local food producers. Similarly, Kenyan recipients of donated Western clothing will not buy clothing from local tailors, putting the tailors out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/spiegel-interview-with-african-economics-expert-for-god-s-sake-please-stop-the-aid-a-363663.html|title=SPIEGEL Interview with African Economics Expert: "For God's Sake, Please Stop the Aid!"|date=2005-07-04|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an episode of ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'', [[John Stossel]] demonstrated the existence of secret government bank accounts which concealed foreign aid money destined for private purposes.

Some believe that aid is offset by other economic programs such as [[agricultural subsidies]]. [[Mark Malloch Brown]], former head of the United Nations Development Program, estimated that farm subsidies cost poor countries about US$50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the extraordinary distortion of global trade, where the West spends $360 billion a year on protecting its agriculture with a network of subsidies and tariffs that costs developing countries about US$50 billion in potential lost agricultural exports. Fifty billion dollars is the equivalent of today's level of development assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2002/november/mmb-uganda.en;jsessionid=axbWzt8vXD9|title=Mark Malloch Brown at Makerere University in Uganda|date=2002-11-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727194456/http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2002/november/mmb-uganda.en;jsessionid=axbWzt8vXD9|archivedate=2009-07-27|deadurl=yes|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/opinion/farm-subsidies-that-kill.html|title=Farm Subsidies That Kill|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=2002-07-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some have argued that the major international aid organizations have formed an aid [[cartel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|date=2002|title=The cartel of good intentions: The problem of bureaucracy in foreign aid|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafjpolrf/v_3a5_3ay_3a2002_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a223-250.htm|journal=Journal of Economic Policy Reform|volume=5|issue=131|pages=40–49|issn=0015-7228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to aid critics, a movement to reform U.S. foreign aid has started to gain momentum. In the United States, leaders of this movement include the [[Center for Global Development]], [[Oxfam America]], the [[Brookings Institution]], [[InterAction]], and [[Bread for the World]]. The various organizations have united to call for a new [[Foreign Assistance Act]], a national development strategy, and a new cabinet-level department for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/10968.html|title=Coalition seeks cabinet-level foreign aid|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, a spoof charity music video was produced by a South African rapper named Breezy V. The video "Africa for Norway" was a parody of Western charity initiatives like Band Aid which, he felt, exclusively encouraged small donations to starving children, creating a stereotypically negative view of the continent.&lt;ref name=ALLAF&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201211220381.html?aa_source=acrdn-f0| title= Africa: Why Are Africans for Norway?| year =  2012| publisher = [[AllAfrica.com]]| publication-place = [[Africa]]| accessdate = 28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aid in his opinion should be about funding initiatives and projects with emotional motivation as well as money. The parody video shows Africans getting together to campaign for Norwegian people suffering from frostbite by supplying them with unwanted radiators.&lt;ref name=ALLAF/&gt;

=== Unintended consequences ===
Some of the unintended effects include labor and production [[disincentive]]s, changes in recipients’ food consumption patterns and natural resources use patterns, distortion of social safety nets, distortion of [[NGO]] operational activities, price changes, and trade displacement. These issues arise from targeting inefficacy and poor timing of aid programs. [[Food aid]] can harm producers by driving down prices of local products, whereas the producers are not themselves beneficiaries of food aid. Unintentional harm occurs when food aid arrives or is purchased at the wrong time, when food aid distribution is not well-targeted to food-insecure households, and when the local market is relatively poorly integrated with broader national, regional and global markets. The use of food aid for emergencies can reduce the unintended consequences, although it can contribute to other associated with the use of food as a weapon or prolonging or intensifying the duration of [[Civil war|civil conflicts]].

==== Increasing conflict duration ====
[[International aid agencies|International aid organizations]] identify theft by armed forces on the ground as a primary unintended consequence through which food aid and other types of humanitarian aid promote conflict. Food aid usually has to be transported across large geographic territories and during the transportation it becomes a target for armed forces, especially in countries where the ruling government has limited control outside of the capital. Accounts from [[Somalia]] in the early 1990s indicate that between 20 and 80 percent of all food aid was stolen, looted, or confiscated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nunn, Nathan, and Nancy Qian. “US Food Aid and Civil Conflict.” ''American Economic Review'', vol. 104, no. 6, 2014, pp. 1630–1666., doi:10.1257/aer.104.6.1630.&lt;/ref&gt; In the former [[Yugoslavia]], the [[UN refugee agency|UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)]] lost up to 30 percent of the total value of aid to Serbian armed forces. On top of that 30 percent, bribes were given to [[Croatia]]n forces to pass their roadblocks in order to reach [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNdZnPXsKN4C|title=The Crisis Caravan: What's Wrong with Humanitarian Aid?|last=Polman|first=Linda|date=2010-09-14|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=9781429955768|language=en|pages=96–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the stolen or lost provisions can exceed the value of the food aid alone since convoy vehicles and telecommunication equipment are also stolen. MSF Holland, international aid organization operating in [[Chad]] and [[Darfur]], underscored the strategic importance of these goods, stating that these “vehicles and communications equipment have a value beyond their monetary worth for armed actors, increasing their capacity to wage war”&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A famous instance of humanitarian aid unintentionally helping rebel groups occurred during the Nigeria-Biafra civil war in the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kbaFEhuIXkC|title=Empire of Humanity: A History of Humanitarianism|last=Barnett|first=Michael|date=2011-03-03|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=080146109X|language=en|pages=133–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the rebel leader [[C. Odumegwu Ojukwu|Odumegwu Ojukwu]] only allowed aid to enter the region of [[Biafra]] if it was shipped on his planes. These shipments of humanitarian aid helped the rebel leader to circumvent the siege on Biafra placed by the Nigerian government. These stolen shipments of humanitarian aid caused the Biafran civil war to last years longer than it would have without the aid, claim experts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The most well-known instances of aid being seized by local warlords in recent years come from [[Somalia]], where food aid is funneled to the Shabab, a Somali militant group that controls much of Southern Somalia. Moreover, reports reveal that Somali contractors for aid agencies have formed a cartel and act as important power brokers, arming opposition groups with the profits made from the stolen aid”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/report-monitoring-group-somalia-pursuant-security-council-resolution-1853-2008|title=Report of the Monitoring Group on Somalia pursuant to Security Council resolution 1853 (2008) (S/2010/91)|work=United Nations Security Council|date=2010-03-10|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rwanda]]n government appropriation of food aid in the early 1990s was so problematic that aid shipments were canceled multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co01kZctL5sC|title=Aiding Violence: The Development Enterprise in Rwanda|last=Uvin|first=Peter|date=1998|publisher=Kumarian Press|isbn=9781565490833|language=en|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zimbabwe]] in 2003, [[Human Rights Watch]] documented examples of residents being forced to display [[ZANU–PF|ZANU-PF]] Party membership cards before being given government food aid.&lt;ref&gt;Thurow, Roger, and Scott Kilman. 2009. Enough: Why the World’s Poorest Starve in an Age of Plenty. New York: PublicAffairs. (pp.206)&lt;/ref&gt;  In eastern [[Zaire]], leaders of the [[Hema people|Hema]] ethnic group allowed the arrival of international aid organizations only upon agreement not give aid to the Lendu (opposition of Hema). Humanitarian aid workers have acknowledged the threat of stolen aid and have developed strategies for minimizing the amount of theft en route. However, aid can fuel conflict even if successfully delivered to the intended population as the recipient populations often include members of [[rebel groups]] or [[militia groups]], or aid is “taxed” by such groups.

Academic research emphatically demonstrates that on average food aid promotes civil conflict. Namely, increase in [[US aid|US food aid]] leads to an increase in the incidence of armed civil conflict in the recipient country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another correlation demonstrated is food aid prolonging existing conflicts, specifically among countries with a recent history of civil conflict. However, it is important to note that this does not find an effect on conflict in countries without a recent history of civil conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, different types of international aid other than food which is easily stolen during its delivery, namely technical assistance and cash transfers, can have different effects on civil conflict.

[[Community-driven development|Community-driven development (CDD) programs]] have become one of the most popular tools for delivering development aid. In 2012, the [[World Bank]] supported 400 CDD programs in 94 countries, valued at $30 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Susan|first=Wong,|date=2012-03-01|title=What have been the impacts of World Bank Community-Driven Development Programs?

After the program’s start, some municipalities experienced and statistically significant and large increase in casualties, as compared to other municipalities who were not part of the CDD. Casualties suffered by government forces as a result of insurgent-initiated attacks increased significantly.

These results are consistent with other examples of humanitarian aid exacerbating civil conflict.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One explanation is that insurgents attempt to sabotage CDD programs for political reasons – successful implementation of a government-supported project could weaken the insurgents’ position. Related findings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beath,Andrew|last2=Christia,Fotini|last3=Enikolopov,Ruben|date=2012-07-01|title=Winning hearts and minds through development ? evidence from a field experiment in Afghanistan|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/455111467989984735/Winning-hearts-and-minds-through-development-evidence-from-a-field-experiment-in-Afghanistan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Beath, Christia, and Enikolopov further demonstrate that a successful community-driven development program increased support for the government in Afghanistan by exacerbating conflict in the short term, revealing an unintended consequence of the aid.

==== Dependency and other economic effects ====
One of the economic cases against aid transfers, in the form of food or other resources, is that it discourages recipients from working, everything else held constant.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Christopher B.|date=2006-03-01|title=Food Aid's Intended and Unintended Consequences|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1142286|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1142286}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim undermines the support for transfers, as heated debates over the past decade about domestic welfare programs in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] show. Targeting errors of inclusion are said to magnify the [[labor market]] disincentive effects inherent to food aid (or any other form of transfer) by providing benefits to those who are most able and willing to turn transfers into leisure instead of increased food consumption.

Labor distortion can arise when [[National Food For Work Programme|Food-For-Work (FFW) Programs]] are more attractive than work on recipients’ own farms/businesses, either because the FFW pays immediately, or because the household considers the payoffs to the FFW project to be higher than the returns to labor on its own plots. Food aid programs hence take productive inputs away from local private production, creating a distortion due to substitution effects, rather than income effects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Beyond labor [[Disincentive|disincentive effects,]] food aid can have the unintended consequence of discouraging household-level production. Poor timing of aid and FFW wages that are above market rates cause negative dependency by diverting labor from local private uses, particularly if FFW obligations decrease labor on a household's own enterprises during a critical part of the production cycle.This type of disincentive impacts not only food aid recipients but also producers who sell to areas receiving food aid flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ozc1AAAAIAAJ|title=Against the grain: the dilemma of project food aid|last=Jackson|first=Tony|last2=Eade|first2=Deborah|date=1982|publisher=OXFAM|isbn=9780855980634|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skW5AAAAIAAJ|title=Feeding dependency, starving democracy: USAID policies in Haiti|last=Richardson|first=Laurie|last2=International|first2=Grassroots|date=1997|publisher=Grassroots International|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJ3mswEACAAJ|title=Food First: Beyond the Myth of Scarcity|last=Lappé|first=Frances Moore|last2=Collins|first2=Joseph|last3=Fowler|first3=Cary|date=1979|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=9780345251503|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPw9AAAAYAAJ|title=Politics of food aid: case of Bangladesh|last=Molla|first=Md Gyasuddin|date=1990|publisher=Academic Publishers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Development Sustainability and Eliminating Food Aid Dependency: Lessons from the World Food Programme|last=Salisbury|first=L.N.|publisher=Cornell University|year=1992|location=Ithica, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FFW programs are often used to counter a perceived dependency syndrome associated with freely distributed food.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, poorly designed FFW programs may cause more risk of harming local production than the benefits of free food distribution. In structurally weak economies, FFW program design is not as simple as determining the appropriate wage rate. Empirical evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Christopher B.|last2=Clay|first2=Daniel C.|date=2003-06-01|title=Self-Targeting Accuracy in the Presence of Imperfect Factor Markets: Evidence from Food-for-Work in Ethiopia|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1847703|journal=Journal of Development Studies|volume=39|issue=5|pages=152–180|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; from rural [[Ethiopia]] shows that higher-income households had excess labor and thus lower (not higher as expected) value of time, and therefore allocated this labor to FFW schemes in which poorer households could not afford to participate due to labor scarcity. Similarly, FFW programs in [[Cambodia]] have shown to be an additional, not alternative, source of employment and that the very poor rarely participate due to labor constraints.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Christopher B.|date=January 2001|title=Does Food Aid Stabilize Food Availability?|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/452505|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|language=en|volume=49|issue=2|pages=335–349|doi=10.1086/452505|issn=0013-0079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, food aid can drive down local or national food prices in at least three ways.

#First, [[Monetization of U.S. in-kind food aid|monetization]] of food aid can flood the market, increasing [[Supply and demand|supply]]. In order to be granted the right to monetize, operational agencies must demonstrate that the recipient country has adequate storage facilities and that the monetized [[commodity]] will not result in a substantial disincentive in either domestic agriculture or domestic marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=P.L. 480 Title II Cooperating Sponsor Monetization Manual|last=Ralyea|first=B.|author2=Food Aid Management Monetization Working Group|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Second, households receiving aid may decrease demand for the [[commodity]] received or for locally produced [[Substitute good|substitutes]] or, if they produce substitutes or the commodity received, they may sell more of it. This can be most easily understood by dividing a population in a food aid recipient area into subpopulations based on two criteria: whether or not they receive food aid (recipients vs. non-recipients) and whether they are net sellers or net buyers of food. Because the price they receive for their output is lower, however, net sellers are unambiguously worse off if they do not receive food aid or some other form of compensatory transfer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Finally, recipients may sell food aid to purchase other necessities or [[Complement (economics)|complements]], driving down prices of the food aid commodity and its substitutes, but also increasing demand for complements. Most recipient economies are not robust and food aid inflows can cause large price decreases, decreasing producer profits, limiting producers’ abilities to pay off debts and thereby diminishing both capacity and incentives to invest in improving agricultural productivity. However, food aid distributed directly or through FFW programs to households in northern [[Kenya]] during the lean season can foster increased purchase of agricultural inputs such as improved seeds, [[fertilizer]] and hired labor, thereby increasing [[agricultural productivity]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bezuneh|first=Mesfin|last2=Deaton|first2=Brady J.|last3=Norton|first3=George W.|date=1988-02-01|title=Food Aid Impacts in Rural Kenya|url=https://academic.oup.com/ajae/article/70/1/181/78423|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=181–191|doi=10.2307/1241988|issn=0002-9092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Changed consumption patterns ====
Food aid that is relatively inappropriate to local uses can distort consumption patterns.

Food aid is usually exported from [[temperate climate]] zones and is often different than the staple crops grown in recipient countries, which usually have a [[tropical climate]]. The logic of food export inherently entails some effort to change consumers’ preferences, to introduce recipients to new foods and thereby stimulate demand for foods with which recipients were previously unfamiliar or which otherwise represent only a small portion of their diet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Massive shipments of wheat and rice into the [[Sahel|West African Sahel]] during the food crises of the mid-1970s and mid-1980s were widely believed to stimulate a shift in consumer demand from indigenous coarse grains – [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] – to western crops such as [[wheat]]. During the 2000 drought in northern [[Kenya]], the price of [[changaa]] (a locally distilled alcohol) fell significantly and consumption seems to have increased as a result. This was a result of grain food aid inflows increasing the availability of low-cost inputs to the informal distilling industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0ebgfiiMn0C|title=Food Aid After Fifty Years: Recasting Its Role|last=Barrett|first=Christopher Brendan|last2=Maxwell|first2=Daniel G.|date=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415701259|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natural resource overexploitation ====
Recent research suggests that patterns of food aid distribution may inadvertently affect the natural environment, by changing consumption patterns and by inducing locational change in [[grazing]] and other activities. A pair of studies in Northern Kenya found that food aid distribution seems to induce greater spatial concentration of [[livestock]] around distribution points, causing localized [[rangeland]] degradation, and that food aid provided as whole grain requires more cooking, and thus more fuelwood, stimulating local [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;McPeak J.G. (2003a) Analyzing and assessing localized degradation of the commons. Land Economics, 78(4): 515-536.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://crsps.net/resource/fuelwood-gathering-and-use-in-northern-kenya-implications-for-food-aid-and-local-environments/|title=Fuelwood Gathering and Use in Northern Kenya: Implications for Food Aid and Local Environments|last=McPeak|first=John G.|date=May 2003|work=CRSPs|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The welfare impacts of any food aid-induced changes in food prices are decidedly mixed, underscoring the reality that it is impossible to generate only positive intended effects from an international aid program.

=== Ulterior agendas ===
Aid is seldom given from motives of pure [[altruism]]; for instance it is often given as a means of supporting an ally in [[international politics]]. It may also be given with the intention of influencing the political process in the receiving nation. Whether one considers such aid helpful may depend on whether one agrees with the agenda being pursued by the donor nation in a particular case. During the conflict between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]] in the twentieth century, the champions of those ideologies – the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] – each used aid to influence the internal politics of other nations, and to support their weaker allies. Perhaps the most notable example was the [[Marshall Plan]] by which the [[United States]], largely successfully, sought to pull [[Europe]]an nations toward capitalism and away from communism. Aid to underdeveloped countries has sometimes been criticized as being more in the interest of the donor than the recipient, or even a form of [[neocolonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Asante|first=S.K.B.|year=1985|url=https://www.econbiz.de/Record/international-assistance-and-international-capitalism-supportive-or-counterproductive-asante/10001860645|title=International Assistance and international Capitalism : Supportive or Counterproductive?|access-date=2018-05-28}} in {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11211907|title=African independence : the first twenty-five years|date=1985|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Carter, Gwendolen Margaret, 1906-1991., O'Meara, Patrick.|isbn=0253302552|location=Bloomington|oclc=11211907|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|250px|[[Marshall Plan]] aid to Germany, West Berlin, 1949]]
S.K.B'. Asante lists some specific motives a donor may have for giving aid: defence support, market expansion, foreign investment, missionary enterprise, cultural extension.{{efn|Asante, p. 251.}}  In recent decades, aid by organizations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] has been criticized as being primarily a tool used to open new areas up to global capitalists, and being only secondarily, if at all, concerned with the wellbeing of the people in the recipient countries.

===Beyond aid===
As a result of these numerous criticisms, other proposals for supporting developing economies and poverty stricken societies. Some analysts, such as researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]], argue that current support for the developing world suffers from a '''policy incoherence''' and that while some policies are designed to support the third world, other domestic policies undermine its impact,&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/3288-beyond-aid-sustainable-development|title=’Beyond Aid’ for sustainable development|date=April 2009|website=ODI|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples include:
* encouraging developing economies to develop their agriculture with a focus on exports is not effective on a global market where key players, such as the US and EU, heavily subsidise their products
* providing aid to developing economies' health sectors and the training of personnel is undermined by migration policies in developed countries that encourage the migration of skilled health professionals

One measure of this policy incoherence is the [[Commitment to Development Index|Commitment to Development Index (CDI)]] published by the [[Center for Global Development]] .  The index measures and evaluates 22 of the world's richest countries on policies that affect developing countries, in addition to simply aid.  It shows that development policy is more than just aid; it also takes into account trade, investment, migration, environment, security, and technology.

Thus, some states are beginning to go ''Beyond Aid'' and instead seek to ensure there is a policy coherence, for example see [[Common Agricultural Policy]] reform or [[Doha Development Round]]. This approach might see the nature of aid change from loans, debt cancellation, budget support etc., to supporting developing countries. This requires a strong political will, however, the results could potentially make aid far more effective and efficient.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

===The "aid industry" ===
Private giving includes aid from charities, philanthropic organizations or businesses to recipient countries or programs within recipient countries. Garrett has observed that aid donor organizations have developed their own industry known as the ''"aid industry"''. Private donors to countries in need of aid are a large part of this, by making money while finding the next best solution for the country in need of aid. These private outside donors take away from local entrepreneurship leaving countries in need of aid reliant on them.&lt;ref name="Garrett"/&gt;

==Transition out of aid==
Researchers looked at how Ghana compares with groups of other countries that have been transitioning out of aid. They talk about how the [[World Bank]] reclassified Ghana from a low income country to a lower middle income country in 2010. They found Ghana experiencing significant improvements across development indicators since early 2000s with different changes for different indicators which is consistent or better than lower middle income country averages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Hou|first1=Zhenbo|last2=Kennan|first2=Jane|date=October 2013|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/8065-graduation-out-aid|title=Graduation out of aid|website=ODI|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marshall Plan==
{{Main|Marshall Plan}}
After World War II the Marshall Plan (and similar programs for Asia, and the Point Four program for Latin America) became the major American aid program, and became a model for its foreign aid policies for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond H. Geselbracht|title=Foreign Aid and the Legacy of Harry S. Truman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZa5BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|year=2015|publisher=Truman State UP|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. gave away about $20 billion in [[Marshall Plan]] grants and other grants and low-interest long-term loans to Western Europe, 1945 to 1951. Historian Michael J. Hogan argues that American aid was critical in stabilizing the economy and politics of Western Europe. It brought in modern management that dramatically increased productivity, and encouraged cooperation between labor and management, and among the member states.  Local Communist parties were opposed, and they lost prestige and influence and a role in government.  In strategic terms, says Hogan, the Marshall Plan strengthened the West against The possibility of a Communist invasion or political takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947–1952'' (1989)  pp. 26–28, 430–443.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Marshall Plan's role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs from the United States.  Economic historians Bradford De Long and [[Barry Eichengreen]] conclude it was, " History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program." They state:
:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II "mixed economies" with more "market" and less "controls" in the mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. Bradford |last=DeLong |first2=Barry |last2=Eichengreen |chapter=The Marshall Plan: History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program |title=Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today |editor-first=Rudiger |editor-last=Dornbusch |editor2-first=Wilhelm |editor2-last=Nolling |editor3-first=Richard |editor3-last=Layard |location= |publisher=MIT Press |year=1993 |pages=189–230 |isbn=0-262-04136-7 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGCfmmlGtPEC&amp;pg=PA189 |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union concentrated on [[Molotov Plan|its own recovery]].  It seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It used trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the Soviet Union.  Moscow controlled  the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes:
:The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kramer, "The Soviet Bloc and the Cold War in Europe," {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyNcCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT174|title=A Companion to Europe Since 1945|last=Larres|first=Klaus|date=2014-01-07|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118890240|language=en|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic theories==
Since the 1960s, improving the efficiency of foreign aid has been a common topic of academic research. There is debate on whether foreign aid is efficacious, but for the purposes of this article we will ignore that. Given that schema, a common debate is over which factors influence the overall economic efficiency of foreign aid. Indeed, there is debate about whether aid impact should be measured empirically at all, but again, we will limit our scope to increasing the economic efficiency.

At the forefront of the aid debate has been the conflict between professor [[William Easterly]] of New York University &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://williameasterly.org|title=About|website=William Easterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his ideological opposite, Jeffrey Sachs, from Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/1770|title=Full Bio - Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs, Columbia University|date=2008-07-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622165502/http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/1770|archivedate=2010-06-22|deadurl=yes|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easterly advocates the "searcher's" approach, while Sachs advocates a more top down, broad planned approach. We will discuss both of these at length.

==="Searchers Approach"===
William Easterly offers a nontraditional, and somewhat controversial "searching" approach to dealing with poverty, as opposed to the "planned" approach in his famous critique of the more traditional Owen/Sachs, The White Man's Burden. Traditional [[poverty reduction]], Easterly claims is based on the idea that we know what is best for impoverished countries. He claims that they know what is best. Having a top down "master plan," he claims, is inefficient. His alternative, called the "Searchers" approach, uses a bottom up strategy.  That is, this approach starts by surveying the poor in the countries in question, and then tries to directly aid individuals, rather than governments. Local markets are a key incentive structure. The primary example is of mosquito nets in Malawi. In this example, an [[NGO]] sells mosquito nets to rich Malawians, and uses the profits to subsidize cheap sales to the impoverished. Hospital nurses are used as middle-women, profiting a few cents on every net sold to a patient. This incentive structure has seen the usage of nets in Malawi spike over 40% in less than seven years.&lt;ref name="Easterly 2007"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70399016|title=The white man's burden : why the West's efforts to aid the rest have done so much ill and so little good|last=1957-|first=Easterly, William,|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199210824|location=Oxford|oclc=70399016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the central tenets in Easterly's approach is a more bottom up philosophy of aid. This applies not only to the identification of problems, but to the actual distribution of capital to the areas in need. In effect, Easterly would have countries go to the area which needed aid, collect information about the problem, find out what the population wanted, and then work from there. In keeping with this, funds would also be distributed from the bottom up, rather than being given to a specific government.&lt;ref name="Easterly 2007"/&gt;

Easterly also advocates working through currently existing Aid organizations, and letting them compete for funding. Utilizing pre-existing national organizations and local frameworks would not only help give target populations a voice in implementation and goal setting, but is more efficient economically. Easterly argues that the preexisting frameworks already "know" what the problems are, as opposed to outside [[NGO]]s who tend to "guess".&lt;ref name="Easterly 2007"/&gt;

Easterly strongly discourages aid to government as a rule. He believes, for several reasons, that aid to small "bottom up" organizations and individual groups is a better philosophy than to large governments.&lt;ref name="Easterly 2007"/&gt;

Easterly states that for far too long, inefficient aid organizations have been funded, and that this is a problem. The current system of evaluation for most aid
organizations is internal. Easterly claims that the process is biased because organizations have a large incentive to represent their progress in a positive light. What he proposes as an alternative is an independent auditing system for aid organizations. Before receiving funding, the organization would state their goals and how they expect to measure and achieve them. If they do not meet their goals, Easterly proposes we shift our funding to organizations who are successful. This would prompt organizations to either become efficient, or obsolete.&lt;ref name="Easterly 2007"/&gt;

Easterly believes that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, one of the main failings of aid lies in the fact that we create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.&lt;ref name="Easterly 2007"/&gt;

The "Searching Approach" is intrinsically tied to the market. Easterly claims that the only way for poverty to truly end is for the poor to be given the capability to lift themselves out of poverty, and then for it to happen. Philosophically, this sounds like the traditional [[bootstrapping|"bootstrap" theory]], but it is not. What he says is that the poor should be given the fiscal support to create their market, which would give them the ability to become self-reliant in the future.&lt;ref name="Easterly 2007"/&gt;

In the end of his book, Easterly proposes a voucher system for foreign aid. The poor would be distributed a certain number of vouchers, which would act as currency, redeemable to aid organizations for services, medicines, and the like. These vouchers would then be redeemed by the aid organizations for more funding. In this way, the aid organization would be forced to compete, if by proxy.&lt;ref name="Easterly 2007"/&gt;

===Proscriptive "Ladder Approach"===
Sachs presents a near dichotomy to Easterly. Sachs presents a broad, proscriptive solution to poverty. In his book, The End of Poverty, he explains how throughout history, countries have ascended from poverty by following a relatively simple model. First, you promote agricultural development, then industrialize, embrace technology, and finally become modern. This is the standard "western" model of development that has been followed by countries such as China and Brazil. Sachs main idea is that there should be a broad analytical "checklist" of things a country must attain before it can reach the next step on the ladder to development. Western nations should donate a percentage of their GDP as determined by the UN, and pump money into helping impoverished countries climb the ladder. Sachs insists that if followed, his strategy would eliminate poverty by 2025.&lt;ref name="Sachs 2005"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57243168|title=The end of poverty : economic possibilities for our time|last=Jeffrey.|first=Sachs,|date=2005|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=1594200459|location=New York|oclc=57243168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs advocates using a top down methodology, utilizing broad ranging plans developed by external aid organizations like the UN and World Bank. To Sachs, these plans are essential to a coherent and timely eradication of poverty. He surmises that if donor and recipient countries follow the plan, they will be able to climb out of poverty.&lt;ref name="Sachs 2005"/&gt;

Part of Sachs’ philosophy includes strengthening the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the United Nations. If those institutions are given the power to enact change, and freed from mitigating influences, then they will be much more effective. Sachs does not find fault in the international organizations themselves. Instead, he blames the member nations who compose them. The powerful nations of  the world must make a commitment to end poverty, then stick to it.&lt;ref name="Sachs 2005"/&gt;

Sachs believes it is best to empower countries by utilizing their existing governments, rather than trying to circumnavigate them. He remarks that while the corruption argument is logically valid in that corruption harms the efficiency of aid, levels of corruption tend to be much higher on average for countries with low levels of GDP. He contends that this hurdle in government should not disqualify entire populations for much needed aid from the west.&lt;ref name="Sachs 2005"/&gt;

Sachs does not see the need for independent evaluators, and sees them as a detractor to proper progress. He argues that many facets of aid cannot be effectively quantified, and thus it is not fair to try to put empirical benchmarks on the effectiveness of aid.&lt;ref name="Sachs 2005"/&gt;

Sachs’ view makes it a point to attack and attempt to disprove many of the ideas that the more "pessimistic" Easterly stands on.

First, he points to economic freedom. One of the common threads of logic in aid is that countries need to develop economically in order to rise from poverty. On this, there is not a ton of debate. However, Sachs contends that Easterly, and many other neo-Liberal economists believe high levels of economic freedom in these emerging markets is almost a necessity to development. Sachs himself does not believe this. He cites the lack of correlation between the average degrees of Economic Freedom in countries and their yearly GDP growth, which in his data set is completely inconclusive.

Also, Sachs contends that democratization is not an integral part of having efficient aid distribution. Rather than attach strings to our aid dollars, or only working with democracies or "good governments", Sachs believes we should consider the type of government in the needy country as a secondary concern.

Sachs’ entire approach stands on the assertion that abject poverty could be ended worldwide by 2025.&lt;ref name="Sachs 2005"/&gt;

====David Dollar====
Dollar/Collier showed that current allocations of aid are allocated inefficiently. They came to the conclusion that aid money is given in many cases as an incentive to change policy, and for political reasons, which in many cases can be less efficient than the optimal condition. They agree that bad policy is detrimental to economic growth, which is a key component of poverty reduction, but have found that aid dollars do not significantly incentivize governments to change policy. In fact, they have negligible impact. As an alternative, Dollar proposes that aid be funneled more towards countries with "good" policy and less than optimal amounts of aid for their massive amounts of poverty. With respect to "optimal amounts" Dollar calculated the marginal productivity of each additional dollar of foreign aid for the countries sampled, and saw that some countries had very high rates of marginal productivity (each dollar went further), while others [with particularly high amounts of aid, and lower levels of poverty] had low [and sometimes negative] levels of [[marginal productivity]]. In terms of economic efficiency, aid funding would be best allocated towards countries whose marginal productivities per dollar were highest, and away from those countries who had low to negative marginal productivities.  The conclusion was that while an estimated 10 million people are lifted from poverty with current aid policies, that number could be increased to 19 million with efficient aid allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Paul|last2=Dollar|first2=David|date=September 2002|title=Aid allocation and poverty reduction|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014292101001878|journal=European Economic Review|volume=46|issue=8|pages=1475–1500|doi=10.1016/s0014-2921(01)00187-8|issn=0014-2921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="New Conditionality"====
New Conditionality is the term used in a paper to describe somewhat of a compromise between Dollar and Hansen. Paul Mosely describes how policy is important,  and that aid distribution is improper. However, unlike Dollar, "New Conditionality" claims that the most important factors in efficiency of aid are income distributions in the recipient country and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Paul|last2=Hudson|first2=John|last3=Verschoor|first3=Arjan|date=2004-05-27|title=Aid, Poverty Reduction and the ‘New Conditionality’*|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00220.x|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=114|issue=496|pages=F217–F243|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00220.x|issn=0013-0133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====McGillivray====
One of the problems in foreign aid allocation is the marginalization of the fragile state. The fragile state, with its high volatility, and risk of failure scares away donors. The people of those states feel harm and are marginalized as a result. Additionally, the fate of neighboring states is important, as economies of the directly adjacent states to those impoverished, volatile "fragile states" can be negatively impacted by as much as 1.6% of their GDP per year. This is no small figure.  McGillivray advocates for the reduced volatility of aid flows, which can only be attained through analysis and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aid Allocation and Fragile States|last=McGillivray|first=Mark|publisher=UNU-WIDER|year=2006|location=Helsinki}} in {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/713186756|title=Fragile states : causes, costs, and responses : a study prepared by the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University (UNU-WIDER)|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Naudé, Wim A., Santos Paulino, Amelia Uliafnova., McGillivray, Mark., World Institute for Development Economics Research.|isbn=9780199693153|location=Oxford|oclc=713186756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Aid on the Edge of Chaos''===
A persistent problem in foreign aid is what some have called a 'neo-Newtonian' paradigm for thinking and action. Development and humanitarian problems are frequently dealt with as if they are simple, linear, and best addressed through the application of 'best practices' developed in Western countries and then applied ad infinitum by aid agencies. This approach has come under sustained criticism in Ben Ramalingam's ''[[Aid on the Edge of Chaos]]''. This work advocates that aid agencies should embrace the ideas and principles of [[complex adaptive system]]s research in order to improve how they think about and act on development problems.

'''Air-Van Airlines''' was an [[airline]] based in [[Armenia]]. It was forced to suspend operations after the Armenian civil aviation authority decided not  to extend its air operator certificate. It had operated two B747-200s and a DC-10 on charter services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ch-aviation.ch/airlinepage.php?code1=AIV Air Van Airlines - CH Aviation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baron of Alagoa''' ({{lang-pt|Barão de Alagoa}}) was a noble title created by D. [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] by decree on 22 December 1841 in favour of [[José Francisco da Terra Brum]], a wealthy merchant from the city of [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] archipelago of the [[Açores]]. The landowner had his residence along the margins of the ''Ribeira da Conceição'', and included properties in the so-named coastal shoreline of Alagoa (today occupied by the football field of Fayal Sport).

{{Geology of the Andes}}
The '''Precordillera Terrane''' or '''Cuyania''' was an ancient [[microcontinent]] or [[terrane]] whose history affected many of the older rocks of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in [[Argentina]]. It was separated by [[oceanic crust]] from the [[Chilenia]] terrane which accreted into it at ~420-390 Ma when Cuyania was already amalgamated with [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rapalini|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesized Mejillonia Terrane in the coast of [[Norte Grande, Chile|northern Chile]] is considered by some [[geologist]]s to be a single block with Cuyania. 

The [[San Rafael Block]] crops out 200 km to the south of the other exposures of Cuyania and is the southern extension of the terrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cingolani|Heredia|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Precordillera has been hypothesised to have been derived from [[Laurentia]], the core of North America, which was attached to the western margin of South America during the Precambrian when virtually all continents formed a "proto-[[Gondwana]]" supercontinent known as [[Pannotia]].  The Precordillera was then part of a proposed "Texas Plateau", a promontory attached to Laurentia similar to the way the [[Falkland Plateau]] is attached to South America today.  The Texas Plateau was detached from the Gondwana in a rift around 455&amp;nbsp;Ma after which it collided with the proto-Andean margin of South America, an event known as the [[Taconic orogeny|Taconic]]-[[Famatinian orogeny|Famatinian]] orogeny, and the Precordillera got left behind at its present location within South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalziel|1997|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Angola}}
The '''Democratic Front for the Liberation of Angola (FDLA)''' was a political movement in colonial [[Angola]]. FDLA was set up as a parallel structure to the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]), supported by the government of [[Congo-Brazzaville]]. FDLA later aligned itself with MPLA in the struggle against Portuguese colonial rule. Eventually the cadres of FDLA joined MPLA, and FDLA ceased its independent existence.

'''''Development Workshop''''' ('''DW''') is a [[non-profit organization]] providing assistance for poor and disadvantaged communities in the developing countries.  Established in 1973. Works in more than 30 countries of [[Asia]], [[Africa]], the [[Americas]].

== Overview ==

The Organization promotes technical assistance, training, research projects, including the following spheres: shelter, basic services, [[infrastructure]], [[livelihood]]s and local economic development, [[governance]], post-conflict reconstruction and disaster mitigation. It is funded by [[non-government organization]]s, private citizens, national and international development agencies. DW is not a funding organization and it does not raise funds directly from the public.

There are three main DW centres ([[Canada]], [[France]], [[Angola]]) and offices in [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Vietnam]].

Development Workshop France (DWF) is a French NGO, and works in South East Asia and Western Africa. 
DWF undertakes actions in Central Viet Nam that help families, communities, community leaders and civil society reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change and develop the safer environment and poverty reduction. 

For its work in Vietnam DWF was awarded the 2008 World Habitat Award, and received the Thua Thien Hué Certificate of Merit in 2008 as well.

Development Workshop France works in collaboration with the People’s Committee of Thua Thien Hué province and the Flood and Storm Control Committee, the Thua Thien Hué Consulting &amp; Designing Construction Company, Hué, and Commune authorities. DW’s work builds on experience gained by DW in disaster and development related work in Viet Nam since 1989 on UNDP and Australian Aid supported projects in central and northern Viet Nam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unisdr.org/eng/public_aware/world_camp/2005/2005-events.htm International Strategy for Disaster Reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by the EC Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) (2003–2009) and the Ford Foundation since 2007, and previously by Canadian International Development Aid (CIDA) and the Foundation Aide Viet Nam. 

In 2008 DWF, by its declaration, exported its Vietnam expertise to Myanmar, to help victims of Cycloen Nargis, and in collaboration with Save the Children Alliance in Myanmar, takes part in the activities to strengthen schools to resist the impact of future cyclones and make children and their parents safer.

Development Workshop Angola was founded in 1981 and was the country's first NGO. In 1989 DWA initiated humanitarian electronic-network "AngoNet",&lt;ref&gt;Angonet Page&lt;/ref&gt; funded by [[UNDP]] and the  [[International Development Research Centre]], and in partnership with UNICEF, the EU and [[One World Action]] contributed to giving access to clean water for about 1,000,000 people in [[Angola]].

[[File:Dollart.png|thumb|Dollart and its surrounding area]]

The '''Dollart''' (German name) or '''Dollard''' (Dutch name) is a [[bay]] in the [[Wadden Sea]] between the northern [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], on the west side of the [[estuary]] of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river. Most of it dries at [[low tide]]. Many water birds feed there.

== Gaining from and losing to the sea ==
&lt;!-- doesn't fit in the article -- [[File:Verdronken Dollarddorpen - Emmius, 1630.jpg|thumb|upright|The area of the Dollart before its creation. The villages shown disappeared as the Dollart bay expanded. (The map was drawn in 1630, after the Dollart had already reached its largest surface.)]] --&gt;
[[File:Dollart-Geschichte.png|thumb|Recovery of the fringes of the Dollart: polders on the German (right and top) and Dutch (left and bottom) sides]]

The Dollart Bay was created by a catastrophic storm surge in 1277,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goffart |first1=Walter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qex4Pl0YATwC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=dollart+ems+flood+1277 |title=Historical Atlases: The First Three Hundred Years, 1570-1870 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2003 |page=126 |accessdate=2018-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the district of [[Reiderland#The old Reiderland|Reiderland]] and large parts of the [[Oldambt (region)|Oldambt]] district. The flood inundated 43 parishes, and is estimated to have caused 80,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Suess |first1=Edward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmkAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=dollart+ems+flood+1277 |title=The Face of the Earth |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1906 |page=417 |accessdate=2018-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another storm surge in 1509 further extended the Dollart, flooding 30 more villages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verdronkengeschiedenis.nl/nl/stormvloed/stormvloed.html#symposium |title= “Stormvloed 1509” - een Nederlands – Duits cultuurhistorisch project |language=Dutch |trans-title="Stormvloed 1509" - a Dutch-German cultural-historical project |work=Stichting Verdronken Geschiedenis |date=2009 |accessdate=2018-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1520 the Dollart had its largest extension. Between the 16th and the 20th centuries, two thirds of the drowned area was reclaimed again.

Nowadays the unembanked forelands have been declared world natural heritage, as they are a paradise for all kinds of [[bird]]s and other aquatic species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1314 |title=Wadden Sea |work=World Heritage Center |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2018-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Border dispute ==
[[File:Dutch-German Border dispute.svg|thumb|Disputed border between Germany and the Netherlands]]

The Netherlands and Germany do not agree on the exact course of the border through the bay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geodaten.niedersachsen.de/viewer_dienste/layerstruktur/layer-nordsee---ems-dollart-vertrag-25327.html |title=Layer Nordsee - Ems-Dollart-Vertrag |language=German |publisher=[[Lower Saxony|State of Lower Saxony]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet they have [[Agree to disagree|agreed to disagree]] by signing a treaty in 1960, laying out mutual responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0005343/1978-07-01 |title=Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland tot [...] van de samenwerking in de Eemsmonding (Eems-Dollardverdrag), 's-Gravenhage, 08-04-1960 |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Government of the Netherlands]] |date=1 July 1978 |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2011, the [[territorial dispute]] gained relevance with plans for the [[Borkum Riffgat]] [[offshore wind farm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spitsnieuws.nl/archives/binnenland/2011/01/nederland_en_duitsland_besprek.html |title=Nederland en Duitsland bespreken zeegrens |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Spits (newspaper)|Spits]] |date=14 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114223131/http://www.spitsnieuws.nl/archives/binnenland/2011/01/nederland_en_duitsland_besprek.html |archivedate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question about use and administration of the [[territorial waters]] between 3 and 12 [[nautical mile]]s (where the wind farm is located) was settled with another treaty in 2014 by defining a "line", while the border dispute itself remained unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/trb-2014-182.html |title=Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland betreffende het gebruik en beheer van de territoriale zee van 3 tot 12 zeemijlen; (met gemeenschappelijke verklaring en briefwisseling) Op de Eems, 24 oktober 2014 |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Government of the Netherlands]] |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of [[Trondheim]]''' is one of the official symbols of the city and municipality of Trondheim in [[Norway]].

Most Norwegian municipalities have a banner of their respective coats of arms as a flag. As Trondheim has no modern heraldic coat of arms, but a seal that is unsuitable as a banner of arms, a yellow "Trondheim rose" on a red field was instead chosen for the flag of Trondheim. The designer of the flag was professor Arne E. Holm, whose proposal was approved by the municipal council in 1989, and confirmed by royal order the same year.

The [[Dog Rose|dog rose]] is the official flower of the city and its stylised form is related to the [[Tudor rose]].

It is found as a symbol in medieval sources among other things representing [[St. Olav]]. This flower has been used as a symbol of the city at least since the 16th century. It is earliest preserved in the seal of the [[Chapter (religion)|church chapter]] of Trondheim used in the 16th century. In the 17th century it was used on a green field in the banner of the citizen guard of the city. It has also been used as a symbol of several [[guild]]s such as the [[masonry|masons]], [[baker]]s, [[goldsmith]]s and [[Smith (metalwork)|smiths]]. In the 18th century the flower replaced the three heads in the [[Coat of arms of Trondheim|seal of Trondheim]]. The idea of the rose as a symbol of Trondheim may originally have come into being because of a misinterpretation of the last syllable of the city's old name [[Nidaros]].

The flower has been so closely connected to Trondheim that the Norwegian heraldic authority denied other municipalities the use of it in their coats of arms.

The flag of Trondheim has been highlighted as an example of a good city flag design by Roman Mars in his radio show "99% invisible", a radio show focused on design and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TED|title=Why city flags may be the worst-designed thing you've never noticed {{!}} Roman Mars|date=2015-05-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Foi magia"''' ("It was magic") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Sofia Vitória]].

The song is an up-tempo number, with Vitória singing about how she felt when she first saw her lover, a feeling she describes as "magic" and otherwise impossible to explain.

As Portugal had not finished the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 Contest]] in the top 10, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here it was performed seventh, following [[Andorra]]'s [[Marta Roure]] with "[[Jugarem a estimar-nos]]" and preceding [[Malta]]'s [[Julie Zahra|Julie]] &amp; [[Ludwig Galea|Ludwig]] with "[[On again...off again]]". At the close of voting, it had received 38 points, placing 15th in a field of 22, thus failing to qualify for the final and requiring Portugal to qualify from the semi-final at the next Contest.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005 Contest]] by [[2B (duo)|2B]] with "[[Amar (song)|Amar]]".

'''The Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care''' was established by the [[World Health Organization]] in December 2005. Its general purpose is to reduce "death and disability from road traffic accidents, trauma, burns, falls, pregnancy related complications, domestic violence, disasters and other emergency surgical conditions" by improving collaborations between relevant organizations, institutions, and agencies ("Global Initiative for Essential and Emergency Surgical Health Care" or GIEESC). Specific objectives include improving basic medical supplies at district hospitals, as well as better training for staff to bolster medical standards and care.

== Establishment ==
The GIEESC is a partnership of organizations, [[NGO]]’s, institutions, and associations from third and first world countries. This partnership is working together to create solutions to and meet the Millennium [[Millennium Development Goals|Development Goals]] developed by the WHO—which include reducing maternal and child mortality rates, as well as reducing HIV rates—“through improvement in the quality and safety of clinical procedures (essential surgical and anaesthesia care)” ("Global Initiative").

===Creation===
The Clinical Procedures Unit of the WHO recognized a need for improved surgical care at the first referral-level health facilities, which typically are district hospitals. The "WHO Meeting towards A Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care" at the WHO headquarters in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]], established the GIEESC to "improve emergency and essential surgical care at resource limited health care facilities". Experts from the fields of surgery, anesthesia, trauma, and others were in attendance to discuss solutions to the global problem.

The first countries to benefit from the creation of GIEESC were [[Pakistan]], [[Maldives]], [[Mongolia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Mozambique]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Other countries may join upon request and a submitted proposal. The training program implemented at district hospitals to achieve the project’s goals includes a tool kit of "best practice protocols on clinical procedures safety, disaster management, HIV prevention, waste disposal, guidelines on policies, training curriculum, emergency equipment, teaching slides and videos”(“WHO Meeting”).

===Mission statement===
GIEESC’s stated goals include: improving the already existing training and education programs essential to executing emergency surgical care; developing district hospitals' surgical, obstetric, trauma, and anesthesia services; training personnel with the appropriate skills to treat patients; continuing education to maintain those skills; and finally, developing a dependable system that facilitates access to medication and medicinal drugs.

===Challenges===
Challenges to those goals include: inadequate equipment to "perform simple but vital interventions such as resuscitation, the provision of oxygen, assessment of [[anemia]], suctions, [[intercostal drainage]] and airway support"; insufficient basic supplies; the absence of specialized surgical teams; and the lack of anesthesia.

== Strategies and Implementation ==

===Policies===
GIEESC’s policies require implementing a national plan to standardize district hospitals' surgical services by including requirements for basic surgical treatment. Hospitals must be clearly committed to educating and training health care professionals to react appropriately when dealing with surgery, trauma, obstetrics and anesthesia.

===Quality and safety===
GIEESC demands national guidelines on standards for personnel, standard operating procedures, and evaluations, based on quality of actual procedures and equipment involved.

===Tool kit===
The "Integrated Management for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care (IMEESC) tool kit" for implementing procedures involves a set of five cds containing recommendations for standards in emergency surgical care in surgery, trauma, [[obstetrics]], and anesthesia.

== Country reports ==
September 24–25, 2007, in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]], the WHO held a second meeting on the initiative to discuss its progress in certain countries. The findings are listed below by continent, and then country.

===Africa===

====Tanzania====
There were 36 million inhabitants but only 100 surgeons, and 1/3 of them had left the country. The GIEESC project started in January 2007 organized a task force to train twenty health care providers (with at least one from nine different zones) in dilation, curettage, cesarean section, and trauma management. There will be a follow-up report in a year to evaluate the education the trainers brought to their respective zones.

====Ethiopia====
With a population of over 75 million, [[Ethiopia]] had only 144 surgeons, 31 anesthesiologists, 254 anesthesia nurses, 1124 general practitioners, 776 health officers, and 18,000 nurses. The initiative had reached only one region so far, with 9 health officers and 18 nurse anesthetists trained. By 2010 the goal was to have trained 300 general practitioners, 600 nurse anesthetists, and 300 midwives. Additionally, four medical colleges are including training materials in their curriculum.

====Gambia====
[[Gambia]] lacked sufficient staff and equipment to treat its population of 1.5 million to proper surgical care. The program was focused on training nurses in child and maternal health care, with the help of an emergency obstetrical flying squad. In the first two months of implementation 27 lives were saved.

====Ghana====
A mycobacterial skin disease occurring primarily in children under 15 years old prompted the [[Buruli ulcer|Buruli Ulcer]] program, which provided education on the treatment of the ulcers that result from the skin disease. Equipment for safe surgery, as well as refurbished health facilities were ongoing challenges.

====Mozambique====
The GIEESC had been holding courses on disaster management and [[polytrauma]], as well as a workshop for surgical technicians, and the founding of the National Program for Infection Control.

====Uganda====
Plans for [[Uganda]] involved implementing better care to lower levels of health facilities, and providing training and surgical services to camps in rural areas.

====Zambia====
Challenges to proper surgical care in [[Zambia]] included lack of staff, poor infrastructure, inadequate supplies, and difficulty in accessing health care. A situational analysis was underway.

====Cote d'Ivoire====
Temporary surgical units in rural health centers have been set up, along with training of doctors there(“WHO Meeting").

===Asia===

====Mongolia====
Various steps had been taken to improve [[Mongolia]]’s emergency surgical care: the training of 300 primary health workers at main hospitals and 120 workers at primary health facilities, the translation of necessary WHO tools into Mongolian.

====India====
The GIEESC’s two goals for [[India]] were to train existing professionals in life saving skills, and to implement a “[[rural surgery]]” project where surgeons would be trained to deal with specific surgical problems seen in rural areas.

====Kyrgyzstan====
The country’s government was implementing health care reform by focusing on surgery, and a WHO toolkit was to be implemented at medical institutions to help.

===Middle East===

====Afghanistan====
GIEESC had begun anesthesia training at sites in [[Faryab]] and [[Mazir-I Sharif]], and equipment was donated for the purpose.

===South America===

====Guyana====
The country’s health care budget was being redirected toward training of health care providers at basic facilities with surgical capabilities, with essential and emergency surgical care education central to the project.

===Other initiatives===
The GIEESC was involved in various collaborations with other WHO departments: Transplantation, Health Action in Crises, Violence and Injury Prevention, Making Pregnancy Safer, Child and Adolescent Health, The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health, Communicable Diseases, Second Global Patient Safety Challenge: Safe Surgery Saves Lives, Health Inter Network Access to Research Initiative, Knowledge Management for Public Health, and the Clinical Procedures Unit. The GIEESC was also involved in global partnerships with: [[The Transplantation Society]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Medecins Sans Frontiers]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], [[International Society of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology]], [[Health Volunteers Overseas]], Association of Surgeons of East Africa, College of Surgeons of East, Central and South Africa, International Federation of Surgical Colleges, International College of Surgeons, World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists, [[Geneva Foundation for Medical Education and Research]], [[EHT-ESC WHO/UNICEF Statement on Anemia]], and the [[Canadian Network for International Surgery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18178">'''International lender of last resort''' (ILLR) is a facility prepared to act when no other lender is capable or willing to lend in sufficient volume to provide or guarantee [[liquidity]] in order to avert a [[sovereign debt crisis]] or a [[systemic risk|systemic crisis]].

The role and suggested functions of an ILLR in a crisis is like domestic [[lender of last resort]] but one at an international level that can [[bailout]] one or several countries.  A number of different proposals and structures have been suggested and some have been implemented but with limited success. One such example is the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s supplemental reserve facility (SRF).  Some suggested ILLR's have been limited to supranational regions such as the [[Eurozone]] where agreements and funding are easier to achieve.

== Antecedents, current arrangements, and related proposals ==

Calls for an ILLR arose following the Mexican crisis (1994–1995) and the Asian and Russian financial crises of the late 1990s. While no comprehensive mechanism has been implemented, in late 1997 the [[International Monetary Fund]] instituted the supplemental reserve facility (SRF), designed to make large short-term loans with policy conditions at penalty rates during crises. To date, only Korea, Russia and Brazil have made use of the SRF.

Other less than comprehensive mechanisms have been proposed but not adopted. The first is International or Sovereign Bankruptcy, which would impose a stay on payments by a country in crisis. The second involves the use of credit lines for sovereigns to draw upon in times of crisis. A flexible credit line (FCL) would be made available with few or no conditions to countries with very sound economic and financial policies, while a precautionary credit line (PCL) could be made available to countries that do not meet FCL criteria but nonetheless display essentially sound policies. In contrast to FCL provisions, countries drawing on the PCL would be subject to policy conditions. A third proposal, broader and less clearly defined, calls for a global stabilization mechanism whereby the IMF could temporarily use an expanded "tool kit," with instruments including the unilateral offer of FCLs for multiple qualifying countries as well as other special facilities and relaxations of the terms of existing facilities.

== Rationales ==

A variety of rationales have been offered for the creation of an ILLR. Particularly prominent in recent years is offering countries an alternative to self-insurance through accumulation of [[foreign exchange reserves]], which, in spite of a high [[cost of carry]], has been widely practiced in emerging economies since the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]  and the 1998 bailout of [[Long-Term Capital Management]]. An ILLR might also provide a cushion against shocks and volatility, as well as reduce the likelihood of [[financial crisis|financial panic]] within countries and [[financial contagion]] across countries.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Arias (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, an ILLR might allow a country's Central Bank to shift their holdings from liquid but low-yielding foreign exchange reserve to less liquid but longer-term and higher-yield assets. Finally, having an ILLR with established rules and procedures in place before a crisis might make collective action problems less likely than in the case of an exclusively ex post response.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposals and characteristics ==

The role and suggested functions of an ILLR in a crisis like domestic [[lender of last resort]], as set forth by [[Walter Bagehot]] and subsequent authors, are the following: i) lending against any marketable [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] (finance) valued at its value in normal times; ii) lending in large amounts (on demand) at terms steeper than at market terms in normal times; and iii) establish the above principles ex-ante and applying them automatically.
The functions of an ILLR could be undertaken by a new institution such as a global [[central bank]], but current proposals have generally suggested the creation of a fund or facility within an existing institution, particularly the [[International Monetary Fund]]. A leading role has also occasionally been suggested for the [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref&gt;Fratianni and Pattison (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Less consensus exists on whether an ILLR should additionally assume the functions of a crisis manager by coordinating the responses of other relevant actors. Disagreement likewise exists regarding whether an ILLR should directly provide international liquidity to a country's financial institutions or should only provide liquidity to institutions serving as a country's financial safety nets.&lt;br/&gt;
Based on the traditional doctrine, four desirable aspects of a feasible ILLR can be set forth:&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Arias (2010) and Fernández-Arias and Levy Yeyati (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Large size'': Sufficient to meet short-term financial obligations and avoid a collapse (either of demand or supply);
* ''Expediency'': Timely, immediate disbursements to prevent crises rather than cure their consequences or, if already underway, mitigate and resolve them at minimum cost;
* ''Certainty'': Automatic (i.e., non-discretionary) financial assistance according to pre-arranged mechanisms and conditions with adequate repayment period to match extraordinary financial need; uncertainty undermines confidence that ILLR will do its job, leads to defensive positioning of stakeholders in anticipation of crisis and, therefore, breeds self-fulfilling crises.
* ''An exit strategy'': Constant monitoring of whether liquidity provision fails to restore normalcy or fundamentals continue to deteriorate in order to be prepared to change diagnosis on the nature of the financial crisis and switch to alternative interventions to strengthen solvency.

There are, in addition, important distinctive characteristics of a feasible ILLR to bear in mind:&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Arias and Fernández-Arias and Levy Yeyati (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Financial safeguards'': In the absence of actual collateral or legal senior creditor status, ILLR financial safety needs a reliable, satisfactory country risk assessment; 
* ''Ex ante eligibility'': In the absence of prudential regulation and other legally binding assurances, ILLR needs to resort to the satisfaction of conditions. In order to be expedient and certain, eligibility conditions (including the above risk assessment) ought to be set ex ante, in normal times. 
* ''Standards for eligibility'': Conditions for eligibility require minimum standards to comply with the financial safeguards mentioned above and standards of country economic health depending on the objective of the particular application of the ILLR (concerning the soundness of fundamentals, the quality of the policies in place and the degree of commitment to sustain them). In all cases, criteria should be parsimonious, easily quantifiable and as objective as possible.
* ''Participation incentives'': Because of the absence of a mandatory legal framework, if countries are reluctant to make individual applications for protection under the ILLR in normal times, the integrity of the safety net will require proactive participation promotion. 
It should be noted that any ILLR arrangement assumes a high level of trust and cooperation among international financial actors. Reserve asset countries, for example, would be expected to provide liquidity on demand to the ILLR. That liquidity would in turn be drawn from a network of Central Bank swaps and other reliable sources, including regional arrangements in a position to co-finance and committed to fulfilling their obligations. Trust and cooperation would also be implicit in the function of channeling liquidity to qualified countries.

== Criticisms ==

The greatest single objection to ILLR is fear of [[moral hazard]], as access to a liquidity facility may lead countries to opt for bolder policies with less liquidity self-protection (e.g. lower reserves) and, in the event of a liquidity crisis, to choose to incur debt from the ILLR to avoid default on private debts and preserve creditworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;Calomiris (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, private risk-taking as well as public risk-taking might increase in a setting characterized by a combination of inadequate macro-prudential regulation and the elimination of [[systemic risk]].

A variety of more specific objections have arisen as well:&lt;ref&gt;See Eichengreen (1999) and Inter-American Development Bank (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* An ILLR cannot provide genuine liquidity support in the absence of a supra-national money, nor can it create money
* No fiscal or taxing authority exists to finance the operations of an ILLR
* The amount of hard currency needed to support an ILLR would be unrealistically large
* An ILLR would lack access to mechanisms and instruments, such as deposit insurance, that are used by national lenders of last resort
* Whether an ILLR would channel funds to domestic authorities or to domestic banks remains unclear, and in either case agency problems could arise
* Regardless of an ILLR's hypothetical benefits, nations are in practice unlikely to yield the degree of control over their banking sectors that would be necessary to make an ILLR functional

'''Kosovan–British relations''' are foreign relations between [[Kosovo]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. When Kosovo [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared its independence]] from [[Serbia]] on 17 February 2008, the United Kingdom became one of the first countries to announce the official recognition of a sovereign Kosovo on 18 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK to recognise independent Kosovo - PM |url=http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page14594.asp |date=2008-02-18 |accessdate=2008-05-09 |publisher=United Kingdom Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510070233/http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page14594.asp |archivedate=2008-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes u.s. u.k. france"&gt;{{cite news|author=Nicholas Kulish and C.

==Military==
The United Kingdom participated in the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], which resulted in a [[UNMIK|UN administration]] of Kosovo. The United Kingdom currently has 84 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the [[NATO]] led [[Kosovo Force]]. Originally there were 19,000 British troops in KFOR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/kfor/structur/nations/placemap/kfor_placemat.pdf "Kosovo Force (KFOR)"] www.nato.int Link accessed 21-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]] was the first KFOR Commander from 12 June 1999 - 8 October 1999.

On 25 April 2008, the British Government announced that it would send a battle-group based on [[The Rifles|2 Rifles]], a light infantry battalion of about 600 soldiers, to help maintain public order to serve as Peacekeepers in [[EULEX]], an EU Police, Civilian and Law Mission in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/25/military.kosovo "New mission for British troops in Kosovo"] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 April Link Added 25 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political==
The United Kingdom was an important player in the events of 1999. The Kosovo War, which Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] had advocated on moral grounds, was initially a failure when it relied soly on air strikes; he believed that the threat of a ground offensive, which [[Bill Clinton]] had initially ruled out, was necessary to convince Serbia's [[Slobodan Milošević]] to withdraw. Blair ordered that 50,000 soldiers - most of the available British Army - should be made ready for action.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, Andrew; ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2008 printing); page 550&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has visited Kosovo on several occasions since; other British Ministers who have had ministerial responsibility for policy towards Kosovo, such as Dennis MacShane, have also maintained their connections.

'''''Lumír and Píseň''''' (Czech: '''''Lumír a Píseň''''') is an outdoor sculpture made by [[Josef Václav Myslbek]] in 1889-1897 for [[Palacký Bridge]]. Damaged from [[1945 Bombing of Prague|American bombing]] on February 14, 1945, statues were removed in 1948 in connection with the bridge reconstruction and installed at Vyšehradské sady in [[Vyšehrad]], Prague, Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="praguecityline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguecityline.cz/prazske-pamatky/sochy-a-sousosi-na-vysehrade-i|title=Sochy a sousoší na Vyšehradě I.|publisher=praguecityline.cz|accessdate=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Prague: A Cultural and Literary History|author1=Richard Burton|author2=Burton, R.D.E.|date=2003|publisher=Signal Books|isbn=9781902669632|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=G0uaU8M2bosC&amp;pg=PA81|page=81|accessdate=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was previously at the New Town's side of [[Vltava]] and it was installed in the gardens with two other statues from the opposite [[Smíchov]]'s side. The fourth statue, [[Libuše and Přemysl]], was heavily damaged and repaired until reinstalled with the other three in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prague.eu/cs/objekt/mista/562/vysehradske-sady?back=1 Vyšehradské sady] Prague.eu - oficiální turistický portál Prahy.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

It depicts the legendary bard Lumír and Píseň ("song"). According to [[Manuscripts of Dvůr Králové and Zelená Hora|Queen's Court manuscript]] Lumír refused to sing a hymn for the winners of [[The Maidens' War]], and sings instead his last song to the Vyšehrad, then breaks his instrument. Albeit lucking authenticity, the story was in the 19th century considered a symbol of national conscience.

'''MV ''Buffalo Soldier'' (T-AK-9301)''' is a [[roll-on/roll-off ship]], formerly of the French Government Line (now merged into [[CMA CGM]]). She was sold and re[[Maritime flag|flag]]ged US, renamed to honor [[Buffalo Soldiers]], and chartered by the [[United States Navy]] [[Military Sealift Command]] as a [[Maritime Prepositioning ship]] serving at [[Diego Garcia]] laden with [[U.S. Air Force]] munitions. She is self-sustaining, that is, she can unload herself, an asset in harbors with little or no infrastructure. Her 120-long-ton capacity roll-on/roll-off ramp accommodates tracked and wheeled vehicles of every description. While she is not currently in service with MSC, ships with her general characteristics are designated ''Buffalo Soldier'' class, fleet designation AK 2222.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''National Liberation Army''' or '''ALN''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''جيش التحرير الوطني الجزائري'' ''Djaïche Al-Tehrir Al-Ouatani Al-Djezaïr''; [[French language|French]], ''Armée de libération nationale'') was the armed wing of the [[Algerian nationalism|nationalist]] [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération National]] (FLN) during the [[Algerian War]]. After the [[independence]] of [[Algeria]] from [[France]] in 1962, the ALN was converted into the regular [[Algerian People's National Armed Forces|armed forces]] of the republic, but its leadership also came to play a prominent role in [[Politics of Algeria|Algerian politics]], as in the 1965 [[coup d'état]] by [[Colonel|Col.]] [[Houari Boumediene]].

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was founded at the beginning of the 14th century. Beginning in the 16th century, it also began acquiring possessions through a series of wars in [[Africa]].

==Egypt==
[[Egypt]] was under the rule of a military cast named [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]]. Mamluks were actually [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Circassians]]. In addition to Egypt they also controlled [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]. After [[Mehmed II]] (the Conqueror) united most of [[Anatolia]] under Ottoman rule, the two empires became neighbours of each other where two Mamluk vassals of [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]] origin were the  buffer states between the two. During the Ottoman-[[Safavid Persia]] war, Mamluks (or their vassals) supported Persia. [[Selim I]] (the Grim) of the Ottoman Empire used this claim as a pretext to wage a war on Mamluks. During Selim’s long campaign to Egypt in 1516-18, Mamluks were defeated three times;  in the battles [[Battle of Marj Dabiq|Marj Dabiq]] and [[Battle of Yaunis Khan|Yaunis Khan]] on the way to Egypt and in the [[Battle of Ridanieh]] in Egypt  (The first and the third personally commanded by Selim and the second by [[Hadim Sinan Pasha]]). The third battle in which Hadim Sinan Pasha fell was the final blow to Mamluks. After clashes in [[Capture of Cairo|Cairo]], [[Tumanbay II]] the Mamluk sultan was arrested and Selim annexed whole Mamluk territory, enlarging the Ottoman Empire more than two times in only two years.&lt;ref&gt;Agaston-Masters, p.512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorga Vol 2, p.284-286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algeria==
Turkish corsair and admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] in 1516, captured the city of [[Algiers]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  Although initially Barbaros and his brothers were independent, after his elder brother's death,  Barbaros appealed to Selim for protection.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, p.212&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1532, during the reign of  [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] (the Magnificent),  Barbaros was appointed as the grand admiral of the [[Ottoman Navy]] and [[Algeria]] became an Ottoman possession.  Eventually the Ottomans began controlling the hinterland also. In 1552, [[Salih Reis]] an Ottoman admiral, marched over the [[Sahara]] and captured [[Touggourt]].

==Tunisia==
In the early years of the 16th century [[Tunisia]] was ruled by [[Hafsid dynasty]] of [[Berber people|Berber]] origin. Although [[Tunis]], the most important city of Tunisia was captured by Barbaros on behalf of the Ottoman Empire in 1534, next year during the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], a navy of the Holy Roman Empire took the city.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, p. 214-216&lt;/ref&gt;   In the year 1560, an Ottoman navy commanded by [[Piyale Pasha]] defeated a large navy of the Holy Roman Empire in the [[Battle of Djerba]]. After this battle [[Uluç Ali Reis]] of the Ottoman Empire captured the city for the second time in 1569 during the reign of [[Selim II]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 271&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the city was lost to Holy Roman Empire for the second time. Finally in 1574, an Ottoman navy commanded by the grand admiral [[Sinan Pasha]] captured the city for the third time.&lt;ref&gt;Jorga, Vol 3, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libya==
After [[Knights Hospitaller]] left the island of [[Rhodes]] in 1522, some of them had settled in [[Tripoli]], the most important city of Libya. In 1551, Ottoman admiral [[Turgut Reis]] (also known as Dragut) captured the city &lt;ref&gt;Shaw, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of Sinan Pasha. Eventually [[Benghazi]] and the hinterland [[Fezzan]] were also annexed. Between 1711 and 1835 Libya became autonomous under Karamanlı dynasty (a dynasty founded by a military ruler from [[Karaman]], [[Turkey]]). After 1835 [[Mahmud II]] reestablished Ottoman control.

==Horn of Africa==
In 1538 Suleiman I sent a navy to the [[Indian Ocean]]. (see [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean]]) The expeditions continued for about 30 years. [[Özdemir Pasha]]  the deputy of the admiral conquered the west bank of the [[Red Sea]] (roughly corresponding to a narrow coastal strip of [[Sudan]] and [[Eritrea]]) in 1567 during the reign of [[Selim II]].&lt;ref&gt;Yücel-Sevim, p.295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Africa==
The Ottomans frequently interfered in the affairs of [[Morocco]], and even captured [[Fes]] briefly in 1576 to enthrone their candidate as the Sultan of Fes.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw p.180&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]] in 1578, they actively fought on the side of Morocco against [[Portugal]]. According to [[Lord Kinross]] Morocco fell under Ottoman influence.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 271&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1585, Ottoman admiral [[Murat Reis the Elder|Murat Reis]] captured the island of [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary islands]] off the West African coast. Although he soon withdrew, it was notable as the sole Ottoman conquest in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Napoleon's campaign to Egypt==
General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (later Napoleon I) of France invaded Egypt in 1798.  The main Ottoman army was preoccupied in European fronts and the only defenders were local forces which were routed in the [[Battle of Pyramids]].&lt;ref&gt;Agaston-Masters p.205&lt;/ref&gt; However Napeleon couldn't proceed much because his fleet was defeated by the British navy. In 1799 he returned and the French army evacuated Egypt following the [[Battle of Alexandria]] in 1801.

==Aftermath==
The Ottoman Empire lost direct control of Egypt and the lands to the south during the revolt of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Kavalalı Mehmet Ali Pasha]] in the 1830s. Although Egypt was still considered an Ottoman vassal, the Ottoman Empire totally lost control in the 1880s to the [[British Empire]]. By the 19th century, Ottoman control of the countries west of Egypt was also weakened. Algeria was lost in 1830 &lt;ref&gt;Agoston-Masters, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and Tunis was lost in 1881, both to France.&lt;ref&gt;Agoston-Masters p.574&lt;/ref&gt; Libya, the last Ottoman territory in Africa was lost to [[Italy]] at the end of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Agoston-Masters, p.572&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radio Berlin International''' was the [[international broadcasting|international broadcaster]] for the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany).

==History==
Radio Berlin International (RBI) started in May 1959 to counter [[Deutsche Welle]], the [[Germany|West German]] international broadcaster.&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its output was news reports and information about the GDR. It offered a state-sponsored view on life in a [[socialist country]]. It distributed large quantities of colorful and professionally produced publicity material about life in the GDR to its listeners.

RBI used transmitters at [[Leipzig]], [[Königs Wusterhausen radio transmitter|Königs-Wusterhausen]], and [[Nauen Transmitter Station|Nauen]]. In 1964, RBI's system at Nauen built by the state enterprises VEB Funkwerk Berlin Köpenick and VEB Industrieprojekte featured rotatable tiltable antennas under remote control and able to handle 200 KW of power, making RBI the second most powerful shortwave service in the  [[Soviet bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Funkhaus_Nalepastra%C3%9Fe|studios]] were based in a former furniture factory at [[Nalepastraße]] in Berlin.

The broadcaster ceased operations on 2 October 1990 just before [[German reunification]].&lt;ref name="berg"/&gt; The final broadcast was noted for the bitterness among some RBI staff about its "takeover", rather than "unification" with Deutsche Welle. The last words (for the last English broadcast, at 36:48 of the reference) were, "Take care and good luck."&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/RadioBerlinInternationalOctober21990&lt;/ref&gt; 

Radio Berlin International broadcast in many languages, with many of its announcers at the different services &amp;mdash; such as [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Danish language|Danish]], coming from their country's respective communist parties. It was one of the major international broadcasters of the [[Cold War]] era.

==RBI revival rumours==
In August 2012, Taiwan-based [[PCJ Radio]] reported in its syndicated program ''Media Network Plus'' of a publicity campaign for a new station with the name "Radio Berlin International". A website and e-mails claimed that a group was preparing test transmissions and intended eventually to broadcast programmes on technology and education via the internet and on shortwave from the former RBI's engineering site at [[Nauen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

PCJ producer Keith Perron and a journalist colleague contacted the organization with questions about its programming plans and funding. Both received vague replies. The organization's web site disappeared later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

'''Radio Salankoloto''' is a [[radio station]] in [[Burkina Faso]]. It is broadcast on 97.3 FM from the city of [[Ouagadougou]]. It was established on November 22, 1996.

It plays mostly [[African music]] from traditional to modern [[hip-hop]].

The radio is known for its important health and community awareness programmes. Radio Salankoloto acts as a "community telephone" by broadcasting community birth and death announcements and hosting phone-in talk shows. The radio station broadcast a 13 episode drama series named "Viim Kuunga" at least twice in the afternoon and evening at times. In [[Mooré]], "Viim" means life, and "Kuunga" is a traditional drum that alerts people during emergencies. The title literally means: "Alert! Save your life!" and was broadcast to increase knowledge of [[HIV/AIDS]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comminit.com/drum_beat_193.html www.comminit.com], Retrieved on June 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ATS 909 worldband receiver.jpg|thumb|A [[Sangean]] ATS-909 [[world band receiver]].]]

'''Shortwave listening''', or '''SWLing''', is the [[hobby]] of listening to [[shortwave radio]] broadcasts located on [[frequency|frequencies]] between 1700 [[kHz]] and 30 [[MHz]].&lt;ref name='DXing.com'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dxing.com/swlintro.htm |title=Introduction To Shortwave Listening |accessdate=2007-11-21 |work=DXing.com |publisher=Universal Radio Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in the technical aspects of radio reception and collecting official confirmations ([[QSL cards]]) that document their reception of distant broadcasts ([[DXing]]). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local [[medium wave]] AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.&lt;ref name="NASWBC" /&gt;

The practice of long-distance radio listening began in the 1920s when shortwave broadcasters were first established in the US and Europe. Audiences discovered that international programming was available on the shortwave bands of many consumer radio receivers, and a number of magazines and listener clubs catering to the practice arose as a result. Shortwave listening was especially popular during times of international conflict such as [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]] and the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].

Listeners use inexpensive portable [[world band receiver]]s to access the shortwave bands, and some advanced hobbyists employ specialized shortwave [[communications receiver]]s featuring [[digital technology]] designed for optimum reception of shortwave signals, along with outdoor [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] to enhance performance.

With the advent of the [[Internet]], many international broadcasters have scaled back or terminated their shortwave transmissions in favor of web-based program distribution, while others are moving from traditional analog to digital broadcasting modes in order to allow more efficient delivery of shortwave programming. The number of organized shortwave listening clubs has diminished along with printed magazines devoted to the hobby; however, many enthusiasts continue to exchange information and news on the web.

==History==
The practice of listening to distant stations in the [[medium wave]] AM broadcast band was carried over to the shortwave bands.  [[Frank Conrad]], an early pioneer of medium wave broadcasting with [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] in [[Pittsburgh]], instituted some of the first shortwave broadcasts around 1921. Stations affiliated with [[General Electric]] and [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation|Crosley]] followed shortly after.
[[File:XGOY,"Voice of China" radio, broadcast in 1942.png|thumb|200px|right| "The Voice of [[China]]" broadcast in 1942]]
[[United States]] shortwave broadcasters began transmitting popular radio programs in an attempt to attract foreign audiences. During the 1930s, new shortwave receivers appeared on the market as well as popular shortwave magazines and clubs. Shortwave stations often offered unique QSL cards for DXers.

In [[Europe]], shortwave broadcasts from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]] such as Philips Radio's [[PCJJ]] began around 1927. [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Soviet Union]], Britain, and many other countries soon followed, and some classic shortwave broadcasters got their start. The BBC began on shortwave as the "BBC Empire Service" [[1932 in radio|in 1932]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4375652.stm Analysis: BBC's voice in Europe] Jan Repa, BBC News Online: 25 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Its broadcasts were aimed principally at [[English language|English speakers]]. [[Radio Moscow]] was broadcasting on shortwave in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by 1939. The [[Voice of America]] (or VOA) began broadcasting in 1942 after its entry into [[World War II]] using the [[Yankee Doodle]] musical theme.

While technically minded shortwave listening hobbyists dwindled during the war years due in part to the demands of military service, casual listeners seeking war news from foreign broadcasters increased. Shortwave receiver manufacturers contributed to war production. [[Zenith]] launched the multi-band [[Trans-Oceanic]] series of radios in 1942. In some other countries, during the war, listening to foreign stations was a criminal offense. Established in 1939, 35-kilowatt Chinese shortwave station XGOY broadcast programming aimed at listening-restricted [[Japan]]. The station was often bombed by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886118,00.html?promoid=googlep ''China Speaks Japanese'', Time Magazine, Dec. 28, 1942]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berg2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome S.

[[File:CBS-Listening-Post-May-1941.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[CBS]] shortwave listening post (May 1941)]]
[[CBS]] began a shortwave listening program in September 1939, on an experimental basis, at the [[1939 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|National Lawn Tennis Championships]] at [[West Side Tennis Club]] in [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills, New York]]. Engineers installed equipment at the CBS booth when the location was found to have good reception, and monitors relayed European shortwave news to CBS headquarters in New York between tennis matches.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773511,00.html "Radio: Propaganda Pigeons."] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', September 7, 1942, pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout World War II, CBS captured Allied and enemy shortwave communications from more than 60 international stations via secretly located receivers. Translations of intercepted broadcasts were teletyped to all New York newspapers, [[Associated Press]], [[United Press International]] and [[International News Service]], and in turn disseminated to newspapers and radio stations throughout the United States. Major headline news frequently resulted, since big stories often broke first on radio.&lt;ref name="CSM 45"&gt;"24,000,000 'Stolen' Words Go to Library of Congress." ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', September 4, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortwave listeners notified families of [[prisoners of war]] when studio announcers at stations in [[Axis powers]] countries, such as Germany and Japan, read prisoner-written messages. [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] monitors notified families, but many shortwave listeners were often first to report the broadcasts. Listeners in other countries also monitored POW messages.&lt;ref name="Berg2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Jerome S. |title=Listening on the Short Waves, 1945 to Today|publisher=McFarland|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=w2pna#v=onepage&amp;q=pow%20messages&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans were actively discouraged from listening to these reports, however, since broadcasting the names of a few American prisoners was regarded as a propaganda trick to build up the listening audience for Axis radio programs. In May 1943 Jack Gerber, director of the CBS listening post, told journalist [[William L. Shirer]] that the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]] was the only reliable source of information on prisoners, and expressed concern at receiving six or seven letters a week requesting transcripts of German broadcasts in which service members may have been mentioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only reason the Nazis put on prisoner broadcasts is to get people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front to listen to their propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]], "The Propaganda Front". ''[[The Montana Standard]]'', May 4, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[New Zealand]] shortwave listeners reported POW voices broadcast over [[Radio Peking]] during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="Berg2"/&gt;

[[Image:WPEcertificate.JPG|thumb|150px|right|WPE shortwave monitor registration certificate circa 1963]]
In the 1950s and 60s, shortwave DX columns in US magazines such as ''[[Popular Electronics]]''′ "Tuning the Short Wave Bands" and ''[[Electronics Illustrated]]''′s "The Listener" became news sources for serious radio listeners. ''Popular Electronics''′ "WPE Monitor Registration" program, begun in 1959, even offered [[callsign]]-like identifiers to hobbyists. A number of specialty radio clubs such as the ''Newark News Radio Club'' also arose during these decades and provided hobbyists with an exchange of DX news and information. When Popular Electronics and similar magazines expanded coverage of new electronics topics in the 1970s, this led to the cancellation of several long-time shortwave listening columns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/WPE.html ''On The Shortwaves, The "WPE" Monitor Registration Program'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with ''[[Sweden Calling DXers]]'' on [[Radio Sweden]] in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2408&amp;artikel=4506968 |title=About Sweden Calling DXers - MediaScan/Sweden Calling DXers |publisher=Sverigesradio.se |date=2001-07-17 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (there was a slightly earlier short-lived program from [[Radio Australia]]), many shortwave radio stations began programs providing news. Some of the other prominent DX programs were [[Radio Netherlands|Radio Netherlands']] ''DX Jukebox'' (which became ''[[Media Network]]''), the ''SWL Digest'' on [[Radio Canada International]], and the ''Swiss Shortwave Merry-go-round'' on [[Swiss Radio International]].

An example of notable shortwave programming was the ''[[Happy Station Show]]'', popularly called the “world’s longest-running shortwave radio program”. The show originated on Philips Radio's [[PCJJ]] shortwave station in 1928, continuing until 1940. After World War II [[Radio Netherlands]] broadcast the show from 1946 until it terminated in 1995. Producer and presenter Keith Perron “resurrected” Happy Station on March 12, 2009. Although no longer associated with Radio Netherlands, the new effort proclaims itself as “transmitted globally via shortwave, podcasting and Internet streaming radio”.&lt;ref name="dxing2004"&gt;Osterman, Fred. "Newsroom." [http://www.dxing.com/news.htm ''DXing Newsroom''.] 2004. Universal Radio Research. 6 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in the 1990s, many Americans tuned into foreign news broadcasts on shortwave. Some electronics retailers even reported a "run" on portable shortwave receivers due to the increased interest at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DD1431F930A35755C0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all ''Tuning Into The World Via Shortwave'', ''New York Times'', June 3, 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
Listening to shortwave broadcast stations for [[news]] and information programming is common, but for many shortwave listeners (abbreviated as "SWLs"), the goal is to receive as many [[Radio station|stations]] from as many countries as possible, also known as [[DXing]]. "DXers" routinely test the limits of their [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] systems, radios and [[radio propagation]] knowledge. Specialized interests of shortwave listeners may include listening for shortwave utility, or "ute", transmissions such as [[shipping industry|shipping]], [[sailing]], [[naval]], [[aviation]], or [[military]] signals, listening for [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] signals ([[numbers station]]s), or tuning in [[amateur radio]] stations.&lt;ref name='DXing.com' /&gt;

[[Image:Radio Moscow logo.png|thumb|150px|A [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] QSL card from 1969.]]
Listeners often obtain [[QSL card]]s (which confirm contact) from ham operators, broadcasters or utility stations as trophies of the hobby. Traditionally, listeners would send letters to the station with reception reports and requests for schedules. Many stations now accept [[E-mail]]s or provide reception report forms on their Web sites. Reception reports give valuable information about propagation and interference to a station's [[Broadcast engineering|engineer]]s.&lt;ref name='DXing.com' /&gt;

There have been several publications dedicated to providing information to shortwave listeners, including the magazines ''Popular Communications'' (now a "[https://web.archive.org/web/20141218051025/http://popular-communications.com/ digital supplement]" to CQ Amateur Radio magazine), ''Monitoring Times'' (now defunct), and [http://www.thespectrummonitor.com/ The Spectrum Monitor], a digital-only publication, in the United States, and the annual publications ''Passport to World Band Radio'' (now defunct) and the ''World Radio TV Handbook'' (WRTH). In addition, stations can provide broadcast schedules through the mail or E-mail. There are also shortwave radio programs dedicated to shortwave listening and DXing, such as the U.S.-based ''World of Radio'' and ''DXing With Cumbre'', but recently these programs have been curtailed or dropped by many [[international]] broadcasters. As of 2007, [[Radio Habana Cuba]] still hosts a program called DXers Unlimited.

There are estimated to be millions of shortwave listeners. In 2002, according to the National Association Of Shortwave Broadcasters, for estimated numbers of households with at least one shortwave set in working order, Asia led with a large majority, followed by Europe, Sub Saharan Africa, and the former Soviet Union, respectively. The total estimated number of households worldwide with at least one shortwave set in working order was said to be 600,000,000.&lt;ref name=NASWBC&gt;

[http://shortwave.org/news/news0210.htm NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SHORTWAVE BROADCASTERS, Inc. October 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; SWLs are varied, with no common age or occupation. [[David Letterman]] is an admitted fan of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC).&lt;ref name='DXing.com' /&gt;

Some developing countries use shortwave as a means of receiving local and regional programming. [[China]] and [[Russia]] retransmits some domestic channels on shortwave that target listeners in far off provinces. Shortwave listening is also used as an educational tool in classrooms.&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/450q42560k728u71/|title=A learning experience via short wave radio|last=Hawkins|first=Ralph G. |date=March 1989|publisher=Tech Trends, Volume 34, Number 2|accessdate=15 April 2010|doi=10.1007/BF02782073|volume=34|journal=TechTrends|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor sound reproduction, unreliable signal quality, and inflexibility of access are seen as disadvantages.&lt;ref name=Wipf&gt;Wipf, Joseph A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/327687 "Shortwave Radio and the Second Language Class."] ''The Modern Language Journal.'' 68.1 (Spring 1984): 7–8. JSTOR. 3 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Some humanitarian organizations like ''Ears to Our World'' distribute portable, self-powered shortwave radios to less developed parts of the globe, enabling people in remote, impoverished parts of the world to get educational programming, local and international news, emergency information and music. Recently, the group was involved in sending radios to [[Haiti]] so victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] could stay abreast of local disaster recovery efforts.&lt;ref name="dxing2004"/&gt;

==Equipment==
{{Main|Shortwave radio receiver}}
Radios for shortwave reception generally have higher performance than those intended for the local [[mediumwave]], [[longwave]] or [[FM broadcast band]], since dependable reception of shortwave signals requires a radio with increased [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]], [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]], [[dynamic range]] and [[frequency stability]]. Modern shortwave radio receivers are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, and many hobbyists use portable "world band" receivers and built-in telescopic [[antenna (radio)|antennas]].

Serious hobbyists may use expensive (shortwave) [[communications receiver]]s and outdoor antenna located away from electrical noise sources, such as a [[dipole antenna|dipole]] made from wire and insulators.

==Future of shortwave listening==
The rise of the [[Internet]] has resulted in many [[broadcasting|broadcasters]] ceasing their shortwave transmissions in favor of broadcasting over the [[World Wide Web]]. When [[BBC World Service]] discontinued service to Europe, North America, [[Australasia]], and the [[Caribbean]], it generated many protests and activist groups such as the Coalition to Save the BBC World Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savebbc.org/ Save the BBC World Service.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the shifting of resources from shortwave to Internet and television by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. international broadcasting, has also resulted in reduced broadcasting hours in the English language. [[Radio Netherlands]], [[Voice of Russia]] (formerly [[Radio Moscow]]), [[Radio Canada International]] and [[Radio Australia]] are among the prominent broadcasters who have ceased broadcasting on shortwave. Although most of the prominent broadcasters continue to scale back their analog shortwave transmissions or completely terminate them, shortwave is still very common and active in developing regions such as parts of Africa.

Some international broadcasters have turned to a digital mode of broadcasting called [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts to as much as one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drm.org/ ''Digital Radio Mondiale'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortwave listening also remains popular with some [[expatriates]] who tune in shortwave transmissions from their homeland. Additionally, a number of remotely controlled shortwave receivers located around the world are available to users on the web.&lt;ref name="Petruzzellis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petruzzellis|first=Thomas |title=22 Radio and Receiver Projects for the Evil Genius|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2007|isbn= 978-0-07-148929-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJBBf5hCYqIC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=web+controlled+shortwave+receiver#v=onepage&amp;q=web%20controlled%20shortwave%20receiver&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; While radio hobbyists report that the number of shortwave listening clubs has diminished and printed magazines devoted to the hobby are few, enthusiasts such as [[Glenn Hauser]] and others continue to populate web sites, and originate podcasts dedicated to the pursuit.&lt;ref name="Groenendaal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.co.za/article/is-there-a-future-for-shortwave-listening-as-a-hobby.html|title=Is there a future for shortwave listening as a hobby?|last=van de Groenendaal |first=Hans |date=January 7, 2009 |publisher=EE Publishers|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8672">{{short description|A subset of Antarctic Bottom Water mass that is at -0.7 °C or colder}}
'''Weddell Sea Bottom Water''' (WSBW) is a subset of [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] (AABW) that is at a temperature of -0.7&amp;nbsp;°C or colder. It consists of a higher salinity branch and a lower salinity branch. It originates in the [[Weddell Sea]] and closely follows the sea floor as it flows out into the rest of the world's oceans. It is created mainly due to the high surface winds blowing off the Antarctic continent which helps cool and oxygenate it.  It flows at a rate of 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;[[Sverdrup|Sv]] and contributes to the overall flow of the AABW.

==Introduction==
The [[Weddell Sea]] plays an important role in the movement of the world's oceans.  An important part of the Weddell Sea is Weddell Sea Bottom Water (WSBW). WSBW is a major contributor to [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] (AABW). While WSBW is considered part of AABW, the distinction comes in its [[potential temperature]]. The potential temperature of WSBW is -0.7&amp;nbsp;°C. At this temperature, the potential temperature vs. salinity chart shows a sharp change in slope. The outflow of WSBW is influenced greatly by the [[Scotia Ridge]]. The movement of WBSW is listed as 16&amp;nbsp;Sv which contributes to a total 97&amp;nbsp;Sv outflow of AABW. 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;Sv of this production is newly formed bottom water off the Antarctic coast.&lt;ref name="Carmack and Foster, 1975"&gt;Carmack, Eddy C. and Foster, Theodore D., ''On the Flow of Water out of the Weddell Sea'', Deep-Sea Research, 1975, Vol. 22, pp. 711 to 724. Pergamon Press. Printed in Great Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The [[Weddell Sea]] is characterized by a cyclonic [[gyre]] bounded on the south by the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]], on the west by the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], on the north by the [[Scotia Ridge]], and extending as far east as 20 to 30°E. The precursor to bottom water formation is derived from the broad continental shelf west of 40°W where brine released during sea-ice formation produces a large reservoir of cold (0 to - 1.8&amp;nbsp;°C), high salinity (S ≥ 34.62&amp;nbsp;[[Practical salinity unit|psu]]) shelf water. This water mass then mixes with a modified form of [[Warm Deep Water]] near the edge of the continental shelf to form a dense layer of bottom water, which in turn sinks along the continental slope and flows cyclonically around the western and northern perimeter of the Weddell Sea basin. Because large quantities of the high salinity water are observed on the continental shelf even during summer, bottom water may form throughout the year.&lt;ref name="Carmack and Foster, 1975"/&gt;

Weddell Sea Bottom Water exhibits two forms: a low-salinity, better oxygenated component confined to the outer rim of the [[Weddell Gyre]], and a more saline, less oxygenated component observed farther into the gyre. The more saline WSBW is derived from the southwestern Weddell Sea, where high salinity shelf water is abundant. The less saline WSBW, like the more ventilated [[Weddell Sea Deep Water]] (WSDW), is derived from lower-salinity shelf water at a point farther north along the Antarctic Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Gordon, Visbeck, and Huber, 2001"&gt;Gordon, Arnold L., Visbeck, Martin, and Huber, Bruce, ''Export of Weddell Sea Deep and Bottom Water'', Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 106, No. C5, pp. 9005-9017, May 15, 2001, DOI: 2000JC000281&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to distinguish between AABW and a subclass of this water mass, WSBW. WSBW is characterized by lower potential temperatures and larger near-bottom temperature gradients, suggesting recent formation in the southwestern and western Weddell Sea. As this bottom water spreads from its region of sinking, it eventually mixes with the warmer and more saline water above to form AABW. Along the Scotia Ridge-Cape Norvegia section, potential temperature values at depths greater than {{convert|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}} range from -0.94 to -0.63&amp;nbsp;°C, while salinity values range from 34.639 to 34.652&amp;nbsp;[[Practical salinity unit|psu]]. The northern limit of the core of Weddell Sea Bottom Water lies against the southern edge of the Scotia Ridge, suggesting that the circulation and property distributions are strongly influenced by [[bathymetry]].&lt;ref name="Carmack and Foster, 1975"/&gt;

==Transport==
The transport of Weddell Sea Bottom Water out of the Weddell Sea represents the outflow of newly formed bottom water plus entrained bottom water that enters the Weddell Sea from the southeast. Carmack and Foster estimated the production rate of bottom water from the mixing ratio of newly formed bottom water to entrained bottom water. Bottom water formation models based on hydrographic observations suggested that the bottom water formed at the edge of the continental shelf has an initial temperature of -1.4 to -1.2&amp;nbsp;°C. This range also represents the coldest bottom water observed at the base of the continental slope in the northwestern corner of the Weddell Sea. The fraction of newly formed bottom water in the outflowing WSBW ranges from about 12 to 31%, so the flow of newly formed bottom water out of the Weddell Sea is about 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;Sv.&lt;ref name="Carmack and Foster, 1975"/&gt; On the other hand, the much larger production rates sometimes proposed are probably estimates of the total transport of bottom water out of the Weddell Sea that include a large fraction of Antarctic Bottom Water entering the Weddell Sea from the southeast.

The low-salinity, better ventilated forms of WSDW and WSBW flowing along the outer rim of the Weddell Gyre have the position and depth range that would lead to overflow of the topographic confines of the Weddell Basin, whereas the more saline forms may be forced to recirculate within the Weddell Gyre are carried by the western boundary current of the Weddell Sea into the northwest corner of the Weddell Gyre. From there, these water masses flow eastward, either within the northern limb of the Weddell Gyre or reaching northward into the Scotia Sea, eventually cooling the lower 2&amp;nbsp;km of the world ocean as Antarctic Bottom Water.&lt;ref name="Gordon, Visbeck, and Huber, 2001"/&gt;

It is proposed that the more saline, lower-oxygen WSBW is derived from shelf water descending into the deep ocean in the southwest Weddell Sea. The higher salinity of this WSBW is due to injection of high-salinity shelf water characteristic of the region. Fahrbach et al. propose that low-salinity bottom water is formed near the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]].&lt;ref name="Gordon, Visbeck, and Huber, 2001"/&gt;

==Climate impacts==
McKee et al., conducted a study of the variability of bottom water temperature relative to [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO), [[Southern Annular Mode]] (SAM), and [[Antarctic Dipole]] (ADP). This study was conducted to discover the impact WSBW has on the global climate. An 8-year time study of the potential temperature of the Weddell Gyre outflow was analyzed.  Interannual variability was discovered in the winters of 1999 and 2002.  The anomalies suggest ENSO influence with a 14-20 month lead time with influences from SAM at 14-20 month lead times as well. Warm ENSO events cause the increase of sea ice advection and more coastal polynyas which allows for more dense shelf water availability. These ENSO and SAM changes impact the WSBW 14–20 months later. Their research suggests that there needs to be large ENSO and SAM events in order for the anomalies in WSBW temperature can be noticed. These large fluctuations allow for warm and cold pulses in the WSBW. With a strong ENSO event, sea ice is greatly reduced during the summer which exposes more surface water to the wind allowing it sink. This makes the WSBW colder than normal allowing it to inject colder water into much of the world's oceans. If the ENSO even is weak enough, the surface winds off the Antarctic coast can shift direction which creates a reduction in shelf water. This will warm the WSBW as it does not have as much access to the cold, dense surface water.&lt;ref name="McKee, et al., 2011"&gt;McKee, Darren C., Yuan, Xiaojun, Gordon, Arnold L., Huber, Bruce A., and Dong, Zhaoqian, ''Climate impact on interannual variability of Weddell Sea Bottom Water'', Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 116, C05020, {{doi|10.1029/2010JC006484}}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
