'''''Adventure Rock''''' (previously known as '''''CBBC World''''') was a virtual online world for children based on Ketnetkick,&lt;ref name=ARCredits&gt;''Adventure Rock'' Credits, found within the game interface&lt;/ref&gt; and created by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in association with [[Ketnet]], owned and operated by the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep]] (VRT), Flanders' public broadcaster.&lt;ref name=LJ&gt;{{cite news| publisher= Lizzie Jackson| accessdate= 2008-03-06| date= 2007-11-30| url= http://lizziejackson.com/2007/11/30/adventure-rock/| title= Adventure Rock| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080228051343/http://lizziejackson.com/2007/11/30/adventure-rock/| archivedate= 28 February 2008| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was originally aimed at the Belgian market, but was redeveloped for a UK audience of children aged between 6–12 years old.&lt;ref name=Epicentre&gt;{{cite news|publisher = Epicentre|accessdate = 2008-03-06|url=http://www.epicentre.co.uk/newsletter/|title =Epicentre Newsletter}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on the system was on safety and responsibility, with no [[chatrooms]] or the financial aspects available in other online worlds such as [[Linden Lab]]'s ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name=brisbane&gt;{{cite news|publisher = Brisbane Times|accessdate = 2008-03-06|date=2007-10-09|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/technology/bbc-launches-virtual-world/2007/10/09/1191695864322.html|title =BBC Launches Virtual World| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080211215954/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/technology/bbc-launches-virtual-world/2007/10/09/1191695864322.html| archivedate= 11 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
''[Adventure Rock]'' is a good example of the way we need to go. The thing that interests me is that children are at the vanguard. And that is where we are taking Children's BBC.

}}
Adventure Rock was shut down in 2009 due to lack of popularity, updates and repairs.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:AdventureRockScreenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot from open Beta Testing of Adventure Rock]]
''Adventure Rock'' consists of a large virtual world which players explore using customised avatars. They are accompanied by Cody, a floating robot who guides and helps the player.

The game starts with a tutorial in which Cody teaches the player how to control the avatar. Following that, the player is 'dropped' onto Adventure Rock, and is free to explore. There are a number of continuous tasks to do, such as collecting the hundreds of cog-shaped tokens, or pages torn from a book, the purpose of which was still unknown at the time of the game's closure. In doing these, the player gains points. There are also a number of different 'studios', including an art studio, a music studio and an animation studio, in which the player can create their own animations etc. which can then be submitted to [[CBBC]].

There are a number of areas which were closed off, such as a [[roller coaster]]. Some of these were released over time but the game was taken down with many areas still locked.

===Story===
The game was based around a story narrated on the ''Adventure Rock'' website. The story section of the website states that:&lt;ref name=ARStory&gt;{{cite web | title = BBC - CBBC - Adventure Rock - The Story | publisher = BBC | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/adventurerock/thestory | accessdate = 2008-03-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080228103118/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/adventurerock/thestory| archivedate= 28 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
A short while ago a strange rift appeared on the CBBC website leading to an unknown world. A decision was made to send in two of our hosts to study the strange world. This is the report they sent back from a world that holds more questions than answers...
}}

The website then continues in the style of a blog written by the hosts sent to explore the world, detailing various discoveries made by the hosts. The blog goes on to detail how the hosts are returning to the studio to examine the pages found, and that they need more help, and will hence be sending in CBBC users to investigate further.

==Research==
''Adventure Rock'' was the subject of a year-long joint research project between [[CBBC]] and the [[University of Westminster]], funded by BBC Future Media and Technology, and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] which began in July 2007, and aims to look at how children engage with virtual worlds.&lt;ref name=AHRC&gt;{{cite web | title = AHRC/BBC Knowledge Exchange Programme: Summary of Awards 2007 | publisher = AHRC | url = http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/images/ahrc_bbc_summary_awards.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-03-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022055253/http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/images/ahrc_bbc_summary_awards.pdf| archivedate = October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first time the BBC has run a structured commissioning round calling for research in partnership with academia.&lt;ref name=LJ/&gt; ''Adventure Rock'' will be studied from both an audience and producer’s point of view, with the hope of finding out how children create imaginary places and spaces in the real world, how children wish ''Adventure Rock'' to develop, how producers should adapt the way they engage with children around the ''Adventure Rock'' ‘brand’ (which includes the service, website, message boards etc.) and what parents think of ''Adventure Rock'' (specifically whether the service changes their perception of ''Adventure Rock'' and/or virtual worlds in general).&lt;ref name=LJ/&gt;

The project will also study why the BBC chose to make ''Adventure Rock'' a closed world where users' avatars cannot meet or communicate, and what children think of this.&lt;ref name=artlab&gt;{{cite web| title = Audience and producer engagement with immersive worlds (Case study: ''Adventure Rock'')| publisher = Artlab| url = http://www.artlab.org.uk/ahrc-bbc-project.htm| accessdate = 2008-03-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080406070456/http://www.artlab.org.uk/ahrc-bbc-project.htm| archivedate= 6 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research workshops have already taken place in December 2007 and January 2008, with 75 participants aged 7–11 years, in five mixed socio-economic and ethnic groups located in Scotland, Wales, N Ireland, and England.&lt;ref name=artlab/&gt; At this workshop the children were asked to talk about imaginary spaces and places, and suggest what they would like to see in a virtual world. Six weeks later, during which the children were asked to explore ''Adventure Rock'', a second workshop was held in which the children made creative suggestions about what they would add or remove from this virtual place.&lt;ref name=artlab/&gt; Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their feelings about their children participating in this virtual world.&lt;ref name=artlab/&gt; In addition, a researcher spent time observing the producers and hosts of CBBC, completing a detailed research diary, which was then used to note congruencies and disparities between producers' expectations and children's own responses.&lt;ref name=artlab/&gt;

The findings have been presented at the Conference on Virtual Worlds for Children, on 23 May 2008.&lt;ref name=LJ/&gt;

==Criticism==
''Adventure Rock'' received many complaints from its users. For example, on the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mbcbbc/NF19369152 CBBC Games Messageboards], many have stated that they have problems downloading, opening or playing the game. Lack of support for these led to many players abandoning the game and to its eventual shutdown.

{{nihongo|'''''Akai Ito'''''|アカイイト||lit. "Red Thread"}} is a Japanese horror [[adventure game]] by [[Success Corporation]], released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on October 21, 2004. A reduced price "popular edition," included in developer and publisher [[Success (company)|SUCCESS]]' ''SuperLite 2000 Series'', was released on October 27, 2005. The title refers to the mythical [[red string of fate]].
Akai Ito has not been officially released outside Japan, but there has been a fan effort to translate it, similar to the popular [[dōjin]] game ''[[Tsukihime]]''.

==Story==
To arrange the inheritance because of the loss of her mother, Kei Hatō heads for her father's house in Hemizuka. In the train on the way there, Kei has a mysterious dream of a huge tree and a woman who seems to be lost in sadness. In Hemizuka, Kei learns the secret concealed in her own blood through various meeting with an [[Oni (folklore)|Oni]] Slayer, a friend of her late mother, a young girl accompanied by a white fox, and even the mysterious girl from her dreams. Throughout the story Kei is antagonized by the twin oni Nozomi and Mikage. Akai Ito's story varies greatly based upon the player's decisions, which not only affect the flow of the story but also the ending the player receives (several of which suggest romantic feelings among the female characters).

[[File:Association of American Weather Observers logo.jpg|thumb|AAWO logo created in 2006 and used until 2010]]

The '''Association of American Weather Observers''' was a group of amateur weather observers from around the United States. Their aim was to educate the public on weather awareness and to simply share stories among themselves on recent extreme weather that they viewed at their location.

The AAWO originally began in 1983 in [[Westwood, New Jersey]] as a group of weather enthusiasts came together in October of that year to create the organization.  The AAWO disbanded in 1993 due to conflicts of interests. In 2005, a new weather [[organization]] under the same name was created to try to bring back what once existed within the old AAWO. Unlike the old [[organization]], the new AAWO has yet to create a [[President]] and [[Board of directors]]. The AAWO that was established in 1983 and ended in 1993 is in no way affiliated with nor associated with the later organization that was established in 2005. However, some who were prominent members of the first AAWO had shown support for the new surge in bringing back the organization.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

== Education, communication, cooperation==
When the AAWO began in 1983, their [[motto]] was "Education, Communication, Cooperation" and opened the door for amateur weather observers from all over the United States to communicate with each other via the American Weather Observer newspaper publication. Before the AAWO there was no nationally recognized organization for the amateur weather hobbyist to share stories and observational data among each other. The group not only had individual memberships, but also had a lengthy list of [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] organizations that were mostly local or regional groups from within the U.S.. The restart of the AAWO in 2005 had the same basic plans as the old group had in 1983. One of the differences between the group created in 1983 versus 2005 is, in 2005, the American Weather Observer publication was owned and operated by the AAWO, where the publication created in 1984 was a separate entity owned by the Belvidere Republican in [[Belvidere, Illinois]], and only affiliated themselves with the AAWO organization created in 1983 as the newspapers official network.

== History ==
[[Image:Aawo old.JPG|thumb|left|AAWO logo created in 1983 and used until 1993]]

*1983: The '''Association of American Weather Observers''' (AAWO) was created.

'''Bessie Loo''' (December 30, 1902 – October 28, 1998) was an American actress, casting director, and talent agent. She owned the Bessie Loo Talent Agency for over 40 years, and represented many of the Asian-American actors in 20th-century Hollywood.

==Early life ==
Loo was born as Bessie Sue in [[Hanford, California]]. Loo's father, Sue Chung Kee, immigrated to Hanford from China in 1886, and operated a general store there; Loo's mother was born in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Ling, [http://imdiversity.com/villages/asian/bessie-loo-delbert-wong-and-richard-wing-of-hanford-cas-china-alley/ "Bessie Loo, Delbert Wong, and Richard Wing of Hanford, CA's China Alley"] IMDiversity (October 20, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Sue Chung Kee Store, Hanford,” San Joaquin Valley &amp; Sierra Foothill Photo Heritage, accessed September 4, 2015, http://photoheritage.sjvls.org/document/652.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sue family lived above their store.

== Education ==
Loo attended the [[University of California at Los Angeles]], and graduated from [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco Teachers College]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Jack Ong, [http://www.jackong.com/bessie.html "From Hanford to Hollywood: Remembering Bessie Loo"] ''Gum Saan Journal'' (2007), published by the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
As an actress of Chinese descent, Loo's acting career started in 1930s. Loo mostly played small parts. Loo appeared in ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]'' (1937), and was a maid in ''[[Mr. Wong in Chinatown]]'' (1939); her husband [[Richard Loo]] was also in the cast of both films.  She began working with [[Central Casting]] during the making of ''The Good Earth'', when her language skills proved useful with the many Chinese-speaking extras.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the opening of [[World War II]], Loo started The Bessie Loo Talent Agency, with offices on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in Los Angeles, California. Loo represented Asian-American actors in the film industry,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McNulty, [http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/167350770/F92D3FC42EA444F0PQ/9 "Actress's Odd Career: Locating Orientals"] ''Los Angeles Times'' (August 31, 1958): D3.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Jack Ong]], [[Keye Luke]], [[Robert Ito]], [[Beulah Quo]], [[James Hong]], [[Soon-Tek Oh]], [[Mako Iwamatsu]], [[Joan Chen]], [[Lisa Lu]], and Guy Lee (who eventually took over the agency when Bessie Loo retired). All the founding members of the [[East West Players]] were represented by Bessie Loo.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/james-hong# "Actor James Hong on his agent Bessie Loo informing him he'd been cast on ''Marco Polo''"] Archives of American Television, interview conducted April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Wong, [http://www.aiisf.org/stories-by-author/607-chen-joan "Immigrant Voices: Actress, Director, and Immigrant"] Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Wyss, [http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/371356319/8EB7B443F90A4B54PQ/2 "Lee Deals in Asian Talent"] ''Asian Week'' (December 25, 1987): 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Shearer, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3156966/bessie_loo_1961_page_1_of_2/ "Hollywood Comes to Bessie Loo for Oriental Beauties"] ''Long Beach Independent Press-Telegram'' (January 15, 1961): 78-79. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bessie Loo served as president of the China Society of Southern California,&lt;ref&gt;China Society of Southern California, [http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll32/id/55/rec/4 Recognition of Bessie Loo] (February 17, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Los Angeles Chinese Women's Club.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Cho, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5KzsbYLLzfAC&amp;lpg=PA2 ''Chinatown in Los Angeles''] (Arcade Publishing 2009): cover photo, 2. {{ISBN|9780738569567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was also an appointed member of the California State Economic Development Commission, and a member of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1978 her achievements were honored at a dinner of the [[Chinese Historical Society of Southern California]], and in 1982 her friend and client James Hong organized an event with the Association of Asian Pacific American Artists (AAPAA) called "An Affair with Bessie," to celebrate her career. Just weeks before she died, she was honored for "Excellence in Entertainment" by the [[Chinese American Museum]] of Los Angeles, at their annual Historymakers Awards Banquet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://camla.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Honorees-Over-the-Years.pdf CAMLA Honorees over the Years] Chinese American Museum of Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Loo married actor Richard Loo in 1929; they had twin daughters together, Beverly and Angela, born in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/22/obituaries/richard-loo-actor-5-decades.html "Richard Loo, Actor 5 Decades"] ''New York Times'' (November 22, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Loo died. She was 95 years old.  Archival footage of Loo, and a brief discussion of her work, was featured in the [[Arthur Dong]] documentary ''[[Hollywood Chinese]]'' (2007).

At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster employed 84,300 people worldwide, including about 58,500 in the United States and about 25,800 in other countries, and had 9,094 stores in total, with more than 4,500 of these in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sad End Of Blockbuster Video: The Onetime $5 Billion Company Is Being Liquidated As Competition From Online Giants Netflix And Hulu Prove All Too Much For The Iconic Brand|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/sad-end-blockbuster-video-onetime-5-billion-company-being-liquidated-competition-1496962|website=International Business Times|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= nyt09&gt;{{cite news|title=Other Retailers Find Ex-Blockbuster Stores Just Right|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/business/09blockbuster.html|work=The New York Times|first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|date=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1085734/000119312505063510/d10k.htm|title=Form 10-K|website=www.sec.gov|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6711543/ns/business-us_business/t/blockbuster-end-late-fees/#.WppwOmeWycw|title=Blockbuster to end late fees in 2005|date=December 14, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition from the [[Netflix]] mail-order service, [[Redbox]] automated kiosks, and [[video on demand]] services were major factors in Blockbuster's eventual demise.

==History==
===1985–1997: David Cook era===
Blockbuster's early beginnings can be traced back to another company, Cook Data Services, that was founded by David Cook in 1978.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney&gt;{{cite news|work=CNN Money|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/07/01/347314/index.htm|title=He Began Blockbuster.

In 1987, the company won a court case against [[Nintendo]], which paved the way for video game rental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3146206 |title=History of Videogame Lawsuits from |publisher=1UP.com |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017051248/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3146206 |archivedate=October 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, [[Waste Management, Inc|Waste Management]] co-founder [[Wayne Huizenga]], who originally had reservations about entering the video rental industry, agreed to acquire several Blockbuster stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGeorge|first=Gail|title=The Making of a Blockbuster |year=1997 |publisher= Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-15903-4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point the number of stores counted 19, and attracted Huizenga's associate John Melk's attention due to its efficiency, family-friendly image and business model, and convinced Huizenga to have a look at it. Huizenga and Melk utilized techniques from their waste business and [[Ray Kroc]]'s model of expansion to rapidly expand Blockbuster, and soon they were opening a new store every 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGeorge|first=Gail|title=The Making of a Blockbuster |year=1995|publisher=Wiley|location=Prologue|isbn=0-471-15903-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=XKiGgl36bkgC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=In+1987+John+J.+Melk,+Waste+Management&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzzMX104rZAhXHliwKHTyUDQoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In+1987+John+J.+Melk,+Waste+Management&amp;f=false|title=American Inventors, Entrepreneurs, and Business Visionaries|first=Charles W.|last=Carey|date=May 14, 2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|accessdate=July 13, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; They took over many of the existing Blockbuster franchise stores as well, and Huizenga even spent much of the late 1980s acquiring several of Blockbuster's rivals, including Major Video.

Blockbuster became a multibillion-dollar company, but Huizenga was worried about how new technology could threaten their business, such as [[video on demand]] and the growth of cable television.

The Blockbuster Block Party concept was test-marketed in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] and [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] in 1994.

===1997–2007: John Antioco era===
In 1998, Blockbuster created [[DEJ Productions]], which acquired 225 films primarily to provide exclusive content to its Blockbuster stores prior to being sold off to [[First Look Studios]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Hettrick, Scott. DEJ Deal to First Look. Variety. November 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  During that same year, Blockbuster bought the Irish video rental store [[Xtra-vision]], with over 200 stores in Ireland and the UK. In 2009, Blockbuster sold off its Irish operations to Birchall Investments, with the few Xtra-vision stores in the UK being rebranded as Blockbuster.

In 1998, when DVDs were emerging as the new video medium, [[Warner Bros.]] offered Antioco an exclusive rental deal. Blockbuster would have rights to rent new DVD releases for a period of time before they went on sale to the general public. The studio would receive 40% of rental revenues in return, which was the same deal already in place for VHS rentals. Blockbuster turned the offer down, and the studio responded by lowering their DVD wholesale price in order to compete with the rental industry. [[Walmart]] seized the opportunity and in a few years surpassed Blockbuster as the studios' single largest source of revenue. Other mass retailers soon followed suit. Many began selling DVDs below wholesale price in hopes of selling more items with better profit margins as a result of the additional foot traffic in their stores. Unable to match prices, Blockbuster's business model was severely impacted.&lt;ref name="Last days of Blockbuster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_hollywood_economist/2006/01/hollywoods_new_zombie.html|title=Hollywood's New Zombie: The last days of Blockbuster.|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|date=January 9, 2006|publisher=Slate|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1998, Blockbuster launched a loyalty program called Blockbuster Rewards, where customers could earn free rentals and received an older title, called Blockbuster Favorites, rental free each month. After the 1998 test launch, the chain went nationwide with the program in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/blockbuster-loyalty-put-test-37266/|title=Blockbuster Loyalty Put To Test|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August the same year, Viacom sold the Blockbuster Music chain to Wherehouse Entertainment, which was subsequently purchased by [[Trans World Entertainment]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/news/10237/ |title=Wherehouse Buys Blockbuster Music for $115 million |publisher=Stereophile.com |date=August 16, 1998 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2000, the company partnered with [[Enron]] in an attempt to create a video-on-demand service.&lt;ref name="Enron partnership"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/20/mu4.html#49a68eba3541|title=Enron, Blockbuster Partner For Movie Mania|last=Schiffman|first=Betsy|date=July 20, 2000|work=Forbes.com|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the partnership was supposed to last for 20 years, however, Enron chose to terminate the deal in March 2001 over fears that Blockbuster would not be able to provide sufficient films for the service.&lt;ref name="Enron"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blockbuster's Broadband-Video Deal Collapses|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/11/news/mn-36306|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000 Blockbuster turned down a chance to purchase the still fledgling [[Netflix]] for $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|  title= Your late fees are waived: Blockbuster closes | first=Todd | last= Leopold | publisher= CNN| date=November 6, 2013 | quote= Even Blockbuster's late fees came back to bite the chain in an unlikely way. In 1997, a man named [[Reed Hastings]] returned a late copy of ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' to his local Blockbuster. He was assessed a $40 fee. Two years later, he founded Netflix.  Blockbuster was caught flat-footed by many of these changes. It could have purchased Netflix for $50 million in 2000, but passed. As Netflix rose, Blockbuster's attempts to compete on Netflix's terms—especially through the mail—foundered. It also tried to compete with [[Redbox]] using standalone [[kiosk]]s. That didn't work, either.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Blockbuster acquired Movie Trading Company, a Dallas chain that buys, sells, and trades movies and games, to study potential business models for DVD and game trading. Also that year, it acquired [[Gamestation]], a 64-store UK computer and console games retailer chain, and purchased DVD Rental Central for $1 million, an Arizona father-and-son online DVD-rental company with about ten thousand subscribers. DVD Rental Central would eventually turn into Blockbuster Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=sodDcL2yhsIC&amp;pg=PT67&amp;dq=Blockbuster+Online+DVD+Rental+central&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0t9CpxZDaAhVGjSwKHa1EDV8Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Blockbuster+Online+DVD+Rental+central&amp;f=false|title=Netflixed: The Epic Battle for America's Eyeballs|first=Gina|last=Keating|date=October 11, 2012|publisher=Penguin|accessdate=July 13, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, Blockbuster was officially spun-off from Viacom. Online DVD subscription was introduced on Blockbuster.com, also known as Blockbuster Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://blockbuster.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=563 |title=With Several Million U.S. Households as Potential Customers, Blockbuster Plans to Capture Substantial Share of Online Rentals |publisher=Blockbuster MediaRoom |date=December 31, 2003 |accessdate=January 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201174655/http://blockbuster.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=563 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blockbuster also rolled out its "Game Rush" store-in-store concept to approximately 450 domestic company-operated stores. Blockbuster began game and DVD trading in select U.S. stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://blockbuster.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=574 |title=Blockbuster Launches National DVD and Game Trading Program |publisher=Blockbuster MediaRoom |date=October 25, 2004 |accessdate=January 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201174710/http://blockbuster.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=574 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had more than 9,000 stores in the U.S.&lt;ref name= nyt09/&gt; In December 2004, Blockbuster announced its intention to pursue a hostile [[takeover]] of [[Hollywood Video]], its major U.S. competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some extensions of the tender offer, Blockbuster eventually gave up due primarily to resistance from the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In response to the Blockbuster offer, Hollywood Video agreed to a buyout in January 2005 by a smaller competitor, the [[Dothan, Alabama]]-based [[Movie Gallery]]. Since then, Movie Gallery has filed for bankruptcy twice and its entire chain of stores has been liquidated.

In May 2005, financier [[Carl Icahn]] waged a successful [[proxy fight]] to add himself and two other members to the board. Icahn accused Blockbuster of overpaying chairman and CEO John F. Antioco, who had served in that capacity since 1997, receiving $51.6 million in compensation for 2004. Icahn was also at odds with Antioco on how to revive profit at Blockbuster; Antioco scrapped late fees in January, started an internet service, and wanted to keep the company independent, while Icahn wanted to sell out to a [[private equity]] firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/business/carl-icahn-wins-seat-on-blockbusters-board/13719/ |title=Carl Icahn Wins Seat on Blockbuster's Board – May 12, 2005 – The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2005 Blockbuster began running a campaign promoting a "No more late fees" policy.&lt;ref name="fastcompanylatefee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carr|first1=Austin|title=Blockbuster Bankruptcy: A Decade of Decline|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1690654/blockbuster-bankruptcy-decade-decline|website=Fastcompany|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign proved controversial with [[Associated Press]] reporting that the new policy actually charged users the full price of the movie or game after eight days which they could cancel by returning the product in question and paying a fee.&lt;ref name="APlatefees"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blockbuster Settles Over 'No Late Fees'|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1414947/blockbuster-settles-over-no-late-fees|website=Billboardbiz|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 40 states filed suit against the company for false advertising.&lt;ref name="APlatefees"/&gt; Blockbuster would later settle the suit agreeing to refund customers as well as promising to better explain the policy.&lt;ref name="APlatefees"/&gt;

In 2006, [[Vintage Stock (retailer)|Vintage Stock]] acquired the Movie Trading Company name from Blockbuster and continues to use the name for Dallas-area stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagestock.com/about-vintage-stock|title=About Us - Vintage Stock / Movie Trading Co. - Music, Movies, Video Games and More!|publisher=|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A billion-dollar campaign called Total Access was introduced in 2007 as a strategy against Netflix. Through Blockbuster Online customers could rent a DVD online and receive a new movie for free when they returned it to a Blockbuster store. While it was a major success every free movie cost the company two dollars, but the hope was that it would attract enough new subscribers to cover the loss. Netflix felt threatened, and Hastings approached Antioco with a suggestion to buy Blockbuster's online business. In return, a new system would be introduced where customers could return their movies to a Blockbuster store. Before the deal could be realized, investor Carl Icahn interfered. Icahn refused to let the company lose more money through Total Access. Antioco was pushed out and replaced with James Keyes, who rejected Hasting's proposal, raised the price on online DVD rentals and put an end to the free movie deal. As a consequence, Blockbuster Online's previously massive growth quickly stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/14/how-blockbuster-almost-beat-netfilx.aspx|title=How Blockbuster Almost Beat Netfilx|first=Aaron|last=Sankin|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July Antioco left the company, reportedly due to continued controversy over his compensation. He left with a $24.7 million severance package.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2034688520070320 | agency=Reuters | title=UPDATE 5-Blockbuster CEO to leave with lower pay package | date=March 20, 2007 | first=Gina | last=Keating}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2007, after a pilot program launched in late 2006, Blockbuster announced that it had chosen [[Blu-ray]] over [[HD DVD]] rental format to rent in a majority of its stores. In the pilot program, Blockbuster offered selected titles for rental and sale in 250 stores. Blockbuster stocked Blu-ray titles in almost 5,000 stores across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvpredictions.com/blockbusterblu041008.htm |title=Blockbuster: Blu-ray In Almost 5,000 Stores |publisher=TVpredictions.com |date=April 10, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720172603/http://www.tvpredictions.com/blockbusterblu041008.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–2011: James Keyes era===
On July 2, 2007, the company named [[James W. Keyes]], former president and CEO of [[7-Eleven]], as the new chairman and CEO. He introduced a new business strategy that included enhancements to existing stores along with a shift to streaming video with the acquisition of MovieLink in September 2008.  Part of the plan was to de-emphasize the unprofitable Total Access (DVD-by-mail) service, in favor of online streaming. In December 2008, he still ignored both Netflix and Redbox, focusing on Apple and Walmart instead; "Neither RedBox nor Netflix are even on the radar screen in terms of competition. It's more Walmart and Apple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/12/10/blockbuster-ceo-has-answers.aspx|title=Blockbuster CEO Has Answers|first=Rick|last=Munarriz|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2007, Blockbuster GB Ltd bought a number of retail stores from ChoicesUK plc. ChoicesUK is an AIM-listed multi-channel distributor and retailer of DVDs, computer games, and CDs. The sale secured employment for approximately 450 employees across 59 stores in the UK. As part of the transaction, Blockbuster GB rebranded the stores as Blockbuster.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

On February 17, 2008, Blockbuster proposed a buyout of struggling [[Circuit City Stores|Circuit City]]. However, after a [[due diligence]] review of Circuit City's financial books, Blockbuster withdrew its offer in July 2008. Analysts were not favorable to the proposed deal, viewing it as a desperate effort to save two struggling retailers rather than a bold turnaround initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1436008820080414 | agency=Reuters | title=Blockbuster-Circuit City deal gets thumbs down | date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Circuit City filed for bankruptcy on November 10, 2008 and, after liquidating all of its stores, ceased operations on March 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Musil |first=Steven |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9982618-7.html |title= Blockbuster abandons Circuit City bid &amp;#124; News Blog – CNET News |publisher=cnet.com |date=July 1, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2010, Blockbuster announced that it would cease all its operations in Portugal, closing down 17 outlets and leaving over 100 workers unemployed. Blockbuster representatives in Portugal blamed [[internet piracy]] and the lack of government response to it as the key factors to the company's failure in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/10/blockbuster-files-for-bankruptcy-in-portugal-blames-internet-pi/ |title=Blockbuster files for bankruptcy in Portugal, and blames internet piracy. |publisher=Engadget |date=February 10, 2010 |accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Blockbuster began "Additional Daily Rates", or "ADRs", for rentals not returned by their due date in the United States, having already used this procedure in other countries such as the UK for many years. An ADR was charged for each day a member kept the rental beyond the rental terms. 
On March 12, 2010, [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], Blockbuster's independent registered public accounting firm, issued its audit opinion disclosing substantial doubt about Blockbuster's ability to continue as a [[going concern]]. This report was included in Blockbusters's 10-K SEC filing. On March 17, 2010, Blockbuster issued a bankruptcy warning after continued drops in revenue threatened its ability to service its nearly $1 billion debt load. By April 1, 2010, Carl Icahn had resigned from Blockbuster's board of directors and sold nearly all his remaining Blockbuster stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/globe-investor-blog/carl-icahn-unwinding-blockbuster-stake/article1521533/|location=Canada|work=The Globe and Mail|first=Jonathan|last=Stempel|title=Carl Icahn unwinding Blockbuster stake|date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbuster paired up with [[Time Warner]] to have [[Warner Bros.]] movies made available in Blockbuster stores on the DVD release date and not be subject to a four-week delay.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Similar agreements were also made with [[Universal Studios|Universal]] and [[20th Century Fox]].

In May 2010,  the liquidation of [[Movie Gallery]] began, eliminating Blockbuster's primary competitor. During the same month, a dissident shareholder, Gregory S. Meyer, in an effort to be elected to Blockbuster's board of directors, engaged in a [[proxy battle]] with Blockbuster's board, alleging that the board had been responsible for significant destruction of value to shareholders. Meyer was elected to the board at Blockbuster's shareholder meeting in Dallas on June 24, 2010.

On July 1, 2010, the company was delisted from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] after its shareholders failed to pass a [[reverse stock split]] plan aimed at heading off involuntary delisting because of the stock's trading at well below $1 per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|title=Blockbuster says to delist from NYSE|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/32156/20100702/blockbuster-says-to-delist-from-nyse.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708072947/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/32156/20100702/blockbuster-says-to-delist-from-nyse.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 8, 2012|accessdate=September 26, 2010|work=Thomson Reuters|publisher=International Business Times|date=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock was then traded on the [[OTC Bulletin Board|OTCBB]] (over-the-counter bulletin board).

Blockbuster was unable to make a $42.4 million interest payment to bondholders and was given until August 13, 2010 to pay off the debt. The company hired Jeff Stegenga to be its chief restructuring officer (CRO) in an effort to satisfy bondholder demands and recapitalize the company. After failing to pay on August 13, bondholders gave Blockbuster until September 30, 2010.

On August 26, 2010, news media reported that Blockbuster was planning to file a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy in mid-September. In light of this news, the company's chief financial officer (CFO), Tom Casey, resigned on September 11. He was replaced by Dennis McGill, formerly CFO of Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. On September 23, 2010, Blockbuster filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] due to challenging losses, $900 million in debt, and strong competition from [[Netflix]], [[Redbox]], and video on-demand services.&lt;ref&gt;James Surowiecki, The Next Level, The New Yorker, October 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blockbuster Chapter 11 Petition|url=http://www.pacermonitor.com/view/PXDYCPY/Blockbuster_Inc.__nysbke-10-14997__0001.0.pdf|website=PacerMonitor|publisher=PacerMonitor|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Movie Gallery|Movie Gallery/Hollywood Video]] had filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation]] earlier in 2010 for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/09/23/blockbuster-files-for-chapter-11/|title=Blockbuster files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy|first=Thomas|last=Ricker|date=September 23, 2010|publisher=[[Engadget]]|format=blog|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Blockbuster's landlords objected to its assumption of leases that it sought to assign to soon-to-be-owner [[Dish Network]] Corp., claiming that they did not have adequate assurance that the new owner would honor those leases.

On January 13, 2012, Dish CEO Aaron Kask announced that while Dish had planned to keep 90% of the stores in operation, meaning around 15,000 employees would remain employed, because of market factors "there are ones that aren't going to make it. We will close unprofitable stores. We will close additional stores." Kask did not say when these additional closings would happen and only remarked that some stores were unprofitable. The Dish chief would not say which stores the company was planning to close, but that each potential closing was to be assessed on a "case by case basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-57358556-17/dish-closing-more-blockbuster-stores-than-expected/|title=Dish closing more Blockbuster stores than expected|date=January 13, 2012|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
The standard business model for video rental stores had traditionally been to pay a large flat fee per video, approximately $65, and offer unlimited rentals for the lifetime of the medium itself. [[Sumner Redstone]], whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept a 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through [[Rentrak]]. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized on the fact that movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher [[Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price|manufacturer's suggested retail price]] targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70–$100 per title.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Quantity and selection of titles===
Blockbuster stores followed a strategy of emphasizing access to the most popular new releases, obtaining early access and stocking many copies of the new-release titles, with a relatively smaller depth of selection than traditional independent video stores.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Nathan |date=February 22, 2011 |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/anyone-want-to-buy-blockbuster-d8b5d4d0e8b7/ |title=Anyone Want to Buy Blockbuster? |access-date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the shelf space in the stores was devoted to popular titles that were placed relatively sparsely on the shelves with the entire front cover visible, so customers could browse casually and quickly, rather than having a more diverse selection with fewer copies of each title. In contrast, independent video rental shops typically tended to stock a broad selection of older titles that were placed densely on shelves with only the spines visible as in a traditional book library. Blockbuster sometimes contracted with studios to obtain earlier access to new titles than other companies could achieve. Examples of such contracts were those in which Blockbuster became the exclusive rental chain for new releases from the [[WWE]],  [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[DreamWorks]], [[Universal Studios]], [[The Weinstein Company]], [[Miramax]], [[Lionsgate]], [[Disney]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[MGM]], [[Sony]], [[Image Entertainment]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[New Line Cinema]] and Allumination FilmWorks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-11-15-blockbuster-weinsteins_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Reuters]] | title=Blockbuster signs deal to be exclusive renter for Weinsteins | date=November 15, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.times-news.com/news/local_news/agreement-gives-blockbuster-exclusive-access-to-new-release-warner-bros/article_b70de4b8-a4c7-5355-93be-e6c4ee46b57e.html|title=Agreement gives Blockbuster exclusive access to new release Warner Bros. films|first=Cory GalliherCumberland|last=Times-News|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one commentator complained, "Blockbuster was once an unstoppable giant whose franchises swept across the country putting mom and pop video stores out of business left and right by offering a larger selection of new releases, pricing them at a lower point due to the volume they worked in... Gone were the fragmented, independently owned shops that were often unorganized treasure troves of VHS discoveries. In their place were walls of new releases: hundreds of copies of a small handful of films. Everyone watching the same thing, everyone developing the same limited set of expectations... They put focus entirely on what was new rather than on discovering film history ..."&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

When a title was no longer a new release, each store would retain a few copies of it and typically sell off the rest as "previously viewed" for discounted prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fthismovie.net/2017/09/riske-business-do-you-dig-on.html|title=Riske Business: Do You Dig on Busterverses?|last=Riske|first=Adam|date=September 12, 2017|publisher=fthismovie.net|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older movies would be re-categorized as "Blockbuster Favorite" titles and placed in a different area of the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We Promise You Will Go Home Happy|date=November 6, 1997|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most Blockbuster locations also accepted trade-ins of used movies, TV shows, and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myce.com/news/Blockbuster-nationwide-DVD-and-game-trading-program-9332/|title=Blockbuster nationwide DVD and game trading program|date=October 28, 2004|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Blockbuster's founding in 1985, the chain refused to stock [[Pornographic film|adult films]] in order to portray the brand as family-friendly.&lt;ref name="Rise and Fall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/10867574/1/the-rise-and-fall-of-blockbuster-the-long-rewinding-road.html|title=Blockbuster's Rise and Fall: The Long, Rewinding Road|last=Poggi|first=Jeanine|date=September 23, 2010|publisher=TheStreet, Inc.|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company did carry [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] and unrated films.

===GameRush===
[[File:Blockbuster Blue Ash OH USA.JPG|thumb|GameRush store at a Blockbuster in [[Blue Ash, Ohio]]]]
In the summer of 2003, Blockbuster started converting some stores to GameRush stores. These stores sold and bought DVDs, games, game consoles, and accessories. GameRush was positioned as a direct competitor to stores such as [[GameStop]] and [[Game Crazy]]. Blockbuster used its location status to get instant coverage; it also promoted these stores by hosting video-game tournaments, special trade-in offers, and a more "hip" look to the selection and staff. However, when Blockbuster introduced the discontinuation of late fees, GameRush was put on the chopping block. In April 2007, GameRush stores were reduced back to just a games section.

===Discovery Zone===
Blockbuster invested in the indoor kids play restaurant [[Discovery Zone]]. In 1995, Blockbuster bought more stock to take control of the company. The Discovery Zone chain closed in 1999.

In Australia, the first Blockbuster store was opened in 1991 in [[Melbourne]]. In 1992, the [[Virgin Group]] and Blockbuster Inc entered into a joint venture to set up Australia's first [[Virgin Megastores]] in [[Sydney]], Melbourne, and [[Adelaide]]. This lasted until Virgin sold its interest in the six stores to Blockbuster, which promptly rebranded them in 1993 as Blockbuster Music. In 1994 Australian store numbers rose to 54 with the acquisition of Major Video and Focus chains in both [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]]. In 1995, the growth continued with the opening of the 100th video store in the country. By the end of 1998, Blockbuster Australia opened over 125 stores. In July 1998, Blockbuster Australia launched into [[franchising]] with the conversion of the former Video Flicks franchise group in [[Queensland]], and the former Movieland group in [[Western Australia]] six months later. Also in 1998, the company sold its last two Australian Blockbuster Music stores in [[Pitt Street]], [[Sydney]], and [[Chapel Street, Melbourne]] to Brazin Limited, which incorporated them under its [[Sanity Entertainment]] brand. Throughout 1999 and 2000, Blockbuster Australia quickly expanded its franchise store network through the conversion of smaller groups and the granting of individual franchises. Before 2005, this was done through the acquisition of the Movies Plus Group and the conversion of some individual Movies 4U and Movieland outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onlysydney.com.au/shopping-services/music-video-dvd/rental-outlets/blockbuster | title=Blockbuster Australia: New South Wales stores | publisher=Only Sydney | accessdate=March 26, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131536/http://www.onlysydney.com.au/shopping-services/music-video-dvd/rental-outlets/blockbuster | archivedate=March 27, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/116624/brazin_acquires_brashs/|title=Brazin acquires Brashs|first=Ellen|last=Cresswell|work=[[International Data Group|ARN]]|date=April 22, 1998|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/blockbuster-inc-history/ | title=Blockbuster Inc.

In February 2007, Blockbuster sold its entire Australian store network to Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd. At the time, Blockbuster Australia comprised 370 outlets nationwide – 29 owned by the company and 341 owned by franchisees. [[Video Ezy]] had 518 Australian outlets, all of them being owned by franchisees, pushing the combined group's [[market share]] to 40% of the country's video rental sector. Video Ezy committed to the [[master franchise]] agreement with Blockbuster for 10 years operating the brand with the possibility of renewal for a further 10 years after that. As a consequence of the deal, the company changed its name from Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd to Franchise Entertainment Group (FEG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/opinion-and-analysis/seeking-nerdvana/9862-video-ezy-to-acquire-blockbuster-as-rental-stores-prepare-for-video-download-onslaught|title=Video Ezy to acquire Blockbuster as rental stores prepare for video download onslaught|first=Adam|last=Turner|work=iWire|date=February 23, 2007|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/strategy/video-ezy-takeover-of-blockbuster-gets-green-light.html| title=Video Ezy takeover of Blockbuster gets green light (19 September 2007) | publisher=Smart Company | accessdate=March 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/video-ezy-fast-forwards-with-blockbuster-buy/2007/02/23/1171734021454.html|title=Video Ezy fast forwards with Blockbuster buy|first=AAP|last=Breaking News|work=[[The Age]]|date=February 24, 2007|accessdate=March 26, 2013|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/consumerproducts-SP/idUSN2217493920070223 | title=Blockbuster to sell Australian business to Video Ezy | first=Gina | last=Keating | date=February 23, 2007 | agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Blockbuster was the largest video rental chain in the country, but finances were not good enough due to high rental prices. [[Lojas Americanas]], the largest Brazilian department store, acquired half of the shares and now it is named under "Americanas Express Blockbuster". The store layout was similar to a regular American store with a Game Rush, but instead of games it offers electronics goods like computers and DVD players, groceries like candies and microwave popcorn, and even toys from [[Mattel]] and [[Hasbro]]'s board games. In January 2007, when Blockbuster had 127 stores across Brazil, it sold its Brazilian stake for $87.4 million and gave Lojas Americanas exclusive rights to the Blockbuster brand in the country for 20 years. The average store has an interior on about 400 m2, where 80-100 m2 is dedicated to movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-americanas-acquisition/retailer-americanas-buys-brazil-blockbuster-stores-idUSN2435322120070124|title=Retailer Americanas buys Brazil Blockbuster stores|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varejista.com.br/cases/5676/lojas-americanas|title=Lojas Americanas|date=February 19, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[File:BlockbusterMoncton.JPG|thumb|right|A Blockbuster store in [[Moncton]], New Brunswick, Canada, which featured the 1985–1997 logo]]
In Canada, Blockbuster Canada (established in 1990) had operated independently, and it initially remained financially stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Hollie|title=Business as usual for Blockbuster Canada|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/fp/Business+usual+Blockbuster+Canada/3568643/story.html|accessdate=September 26, 2010|work=Vancouver Sun|date=September 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926120746/http://www.vancouversun.com/business/fp/Business+usual+Blockbuster+Canada/3568643/story.html|archive-date=September 26, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It began a partnership with [[Wind Mobile]] in December 2009, selling mobile phones at all stores in cities where Wind's service was available.

On August 31, 2011, Blockbuster Canada announced that no buyer could be found for its remaining stores that were acceptable to the court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, and that it would wind down operations and close all stores by December 31, 2011. The company had acted as a guarantor towards Blockbuster's remaining debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/blockbuster-to-pull-plug-in-canada/article2149222/ |title=Blockbuster to pull plug in Canada |first1=Marina |last1=Strauss |first2=Iain |last2=Marlow |date=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
Blockbuster came to Denmark in 1996 with the acquisition of the 29 [[Christianshavn]] video stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://politiken.dk/kultur/filmogtv/art5487402/Milliardg%C3%A6ld-truer-verdens-st%C3%B8rste-filmudlejningsk%C3%A6de|title=Milliardgæld truer verdens største filmudlejningskæde|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 they were on its peak with 72 stores across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.business.dk/detailhandel/nu-lukker-blockbuster-butikker|title=Nu lukker Blockbuster butikker|date=July 17, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbuster Video Denmark sold the rights for the Blockbuster brand to the Danish telecommunications corporation TDC in 2013, excluding the 46 remaining brick and mortar stores which continued as RecycleIT A/S, diversifying in refurbishing and reselling consumer electronics in addition sale and rental of games and movies.&lt;ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://detailfolk.dk/detailnyheder/tdc_koeber_danske_blockbuster.html?prsrc=3|title=TDC køber danske Blockbuster|website=detailfolk.dk|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original goal was to rename all the stores before 1 July 2014, when TDC would get the exclusive rights to the brand name in Denmark, but only 12 of them had been renamed at the end of June and RecycleIT A/S filed for bankruptcy the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flatpanels.dk/test.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1404203885|title=TDC: iTunes bliver største konkurrent til Blockbuster test - FlatpanelsDK|website=flatpanels.dk|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flatpanels.dk/nyhed.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1406269924|title=Fra Blockbuster til RecycleIT til Bluecity - FlatpanelsDK|website=www.flatpanels.dk|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12 RecycleIT stores were bought by the company Blue City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordere.dk/2014/08/blue-city-viderefoerer-blockbuster-koncept/|title=Blue City viderefører Blockbuster-koncept - recordere.dk|date=August 2, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new owners planned to gradually phase out game and movie sales and rental within 2016, but due to the fast changes in the market it happened almost immediately after the takeover, and seven of the stores, therefore, closed in 2015. As of 2017, the five remaining ones had started to make some profit, and focus exclusively on second-hand consumer electronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retailnews.dk/article/view/468696/blue_city_er_tradt_ud_af_blockbusters_skygge|title=Blue City er trådt ud af Blockbusters skygge|website=RetailNews|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Blockbuster On Demand service is still active in Nordic Countries, offering both unlimited streaming and 48-hour rental of films online. Several [[Smart TV]]s have the Blockbuster app pre-installed out-of-the-box, and it is available on a variety of streaming devices such as Google's Chromecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Blockbuster (Denmark) |url=http://blockbuster.dk/om/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Blockbuster opened 20 stores in Berlin and Munich and announced plans to open 250 more.{{When|date=July 2018}} The chain presented itself as family friendly by not renting pornographic films. However, that decision left a gap in the profitability of the stores. Blockbuster left the German market in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/videotheken-blockbuster-ist-pleite/5682592.html |title=Blockbuster ist pleite |publisher=[[WirtschaftsWoche]] | date = September 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Blockbuster announced that it intended to sell all operations in Europe. The company once had an Irish subsidiary, [[Xtravision]], which did not operate under the Blockbuster [[brand name]]. Blockbuster sold Xtravision at a loss in August 2009 to Birchhall Investments Limited. In early 2016 it was decided to close all of its 83 stores except for its online business and vending machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/xtra-vision-killed-by-christmas-sales-collapse-court-told-1.2512923|title=Xtra-vision killed by Christmas sales collapse, court told|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/no-sequel-as-final-credits-roll-for-xtra-vision-1.2515757|title=No sequel as final credits roll for Xtra-vision|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In the late 2000s at its peak, Blockbuster Israel had 40 branches and more than 260 automated video rentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ima.org.il/yahadclub|title=מועדון יחד - מועדון צרכנות לרופאים -|first=|last=SLATECH|website=מועדון יחד - מועדון צרכנות לרופאים - ההסתדרות הרפואית בישראל|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globes.co.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000730869#utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=facebook|title=14 סניפי טאוור רקורדס נסגרו; בלוקבסטר הפסיקה לפעול|first=אילנית|last=חיות|website=Globes|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Blockbuster closed off its last branch store, and had only 80 automated video rentals left.&lt;ref name="globes.co.il"/&gt;

===Japan===
In March 1991, [[Den Fujita|Fujita Den Trading]] (which was the [[master franchise]] owner of [[McDonald's]] in Japan) and Blockbuster Inc entered into a joint venture to established Japan's first Blockbuster Video stores. By October 1992, Fujita and Blockbuster opened 15 stores in the country – four of them next to McDonald's outlets and most being located in the [[Greater Tokyo Area|greater Tokyo area]]. Unlike Blockbuster's U.S. stores, each Japanese outlet only occupied about half the floor space at 5,000 square feet due to the country's more limited available real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-10-05/business/9002170929_1_blockbuster-wally-knief-den-fujita|title=Blockbuster Plans A Move Into Japan|first=Lane|last=Kelley|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=October 5, 1990|accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1992-10-18/they-dont-call-it-blockbuster-for-nothing|title=They Don't Call It Blockbuster For Nothing|date=October 18, 1992|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1996, 32 stores were in operation with a public aim for 150 by 1998. Blockbuster Japan faced heavy competition from [[Osaka]]-based video rental chain, [[Tsutaya (video store)|Tsutaya]], with its 817 outlets, but the company saw opportunity in the population having high [[VCR]] ownership levels (at around 75%), low satellite TV penetration (at around 27%), and well-ordered store layouts (unique for most local video stores).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-18/business/fi-16261_1_blockbuster-video|title=Blockbuster Moving In on Japan's Video Market|first=Yuri|last=Kageyama|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 18, 1996|accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blockbuster's business strategy of "wholesome home entertainment" saw it not stock [[adult entertainment]] or extreme [[horror films]] where they account for 35% of the Japanese video market. That meant Blockbuster was unable to fit into the Japanese market adequately and was put at a disadvantage to other businesses selling and renting these movies. In 1999, Blockbuster handed its remaining shares over to Fujita Den Trading and exited the Japanese market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gcrossinc.com/en/info_exampleFailure.htm | title=Examples of Failure for Market Entry into Japan | publisher=G-Cross Inc. | accessdate=April 5, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104003641/http://www.gcrossinc.com/en/info_exampleFailure.htm | archivedate=November 4, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In September 2015, all remaining Blockbuster retail stores (263 in total) in Mexico had been converted to "The B Store", and the floor space dedicated to video rentals reduced from 70% to 20%, the remaining space being used for general technology and electronics sales. The re-branding occurred with the owners not renewing their license with Blockbuster and the imminent expiry of the existing license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expansion.mx/negocios/2015/09/18/blockbuster-desaparece-en-mexico-conoce-su-nueva-imagen |title=Blockbuster desaparece en México, lo sustituye The B-Store |website=[[Expansión (Mexico)|Expansión]] |date=September 21, 2015 |accessdate=August 26, 2016}} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/farewell-blockbuster-here-comes-b-store/|title=Farewell Blockbuster, here comes The B-Store|date=September 21, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was reported that all the remaining B-stores were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://expansion.mx/empresas/2016/10/28/grupo-salinas-cierra-su-tienda-de-peliculas-the-b-store|title=Grupo Salinas pone fin a su tienda de películas The B Store|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
In December 2002 the first Blockbuster store opened in Norway, and was followed by another store some months later in 2003, both located in Oslo. The hope was to acquire an already existing video chain. When that failed, it was made an attempt to build a Norwegian blockbuster chain from scratch. But both stores closed in the spring of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videomagasinet.no/artikkel/blockbuster-stenger-129-butikker/|title=Blockbuster stenger 129 butikker|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Blockbuster announced that it plans to shut down its stores in Peru due to poor revenues, which it blamed on the effect of movie [[copyright infringement|piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1989, the company entered the United Kingdom via its purchase of the 875-store Ritz Video chain for $135 million, from parent company Citivision. Ritz Video was Europe's largest rental chain, with a 20% share of the United Kingdom video market, and annual sales of about $150 million. The first re-branded Blockbuster outlet opened on [[Walworth Road]], [[South London]], the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blockbuster.co.uk/help/aboutus.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Blockbuster UK |accessdate=January 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115221240/http://www.blockbuster.co.uk/Help/aboutus.aspx |archivedate=January 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/4524/article-1G1-11849744/blockbuster-uk-division-buys-ritz-video-rental-chain|title=Blockbuster's U.K. division buys Ritz Video rental chain.

Blockbuster UK operated trade functions in all their stores, buying and selling pre-owned DVDs, console games, and gaming accessories. Stores offered either store credit or cash for trade-ins, and would price-match with competitors.

In early 2013, the company had 528 locations in the United Kingdom. On January 16, 2013, Blockbuster placed its United Kingdom subsidiaries in [[Administration (law)|administration]], putting over 4,000 jobs at risk. Non-UK stores were unaffected by the administration, and continued to trade as normal. On February 1, 2013, a large number of Blockbuster stores in the UK were closed, and the UK business was purchased out of administration by restructuring firm [[Gordon Brothers Group|Gordon Brothers Europe]] on March 23, 2013.&lt;ref name="UK buyer"&gt;{{cite news |title=Buyer found for Blockbuster stores, say administrators |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21912508 |newspaper=BBC News |date=March 23, 2013 |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blockbuster UK then traded as ''TS Operations'', with only 264 branches retained.

Following ''[[Deadpool 2]]'''s digital release, a [[pop-up retail]] store in the style of the original 1989 Blockbuster outlets is set to arrive to [[Shoreditch]]. The store will be giving away 1,989 copies of the film as a reference to Blockbuster's entry year into the British market. Additionally, those with an original membership card can skip the queue and get their copies of the film before others. It was set to operate on the 16th and 17th of September, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://londonist.com/london/film/blockbuster-reopens-london-deadpool "Blockbuster Video Reopens In London...

In 1997, [[Enron Corporation]] had entered the broadband market, constructing and purchasing thousands of miles of fiber optic cables throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT1999"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schiesel|first1=Seth|title=Jumping Off the Bandwidth Wagon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/business/jumping-off-the-bandwidth-wagon.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PRNEWS&gt;{{cite news|title=Montana Power, Williams Communications, Enron Units Announce Fiber Providers for Portland-to-Los Angeles Network|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montana-power-williams-communications-enron-units-announce-fiber-providers-for-portland-to-los-angeles-network-77921802.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=[[PRNewswire]]|date=17 December 1997|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217071349/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montana-power-williams-communications-enron-units-announce-fiber-providers-for-portland-to-los-angeles-network-77921802.html|archive-date=February 17, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Enron and Blockbuster Inc. attempted to create a 20-year deal to stream [[Video on demand|movies on demand]] over Enron's fiber optic network.&lt;ref name="WPjan01"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Behr|first1=Peter|title=Broadband Strategy Got Enron in Trouble; Bid to Create Market for Fiber-Optic Space Included Aggressive Accounting|work=[[The Washington Post]]|issue=E01|date=1 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the "heavily promoted" deal fell through, with Enron's shares dropping following the announcement.&lt;ref name="WPjan01"/&gt;

On August 11, 2004, Blockbuster introduced a [[DVD-by-mail]] service in the U.S. to compete with the established market leader, [[Netflix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/11/technology/blockbuster_rental/ Blockbuster going after NetFlix] CNNMoney.

Blockbuster's U.S. online operation started with around 10 warehouses; further expansions every year brought that number to 41, plus more than 1400 stores in the Blockbuster Online network. Most Blockbuster independent franchises did not honor the Total Access program. The company had 1.5 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter of 2006.&lt;ref name="vb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6387895.html |title=Blockbuster reports narrowed Q3 loss |publisher=Video Business |date=June 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216082434/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6387895.html |archivedate=February 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbuster's move to follow the business pattern with its online rentals as was established by Netflix prompted Netflix to sue Blockbuster for patent infringement. Blockbuster counter sued with a counterclaim alleging deceptive practices with its patent which it alleged was designed to maintain an illegal monopoly. The suits were eventually settled, and while the terms were not disclosed it was later reported that Netflix recorded a settlement payment from Blockbuster of $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated |first=The |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/technology/24netflix.html |title=NetFlix Outlook Gloomy Despite A Profitable Quarter |work=The New York Times |date=July 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blockbuster offered several online movie rental plans. In some cities customers could add games to their movie rental queue as if they were included in their plan, but game rentals resulted in a separate additional fee which was not displayed or charged until the end of the billing cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://blockbuster3.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1497/kw/game%20rental/r_id/106342{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until July 26, 2007, Blockbuster offered and advertised unlimited free in-store exchanges of online rentals with all plans. Since then there were several changes back and forth with regard to this policy; as of March 2010 customers were allowed a limited number of in-store exchanges.

At the end of 2006, Blockbuster Total Access had 2.2 million customers, exceeding their original goal of 2 million, according to its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://blockbuster.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=706 |title=Blockbuster Achieves Year-End Goal of 2 Million Online Subscribers |publisher=Blockbuster MediaRoom |location=DALLAS |date=January 3, 2007 |accessdate=January 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201174903/http://blockbuster.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=706 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an aggressive media campaign that accounted for much of Blockbuster's $46.4 million net loss in the first quarter of 2007, the Total Access subscriber base surpassed 3 million customers in total, marking the company's highest subscriber growth quarter ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.b2i.us/profiles/investor/ResLibraryView.asp?BzID=553&amp;ResLibraryID=19771&amp;Category=1027 |title=Blockbuster Reports First quarter 2007 Results |publisher=Blockbuster Inc. |date=May 2, 2007 |accessdate=January 28, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, however, the company was declining to provide figures when asked by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mcbride |first=Sarah |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125303731573912777 |title=Wall Street Journal, "Blockbuster to Shutter More Stores" |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2007, Southern Stores Inc., one of Blockbuster's largest franchise operators in the United States, filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that, by introducing Blockbuster Online and Blockbuster Total Access, the rental chain has undercut the group's franchise agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memphisdailynews.com/Editorial/StoryFocus.aspx?&amp;id=95692 |title=Blockbusted!

On August 6, 2010, Blockbuster By Mail subscribers gained access to Blockbuster's library of console games, in addition to movies and television shows.

On March 31, 2012, Blockbuster On Demand removed support from set-top box media players, including [[Vudu]], [[Western Digital Media Center|WDTV]], and [[Roku]]. Supported devices now only include computers, Blu-ray players, select television sets, and cellular phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9391/p/208,393/session/L3RpbWUvMTM0MDA1NzI3OS9zaWQvX2VQTURfLWs%3D |title=Accessing the Blockbuster On Demand service on a WD TV Live Product |publisher=Wdc.custhelp.com |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, Blockbuster also introduced a conventional online subscription service. The unlimited three-disc plan costs £14.99/month but does not allow in-store exchange, contrary to the U.S. service.  Partial support for in-store exchange would not be added until April 2005 with the launch of an "OnlineXtra" service. This service cost £2 per month, required an online subscription to a disc plan, and added two extra discs sent by mail. The OnlineXtra discs could be exchanged in store, but the non-OnlineXtra discs could not.  The program was discontinued in 2006 with no [[Grandfather clause|grandfathering]], but an in-store-only variant of it resurfaced in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blockbuster.co.uk/bandsignup/all-rental-plans.aspx |title=Band Signup – All Rental Plans |publisher=Blockbuster UK |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628224148/http://www.blockbuster.co.uk/bandsignup/all-rental-plans.aspx |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "Click &amp; Collect" service launched in September 2010 allows the reservation of Blockbuster movies in store, but the store's regular rental fees applied until the company added in-store exchanged in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.blockbuster.co.uk/2010/09/the-new-way-to-rent-click-collect/ |title=The new way to rent – Click &amp; Collect |publisher=Blockbuster UK |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017014151/http://blog.blockbuster.co.uk/2010/09/the-new-way-to-rent-click-collect |archivedate=October 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.blockbuster.co.uk/2012/05/service-update-introducing-in-store-exchange-total-access/ |title=Service Update – Introducing In-Store Exchange / Total Access |publisher=Blockbuster UK |accessdate=May 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715050650/http://blog.blockbuster.co.uk/2012/05/service-update-introducing-in-store-exchange-total-access |archivedate=July 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Support for game reservations was added in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.blockbuster.co.uk/2011/11/service-update-click-collect-games/ |title=Service Update – Click &amp; Collect Games |publisher=Blockbuster UK |accessdate=November 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126153920/http://blog.blockbuster.co.uk/2011/11/service-update-click-collect-games/ |archivedate=November 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Antioco, the Blockbuster CEO, was not interested in the offer because he thought it was a "very small niche business" and it was losing money at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/blockbuster-ceo-passed-up-chance-to-buy-netflix-for-50-million-2015-7?r=US&amp;IR=T |title=Blockbuster's CEO once passed up a chance to buy Netflix for only $50 million|last=Chong|first=Celena|date=2015-07-18|work=Business Insider Australia|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==

===Super Bowl===
One of Blockbuster's most well known [[advertising campaign]]s was launched during the 2002 [[Super Bowl]]. It starred the voices of [[Jim Belushi]] and [[James Woods]], as a rabbit and a [[guinea pig]] in a pet shop, located across the road from a Blockbuster store. The first campaign ended in 2003. The Carl and Ray campaign started again in 2007 starting with a commercial in the first quarter of [[Super Bowl XLI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16996195/ns/business-us_business/t/best-super-bowl-ad-readers-pick-blockbuster/#.VG8aOItvwX4 |title=Best Super Bowl ad?

===Misleading advertising===
In 2005, Blockbuster launched a marketing campaign describing changes in its late fees policy and offering "No Late Fees" on rentals. The program sparked investigations and charges of misrepresentation in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as state attorneys general including [[Bill Lockyer]] of California, [[Greg Abbott]] of Texas, and [[Eliot Spitzer]] of New York argued that customers were being automatically charged the full purchase price of late rentals and a restocking fee for rentals returned after 30 days. In a settlement, Blockbuster agreed to reimburse the states the cost of their investigation, clarify communication to customers on the terms of the program, and offer reimbursement to customers charged fees prior to the clarification. New Jersey filed a separate lawsuit and was not a party to the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/18/entertainment/main675086.shtml |publisher=CBS News |date=February 18, 2005 |title=Blockbuster Sued Over Late Fees}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7327309/ |publisher=MSNBC |date=March 30, 2005 |title=Blockbuster settles "no late fees" claims}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36767-2005Feb18.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Blockbuster sued over return policy |date=February 19, 2005 |author=Caroline Mayer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2005-02-27-track_x.htm |author=Michael McCarthy |date=February 27, 2005 |work=[[USA Today]] |title='No late fees' ads cause a stir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/30/business/fi-blockbuster30 |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=March 30, 2005 |author=Lorenza Munoz |title=Blockbuster Settles State Probes Into Late Fee Ads }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 controversy came after a related lawsuit settled in 2002 in Texas. That lawsuit, alleging exorbitant late fees, led the company to pay $9.25 million in attorney fees and offer $450 million in late fee refund coupons (which were rent-one get-one-free coupons, and thus required the customer to make an initial expenditure). The company estimated that the coupons would ultimately cost about $45 million depending on the redemption rate; an attorney for the plaintiffs estimated the final cost at closer to $100 million at a redemption rate of about 20% (calculated based on a similar case in Michigan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courant.com/topic/sns-blockbuster,0,5496993.story |date=June 6, 2001 |author=Sarah Hale |publisher=The Los Angeles Times, via the Hartford Courant |title=Blockbuster to settle lawsuit over late fees}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,42827,00.html |publisher=Fox News |date=January 11, 2002 |title=Blockbuster customers to be reimbursed for late fees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such corrections were also sent to international stores such as those in Canada to prevent further lawsuits.

Blockbuster reintroduced late fees in the United States in 2010 under the name of "Additional Daily Rates". With this pricing scheme, rentals were once again limited to a certain number of days and accrued pay-per-day rates after the days allocated are exceeded.

The [[music video]] for English recording artist [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]]'s "[[Born Free (M.I.A. song)|Born Free]]" was directed by [[Romain Gavras]]. The video, which depicts a [[genocide]] against [[red hair|red haired people]], was filmed in [[California]] and directed by [[Romain Gavras]] as a nine-minute short film without the prior knowledge of M.I.A.'s record labels. Several incidents relating to the extra-judicial killing of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] males by the [[Sri Lanka's Killing Fields|Sri Lankan Army filmed on mobile phones in Sri Lanka]], some of which had been broadcast by news outlets worldwide, inspired M.I.A.'s [[film treatment|treatment]] for the film-video. The video's portrayal of military force, violence and brutality met with a positive critical reception but much controversy worldwide, including a ban from YouTube in the US and UK. Some critics hailed its representation of oppression and political turmoil, while others criticized the more explicit material. The way the film was shot and the themes it covered drew comparisons to previous works by the artist, and other writer-directors' films such as ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' and ''[[Punishment Park]]''. It earned a nomination for "Best Dance Video" at the 2010 [[UK Music Video Awards]].

==Development==
The music video-short film, filmed in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Lancaster, California]] on 15 January 2010 was written by M.I.A. and directed by French director [[Romain Gavras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mackay, Emily|url=|title=MIA interview|publisher=[[NME]]|page=26|date=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gavras, who directed the video for the song "Stress" by [[Justice (band)|Justice]] which proved controversial after release dealt with themes of "real and fake" which complimented M.I.A.'s vision for the video. M.I.A. intended for the video to depict something real "made not real" to reach a wider audience. The video would depict the footage of the extra-judicial killing of Tamil males she had uploaded three months prior onto her Twitter feed.&lt;ref name="gs2010"&gt;{{Cite episode|credits=Stroumboulopoulos, George (Interviewer), M.I.A.

==Synopsis==

The film is over nine minutes long and depicts a [[SWAT team]] driving up to a building and staging a raid, during which they ignore a man sitting in a room smoking a crack pipe, beat a couple engaged in coitus, and then force a young [[Red hair|red-haired]] man violently into a detainee transport vehicle. Other red-heads are rounded up. Some of the SWAT team members wear American flags on their uniforms. During the video, a mural is seen depicting armed red-headed men and the slogan "Our day will come", the historic motto of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (''[[Tiocfaidh ár lá]]''). [[Keffiya]]-wearing red-haired young people throw rocks and glass bottles at the armored vehicles transporting the detainees, in an apparent reference to the iconic images of the Second Palestinian "[[Second Intifada|Intifada]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galil |first=Leor |url=http://trueslant.com/leorgalil/2010/04/26/finding-meaning-in-m-i-a-s-born-free-video/ |title=Finding meaning in M.I.A.’s ‘Born Free’ video - Leor Galil - Ex-Spectator |publisher=True/Slant |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detainees are then driven out to the desert, treated brutally, and forced to run across a live [[minefield]].&lt;ref name="MTVBornFree"&gt;James Montgomery (26 April 2010).

The "Born Free" film includes graphic violence and language, as well as nudity. Ian Hamrick, the 12-year-old red-haired actor whose character is shot in the head in the film, described the video as "showing violence to end violence." He felt a potency in the video absent from far more graphic video game media such as ''[[Call of Duty]]'' or ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/mia/50911 |title=Child 'killed' in MIA's 'Born Free' video defends singer |date=30 April 2010 |publisher=NME |accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news| author=Brown, August|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/05/twelveyearold-ian-hamrick-on-his-gruesome-death-in-mias-born-free-video.html | title=Twelve-year-old Ian Hamrick on his gruesome death in M.I.A.'s 'Born Free' video|work=Los Angeles Times | series=Pop &amp; Hiss blog|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving more details on his role in an interview to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Hamrick said M.I.A. complimented his work on set, stating "She wanted to make sure I was OK, that I knew what was happening and why she killed [my character].

==Release and critical response==
[[File:Lancaster, California desert.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The music video was partly filmed at the [[Lancaster, California]] desert, imaged above]]

On 26 April 2010, the music video was released online and was immediately noted as political allegory, drawing parallels to genocides and many indigenous resistance movements around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/music/823394-m-i-a-releases-controversial-born-free-music-video M.I.A. releases controversial Born Free music video]. [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]. 27 April 2010. Retrieved 27 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Its content elicited strong, widespread discussion across the world. Real life parallels were drawn with the issue of immigration in the American state of Arizona, the treatment of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|prisoners by U.S. troops at the Abu Ghraib prison]] in [[Baghdad]], and, more universally, the brutal tactics used against minorities by government forces around the world.&lt;ref name="MTVBornFree" /&gt;

''[[The Huffington Post]]'' stated "Whether it's a comment on the absurdity of [[genocide]] (of which M.I.A. saw plenty during her early childhood in [[Sri Lanka]]) or a challenge to the idea of "other" in [[Arizona SB1070|Arizona's immigration law]], it is startling even in the context of recent genre-bending music art-films."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/26/mia-releases-graphic-expl_n_552486.html M.I.A.

The effect of this was that the viewer was "expected to empathise with the victim, rather than the aggressor." Haddow stated that this sat in "stark contrast" to the bulk of recent films on the subject of the Afghan and Iraq wars such as [[Katheryn Bigelow]]'s ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' (2009), [[Oren Moverman]]'s ''[[The Messenger (2009 film)|The Messenger]]'' (2009) and  ''[[Green Zone (film)|Green Zone]]'' (2010) written by [[Brian Helgeland]] and directed by [[Paul Greengrass]], where focus was almost entirely on the psychological experiences of military personnel, continuing "Rarely do we ever catch a glimpse of the locals, whom we are supposed to be helping, unless they are being blown up or used as plot devices to heighten the suspense."&lt;ref name="The real controversy of MIA's video"/&gt; Other critics also pointed to differences between "Born Free" and Bigelow's ''The Hurt Locker'' but similarities between the video and [[Peter Watkins]]' ''[[Punishment Park]]'' (1971).&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;

''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' described "Born Free" as the most violent music video made in a long time and called it a nine-minute masterpiece, adding that "M.I.A. has built a career on making music that's as outspoken as it is danceable" and described the video as "undeniably powerful, a lurid parable on the systematic [[ethnic cleansing]] that goes on all over the world." &lt;ref&gt;Mary Elizabeth Williams (27 April 2010).

==Aftermath==
[[RT America]] (a [[Russia]]n television network) producer Lucy Kafanov noted how several mainstream American TV news networks hesitated in covering the reaction to the video initially despite the widespread response. She said this was in contrast to their coverage of the controversy of [[Erykah Badu]]'s "[[Window Seat (song)|Window Seat]]" video two weeks prior, and suggested this was because the video for "Born Free" "hit too close to home" in the United States.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8GoDXXUoY |title=M.I.A. music video banned from |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' writer Monica Herrera stated that anyone who was "up in arms" over Badu's video would probably feel "ridiculous" after watching the video for "Born Free".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/958476/mias-born-free-video-banned-from-youtube-for-graphic-violence |title=M.I.A.'s 'Born Free' Video Banned from YouTube for Graphic Violence - Viral Videos |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Alyona Minkovski]] of ''[[The Alyona Show]]'' noted how M.I.A.'s own experiences with genocide in Sri Lanka contributed to the themes in the video but that the silence of the artist left audience members to speculate on several connections between the video and real events.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] rapper [[Narcy (rapper)|Narcy]], [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] hip hop group [[DAM (band)|DAM]] and singer Sabreena Da Witch told MTV Iggy that they saw the video as a "grander metaphor for society" and persecution in areas of political turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinlan |first=Adriane |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/blog-posts/arab-rappers-weigh-in-on-m-i-a-s-born-free-video/ |title=Arab Rappers Weigh In On M.I.A.’s "Born Free" Video |publisher=Mtv Iggy |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British network [[Sky News]] reported that Sherry Adhami, spokeswoman for the UK [[Beatbullying]] charity found the video "inappropriate" as it could "lead to more abuse against red-haired people." Caroline Sullivan of ''The Guardian'' told the network "I think M.I.A. is making the point that if we segregated all ginger people as a minority - in the same way as black and Asian people - there would be an enormous outcry, and that we don't seem to get the same reaction when black people are treated in this way." She also stated that M.I.A. depicted violence in order to make a political point, in a way different from [[gangsta rap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/home/showbiz-news/article/15623553 |title=M.I.A.: 'Ginger Genocide' Music Video Born Free Slammed By Bullying Charity, Defended By Actor &amp;#124; Showbiz News &amp;#124; Sky News |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamrick was to be prominently featured in the video for "[[Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)]]" by [[Shakira]] and [[Freshlyground]], the official [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] anthem but his appearance was allegedly recut to a crowd scene following the "Born Free" video release. "Waka Waka"'s producers responded that Hamrick was always meant to be an extra in the video and that this was not due to the controversy. Hamrick said of "Born Free" that he was really "proud to be a part of M.I.A.’s shout-out to the world" because "it was a great chance to tell everyone that bully’s [sic] suck no matter what country you are from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paskin |first=Willa |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/05/shakira_video_snubs_red_head_w.html |title=Shakira Video Snubs Redhead Who Got Shot in the Head in M.I.A.

Gavras was more reassured that audiences talked about the subject by themselves, than explaining the video himself as the debate over the video heightened, although he questioned "How can you be shocked by the M.I.A. video and not shocked when [[Israel]] bombs [[Gaza City|Gaza]] for days and days...Really crazy stuff where people actually die, real things."&lt;ref name="Cochrane" /&gt; [[Vincent Cassel]], star of Gavras' film ''Our Day Will Come'', stated he found the video "scary, shocking and totally crazy" on the first viewing, and added "If it would have been with any kind of community it would have been terrible, but suddenly it's redheads, so it's like a symbol of a quest that doesn't really exist." Thus the video also seemed "strange and funny" to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a332376/mia-born-free-video-was-shocking-and-funny-says-vincent-cassel.html |title=MIA 'Born Free' video was shocking and funny, says Vincent Cassel - Music News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M.I.A. stated in an interview to MTV News that she found the reaction to the film "fascinating" but that she was baffled by the media's fixation on the clip when real issues were ignored, stating "I think it's interesting how we react to fiction and how we react to realism on the internet... this is mainstream media, I wish I was talking about way more underground theories, but [I'm] not, this is just me digesting what I see in the mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a231806/mia-fascinated-by-born-free-reaction.html |title=M.I.A.

It's weird. No I said that I found his video offensive, because people said they found my video offensive [...] It got out of hand, Now I feel really bad coz I have some family members who love Justin Bieber, and now they won't talk to me, I need my little cousins to talk to me!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXVttROems4 |title=Mia Hot 97 |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after its release on [[Vimeo]] on 26 April, the video was viewed 1.8 million times on the site. From 27 April to 2 May, M.I.A. remained the most blogged about artist on the internet, according to MP3 blog aggregator [[The Hype Machine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/most-blogged-artists-mia-the-xx-jamaica-1955809.html Most blogged artists: M.I.A., The xx, Jamaica].

The raw video is also on M.I.A.'s website. The video has been viewed over 30 million times on the internet.&lt;ref name="Cochrane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiss"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/apr/28/mia-bornfree-youtube | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jemima | last=Kiss | title=MIA's redheads video gets a wrist-slap from YouTube – and coverage in China | date=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==YouTube controversy and response==
Video sharing website [[YouTube]] removed the film from viewing in the United States within a day of its posting. Some other uploads of the video were subsequently age-gated on the site, while others were removed due to copyright claims. YouTube stated that they did not comment on individual clips on the site but said that videos were removed only after users reported videos that could "contravene guidelines."&lt;ref name="Kiss"/&gt; Commentators proposed different reasons for the actions, from the graphic "excessive" violence depicted to political censorship. On 27 April, the [[BBC]] reported that the video was being removed in some instances by YouTube, and labelled with an age-restriction in others. Neither M.I.A. or her record label [[XL Recordings]] commented on the development in the weeks following the release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10080000/newsid_10087800/10087809.stm M.I.A video 'removed by YouTube'].

M.I.A. told Sawyer "It's just fake blood and ketchup and people are more offended by that more than the execution videos" referring to the clips of Sri Lankan troops shooting unarmed, blindfolded, naked men in the head that she tweeted beforehand, later telling French music magazine ''Mondomix'' "It’s amazing to me that is the state we're in today – people are more moved by something synthetic than something real. And as an artist that’s the decision you have to make – whether to be real or synthetic."&lt;ref name="sawyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouard"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bouard|first=Bertrand|title=M.I.A repousse les frontières (English translation: Activism without Borders)|url=http://www.rue89.com/mondomix/2010/07/11/mia-les-sri-lankais-sont-devastes-casses-158166|work=Mondomix|publisher=[[Rue 89]]|date=7 August 2010|accessdate=7 September 2010|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Erin Thomson of ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'' concurred that the violence in the video was not gratuitous, noting that as an artist, M.I.A. "never pretended to be anything less than radical; she's never shied away from shock value. She comes from a world where persecution and terrorism are the norm, and from day one that's been the world she's tried to portray through her music."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/2010/04/mias_controversial_born_free_m.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 August 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709202032/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/2010/04/mias_controversial_born_free_m.php# |archive-date=9 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xinhua]], the official news agency of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] and ''[[Global Times]]'', a paper owned by the [[Communist Party of China]] noted the removal of the film on American YouTube within a week of Born Free's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/sci-edu/it/2010-04/527242.html |title=Global Times - M.I.A video restricted by YouTube |publisher=Globaltimes.cn |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; M.I.A. condemned the Chinese Government's role in supporting and supplying arms to the Sri Lankan government during [[Eelam War IV]], stating that China's influence within the UN was preventing prosecutions of [[war crimes]] committed during the conflict.&lt;ref name="Bouard"/&gt; The coverage of the video in China was noted by Jemima Kiss of ''The Guardian'' to bring her work to the attention of more fans in the country; M.I.A. herself stated after the release she considered her child learn the Chinese language given the economic rise of the country.&lt;ref name="Kiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contactmusic.com/news/mia-considers-bringing-up-baby-in-china_1144182&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Brad Byers was born and raised in [[Moscow, Idaho]].  According to the biography given on the official site, he joined a traveling circus to become a juggler shortly after graduating from high school. Two years later he left the circus focusing on TV performances. He began swallowing swords at the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradbyers.com/bio.html|title=Brad Byers biography|publisher=www.bradbyers.com|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career he performed in more than 20 countries.&lt;ref name=inland360/&gt; He is listed in the 1999, 2000 and 2003 editions of the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]''.&lt;ref name=wr/&gt; He also took part in [[America's Got Talent (season 4)|fourth]] and [[America's Got Talent (season 8)|eighth seasons]] of the [[NBC]]'s ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' TV-show (2009, 2013).

== Performances ==

=== Sword swallowing ===
He earned a Guinness World Record for "The Most Swords Swallowed and Twisted at One Time" by swallowing ten 27-inch swords one at a time until all 10 were in his esophagus and then twisting all 10 swords 180 degrees in his throat before withdrawing them and taking a bow.&lt;ref name=wr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradbyers.com/world_records.html|title=Guinness World Record|publisher=www.bradbyers.com|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also among the few people in the World able to swallow a curved sword.

=== “Human toolbox” ===
“Human toolbox” is a moniker given to him by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' for his activities involving inserting various [[tool]]s in his [[nasal cavity]].&lt;ref name=inland360&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inland360.com/pullman-sideshow-artist-brad-byers-on-nbcs-americas-got-talent-tonight/|title=Pullman sideshow artist Brad Byers on NBC’s "America’s Got Talent" tonight|publisher=inland360.com|first=Jennifer|last=Bauer|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hammers in a nail or an awl and hangs a weight on it. Seen through the X-ray, the nail stops in several millimeters from his brain. He puts in a fishing hook into his nasal cavity so that it shows up out of his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacafe.com/watch/yt-_FwNj2A4FEU/americas_got_talent_most_dangerous_act_brad_byers_hook_and_drill/|title=America's Got Talent MOST DANGEROUS ACT: Brad Byers Hook and Drill|publisher=[[Metacafe]]|date=September 26, 2009|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also puts in a [[drill]] when it is being turned on. As it reaches maximum safe depth, he turns the drill off and on again when getting it out.&lt;ref name=wr/&gt;

In 2002, the main reason for reinstatement of Chastity Houses given to public was to prevent prostitution from spreading in the cities.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parstimes.com/women/chastity_houses.html |title=Iran: Proposal Debated For Solving Prostitution With 'Chastity Houses'|work=parstimes.com|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters of Chastity Houses==
Several prominent conservative clerics have proposed that prostitutes be placed in government-run shelters for destitute women to be called "Chastity Houses," where male customers could briefly marry them under the Shia practice of Nikah mut‘ah. Proponents of the idea argue that it would "eradicate social corruption" by legitimizing sexual relations between the men and women.

A supporter of the plan, [[Ayatollah]] [[Kazem Mousavi-Bojnourdi|Mohammed Mousavi Bojnurdi]], said: "We face a real challenge with all these women on the street. Our society is in an emergency situation.” [[Hojatolislam]] Mohammed Taghi Fazel-Meibodi, a member of Qom Seminary, said the proposal is religiously legal. He said, "Our young people are troubled. There is poverty, unemployment, and more and more girls are escaping from their homes. In a society where there are sharp differences between rich and poor, rich men will use these poor girls for a quick thrill and to satisfy their impulses and lust."

==Opposition==
Women's groups have been particularly outspoken about the idea of Chastity Houses. [[Shahrbanou Amani]], a female Iranian parliamentarian, called the idea of establishing Chastity House as "an insult and disrespectful to women." The Cultural Council for Women, a liberal Islamist women's group, said such houses would be a "deceitful and thinly disguised" form of prostitution.

{{original research|date=April 2018}}
A '''chess clock''' consists of two adjacent [[clock]]s with buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, so that the two clocks never run simultaneously. Chess clocks are used in chess and other two-player [[game]]s where the players move in turn. The purpose is to keep track of the total time each player takes for their own moves, and ensure that neither player overly delays the game.

Chess clocks were first used extensively in tournament [[chess]], and are often called '''game clocks'''.  The first time that game clocks were used in a chess tournament was in the [[London 1883 chess tournament|London 1883 tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Goldene Schachzeiten: Erinnerungen |last=Vidmar |first=Milan |authorlink=Milan Vidmar |coauthors= |year=1960 |publisher=W. de Gruyter |location= |isbn=3-11-002095-5|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their use has since spread to tournament [[Scrabble]], [[shogi]], [[Go (board game)|go]], and nearly every competitive two-player [[board game]], as well as other types of games. 
In a tournament, the arbiter typically places all clocks in the same orientation, so that they can easily assess games that need attention at later stages.

The simplest [[time control]] is "sudden death", in which players must make a predetermined number of moves in a certain amount of time or forfeit the game immediately.
A particularly popular variant in informal play is [[blitz chess]], in which each player is given a short time (e.g. five minutes) on the clock in which to play the entire game.

The players may take more or less time over any individual move. The opening moves in chess are often played quickly due to their familiarity, which leaves the players more time to consider more complex and unfamiliar positions later. It is not unusual in slow chess games for a player to leave the table, but the clock of the absent player continues to run if it is their turn, or starts to run if their opponent makes a move.

== Analog game clocks ==
[[File:Garde-chess-clock.jpg|thumb|A typical analog chess clock]]

[[Analog clock]]s are equipped with a "flag" that falls to indicate the exact moment the player's time has expired. Analog clocks use mechanical buttons. Pressing the button on one player's side physically stops the movement of that player's clock and releases the hold on the opponent's.

The drawbacks of the mechanical clocks include accuracy and matching of the two clocks, and matching of the indicators (flags) of time expiration. Additional time cannot easily be added for more complex time controls, especially those that call for an increment or delay on every move, such as some forms of [[byoyomi]]. However, a malfunctioning analog clock is a less serious event than a malfunctioning digital clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7328/28/ |title= FAQ (Starting Out) - Learn About Chess |accessdate=2008-01-19 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=1999-11-30 |work= |publisher=United States Chess Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early development of digital game clocks==
[[File:Modern Day Chess Clocks.jpg|thumb|Modern day chess clocks.]]
In 1973, to address the issues with analog clocks, '''Bruce Cheney''', a [[Cornell University]] Electrical Engineering student and chess player, created the first digital chess clock as a project for an undergraduate EE course.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Bird", ''[[Chess Life]]'', April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of most inventions, it was crude compared to the products on the market many years later and was limited by the technology that existed at the time. For example, the display was done with red LEDs. LEDs require significant power, and as a result, the clock had to be plugged into a wall outlet. The high cost of LEDs at the time meant that only one set of digits could be displayed, that of the player whose turn it was to move. This meant that each player's time had to be multiplexed to the display when their time was running. In 1973, LSI chips were not readily or cheaply available, so all the multiplexing and logic were done using chips that consisted of four two-input [[Transistor–transistor_logic|TTL NAND gates]], which resulted in excessive power consumption. Being plugged into the wall is obviously a major drawback, but had one advantage: the timebase for the clock was driven off of a rectified version of 60 cycle AC current. Each player had a separate counter, and, in a parallel to the original mechanical architecture, one player's counter was disabled while the other's was running. The clock only had one mode: time ran forward. It could be reset, but not set. It did not count the number of moves. But it successfully addressed the original goals of the project (accurate and matched timing).

The first commercially available digital chess clock was patented in 1975 by '''Joseph Meshi''' and '''Jeffrey R. Ponsor''' and sold as the Micromate-80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=4062180 |status=patent |title=Electronic chess clock |gdate= 1977-12-13 |fdate= 1975-07-31 |invent1= Meshi, Joseph |invent2= Ponsor, Jeffrey R.}}; filed July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later a much-improved Micromate-180 was produced alongside Meshi's MBA Thesis, "Demand Analysis for a New Product (The Digital Chess Clock)", at [[San Diego State University]], while Meshi and Ponsor continued to develop digital gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=4247925 |status=patent |title=Game microcomputer |gdate= 1981-01-27 |fdate= 1978-07-13 |invent1= Meshi, Joseph |invent2= Ponsor, Jeffrey R.}}; filed January 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fischer clock and related designs {{anchor|Fischer clock}}==
[[Image:Olimpiada Bled Slovenija deska.jpg|thumb|Digital chess clock connected to a board that automatically senses when moves have been made]]
Digital clocks and Internet gaming have spurred a wave of experimentation with more varied and complex time controls than the traditional standards. [[Time control]] is commonly used in modern chess in many different [[Time control#Methodology|methodologies]]. One particularly notable development, which has gained quite wide acceptance in chess, was proposed by former world champion [[Bobby Fischer]], who in 1988 filed for {{US patent|4,884,255}} (awarded in 1989) for a new type of digital chess clock.  Fischer's digital clock gave each player a fixed period of time at the start of the game and then added a small amount after each move. Joseph Meshi called this "Accumulation" as it was a main feature of his patented Micromate-180 (US Patent 4,247,925 1978). This became the linchpin of Fischer's clock patented 10 years later. In this way, the players would never be desperately short of time. 

The increment time control was first used in the privately organised [[Fischer–Spassky (1992 match)|1992 Fischer–Spassky match]], and quickly became popular in the wider chess world, and was used in the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theweekinchess.com/html/twic161.html The Week in Chess 161], [[The Week in Chess]], 8-Dec-1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 most top level tournaments use Fischer's system as well as an increasing number of lower level tournaments. Other aspects of Fischer's patent, such as a synthesized voice announcing how much time the players have, thus eliminating the need for them to keep looking at the clock, have not been adopted.

On March 10, 1994, a patent application was filed by inventors Frank A. Camaratta Jr. of Huntsville, Alabama, and William Goichberg of Salisbury Mills, New York, for a game timer especially suitable for playing the game of chess, which employed a "delay" feature. The game timer provides, among other features, a user-definable delay between the time the activation button is pressed and the time that the activated clock actually begins to count down. United States Patent 5,420,830 was issued on May 10, 1995, and subsequently assigned to the United States Chess Federation by the inventors. As with the Fischer clock, the benefit of the delay clock is to reduce the likelihood that a player with positional and/or material superiority will lose a match solely because of the expiration of time on that player's time clock. Delay is still popular in the U.S, although increment is becoming more popular in the US.

==Timing methods==
{{main article|Time control}}

There are three main types of chess timing methods, two of which are mathematically equivalent: (1) ''Increment'' (invented by [[Bobby Fischer]]), (2) ''Bronstein delay'' (invented by [[David Bronstein]]), and (3) ''Simple delay''.

* Increment (also known as Fischer and bonus)&amp;mdash;a specified amount of time is added for each move. For example, if the increment is thirty seconds, each player gets an additional thirty seconds for each move. Under FIDE and US Chess rules you get the increment for move one as well. For example, for G/3;inc2 (three minutes of base time with a two second increment each move), you start with three minutes and two seconds on the first move. Not all digital chess clocks automatically give the increment for move one and thus for those that don't, the increment time has to be added manually to be base time so each player gets the increment for move one. 
* Bronstein delay&amp;mdash;this timing method adds time but unlike increment not always the maximum amount of time is added. If a player expends more than the specified delay, then the entire delay is added to the player's clock but if a player moves faster than the delay, only the exact amount of time expended by the player is added. For example, if the delay is ten seconds and a player uses ten or more seconds for a move, ten seconds is added after they complete their move. If the player uses five seconds for a move, five seconds is added after they complete their move. This ensures that the base time left on the clock can never increase even if a player makes fast moves. As with increment, you get the delay time for move one under FIDE and US Chess rules. 
* Simple delay (also known as countdown delay and US delay)&amp;mdash;with this timing method, the clock waits for the delay period each move before starting to subtract the player's base time.  For example, if the delay is ten seconds, the clock waits for ten seconds each move before the base time starts going down. This timing method is mathematically equivalent to Bronstein delay. Simple delay is the form of delay most often used in the US.

'''Cisneros Media Distribution''' (abbreviated as '''CMD''', formerly known as '''Venevision International''') is an entertainment company that broadcasts Spanish content in the United States and in other locations around the globe.

CMD is a Spanish-language Entertainment company with more than 30 years of experience in TV programming production and distribution, besides participating in other segments of the market. Venevision International is part of the [[Grupo Cisneros|Cisneros Group of Companies]] and was founded initially as the distribution company of this media holding.&lt;ref&gt;Global Communication: Theories, Stakeholders and Trends. Thomas Mcphail. 2005 Page 113&lt;/ref&gt;

CMD is headed today by [[Peter Tinoco]]. The company opened doors in 1971 under the name Teverama Florida along with [[RCTV|Radio Caracas Television]] as distributors of Venezuelan programming abroad. After a split from RCTV (which formed Coral Pictures) was renamed America Television Inc. and finally in 1987 the company took the name of Venevision International.

As a distributor of television programming, VVI is one of the two largest companies in Spanish language.&lt;ref&gt;A Companion To Television Janet Wasko 2005. Page 517&lt;/ref&gt; The programming catalogue is diverse in genres, and the company is renowned for its history and management expertise of the [[telenovela]], an original type of program from Latin America that has achieved great success in international markets.&lt;ref&gt;Venezuela: The Challenge of Competitiveness Michael Enright, Scott Saavedra, 1996 Page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a presence in five continents and more than 70 countries, Venevision International’s programs have harvested successes in Latin America, Europe and the rest of the world. Venevision International’s telenovelas have been broadcast in more than 100 countries and translated into 24 languages. In this genre the company launched in 2001 the first erotic soap opera “[[Latin Lover (TV series)|Latin Lover]]", and in 2007 produced the first soap opera exclusively for cellular phones "Querido Profe" (Dear Teacher). VVI presently supports exchange agreements and sales of TV programming in China and [[Korea]], where the telenovelas have reached great popularity.

From the year 2000 the company embarked in a strategy of diversification to strengthen its catalogue with its own productions, and to participate in the profitable Hispanic market in the United States.   As a company that belongs to a mass media group, it decided to focus on the entertainment market, leveraging its relations with industry players, and its own capacity to commercially support its contents.

CMD has today operating divisions in the business of music production and distribution, film distribution, TV productions and distribution, pay television, original productions and content distribution for cellular phones and Internet and product integration through Synapsys International.

In television production, the company was pioneer in independent television production in Spanish in the city of Miami and one of the main companies of this segment in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thinking Outside the Box: A Contemporary Television Genre Reader. Gary R. Edgerton, Brian G. Rose. 2005. Page 285&lt;/ref&gt; Also, since 2001 VVI has co-produced with Latin American and US companies, and also with the Chinese TV company [[China Central Television|CCTV]] in the Spanish version of a documentary of the [[Yangtze River]].

CMD founded the first exclusive film distribution company in Spanish language in the United States launching movies in cinemas and distributing in pay-per-view, pay television, home video, the hospitality industry (hotels and tourism) and Internet. It is part of the companies that have renewed interest in the [[Latin American cinema]] in the US market.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies Used by Major Studios and Independents Robert Marich. 2005. Page 264&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Cisneros Group of Companies, the company has been always interested in launching TV channels (Global Television: How to Create Effective Television for the 1990s . Tony Verna. 1993. Page. 236.). Based on its film catalogue in Spanish, the company launched in 2006 its pay TV movie channel  VeneMovies, a signal that programs films 24 hours a day with interviews and coverage of the main festivals of the Hispanic market of the United States.

VeneMusic, Venevision International’s musical stamp, has turned into an important reference in the [[Latin American music|Latin music]], with distribution agreements with the biggest labels of the music industry. Its market activities in the music industry expanded with a publishing unit that administers the rights of the artists and the musical pieces that support the television productions of the company.

In the area of cellular entertainment the company runs [[Latcel]], a mobile content production and distribution company in the U.S. Hispanic market and [[VeneMobile]], a division that offers contents of the Cisneros Group of Companies in the mobile markets worldwide

CMD also has participated in the business of television formats with an alliance with the Spanish company Nostromo&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture in the United States by Cordelia Candelaria, Peter J. García, and Arturo J. Aldama. 2004. Page. 293&lt;/ref&gt; and in the production of theater plays in the city of Miami, where it even had its own theatre from 2001 until 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4039">The '''Convertors''' were a line of [[action figures]] manufactured by Select in the 1980s.

Often compared to the more famous [[Gobots]] and [[Transformers]], the Convertors were a line of toys which came out at about the same time and featured robots who changed form.

==History==
The Convertors licensed some of their toy designs from [[Bandai]] just as was done for the Transformers, meaning some of the toys looked very similar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/02/the_10_worst_transformers_rip-offs.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://venomianbane-giantrobots.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The molds for Convertors were later knocked off by other toy companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transformersontheshelf.com/KOBeastfighters.html&lt;/ref&gt; Convertors toys were featured in a display in the 1985 [[J. C. Penney]] Christmas catalog.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transformersontheshelf.com/catalogueJCP.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
The Convertors toys featured the conflict between heroic and evil factions, in this case the heroic Defendors (and their Avarian allies) and the evil Maladroids (and their Insectors allies).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toyarchive.com/Convertors/Convertors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toys==

'''Crystal Theatre''' is a historic theater in [[Gonzales, Texas]]. It has hosted [[vaudeville]] performances, [[silent movies]], and [[talkies]], and later became a coffee house and dinner theater venue. It was reopened in 2009 with a focus on youth programs.

The '''Cyberathlete Professional League''' ('''CPL''') is a professional sports tournament organization specializing in computer and console video game competitions. It was founded by [[Angel Munoz]] on June 27, 1997 in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2013/04/09/cpl-founder-angel-munoz-explains-why-he-left-esports-and-launched-mass-luminosity/ |title=CPL Founder Angel Munoz Explains Why He Left ESports And Launched Mass Luminosity |author=John Gaudiosi |work=Forbes.com |date= 2013-04-09 |accessdate=1 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CPL is considered the pioneer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clubforum.org/cforum/eng/project.php |title=Club FORUM Beograd &amp;#124; PROJECTS &amp;#124; |work=clubforum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721020612/http://www.clubforum.org/cforum/eng/project.php |archivedate=2012-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in professional video game tournaments, which have been held worldwide. The CPL's tournaments are open to all registrants, but due to the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] content rating of some video games, CPL competitions are restricted to participants age 17 or older. The CPL has distributed more than US$3&amp;nbsp;million in cash prizes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In 2005, the CPL moved to a World Tour format. The [[2005 CPL World Tour]] focused on the one-on-one [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] game ''[[Painkiller (video game)|Painkiller]]'', and had a total prize purse of $1&amp;nbsp; millions. The winner of the CPL Grand Finals event, [[Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel]], went home with the grand prize of $150,000, while [[Sander "Vo0" Kaasjager]] took home the MVP trophy for having the most tournament wins.

In March 2008, the CPL ceased operations, citing a "crowded field of competing leagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyberathlete professional league (CPL) is no More!|url=http://www.gameguru.in/pc/2008/17/cyberathlete-professional-league-cpl-is-no-more/|date= 17 Mar 2008|work=GameGuru|accessdate=15 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 25, 2008, the CPL announced that it had signed an acquisition agreement with an investment group based in [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avault.com/news/investment-group-acquires-the-cpl/|title=Investment Group Acquires CPL|accessdate=2011-02-22|author=Adrenaline Vault|date=2008-08-25|work=avault.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221162445/http://www.avault.com/news/investment-group-acquires-the-cpl/|archivedate=2010-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, 2010, the former parent company of the CPL, announced that the two-year acquisition process of the CPL was finalized, and that the sole owner of the CPL (and its subsidiaries) was now WoLong Ventures PTE of [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newworld.com/release08232010.php| title=NewWorld and WoLong Ventures Announce Completion of CPL Acquisition| accessdate=2011-02-22| last=| first=| date=2010-08-23| work=newworld.com| publisher=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714174915/http://www.newworld.com/release08232010.php| archivedate=2011-07-14| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.newworld.com/release08232010.php |title=NewWorld and WoLong Ventures Announce Completion of CPL and CAL Acquisition |publisher=NewWorld |date=2010-08-23 |accessdate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402112846/http://www.newworld.com/release08232010.php |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this acquisition, the CPL has hosted annual competitions in China, in collaboration with the municipal government of [[Shenyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=China- Shenyang CPL Championship is Back!!!|date=6 Jul 2013|publisher=theCPL.com|url=http://thecpl.com/2013/07/china-shenyang-cpl-championship-is-back/|accessdate=30 Aug 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819025430/http://thecpl.com/2013/07/china-shenyang-cpl-championship-is-back/|archivedate=2013-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyberathlete Amateur League==

The CPL also owned and operated an online video game league for [[amateur]] players and teams, named the '''Cyberathlete Amateur League''' or CAL. CAL operated year-round, with regular eight-week seasons, one or two matches per week, and a single-elimination postseason (playoffs).

On November 14, 2008, the newly formed CPL Holding Group, LLC from [[United Arab Emirates]] announced that it had acquired CAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gotfrag.com/cs/story/43429/ | title=CPL Holdings Group Acquires CAL | accessdate=2011-02-22 | last=GotFrag | first= | date=2008-11-14 | work=thecpl.com | publisher= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113716/http://www.gotfrag.com/cs/story/43429/ | archivedate=2011-07-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2009, CAL ceased online operations. At its peak CAL was one of the largest online gaming leagues in North America with 20,000 teams and over 600,000 registered players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecpl.com/the-cpl-heritage/|title=The CPL Heritage|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105065035/http://thecpl.com/the-cpl-heritage/|archivedate=2013-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAL is based mainly on online game play. A 2003 competition hosted by CAL was played in a [[Hyatt]] Regency Ballroom.  Several tables were placed together where 10 computers were set up for the professional gamers.  The game was [[Half-Life: Counterstrike]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0808/p13s01-alsp.html?entryBottomStory |title=Are video games a sport? |publisher=csmonitor.com |date=2003-08-08 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAL ceased operating in 2009.

==CPL divisions==
In mid-2006, the CPL together with its international partners announced a series of licensed divisions to bring worldwide the experience of the CPL events.

* Singapore: Edge of Reality
* China: Media Gaming Live Pte Ltd
* Australia: Ping Events Australia EH? (James Duffy's "Puffing Duffy's Pro's")
* Chile: ALM Ingenieria (LAN-Z) S.A.
* Brazil: Made in Brazil Esportes Eletrônicos (MiBR) Ltda
* South Korea: International e-Sports Group, Inc (IEG)
* Sweden: E-Sport Entertainment Group AB (EEG)
* Romania: E-Sport Entertainment, Inc (OSIM)
* Italy: A.S. Play.it (ASPI)

==Possible fraud leak==
On April 2, 2010, a former CGS employee Tonya Welch, released information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Don't Be Fooled |url=http://www.complexitygaming.com/index.php?c=news&amp;id=1704 |title=New CPL: Don't be fooled |publisher=Complexitygaming.com |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; about an alleged "''fraud scheme''" by which the new buyers of the CPL had made fictitious statements to the general public and to the previous owner of the CPL. She claimed that the investors were not from Abu Dhabi, as had been announced, but that the purchase was actually conducted by a private group of US investors. Despite the allegations the acquisition was ultimately completed by WoLong Ventures of Singapore.

'''Dangler''' is a literary term meaning a [[plotline]] that is metaphorically left to "dangle" or "hang".  A ''dangler'', or ''dangling plotline'', is a [[plot device]] in fiction where a plotline is forgotten, phased out and eventually dropped, thus a resolution is never achieved.  Although dangling plotlines can occur in all forms of media, they typically appear in comic books, movies and book sequels, where the original writer or creative team can be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;http://dollhousewiki.fox.com/thread/2975709/DOLLHOUSE+Season+1+WRAP-UP%3A+Top+10+Plot+Danglers!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showfaq.asp?fldAuto=18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dexterwiki.sho.com/page/Dexter%3A+Plot+Holes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for danglers ==
Typically, a writer will pepper the main story with smaller back-stories.  It then becomes evident to the reader that these smaller back-stories have the potential to build up into a bigger story and reach a conclusion of some sort.

Editorial mandate can also force a writer to drop a building plotline due to fan backlash or an editor's lack of interest to pursue such a plot.

== Examples of danglers ==
In [[television]], when a creative team fears that their show may not be picked up for another season, they will end the [[season finale]] with a [[cliffhanger]] in order to conjure a fan outcry and interest to continue the series.  When the series is not picked up for another season, the cliffhanger creates a dangling plotline.  Usually the original writer, fan of the series, or the company who produced the series, will look to another form of media to continue the story. ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' was able to resolve some dangling plotlines due to the release of the [[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me|theatrical film]]. ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' got its own comic book series appropriately named ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'', which was written by series creator [[Joss Whedon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/14-111/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-Season-8-1&lt;/ref&gt; In an extremely rare occasion, ''[[Futurama]]'' was continued six years later through [[direct-to-DVD]] films, which eventually led to the resurrection of the series in its original television format.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedbumpstudios.com/futurama/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[comic book]]s, it is a common practice for writers to resolve their own dangling plotlines in other comic books within the [[shared universe]].  A good example is [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]], who started a [[Weapon X]] story in [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]], who then later became the writer of his own Weapon X series and as the series ended abruptly, was forced to continue some of his side-stories in a miniseries called ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now''.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;  One lingering plotline left a character in limbo from the ''Weapon X'' series until Frank Tieri took the reins of ''[[New Excalibur]]'',&lt;ref&gt;New Excalibur #8-15&lt;/ref&gt; where he proceeded to close this character's storyline, five years later.  [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Warren Ellis]] are also known for continuing their own stories throughout other books they write for.  In a similar fashion, [[Mark Millar]] has continued the story of an ever-dangling character, [[Clyde Wyncham]], all throughout his runs on ''[[Marvel 1985]]'', ''[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[Old Man Logan]]''.

Because of the unsatisfying nature of having a plotline dangle, fans sometimes take matters into their own hands.  One famous example of this, the numerous directors and writers in the ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'' series each had different directions for their story of [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]].  This left many [[plot holes]] and dangling storylines after each movie.  Seemingly unconnected, the movies would end with a cliffhanger and continue with absolutely no mention of the previous movie's occurrences.  To remedy this mess of [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], [[Chaos Comics]] published a comic book series to bridge the gaps between all the movies into one continuous [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

'''''Dedication 6''''' is a two part mixtape by American rapper Lil Wayne, hosted by DJ Drama. The first part of the mixtape was released on December 25, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dedication6.com|title=Lil Wayne Dedication 6 Mixtape #D6|website=[[DatPiff]]|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second part of the mixtape titled '''''Dedication 6: Reloaded''''' was released on January 26, 2018.&lt;ref name=HHNH&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-waynes-d6-reloaded-drops-tomorrow-heres-the-tracklist-news.42872.html|title=Lil Wayne's "D6: Reloaded" Drops Tomorrow, Here's The Tracklist|website=HotNewHipHop|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sixth installment of Lil Wayne's "''Dedication''" series, following its predecessors ''[[The Dedication]]'', ''[[Dedication 2]]'',  ''[[Dedication 3]]'', ''[[Dedication 4]]'' and ''[[Dedication 5]]''. It is the sixth installment of Lil Wayne's "Gangsta Grillz" chronology.

==Background==
On February 2, 2015, [[DJ Drama]] posts a picture of him, [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Mack Maine]] on [[Instagram]] with the caption, "Sorry For The Wait 2. Carter V. Dedication 6". [[HotNewHipHop]] says this indicates that ''Dedication 6'' will be released after ''[[Tha Carter V]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/dj-drama-hints-that-lil-wayne-s-dedication-6-will-drop-after-tha-carter-v-news.13837.html?image=1&amp;gallery=0|title=DJ Drama Hints That Lil Wayne's "Dedication 6" Will Drop After "Tha Carter V"|website=[[HotNewHipHop]]|last=Lilah|first=Rose|date=February 2, 2015|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2016, [[DJ Drama]] invited [[Lil Wayne]] and [[2 Chainz]] on an episode of his [[Shade 45]] podcast "Streetz is Watchin" to discuss the release of the album, ''[[ColleGrove]]''. The topic of conversation eventually turned to Lil Wayne and DJ Drama's "''Dedication''" mixtape series, and specifically the whereabouts of the next installment, ''Dedication 6''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-waynes-dedication-6-is-coming-news.20910.html|title=Lil Wayne's "Dedication 6" Is "Coming"|website=HotNewHipHop|last=Schwartz|first=Danny|date=April 4, 2016|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I started no longer wanting Drama to put out only songs I'm doing my own little remixes to. I started giving him original music. I started approaching mixtapes as to actually getting a little more recognition than albums. So start paying attention to what you're doing and how you're doing it on there, and still doing the same thing. That's why when you ask me what's my favorite Dedication, I'm always going to say the last one because I'm trying to get only better than the last shit.}} Wayne also said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/lil-wayne-teases-release-new-mixtape-rapper-could-drop-dedication-6-2016-2348083|title=Lil Wayne Teases Release Of New Mixtape; Rapper Could Drop ‘Dedication 6’ In 2016|website=[[IBTimes]]|last=Bodner|first=Brett|date=April 4, 2016|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I want it to be something you can listen to ten years from now, just like when I walk in, I meet people, and they be like, 'Damn, ''[[Dedication 3]]'', I still listen to that every day.}}

Lil Wayne has teased the mixtape several times throughout 2016 and 2017. It was rumored to release some time before the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lilwaynehq.com/2017/10/cortez-bryant-gives-little-update-on-lil-wayne-dedication-6-mixtape/|title=Cortez Bryant Gives A Little Update On Lil Wayne’s “Dedication 6” Mixtape|website=LilWayneHQ|last=Mousdell|first=Daniel|date=October 29, 2017|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7973960/lil-wayne-dedication-6-mixtape|title=Lil Wayne Teases 'Dedication 6' Mixtape|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Penrose|first=Nerisha|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lil Wayne's manager Cortez Bryant hinted it may release in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8038316/lil-wayne-manager-cortez-bryant-dedication-6-november-release|title=Lil Wayne's Manager Cortez Bryant Teases 'Dedication 6' Could Arrive This Month|website=Billboard|last=Penrose|first=Nerisha|date=November 11, 2017|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lil Wayne announced on Twitter that the mixtape would be released on Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LilTunechi/status/938499567770890240|title=It’s time!

'''''Don't Look Back''''' is a [[platform game]] playable through [[Adobe Flash]] and designed by [[Terry Cavanagh (developer)|Terry Cavanagh]]. The game is a modern interpretation of the [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]] [[Greek legend]].

The game is a combination of two ideas; Cavanagh wished to create a "silly shooter" where the player's actions were "redeemed" after being shown from a different perspective, he also wished to create a game where the gameplay acted as a metaphor of the player's actions.

Critics praised the game's addictiveness and presentation, but had different opinions over the game's high difficulty level.

==Gameplay==
The game is an interpretation of the Orpheus and Eurydice legend with stylized graphics resembling those produced by the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] game console.&lt;ref name="jay"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/03/dont_look_back.php| title = Don't Look Back| author = Psychotronic| publisher = [[Jay is Games]]| date = 2009-03-05| accessdate = 2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players control a man who begins the game standing at the grave of his lover. After finding a handgun, he descends into the underworld to find the spirit of the deceased and lead her back out to safety.&lt;ref name="play"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://playthisthing.com/dont-look-back| title = Don't Look Back - A Love Story About Jumping Puzzles| author = Dugan, Patrick| publisher = [[Manifesto Games|Play This Thing]] | date = 2009-03-20| accessdate = 2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players have infinite chances to repeat each of the game's screens, the screen must be replayed if the player makes contact with an enemy or hazard, and also if the player turns the man to face his lover once she has been rescued. Play consists of crossing lava pits by jumping across platforms, circumnavigating other hazards, fending off enemies such as spiders and bats, and defeating [[Boss (video games)|bosses]].&lt;ref name="jay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indie preview"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/03/preview_dont_look_back_distrac.html| title = Preview: Don't Look Back (Distractionware)| author = W., Tim| publisher = [[Gamasutra|IndieGames.com]]| date = 2009-03-01| accessdate = 2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After safely leading the spirit out of the underworld, the player reaches the gravestone where the game started, to encounter the man still stood at the grave. Both the player character and the spirit disappear, leaving the other figure standing alone at the grave. The journey is a fantasy, once completed the player is confronted by the reality of the figure silently grieving.&lt;ref name="critics"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gamecritics.com/brad-gallaway/interview-with-terry-cavanagh-creator-of-dont-look-back| title = Interview with Terry Cavanagh, creator of Don't Look Back| author = Gallaway, Brad| publisher = GameCritics.com| date = 2009-04-18| accessdate = 2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Don't Look Back'' is a combination of two separate ideas, one of which was what Cavanagh termed "a silly shooter or something like that",&lt;ref name="critics"/&gt; which would be "redeem(ed)" by a twist which would show the player's actions in a different light. The other idea was creating a game where the gameplay itself was "a metaphor for something else that's happening to the player".&lt;ref name="critics"/&gt;

==Reception==
The iOS port had initially been rejected by Apple due to its marketing material stating that "''There are no in-app purchases or any of that nonsense''".&lt;ref&gt;http://distractionware.com/blog/2012/10/dont-look-back-now-available-for-ios-and-android/&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists praised ''Don't Look Back'' overall, in particular its presentation, the gat Jim Rossignol of [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] described ''Don't Look Back'' as "simplistic, but very tricky",&lt;ref name="rock"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/03/16/dont-look-back/| title = Don’t Look Back| author = Rossignol, Jim| publisher = [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]| date = 2009-03-16| accessdate = 2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding "It’s really well done".&lt;ref name="rock"/&gt; Indie game developer [[Derek Yu]] stated it is a moody game similar to ''[[Seiklus]]'' but "more focused and challenging",&lt;ref name="tig"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://tigsource.com/articles/2009/03/13/dont-look-back| title = Don't Look Back| author = [[Derek Yu|Yu, Derek]]| publisher = TIGSource| date = 2009-03-13| accessdate = 2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is rewarding to play for fans of the genre.&lt;ref name="tig"/&gt; Tim Rose of IndieGames.com said the game is "simply quite brilliant" and "great platforming fun that deserves to be played".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/03/browser_game_pick_dont_look_ba.html| title = Browser Game Pick: Don't Look Back (Terry Cavanagh)| author = Rose, Tim| publisher = [[Gamasutra|IndieGames.com]]| date = 2009-03-05| accessdate = 2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff of online video game magazine ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' found the game addictive, "a perfect example of doing more with less",&lt;ref name="escapist"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/alt-escape/5849-Alt-Escape-Dont-Look-Back| title = Alt + Escape - Don't Look Back| author = Escapist Staff| publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]| date = 2009-03-13| accessdate = 2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated it possesses a "wonderfully haunting aesthetic".&lt;ref name="escapist"/&gt;

In a positive examination of ''Don't Look Back'', game designer [[Emily Short]] (writing for [[Gamasutra]]) described the game as "not a masterpiece", but she noted that it illustrates "the methods by which a masterpiece will one day be written." She also pointed to the fact that the difficulty of the game elevated it in a way that was impossible for traditional accounts of the Orpheus myth (opera, sculpture, painting, and literature). Through the struggle the player identifies with Orpheus on a much deeper level.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Short|Short, Emily]]. ''[http://gamasutra.com/view/news/115375/Analysis_Dont_Look_Back__Cavanaghs_Alternate_Game_Viewpoints.php Analysis: Don't Look Back - Cavanagh's Alternate Game Viewpoints]''.

'''''Extras''''' is a [[British sitcom]] about [[Extra (actor)|extras]] working in television, film, and theatre. The series was co-produced by the [[BBC]] and [[HBO]] and was created, written, and directed by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], both of whom also starred in it. ''Extras'' follows the lives of Andy Millman (Gervais), his platonic friend Maggie Jacobs ([[Ashley Jensen]]), and Andy's substandard agent and part-time retail employee Darren Lamb (Merchant) as Millman muddles through life as an anonymous "background performer" who eventually finds success as a B-level sitcom star.

''Extras'' has two series of six episodes each as well as a Christmas Special.  The first episode aired in the UK on 21 July 2005 on [[BBC Two]] and on 25 September 2005 on HBO in the US.  The second series premiered in the UK on BBC Two on 14 September 2006 and began airing in the US on HBO and in Australia on ABC on 14 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/extras/?ntrack_para1=leftnav_category0_show3 HBO: Extras&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Christmas Special aired on 27 December 2007 on [[BBC One]] and on 16 December 2007 on HBO. Both series are available on [[DVD]] in the UK and the US.

The series is filmed in a more traditional sitcom style than the [[mockumentary]] style used by Gervais and Merchant in their previous series ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.  Each episode has at least one guest star: a television or film celebrity, who play what Gervais and Merchant have referred to as "twisted" versions of themselves;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Lee| first = Alana| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = BBC - Movies - interview - Ricky Gervais| work = | publisher = BBC| date = March 2005| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/03/18/ricky_gervais_valiant_interview.shtm| doi = | accessdate = 2008-08-29}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exaggerated or inverted parody of their public personas.

The show has been critically acclaimed, and has a [[Metacritic]] score of 81/100.

==Plot==

Andy Millman ([[Ricky Gervais]]) is an aspiring actor who can only find work as an extra which he often refers to as being a "background artist" as a means of making the work seem more dignified to others than he, himself, believes it to be. Andy is accompanied on his various projects by his platonic best friend and fellow extra, Maggie Jacobs ([[Ashley Jensen]]). Maggie is well-meaning but ditzy, often missing obvious social cues and failing to exhibit appropriate tact and subtlety in conversations. Unlike Andy, Maggie has no aspirations toward being anything more than an extra. Andy's agent, Darren Lamb ([[Stephen Merchant]]) is a part-time employee of mobile phone retailer, [[Carphone Warehouse]], and has no real experience in the field of entertainment. He is incompetent, often taking no steps at all to find work for Andy, and even discouraging potential employers from hiring his client due to his flabby physique, age, and lack of acting experience. Darren is assisted by former soap opera star Shaun Williamson, who plays himself. Lamb frequently tries to undermine Andy by suggesting Williamson (who Lamb refers to by his former ''[[EastEnders]]'' character name, "Barry") is better suited for various acting roles that are offered to Andy.

Fed up with life as an extra who is always being cut out of scenes just as he manages to get his face on camera, Andy shamelessly kisses up to celebrities and producers in an effort to try to get screen time or a line of dialog.  Although often successful in these endeavors, circumstances always arise that prevent Andy from advancing his career. Reasons include celebrities confessing that they have no real power to help, or (more often) Andy inadvertently offending the star which results in his immediate dismissal from the set.

In the conclusion of season one, Andy successfully delivers a sitcom script he has written to [[Patrick Stewart]] who, in turn, passes it along to the BBC through his production company. Andy gets a meeting with BBC comedy producers who greenlight his project and agree to allow him to play the starring role in the show.

Series Two largely chronicles Andy's frustrations with his sitcom--''When the Whistle Blows''--which is heavily rewritten by BBC producers resulting in it being a lowest-common-denominator comedy that relies on a multitude of catchphrases, offensive stereotypes, and silly costumes for cheap laughs. Although the sitcom is commercially successful, pulling six million weekly viewers, it is a flop with critics who mercilessly bash both it and Andy. Andy periodically gets a chance to expand his repertoire in film and on stage but manages to ruin every opportunity that comes his way by either refusing to take direction, or by once again offending bigger stars than himself.

In the series' 90-minute finale, the sitcom has made Andy financially successful and recognizable to many, but he is increasingly frustrated with the show's quality and with his career not moving forward. Andy is convinced to fire Darren as his agent and become a client of a larger, more professional firm which he believes will accelerate his path upward. After taping a Christmas Special for ''When the Whistle Blows'', he announces to the live studio audience that he is quitting the series effective immediately. His career falls into total stagnation and Andy is forced to take bit parts on various long-running British television series such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Hotel Babylon]]''. Eventually, his agent ceases to take his calls. Andy's relationship with Maggie sours as he frequently ignores her, and spends all of the time they spend together complaining about not getting the opportunities he feels he deserves.

When he crashes his agent's lunch meeting at a posh restaurant, he is bluntly told that he will never realize his dreams of having fame, fortune, prestige and respect.  Crushed, Andy reluctantly agrees to lower his expectations for the sake of remaining modestly famous and successful, and is cast in ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. While staying in the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' house, Andy openly reflects upon the price of fame and grows increasingly disenchanted with the culture of celebrity worship that has manifested itself throughout Western society.

His despondency culminates in an emotional breakdown during a conversation with the other housemates. He tearfully turns to the camera and apologizes to Maggie, who is watching the broadcast from her apartment, for ignoring her and not heeding her advice to be grateful for the things he has managed to achieve. He voluntarily departs the house, ending his tenure on the show. Moved by the unexpected outpouring of emotion, a group of journalists eagerly awaits Andy's appearance at a press conference. Andy's agent returns, and tells him that his emotional turn has instantly skyrocketed Andy's profile, and that a number of A-list stars are requesting to meet him. As his agent prepares to introduce him to the throng of waiting press, Andy quietly slips out the back door of the studio where Maggie is waiting for him in her car. They drive off together with Andy seemingly turning his back on show business and accepting a life of anonymity.

==Episodes==
{{main article|List of Extras episodes}}
{{:List of Extras episodes}}

There are twelve regular episodes and a 90-minute Christmas special.

When the first series was originally broadcast in the UK, the episode featuring [[Ben Stiller]] was broadcast first, followed by the [[Ross Kemp]] and [[Vinnie Jones]] episode the following week. When the series was repeated over the Christmas holiday 2005, the episodes were returned to their intended order, with Ross Kemp first, followed by Stiller. The first series DVD, released in the UK on 31 October 2005, also preserves this same order, along with the ''Extras'' script book.

When the first series is shown in North America another order is used:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/extras/episode/ HBO: Extras – Episode 12, Season 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==US and UK version differences==
There were some subtle changes between the UK and US versions, with references to the names of British celebrities often being changed to American celebrities for the US edition.

In Season 2, episode 1, [[Keith Chegwin]]'s anti-gay tirade includes the sentence "Men have knobs, women have fannies. Pop knob in fanny. Not up the arse." In [[British English]] "fanny" is a euphemism for vagina, while in [[American English]] "fanny" is a term for buttocks. A scene was shot, and aired in the US, in which Chegwin says "Men have dicks. Women have vaginas. Pop dick in vagina. Not up the bum."

In Season 2, episode 3, in the scene where Darren Lamb tells Andy Millman about an offer that has come in for Andy to play a supporting role in a film, Lamb mistakenly says the film stars [[Billie Piper]]. For the American broadcast, an alternate take was used where Merchant's character says, "How do you fancy three days with [[Halle Berry]]?" In each case, Piper and Berry's names are mistaken for the name [[Harry Potter]] (actor [[Daniel Radcliffe]] guest stars in the episode).

In Season 2, episode 4, a scene featuring UK TV presenter [[Moira Stuart]] was completely excised from the US version and a song by [[Coldplay]] frontman [[Chris Martin]] replaced it; the latter was featured as a deleted scene on the DVD releases.

In the Christmas special the talking "[[Jade Goody]]" doll was replaced by a talking "[[Michael Richards#Laugh Factory incident|Kramer]]" doll. (Both dolls parodied incidents where each celebrity said things publicly that were generally seen as racist.) The T-shirt in the studio audience depicting [[Victoria Wood]] and [[Asda]] is replaced in the US version by a T-shirt depicting [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[DirectTV]]. A scene with [[George Michael]] was also truncated to remove references to UK celebrities [[Richard and Judy]] and [[Catherine Tate]]. A scene set in the Carphone Warehouse was edited to remove jokes referring to the long running BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''.

==''When the Whistle Blows''==
{{See also|Characters of Extras#When the Whistle Blows}}
''When the Whistle Blows'' is the [[show-within-a-show]] [[sitcom]] created, co-written by and starring Andy Millman. It was first mentioned in episode 1.3, as a script that Millman had written and given to Darren, who neglected to read it (in a recurring joke, he would frequently forget the name of the show, often calling it ''When the Wind Blows'' and even confusing it with ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''). The script was turned into a sitcom on [[BBC One]] in the first season finale, after Millman gave the script to Patrick Stewart. Excerpts from the sitcom are featured in the second season, and many of the ''Extras'' second season plotlines revolve around Millman's experiences on and around the show.

''When the Whistle Blows'' is set in a [[Wigan]] factory canteen. The humour is broad and lowbrow in the manner of many catchphrase-based sitcoms. The main catchphrase of the show, "Are you 'avin' a laugh?," is spoken by Millman. The show is unpopular with critics but popular with the public. It does receive a [[BAFTA]] nomination, although Millman suspects it is there simply to make up the numbers, and in the end it loses to an unspecified programme by [[Stephen Fry]].

Millman is deeply unhappy with the show, feeling that too many people have interfered with his original ideas in the hunt for ratings. It appears that Millman originally set out to do a comedy similar to ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', with true-to-life characters in a realistic work environment, without a studio audience or canned laughter. After being forced to collaborate and compromise many of his ideas with producers at the BBC, the show is transformed into lowest common denominator fare with each character having his/her own catchphrase which are repeated ad nauseam to the delight of its 6 million viewers. The show is further debased by the unexplained guest appearance of [[Coldplay]]'s [[Chris Martin]], in episode 2.4, which bears no relation to the plot and which Millman openly opposes, going so far as to utter the on-camera line, "Chris Martin, what are you doing in a factory in Wigan?  It's mental!"

The presence of studio audiences/[[laugh track|canned laughter]], and the reliance on funny wigs, costumes and [[catchphrase]]s for humour is a comment on British comedy hits such as ''[[Little Britain]]'' and ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Dessau| first = Bruce| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Little at Large| work = | publisher = [[The Scotsman]]| date = 2006-10-01| url = http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1220&amp;id=1454502006| doi = | accessdate = 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people that Millman sees at the recording of the pilot wear T-shirts displaying comedy catchphrases, such as "[[Whassup?|Wassup]]", "[[It's Chico Time]]", "[[Emily Howard (Little Britain)|I'm a lady!]]", "[[The Catherine Tate Show|Am I bovvered?]]" and "[[Peter Kay|Garlic bread?]]." (These shirts are not shown in the US version of ''Extras''.) Some of the reviews that the show gets refer to it as a "time warp comedy", and Millman's character talks about 1970s catchphrases such as Mr Humphreys' "I'm Free"  (from ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'')  and [[Frank Spencer (Michael Crawford)|Frank Spencer]]'s "Ooh Betty" (from ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]''), suggesting that it is also partly sending up 1970s British comedy. In episode 2.5, [[Germaine Greer]] suggests that ''When the Whistle Blows'' is "sub ''[[Carry On films|Carry On]]''".

==Music==
The closing title track is called "Tea for the Tillerman", which is written and performed by [[Cat Stevens]] and is the title track of his album ''[[Tea for the Tillerman]]''. The fourth episode of the second series of the show features a cover of the song performed by [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]].

The song in the Christmas Special highlighting Maggie's depression after she hits bottom and quits acting is "[[This Woman's Work (song)|This Woman's Work]]" by [[Kate Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/story/music-extras-fames-fickle-finger/17709292|title=Music on Extras: Fame's Fickle Finger|last=Lelane|first=Drake|date=18 December 2007|publisher=film.com|accessdate=2008-09-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616021837/http://www.film.com/tv/story/music-extras-fames-fickle-finger/17709292|archivedate=16 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Andy is having a bad time at [[The Ivy]] restaurant and leaves Maggie on her own, [[The Smiths]]' song "[[Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want]]" can be heard.

==Guest star cancellations and replacements==
According to a segment in the extras section of the Series 1 DVD, [[Jude Law]] was scheduled to appear in one of the episodes, after meeting Gervais backstage on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', but had to pull out due to film commitments. This resulted in Gervais and Merchant having to scramble to find a replacement actor at the last minute, with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] being considered and doggedly pursued. A featurette on the first series DVD release, "Finding Leo", consists of late-night video camera footage (shot mostly by Merchant) chronicling Gervais' desperate but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to contact DiCaprio's representatives. Law was ultimately replaced by [[Patrick Stewart]] in the series 1 finale, although a poster for the Jude Law film ''[[Alfie (2004 film)|Alfie]]'' appeared at the end. Other actors who did not appear in ''Extras'' despite initial reports from Gervais that they would appear include [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Brad Pitt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Smith| first = Neil| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Extras 'a nightmare' says Gervais| work = | publisher = BBC News| date = 2005-07-14| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4680133.stm| doi = | accessdate = 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Williams| first = Lowri| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tom Cruise To Appear In Ricky Gervais' 'Extras'| publisher =| work = EntertainmentWise| date = 2005-11-08| url = http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=10285| accessdate = 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Keith Harris (ventriloquist)|Keith Harris]] turned down a part having read the script, telling ''The Independent'' "This isn't clever writing, it's pure filth".

==Synopsis==
The series is set in a run-down bar called Horace and Pete's in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The bar has been owned by the same family since 1916 and has been passed down through several generations, always with a Horace and a Pete in charge. The current owners are the 49-year-old Horace Wittel VIII and his 52-year-old cousin Pete. The bar is old-fashioned and tradition bound; for example, no mixed drinks are served and the only beer they sell is [[Budweiser]] [[Draught beer|on tap]]. Pricing is variable, depending on whether the customer is a regular or a [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] who is drinking there "ironically". For many years, the management has been watering down the drinks, justifying it to themselves by saying their alcoholic regular customers would be dead by now if they were drinking full-strength liquor.

While there is an overarching narrative concerning the relationships between the members of the family and the future of the bar, there are many stand-alone scenes which take place in the bar and do not advance the main plot. Episode 1, for example, features a debate on liberalism and conservatism between a minor character and two guest actors, while episode 2 features a disastrous [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] date between two guest actors who have no connection with any of the other characters. A feature of the series was the frequent references to highly topical current events during the barroom discussions. This was made possible by the very short time frames between the production and release of the episodes (less than a week). Other story lines appeared to take place over longer periods.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Review-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poniewozik|first1=James|title=Review: Louis C.K.’s ‘Horace and Pete,’ Mournful and Unshakable|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/arts/television/louis-ck-horace-and-pete-episode-1-review.html|accessdate=January 31, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deadline-HoracePete-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lincoln|first1=Ross A.|title=Louis C.K.

==Cast and characters==
===Main cast===
* Horace Wittel VIII ([[Louis C.K.]]) is 49 years old and divorced. He is estranged from his son Horace Wittel IX, who refuses all contact with him, and has a frosty relationship with his daughter Alice. Formerly an accountant, he inherited the bar one year prior to the start of the series after the death of his abusive father Horace Wittel VII. He carries on the tradition of the family bar but with little enthusiasm for the role. He is prone to bouts of depression, but nevertheless is quite successful at attracting women. He has good people skills and frequently becomes the peacemaker in conflict situations. However, he also has a callous streak.
* Pete Wittel ([[Steve Buscemi]]) is 52 years old and is co-owner of the bar. He was raised with Horace and Sylvia as their brother, but is their biological second cousin; his biological father is Uncle Pete. As a teenager, he was handsome, athletic, and outgoing, but he was later crippled by a severe mental illness and institutionalized for several years. He is now dependent on an expensive drug called "probitol" to function, and on the family bar for his livelihood. He is generally kind and concertedly respectful towards other people, especially women, but struggles with the limitations and consequences of his condition, making him sensitive to perceived criticism, especially where Horace is concerned, leading to frequent minor spats between the two.
* Sylvia Wittel ([[Edie Falco]]) is in her early fifties and is Horace's older sister. She was a rebellious and unhappy teenager, and is tough and assertive as an adult. She has a son, Franklin, who is at school, and a daughter, Brenda, who is emotional and protective of her, much to her irritation. She hates the bar and all the misery associated with it, and wants to shut it down and claim her share of the inheritance to help pay for her [[chemotherapy]], as she has just been diagnosed with cancer. Despite this, she has a good relationship with Horace, who persuades her to become involved in the bar's management. She can also be startlingly blunt when she finds cause to criticize someone, to the point of cruelty.
* Leon ([[Steven Wright]]) is in his sixties and has been a regular at the bar for many years. A recovering alcoholic, he continues to visit the bar for companionship, drinking only apple juice. He speaks infrequently, is laconic and has a dry sense of humor. He is chivalrous and believes a man should never be rude to a woman regardless of the circumstances.
* Kurt ([[Kurt Metzger]]), a regular at the bar, is an opinionated loudmouth in his thirties. He has a nihilistic world view, and believes it would be good idea to elect [[Donald Trump]] in order to destroy the current political system. It is unclear what he does for a living or what his source of income is. He is crude and insensitive.
* Uncle Pete ([[Alan Alda]]) is about 80 years old and was the co-owner of the bar before handing over the reins to Pete after Horace VII's death. He continues to tend the bar and in effect runs it, bullying Horace and Pete and drawing his own indeterminate salary from the bar's takings. He is an acerbic, foul-mouthed bigot who insults everyone and is particularly abusive towards his family, but his rants are often a source of some entertainment to the bar's patrons. He reveals in the first episode that he is Pete's biological father (his mother is unknown).  He is the only Wittel who treats Marsha as family and he sometimes shows other patrons, particularly women, a degree of warmth and respect, but is hostile towards anyone who challenges his bigoted views. Horace VIII's father Horace VII was Uncle Pete's first cousin.
* Marsha ([[Jessica Lange]]) is in her sixties and was Horace Wittel VII's last sexual partner before his death. Subsequently Uncle Pete has continued to give her a share of the bar's takings and give her free drinks. She is a chronic alcoholic and has been drinking since her early teens, relying on her sex appeal to attract men to support her habit. She is loud and often very rude, speaking her mind without social filters.

===Recurring cast===
* Alice Wittel ([[Aidy Bryant]]) is Horace's daughter. She is 23 years old and is nearing the end of her law studies. Horace was absent from her life for most of her childhood, and she still bitterly resents him for causing the family to break up. Unlike her brother Horace Wittel IX, who refuses all contact, she meets with her father on several occasions, but rebuffs all his attempts to bond with her. She is emotionally cold; however, she is on friendly terms with her uncle Pete.
* Tricia ([[Maria Dizzia]]) is a pleasant young woman who has [[Tourette syndrome]], causing her to involuntarily make offensive utterances. She befriended Pete during his stay at a psychiatric hospital. When she attempts to renew their friendship Pete initially doesn't want to see her, associating her with the worst period of his life, but he relents and they eventually become romantically involved.
* Nick ([[Nick DiPaolo]]) is 49 years old and is an assistant DA. He is not particularly enthusiastic about his job and sees no prospects for advancement. He is politically conservative and often argues with other bar patrons. He is a semi-regular at the bar and sometimes picks up women there for one night stands.
* Tom ([[Tom Noonan]]), a regular at the bar, is a lugubrious man in his 60s who is a failed musician and actor. He sometimes plays the piano.
* Melissa (Liza Treyger)
* Carl ([[Greer Barnes (comedian)|Greer Barnes]])
* Rhonda ([[Karen Pittman]])
* Dom ([[Dov Davidoff]])
* Mark (Mark Normand)
* Ricardo ([[muMs da Schemer|Craig muMs Grant]])

== Production==
=== Conception and casting ===
[[File:Louis CK 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Creator [[Louis C.K.]] made the show without making any public announcements.]]
C.K. said that the show was inspired by [[Mike Leigh]]'s 1977 play, ''[[Abigail's Party]],'' which was written and developed using Leigh's improvisation method, and was then made into a multi-camera TV play. ''Abigail's Party's'' story takes place during the course of a night, over drinks and dinner. It is one scene over two hours.&lt;ref name=HowardSternShow-StoryofShow-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Howard|title=Louis C.K. Explains His Concept for Horace and Pete|url=https://soundcloud.com/howardstern/louisck_horaceandpete|accessdate=April 11, 2016|work=[[The Howard Stern Show]]|date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.K. also credits playwright [[Annie Baker]] both in discussion about the show and in the credits,&lt;ref name=NYTimes-HoracePeteNetworkSuits-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zinoman|first1=Jason|title=How 'Horace and Pete' Made the Network Suits Look Good|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/arts/television/how-horace-and-pete-made-the-network-suits-look-good.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he saw her play ''[[The Flick]],'' and was influenced by her work there. She also helped him with the writing of the first few episodes.&lt;ref name=WTFMaron-CKOpenSource-2016/&gt;

The idea was a sitcom with no audience or laugh-track, multi-camera, shot from a stage-like perspective (i.e., from one angle). The focus would be, similar to ''Abigail's Party,'' centered on a family. [[Steve Buscemi]] came on board first, then [[Edie Falco]] and [[Jessica Lange]]. C.K. said that the cast will get a portion of the profits.&lt;ref name=HowardSternShow-StoryofShow-2016 /&gt; C.K. originally tried to cast [[Joe Pesci]] for the role of Uncle Pete Wittel, which was played by [[Alan Alda]]. During their conversations Pesci gave C.K. a whole speech on never performing cunnilingus on a woman, which Pesci said C.K. could use; it became Alda's long monologue in episode 4. He also contacted [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Christopher Walken]] before deciding upon Alda, who was cast against type.&lt;ref name=WTFMaron-CKOpenSource-2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardSternShow-Pesci-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Howard|title=Louis C.K.

C.K. started writing the show in October 2015 and then as cast members came on board, he held rehearsals in January 2016. Sections of the show's scripts were kept intentionally blank with placeholders to insert current events, like the upcoming [[United States presidential election, 2016|presidential election]].&lt;ref name=WTFMaron-CKOpenSource-2016/&gt;

=== Filming ===
C.K. said that each episode cost half a million dollars to shoot.&lt;ref name=HReporter-HoracePeteDebt-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Ryan|title=Louis C.K. Says Web Series ''Horace and Pete'' Has Left Him "Millions of Dollars in Debt"|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/louis-ck-says-web-series-882833|accessdate=April 11, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was shot in a studio in New York City called NEP Penn Studios, which is located in the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]] across from [[Madison Square Garden]]. They shot the show starting in early January 2016, with production lasting about five or six weeks. Using the look and feel of ''Abigail's Party,'' C.K. used a color-coded shot list that was created during rehearsals to enable live-switching between cameras. A quick line-cut would enable a fast turnaround to distribution. Also unique to this approach, the editing becomes focused on dialogue and how the moods of the characters shift. There would be no ad breaks for commercials and no [[standards &amp; practices]] that would restrict language. Also important to C.K., and why he did not want to release the show via a television network, was that he wanted the show to be secret and unexpected, where the audience had little to no information before viewing, which he said would have been impossible with a traditional TV show model.&lt;ref name=WTFMaron-CKOpenSource-2016/&gt;

The strategy was that C.K. would make the first four episodes and use the money people paid for those to fund the rest of the season. Due to lack of promotion, there was not enough money and he went into debt to fund the production of the show. After he finished production on the show C.K. went on a promotional tour to promote the show and recoup some of the costs.&lt;ref name=HReporter-HoracePeteDebt-2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardSternShow-CKDebt-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Howard|title=Horace and Pete Put Louis C.K. Millions of Dollars In Debt|url=https://soundcloud.com/howardstern/louisck_debt|accessdate=April 11, 2016|work=[[The Howard Stern Show]]|date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.K. said that what he was going to be doing (i.e., producing shows of varying length, using a theater-based approach to storytelling, distributing the show himself) was going to be so extreme he did not want to have funding from other sources, like [[FX Networks]], even though people like [[Lorne Michaels]] strongly discouraged C.K. from doing this.&lt;ref name=WTFMaron-CKOpenSource-2016/&gt;

=== Music ===
[[File:Paul Simon at the 9-30 Club (b).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Paul Simon]] wrote the theme song and his music was used for the soundtrack.]]
The theme song was written and performed by [[Paul Simon]].&lt;ref name=Gothamist-HoracePeteSurprise-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yakas|first1=Ben|title=Louis C.K.

The first episode was released on January 30, 2016, with no press or previous mention.&lt;ref name=Variety-HoracePeteSurprise-2016/&gt; Subscribers to C.K.'s [[mailing list]] received an email notice of its availability.

Horace tries to ask Uncle Pete not to attend the afternoon's meeting with Sylvia and her lawyer over the future of the bar, fearing he will inflame the situation, but this only infuriates him. Horace has been trying to contact his daughter Alice all day when she unexpectedly visits. She rebuffs his attempts to connect with her, and declines his offer to let her stay at the upstairs apartment despite having accommodation problems. Pete has been acting strangely all day; he can no longer afford to take his expensive medication due to an insurance mix-up. He has a meltdown and scares away most of the customers. An accountant (Peter Benson) who was sent by Sylvia's lawyer asks some awkward questions about the bar's finances. Sylvia arrives with her lawyer ([[Stephen Wallem]]) and gives notice that she intends to sue the bar for her share of the inheritance and to sell it. Uncle Pete reveals that he is Pete's true father, but he gave him up to be raised by Horace's father. Amid the bickering, Pete unexpectedly becomes the voice of reason.

Jenny comes to have dinner at the apartment and meets Horace and Sylvia (it is apparent that Sylvia has agreed to take a role in managing the bar and moved into the apartment).

She spends the night with him. The next morning, Rhonda suggests (but never confirms) that she might be a [[trans woman]]. Horace isn't sure if she is joking, but is forced to consider his own attitudes towards transgender people. During the conversation Horace tells Rhonda that his two children were born at about the same time, one to his wife Sarah and the other to her younger sister Rosemary.

She had attempted to wean him off his medication, naively believing that their mutual love would see them through. Back at the bar, Horace is very upset about Pete's disappearance and rants at Leon; when Kurt attempts to joke about it Horace physically attacks him. Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] (played by himself) pays an unexpected visit to the bar. Horace retires to Pete's room and weeps. An imaginary conversation takes place in the bar between Pete and Uncle Pete; this suggests that Pete is still alive somewhere, and in his head he is trying to work through unresolved issues with his biological father.

 |ShortSummary    = The first half of the episode is set in 1976. Horace senior (Louis C.K.) is abusive and controlling towards his wife Marianne (Edie Falco) and children. In the bar, current events such as [[Jimmy Carter]]'s candidacy for the Presidency are discussed. Marianne finally walks out on her husband after years of abuse taking Sylvia ([[Sofia Hublitz]]) and Horace (Jack Gore), but leaving Pete (Nolan Lyons). The second half of the episode is set in the present. Ricardo informs Horace and Sylvia that the police will call off the search for Pete because he is almost certainly dead. Sylvia announces that she intends to leave the bar and live with Harold, and challenges Horace to make a decision about his own future. An eccentric and outgoing woman named Mara ([[Amy Sedaris]]) lifts Horace's mood when she interviews for a job. Horace tells Sylvia he knows what he wants to do with his life now. Pete returns to the bar and picks up a knife. Sylvia screams as Pete kills Horace. As Sylvia prepares to leave with Harold, Horace's son, Horace IX ([[Angus T. Jones]]) comes to the bar and asks about his father. Sylvia says there was nothing distinctive about Horace, he was "just some guy", then breaks down in tears.

'''Kiev National Ballet''' performs works of [[classical ballet]] and tours internationally. It currently has 24 ballets in its repertory, one of the largest in the world, and has had many notable dancers among its members.

==History==
===1867 to 1930===
The [[National Opera of Ukraine]], a performing arts theatre with a resident opera company, was established in 1867. It also included a small resident troupe of ballet dancers, who would perform mainly folk-style dancing during opera productions. By 1893, this grew to a troupe large enough to stage large ballets. Folk dancing and ballets with Ukrainian stories were among the early productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bleiberg|first=Laura|title=Kiev Ballet cleaves to the classics|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/ballet-83686-kiev-nutcracker.html|accessdate=March 10, 2012|newspaper=Orange County Register|date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, the dance scene in Kiev saw a rapid development in [[classical ballet]] and [[contemporary dance]] training and performance. [[Mikhail Mordkin]], a former soloist with the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], travelled to Kiev with a troupe and gave performances with Art Nouveau approaches, containing Spanish and Oriental themes. He was hired by the experimental Kiev Young Theatre between 1916 and 1919, and gained a reputation as an influential teacher of movement and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Makaryk, Irena R. and Virlana Tkacz|title=Modernism in Kiev|year=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9781442640986|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronislava Nijinska]], sister of [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and a former soloist with Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]] in Paris, fled to Kiev in 1916 to escape [[World War I]] upheaval in Western Europe. Her husband, also a dancer with the [[Ballets Russes]], was hired as ballet master at the Kiev Opera. Nijinska founded a modernist dance school, the École de Mouvement, in Kiev. This was an influential step forward in Kiev's dance culture, exposing artists there to the avant garde of Western Europe. Following the Communist Revolution in Russia and Ukraine, however, Nijinska was forced to flee once more, to Poland, and the school disbanded shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Makaryk, Irena R. and Virlana Tkacz|title=Modernism in Kiev|year=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9781442640986|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her most prominent pupil while in Kiev was local dancer [[Serge Lifar]], who went on to become principal dancer with the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1923, and was considered the most important dancer and choreographer of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schueneman, Bruce R. and William Emmett Studwell|title=Minor Ballet Composers|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780789003232|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1931 to 1989===
The first full symphonic Ukrainian ballet, [[Mr. Kanyovsky]] by M. Verikivsky, was premiered by the Kiev Ballet on October 18, 1931. In 1935, the Kiev Ballet was awarded the gold medal at the London International Folklore Dance Festival. Also known as the National Ballet of Ukraine, the Kiev Ballet company began to tour internationally by the 1950s, primarily in [[Communist Bloc]] countries such as Bulgaria, [[Yugoslavia]], and Hungary, but also to Britain and France. The Kiev Ballet was awarded the Étoile d'Or the French Dance Academy's highest prize, at the 1964 International Dance Festival in Paris. Performances by the National Ballet of Ukraine in Paris were considered highlights of the European cultural calendar for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swan Lake|url=http://www.grandsballets.com/en/spectacle.php?spectacle=28|publisher=Les Grands Ballets Canadiens|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990 to today===
Following Ukraine independence in 1990, the Kiev Ballet began more extensive international touring, adding performances in North America, Europe and Asia to its tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swan Lake|url=http://www.grandsballets.com/en/spectacle.php?spectacle=28|publisher=Les Grands Ballets Canadiens|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Choreographer [[Anatoly Shekera]] directed the company from 1992 to 2000. Shekera was a driving force of the National Ballet during the late 20th century. Shekera directed modern and classical ballet works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swan Lake|url=http://www.grandsballets.com/en/spectacle.php?spectacle=28|publisher=Les Grands Ballets Canadiens|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company currently has around 150 dancers, and stages 16 productions per month in its Kiev theatre, in addition to extensive international touring. Some of the famous former members of the Kiev Ballet are [[Alina Cojocaru]], the Bolshoi's [[Svetlana Zakharova (dancer)|Svetlana Zakharova]], [[Leonid Sarafanov]], [[Maxim Beloserkovsky]] and his wife, [[Irina Dvorovenko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bleiberg|first=Laura|title=Kiev Ballet cleaves to the classics|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/ballet-83686-kiev-nutcracker.html|accessdate=March 10, 2012|newspaper=Orange County Register|date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other former members are [[Maya Plisetskaya]], [[Nadezhda Pavlova]], [[Marina Timofeyeva]], [[Irina Kolpakova]], [[Alla Osipenko]], and [[Vladimir Malakhov (dancer)|Vladimir Malakhov]].

==Kiev Ballet School==
The Kyiv Choreographic College, formally Kyiv Choreographic School/Academy was founded by [[Galina Berezova]]. The school was founded in 1949 and is considered one of the best ballet schools in the post-Soviet space. It first opened in 1934 as a small studio to train ballet dancers for the Kiev Opera and Ballet Theatre, where the legendary ballet teacher and influencer [[Agrippina Vaganova]] worked.

Early children's programming addressing LGBT-related subject matter includes two episodes of ''[[CBS Schoolbreak Special]]''.

It was nominated for three Daytime Emmy Awards, winning for Outstanding Direction in Children's Programming.&lt;ref name = emmys&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985040/awards Awards - CBS Schoolbreak Special]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 episode "Other Mothers" featured a boy who was afraid that his friends would think he was gay because he has two mothers. The episode was nominated for five Daytime Emmys, winning for Outstanding Writing in a Children's Special, Outstanding Performer in a Children's Special ([[Justin Whalin]]) and Outstanding Sound Mixing in a Children's Special.&lt;ref name = emmys /&gt; In 1986, [[HBO]] broadcast ''[[The Truth About Alex]]'', which told the story of a high school athlete who discovers that his best friend Alex is gay.

== LGBT representation on Nickelodeon ==
On June 18, 2002, children's cable network [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] ran a program entitled ''Nick News Special Edition: My Family Is Different''. Produced by Linda Ellerbee's Lucky Duck Productions and hosted by Ellerbee, ''My Family Is Different'' featured children of gay and lesbian parents talking with children from households that oppose equal rights for gay and lesbian families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glaad.org/action/al_archive_detail.php?id=320&amp; GLAAD 2002]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;This program was subject to much criticism from Christian organizations, such as the Washington-based [[Traditional Values Coalition]], who believed the program pushed a "pro-homosexual agenda" and was not suitable for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-06-11/lifestyle/0206100256_1_gay-parenting-linda-ellerbee-nickelodeon|title=NICKELODEON UNDER FIRE FOR A SPECIAL ON GAY PARENTS|last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=11 June 2002|work=Sun Sentinel|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;Another organization that opposed this episode was the [[Parents Television Council]] who claimed they had no problem with same-sex parents but did not think it was appropriate for Nickelodeon's young target audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=NICKELODEON GETS LOTS OF ATTENTION WITH GAY SPECIAL|last=|first=|date=25 June 2002|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' became the first western children's animation series to not only feature major LGBT characters, but also a lead LGBT character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Joanna|title=How a Nickelodeon Cartoon Became One of the Most Powerful, Subversive Shows of 2014|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/12/korra-series-finale-recap-gay-asami|accessdate=19 December 2014|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=IGN Staff|title=THE LEGEND OF KORRA: IGN EDITORS REACT TO THE ENDING AND KORRASAMI|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/24/the-legend-of-korra-ign-editors-react-to-the-ending-and-korrasami|accessdate=25 December 2014|work=[[IGN]]|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, since the two suspected LGBT characters, [[Korra]] and [[Asami Sato|Asami]], never shared an on-screen kiss many argued the two were not canonically a couple, simply good friends. The shows creators Mike DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko quickly silenced that argument in a blog post stating, " Our intention with the last scene was to make it as clear as possible that yes, Korra and Asami have romantic feelings for each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/korra-bisexual-asami-finale/|title=‘Legend of Korra’ creators confirm gay romance between Korra and Asami|last=Baker-Whitelaw|first=Gavia|date=23 December 2014|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickelodeon's ''[[The Loud House]]'' debuted their first bi-racial gay couple on July 20th, 2016. Announcement of these characters, Harold and Howard McBride, was met with "overwhelmingly positive reaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/loud-house-gay-couple-nickelodeon-1201816592/|title=Nickelodeon’s ‘Loud House’ to Feature Married Gay Couple|last=Roshanian|first=Arya|date=2016-07-19|work=Variety|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the positive reaction from it's audience and parents on social media, conservative parents, with the help of conservative watch group [[One million moms|One Million Moms]], have pushed back with a campaign calling for the episode to be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3697867/Loud-proud-Nickelodeon-debuts-bi-racial-gay-couple-cartoon-Loud-House.html|title=Nickelodeon debuts first ever bi-racial gay couple on The Loud House|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== LGBT representation on PBS ==
In 2005, [[PBS]] planned to release an episode of the children's series ''[[Postcards from Buster]]'' in which the animated bunny visits the children of two [[lesbian]] couples. When education secretary [[Margaret Spellings]] stated disapproval of the planned episode, PBS withdrew plans for airing. Spellings believed the episode to be inappropriate for children as well as a misuse of governmental funding that the show had received. Lisa Reilly ([[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] Member Services), stands by the episode stating that, "We believe, as do WGBH's educational advisers on this series, that the program is appropriate for our audience and fits the series' mission to introduce children to the rich and varied cultures that make up the United States, including kids living in a wide range of family structures."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40188-2005Jan26.html ''The Washington Post'' 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Praise for Postcards from Buster and WBGH|last=Acain|first=A|date=March 2005|work=Gay Parents Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigid Sullivan, vice president of WGBH cited that over the course of 40 episodes, the show had represented many different family structures and cultures, including [[Mormons]], [[Orthodox jews|Orthodox Jews]], [[Christian|Christians]], and [[Muslim]] families. She said that this represented that the program was meant "to include, not to exclude, anyone who is part of our society, and for children to see a reflection of themselves on TV is an important part of their development."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Gay recruiting through cartoon characters?|last=Chibbaro Jr.|first=Lou|date=4 February 2005|work=New York Blade|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== LGBT representation on Cartoon Network ==
In 2016, [[Rebecca Sugar]], creator of ''[[Steven Universe]]'', spoke about her desire to create an LGBTQ show that was accessible to young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/rebecca-sugar-steven-universe-lgtbq/|title=Rebecca Sugar, Cartoon Network's first female creator, on writing LGBTQ stories for kids|newspaper=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its creation, ''Steven Universe'' has quickly gained a cult following largely made up of LGBT kids and young adults. In 2016, "The Answer," an episode depicting the romantic meeting of two female characters, [[Ruby (Steven Universe)|Ruby]] and [[List of Steven Universe episodes|Sapphire]], earned the show its second [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/the-wrap/article/Steven-Universe-Creator-Rebecca-Sugar-Talks-9180749.php|title=‘Steven Universe’ Creator Rebecca Sugar Talks LGBT Themes and Season 3|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/shows/steven-universe|title=Steven Universe|website=Television Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Clarence (U.S. TV series)|Clarence]]'' (2014-18), has also been praised for LGBT representation as one of the cartoons main characters, [[Jeff Randell]], has two moms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/four-cartoons-that-are-leading-the-way-in-lgbt-visibility/zsJogi---ekjB9tKntGMWg|title=Four cartoons that are leading the way in LGBT visibility|date=2015-07-09|work=Metro US|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two characters from the hit show ''[[Adventure Time]]'' (2010-present) have been the topic of much speculation from fans, [[Marceline the Vampire Queen]] and [[Princess Bubblegum]]. Fans have speculated that the two's interactions on-screen could be read as flirting. This speculation was confirmed by the shows creator [[Pendleton Ward]], who has stated that the two used to date. Since Marceline dates a man later in the series, this would make her the networks first out-right [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] representation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== LGBT representation on Disney Channel ==
In 2017 [[Disney]] the creators of ''[[Andi Mack]]'' had the character Cyrus played by [[Joshua Rush]] come out as gay in the episode titled "Hey, Who Wants Pizza?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Hey, Who Wants Pizza?|date=2017-10-27|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6932276/|others=Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Joshua Rush, Sofia Wylie|accessdate=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first episode of season 2. In an effort to ensure the story arc was age appropriate for the network's young audience, Disney consulted with groups such as [[PFLAG]], [[GLAAD]], [[Common Sense Media]], and The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/disney-channel-andi-mack-character-come-out-gay-1202194584/|title=‘Andi Mack’ Character To Come Out As Gay: A Disney Channel First|last=Evans|first=Greg|date=2017-10-25|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the channel's first depiction of an LGBT character as ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]'' debuted the channel's first lesbian couple on January 26th, 2014. The couple was introduced when the series' main character Charlie has a playdate with her friend Taylor. When Charlie's parents answer the door, they are shocked to find that "Taylor has two moms!" as Bob, Charlie's dad exclaims. While many celebrities tweeted their support (including former Disney star [[Miley Cyrus]]), conservative watch group [[One million moms|One Million Moms]] was not quiet about their disapproval of the episode and launched an email campaign against the network. They were joined in support by other conservative groups such as [[Family Research Council]] and [[Right Wing Watch|RightWingWatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/28/disney-channel-aired-its-first-gay-couple-it-was-fine|title=Disney Channel Aired Its First Gay Couple.

The '''Latino Theater Company''' (LTC) is a theatre producing organization based in Los Angeles, California.

== History ==
Latino Theater Company was founded in 1985 by its [[artistic director|Artistic Director]], [[Jose Luis Valenzuela]]. Known as the "Latino Theater Lab" and based at The Los Angeles Theatre Center (LATC), they produced plays and comedy showcases. They also created the "New Voices Playwriting Series," which commissioned many Latino playwrights. When LATC closed in 1991, LTC moved to the [[Mark Taper Forum]], where Valenzuela created the "Latino Theater Initiative."  The group moved to [[Plaza de La Raza]] in 1995. LTC returned to The LATC and in 2004 received a grant from the [[California Cultural and Historical Endowment]] to renovate The LATC and create a [[multicultural]] theater arts center, along with the [[Latino Museum of History, Art and Culture]].  In 2006, LTC became the operator of The LATC,  and invited several culturally different producing organizations together, creating the "Cultural Roundtable," to create theatre that reflects the cultural landscape of the City of Los Angeles.  "Cultural Roundtable" participants include Latino Theater Company, [[Robey Theatre Company]], [[Cedar Grove OnStage]], [[Playwrights' Arena]], [[Culture Clash (performance troupe)|Culture Clash]], [[American Indian Dance Theatre]] and the [[UCLA School of Theater Film and Television]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/stage/cl-et-latc26feb26,0,5543757.story "The New LATC cancels series" by  Lynne Heffley - 2/26/08] on [[Los Angeles Times]] online{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Latino Theater Company presented ''La Virgen de Guadalupe, Dios Inantzin'', performed at the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].  The pageant play has been performed every year since, and has become an annual [[Southern California]] holiday tradition offered free of charge to the community, for low-income, working families.

While some films criticize armed conflicts in a general sense, others focus on acts within a specific war, such as the use of poison gas or the [[Genocide|genocidal]] killing of civilians (e.g., ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', 2004). Some [[anti-war]] films such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964) use [[parody]] and [[black comedy]] to [[satire|satirize]] wars and conflicts. An anti-war film's goal is to show the physical and psychological destruction warfare causes to the soldiers and to innocent civilians.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Plot ==
Before being known as [[Luis Miguel]], Micky, as his family called him, finds a great satisfaction, love, and security alongside his beloved mother Marcela ([[Anna Favella]]) and his younger brother Alex ([[Juanpa Zurita]]). A singer of natural talent, he begins gaining recognition and popularity until he turns 11, when his father, Luis Rey ([[Óscar Jaenada]]), obsessively gives himself the task of turning his son into the superstar that he himself did not manage to be. As Micky grows and becomes a pop star of the time, with the name of Luis Miguel ([[Diego Boneta]]), problems associated with fame and protecting his private life and his great loves begin. While the world falls in love with the masculine image of a tanned young man with a beautiful smile and fascinating lifestyle in [[Acapulco, Mexico|Acapulco]], which was the hallmark of his career, what lies behind this reality is how fame and fortune can impact a family.

'''''Lust, Caution''''' ({{zh|t=色，戒|p=Sè, Jiè|j=Sik&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Gaai&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is a 2007 [[Erotic thriller|erotic]] [[Spy film|espionage]] [[historical period drama|period]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Ang Lee]], based on the [[Lust, Caution (novella)|novella of the same name]] published in 1979 by Chinese author [[Eileen Chang]]. The story is mostly set in Hong Kong in 1938 and in Shanghai in 1942, when it was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and ruled by the [[Wang Jingwei Government|puppet government]] led by [[Wang Jingwei]]. It depicts a group of Chinese university students from the [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]] who plot to assassinate a high-ranking [[special agent]] and [[recruiter]] working for the puppet government, by using one of their group, an attractive young woman, to lure him into a [[Honey trapping|honey trap]]. The film is generally accepted to be based on the historical event of Chinese spy [[Zheng Pingru]]'s failed attempt to assassinate the Japanese collaborator [[Ding Mocun]].&lt;ref name="Peng2014"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hsiao-yen|last1=Peng|last2=Dilley|first2=Whitney Crothers|title=From Eileen Chang to Ang Lee: Lust/Caution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJziAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58|date=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-91102-9|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this film, Lee won the [[Golden Lion]] Award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for the second time, the first being with ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/history/awards1.html?back=true The awards of the Venice Film Festival on the Festival's site]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[film adaptation]] and the story are loosely based on events that took place during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. The film's explicit sex scenes resulted in the film being rated [[NC-17]] in the United States.

==Plot==
'''Hong Kong 1938'''

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], a shy, inexperienced university student, Wong Chia Chi, travels from Shanghai to Hong Kong and attends her first year at [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]]. A male student, Kuang Yu Min, invites her to join his patriotic drama club, and soon she becomes a lead actress, inspiring both her audience and her colleagues. Inspired by the troupe's patriotic plays, Kuang persuades the group to make a more concrete contribution to the war against Japan. He devises a plan to assassinate Mr. Yee, a [[special agent]] and recruiter of the puppet government of [[Wang Jingwei]] set up by the Japanese occupation in China. The beautiful Chia Chi is chosen to take on the undercover role of "Mrs. Mai", the elegant wife of a trading company owner. She manages to insert herself into the social circle of Mrs. Yee.

Chia Chi catches the eye of Mr. Yee and tries to lure him to a location where he can be assassinated. Chia Chi is still a virgin, and she reluctantly consents to sleeping with another student involved in the plot, in order to practice her role as a married woman if she were to sleep with Yee. Kuang, who has feelings for Chia Chi, is upset by this, but agrees to the arrangement. Attracted to Chia Chi, Yee nearly falls for the trap but withdraws at the last minute. Soon after, Mr. and Mrs. Yee suddenly move back to Shanghai, leaving the students with no further chance to complete their assassination plan. While they are preparing to disband, an armed subordinate of Yee turns up unannounced and tells them that he is aware of their plans. After a violent struggle, the university students kill the subordinate and then go into hiding.

'''Shanghai 1942'''
[[File:Zheng Pingru 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese spy [[Zheng Pingru]], generally believed to be the inspiration for the film]]

Three years later in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, Chia Chi again encounters Kuang, who is now an undercover agent of the [[KMT]] secret service the [[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics|''Juntong'']], which is seeking to overthrow the Japanese occupation forces and their [[Wang Jingwei regime|puppet government]]. He enlists her into a renewed assassination plan to kill Yee. By this time, Yee has become the head of the secret police department under the puppet government and is responsible for capturing and executing Chinese resistance agents who are working for the KMT. Chia Chi is trained to use weapons and other spy tools.  She eventually becomes Yee's mistress, and during their first encounter, Yee has very rough sex with her. Over the next few weeks, however, their sexual relationship becomes very passionate and deeply emotional, which causes conflicting feelings in Chia Chi, who is still involved in the assassination plot.

When Chia Chi reports to her KMT superior officer, she exhorts him to carry out the assassination soon so that she will not have to continue her sexual liaisons with Yee, but she is told that the assassination needs to be delayed for strategic reasons. Chia Chi describes the inhuman emotional conflict she is in, sexually and emotionally bound to a man whom she is plotting to assassinate. When Yee sends Chia Chi to a jewelry store with a sealed envelope, she discovers that he has arranged for a large and extremely rare six-carat pink diamond for her, to be mounted in a ring. This provides the Chinese resistance with a chance to get at Yee when he is not accompanied by his bodyguards.

Soon after, Chia Chi invites Yee to accompany her to collect the diamond ring. While entering the jewelry shop, she notices that her friends are not outside (suggesting her friends may have already been caught). When she puts on the ring and sees Yee's obvious love for her, she is overcome by emotion and quietly urges him to leave. Understanding her meaning, Yee immediately flees the shop and escapes the assassination attempt. By the end of the day, most of the resistance group are captured. Yee's deputy was aware of the resistance cell, but did not inform Yee because he hoped to use the opportunity to catch their leader. Emotionally in turmoil, Yee signs their death warrants and the resistance group members, including Chia Chi, are led out to a quarry and executed. As all the members of the resistance group are forced to their knees while the executioners take out their pistols, a sad Kuang, who always loved Chia Chi, gazes at her. Meanwhile, Yee sits on Chia Chi's empty bed in the family guest room while his wife asks him what is going on, since his secretary and two men had taken Chia Chi's belongings and some papers from his office. Yee tells her to keep quiet and to continue playing downstairs, to avoid letting anyone know that something is amiss.  If anyone asks, he says, Chia Chi has returned to Hong Kong.

The film was nominated for the Best Film in a Foreign Language [[BAFTA]] in 2008.

Ang Lee was awarded Freedom of Expression award at the ShoWest convention for his decision to release the film in the United States uncut, rather than editing the film to avoid the [[MPAA]]'s [[NC-17]] rating.&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, Scott. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-03-13-showest-nc-17-debate_N.htm "'Lust, Caution': Not just a movie title in NC-17 debate"], ''[[USA Today]]'', March 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Censorship===
In its uncut form, ''Lust, Caution'' features three episodes of graphic sex, with full-frontal [[nudity]]. The ten minutes of sex scenes were considered by Lee to be critical to the story and reportedly took 100 hours to shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/fang-lee-cruel-but-true/2008/01/10/1199554807538.html |work=The Age |location=Melbourne, Australia | title='Fang' Lee: cruel but true | date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a number of countries, notably the People's Republic of China and India, many of the sex scenes had to be cut before the film could be released. In Singapore, while the film's producers initially decided to release a cut version there which was given an NC-16 rating, a public outcry stating that the producers of the film were underestimating censorship standards in the country (the film was released uncut in Hong Kong and Taiwan) prompted them to eventually release the uncut version with the higher R21 rating in Singapore. The film is rated R18 and was released uncut in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10488493&lt;/ref&gt;

The following scenes were cut from the mainland China version: 
# Wong Chia Chi walking past dead [[refugee]]s in the street
# [[Stabbing]] scene cut to only one knife stab
# Two of the sex scenes featuring the student, and three featuring Mr. Yee
# A nude shot of Wong Chia Chi at window
# Wong Chia Chi in bed after first sex scene with Mr. Yee
# Dialogue modified in diamond ring scene so that Wong Chia Chi did not betray the resistance by warning Mr. Yee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?in_article_id=78856&amp;in_page_id=7 Lee admits 'political edit' of film]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's end credits ends with a [[Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act|18 U.S.C § 2257 notice]].&lt;ref&gt;The notice reads: "18 U.S.C § 2257 records custodian – Joyce Hsieh, custodian of records, Mr. Yee Productions LLC, C/O Schreck Rose Dapello Adams &amp; Hurwitz LLP, 1790 Broadway, New York, NY 10019. Date of publication: September 28, 2007.

===Blacklisting===
Tang Wei was ostracized from China's movie industry and did not work for three years because the State Administration of Radio Film and Television (SARFT) disapproved of Tang's performance of sexual acts in ''Lust, Caution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-tang-wei-china-20170825-story.html|title="Lust, Caution" actress banned in China|date=9 March 2008|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; All print ads and feature content using Tang were removed, and her endorsements were discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/film-lust-dc-idUSN0935238620080309|title=Tang Wei's spectacular career comeback after being banned in China|date=7 August 2017|work=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was set to star in [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s budget period film ''[[The Warrior and the Wolf]]'' (2009), but was replaced by [[Maggie Q]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992952.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 "Maggie Q to star in 'Wolf'"] ''Variety''. 25 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, during her absence from the movie industry, she was reported to have briefly attended drama classes at the [[University of Reading]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/90001/90782/90875/6951726.html|title=Tang Wei returns, with caution|date=15 April 2010|work=People's Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country of production===
The film was co-produced by the American companies [[Focus Features]] and River Road Productions, and Chinese companies [[Shanghai Film Group Corporation]] and Haishang Films and the Taiwanese Hai Sheng Film Production Company. The director is Ang Lee, who is a [[naturalized]] U.S. citizen, and the actors/actresses are from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as well as the United States. It was shot in Shanghai, the neighboring province of [[Zhejiang]], Hong Kong (at Hong Kong University), and some locations in [[Penang]] and [[Ipoh]] in Malaysia used as 1930s/1940s Hong Kong.

Originally, the film's country was identified as "China-USA" by the organizers of the [[Venice Film Festival]]. However, a few days later, the Venice Film Festival changed the film to "USA-China-Taiwan, China" on its official schedule.&lt;ref name="title2"&gt;{{cite web |title=64th Venice Film Festival – In Competition |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/program/en/14372.1.html |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821012540/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/program/en/14372.1.html |archivedate=August 21, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the film premiered at the event, Taiwan's [[Mainland Affairs Council]] protested the Venice event's use of "Taiwan, China" to identify films from the island and blamed China for the move.&lt;ref name="title3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Taiwan protests Chinese credit for Ang Lee's movie at Venice festival |url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/entertainment/070828/e082804A.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115112757/http://www.cbc.ca/cp/entertainment/070828/e082804A.html |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Venice Film Fest faces faux pas over Taiwan |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/08/28/venice-taiwan.html|accessdate=February 9, 2008 | work=CBC News |date=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film's premiere, Taiwan submitted the film as its [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Film|Best Foreign Film Oscar]] entry. However, the Oscars asked Taiwan to withdraw the film because some key crew members were not locals. Oscars spokeswoman Teni Melidonian said in an e-mail organizers refused to accept the film because "an insufficient number of Taiwanese participated in the production of the film," violating a rule that requires foreign countries to certify their locals "exercised artistic control" over their submission.

On September 13, 2007, an elderly lady, Zheng Tianru, staged a press conference in Los Angeles, claiming that the movie was about real-life events that happened in World War II, and wrongfully portrayed her older sister, [[Zheng Pingru]], as a promiscuous secret agent who seduced and eventually fell in love with the assassination target [[Ding Mocun]] (she alleges that the characters were renamed to Wong Chia Chi and Mr. Yee in the movie).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.pchome.com.tw/entertainment/tvbs/20070913/index-20070913101808391700.html |script-title=zh:色‧戒」影射鄭蘋如？鄭家人不滿|accessdate=August 16, 2008|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan's investigation bureau confirmed that Zheng Pingru failed to kill Ding Mocun because her gun jammed, rather than developing a romantic relationship with the assassin's target.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Director Ang Lee maintains that Eileen Chang wrote the original short story as fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.people.com.cn/BIG5/8222/86596/100104/100111/6262679.html |title=湯唯情欲戲被指褻瀆烈士 &amp;lt;色戒&amp;gt;遭原型家人聲討 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612053510/http://ent.people.com.cn/BIG5/8222/86596/100104/100111/6262679.html |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{as of|2018|September|8|df=US}}, on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 73% of critics gave the film positive reviews, the consensus said "Ang Lee's ''Lust, Caution'' is a tense, sensual and beautifully-shot espionage film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lust_caution/ |title=Lust, Caution – Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 8, 2018 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film had an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 34 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/lustcaution |title=Lust, Caution (2007): Reviews |accessdate=October 30, 2007 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Mathews of the [[Daily News (New York)|New York ''Daily News'']] named it the 5th best film of 2007.&lt;ref name=mc07top10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2007/toptens.shtml |title=Metacritic: 2007 Film Critic Top Ten Lists |accessdate=January 8, 2008 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080102102034/http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2007/toptens.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Turan of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named it the 6th best film of 2007.&lt;ref name=mc07top10/&gt;

The Chinese press gave generally positive reviews. In analyzing how successful Lee's film was as an adaptation of Eileen Chang's short story, literary critic [[Leo Ou-fan Lee]] wrote in [[Muse (Hong Kong magazine)|''Muse'']] Magazine that he 'found [his] loyalties divided between Eileen Chang and Ang Lee. But after three viewings of the film, I have finally opted for Lee because deep down I believe in film magic which can sometimes displace textual fidelity.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lee |first= Leo Ou-fan |date=November 2007 |title= ''Lust, Caution'': Vision and revision |journal=Muse Magazine |issue= 10 |pages= 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier issue of ''Muse'' however, film critic Perry Lam had criticized Lee's direction: 'in his eagerness to make the movie appealing to a mass audience, Lee seems guilty of sentimentalism.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lam |first= Perry |date=October 2007 |title= Great expectations |journal=Muse Magazine |issue= 9 |pages= 103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentimental or not, there is certainly a palpable trace of Lee's sympathy for Chang's personal love life, "It was hard for me to live in Eileen Chang's world...There are days I hated her for it. It's so sad, so tragic. But you realize there's a shortage of love in her life: romantic love, family love." He added, "This is the story of what killed love for her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/movies/26lim.html | work=The New York Times | first=Dennis | last=Lim | title=Love as an Illusion: Beautiful to See, Impossible to Hold | date=August 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anachronisms===
It has been noted by critics (including [[Bryan Appleyard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bryanappleyard.com/blog/2008/01/protocol-problem-and-lust-caution-taxi.php |title=A Protocol Problem and the Lust Caution Taxi |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |last=Appleyard |first=Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Appleyard |date=January 21, 2008 |work=Thought Experiments: The Blog |publisher=brianappleyard.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209080650/http://www.bryanappleyard.com/blog/2008/01/protocol-problem-and-lust-caution-taxi.php |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the Hong Kong sequences in the film set in the late 1930s&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite video|title=Lust, Caution (clip) |url=http://www.focusfeatures.com/clips/lust_caution/epk1-320x240.wmv |format=WMV |medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[Focus Features]] |accessdate=August 16, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (5.2 MB)&lt;/ref&gt; include "London taxis" of two types ([[Austin FX3|FX3]], [[Austin FX4|FX4]]) that were only manufactured onwards from 1948 and 1958 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lti.co.uk/previous-models/fx |title=The FX series |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |publisher=[[London Taxis International|LTI Vehicles]] |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624025708/http://www.lti.co.uk/previous-models/fx/ |archivedate=June 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Box office==
''Lust, Caution'' was produced on a budget of approximately $15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BOM1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lustcaution.htm |title= Lust, Caution |accessdate=December 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, where it played in its entirety, ''Lust, Caution'' grossed US$6,249,342 (approximately $48&amp;nbsp;million HKD) despite being saddled with a restrictive "Category III" rating. It was the territory's biggest-grossing Chinese language film of the year, and third biggest overall (behind only ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/hongkong/yearly/?yr=2007&amp;p=.htm|title= Hong Kong Yearly Box Office (2007)|accessdate=August 16, 2008|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was also a huge success in China, despite playing only in a heavily edited version. It grossed US$17,109,185, making it the country's sixth highest-grossing film of 2007 and third highest-grossing domestic production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/china/yearly/?yr=2007&amp;p=.htm|title= China Yearly Box Office (2007)|accessdate=August 16, 2008|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, the NC-17 rating which ''Lust, Caution'' received is traditionally perceived as a box office "kiss-of-death". In its opening weekend in one U.S. theatre, it grossed $63,918.&lt;ref name="BOM1" /&gt; Expanding to seventeen venues the next week, its per-screen average was $21,341, before cooling down to $4,639 at 125 screens.&lt;ref name="BOM2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=lustcaution.htm|title= Lust, Caution – Weekend Box Office|accessdate=August 16, 2008|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Never playing at more than 143 theatres in its entire U.S. run, it eventually grossed $4,604,982.&lt;ref name="BOM2" /&gt; As of August 15, 2008, it was the fifth highest-grossing NC-17 production in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/mpaa.htm?page=NC-17&amp;p=.htm|title= Domestic Grosses by MPAA Rating – NC-17|accessdate=August 16, 2008|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focus Features]] was very satisfied with the United States release of this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20185085,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Nicole | last=Sperling | title=Ang Lee and James Schamus Get Frank | date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, ''Lust, Caution'' grossed $67,091,915.&lt;ref name="BOM1" /&gt;

==Home media==
In the United States, two DVD versions of this film were released: the original NC-17 version and the censored R-rated version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=66423|title= Lust, Caution (R1) in February – Artwork Updated|last= Foster|first= Dave|accessdate=August 16, 2008|publisher=DVD Times|date= December 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media portrayals of [[Indigenous Australians]]''' fall into a range of categories, which academics and commentators have described as often negative or stereotyped. In issues which concern them, Indigenous voices are continually drowned out by non-Indigenous voices, which present them as "problems" for the rest of society. Most stories are directed at white audiences, and anything which concerns welfare, or land rights especially, is tinged with a clear sense of conflict between "us" and "them." Indigenous people are often portrayed positively in documentaries and advertisements, almost as tourist attractions, yet when they interact with contemporary society they are seen as threatening. Many reviews of mass media have found that the race of criminal offenders is mentioned more often when the offenders are Aboriginal. The mainstream media is still seen as influential in shaping public opinion, and the Australian media continues to pander to racist stereotypes.

==Portrayals of Indigenous Australians in the news media==
One 1994 study found that no newspaper managers interviewed believed their papers were racist, but most Aboriginal interviewees believed that mainstream newspapers "failed Aborigines dismally".&lt;ref name=dunbar&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunbar, Jane|title=Newspaper Coverage of Mabo: An Evaluation of Performance|journal=Australian Journalism Review|volume=16|issue=2|date=July–December 1994|pages=116&amp;ndash;124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same survey found that no major paper had any Indigenous Australians as editors, and that only editors specializing in Indigenous issues had any significant knowledge of Indigenous cultures.&lt;ref name=dunbar/&gt;  Most editors also said that they saw their readership as white, and some conceded that this perception affected their news coverage.&lt;ref name=dunbar/&gt; In 1992, a systematic survey of mainstream media, including television, news, and radio, found that "the exclusion of (non-stereotyped) diversity is almost total in all the media studied."&lt;ref name=bell&gt;{{cite book|author=Bell, Philip|title=Multicultural Australia in the Media|location=Canberra|publisher=Australia Government Publishing Service|year=1992|pages=78&amp;ndash;79|isbn=0-644-28632-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In issues specifically relating to Indigenous Australians, Indigenous voices are still dwarfed by non-Indigenous voices in press coverage.  One study of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'''s coverage of [[Wik Peoples v Queensland|Wik]] and [[native title]] found that only one quarter of relevant articles contained any Indigenous voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bullimore, Kim |title=Media Dreaming: Representation of Aboriginality in Modern Australian Media |journal=Asia Pacific Media Educator |volume=6 |date=January 1999 |pages=72&amp;ndash;80 |url=http://uow.edu.au./crearts/sjcw/APME/APME_Issue6/Bullimore.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913122339/https://www.uow.edu.au/crearts/sjcw/APME/APME_Issue6/Bullimore.html |archivedate=13 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study of several media found that the only highly reported issues relating to multiculturalism (including but not limited to Indigenous issues) were immigration and Indigenous land rights, both of which were presented as "problems for the majority culture."&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;  One author has explained that [[Mabo v Queensland (1988)|Mabo]] coverage was so in-depth because Mabo "reached far into the heart of non-Aboriginal Australia."&lt;ref name=dunbar/&gt;  The way in which Mabo was covered also reflected papers' presumed white readership: according to Dunbar, most stories were directed at white audiences, with a clear sense of conflict between "us" and "them."&lt;ref name=dunbar/&gt;  When Mabo was mentioned on the front page, it was almost always portrayed as a potential threat to the population as a whole, as opposed to belated justice for Indigenous Australians.&lt;ref name=dunbar/&gt;  This pattern was also seen in news coverage of a community funeral in [[Woorabinda]] that was used as an opportunity to arrest fifty Indigenous people on outstanding fine warrants.  The Indigenous community was outraged, but the local paper reported the arrests without any mention of their happening at a funeral.&lt;ref name=ewart&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ewart, Jacqui|title=The Scabsuckers: Regional Journalists' Representation of Indigenous Australians|journal=Asia Pacific Media Educator|volume=3|date=July–December 1997|pages=108&amp;ndash;117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper's chief of staff explained this way:  
"We decided there is a perception that the majority of readers don't really care what happened out there. […] There was a blowout over the fact it happened at a funeral and we did not embroil ourselves in the shit fight that blacks hate police and police hate blacks.  It would not have achieved anything.  We had to make a conscious decision based on our circulation; we had nothing to gain circulation-wise by continuing the fight for days and days."&lt;ref name=ewart/&gt;

===1990 National Inquiry into Racist Violence===
In 1990 the Federal government conducted a National Inquiry into Racist Violence. Many people complained to the Inquiry about alleged racism in media reporting.&lt;ref name = "ALB"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Moss  | first = Irene  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence  | journal = Aboriginal Law Bulletin  | volume = 1991  | issue =   | pages =   | publisher = AustLII  | location =   | year = 1991  | url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AboriginalLB/1991/16.html  | doi =   | id =   | accessdate = 2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was recognised by the enquiry as being due in part to there often being a gap between many white media representations of Indigenous people and Indigenous perspectives of their own situations.&lt;ref name = "ABCCulturalProtocols"&gt;*{{cite web  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | year =  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/message/proper/culturalprotocol.pdf  | title = Cultural Protocols for Indigenous Reporting in the Media | format = pdf - 35 pages | work = ABC Message Stick | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report's 64 recommendations included:
*The media have a right and, indeed, a responsibility to report on race issues. The report recognised, however, the concerns of those who gave evidence to the Inquiry.
*The Inquiry was convinced of the importance of codes of practice and recommended their development, where they do not already exist, and their observance by media outlets.
*They also recommended that any proposal to modify or abolish the powers and processes of the [[Australian Broadcasting Tribunal]] take into account the need to retain an effective avenue for the handling of complaints of racism and racial vilification in the media.
*The Inquiry commended initiatives taken by some media organisations to encourage the recruitment and advancement of journalists from Aboriginal and non-English speaking backgrounds and encouraged all media organisations to follow this example. The Inquiry also believed that more emphasis also needs to be placed on cross-cultural training and education for cadet journalists.
*The Inquiry also recognised the need for antidiscrimination bodies to provide regular opportunities for consultation and exchange of views between media representatives and community spokespeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | year = 1991 | url = http://www.multiculturalaustralia.edu.au/doc/racediscrimcomm_1.pdf  | title = National Inquiry into Racist Violence: Summary | format = pdf - 6 pages | work = Making Multicultural Australia | publisher = www.multiculturalaustralia.edu.au | accessdate = 2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (1987 -1991)===
The [[Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]] also made recommendations proposing the development of codes of practice and policies relating to the presentation of Aboriginal issues; the establishment of monitoring bodies and the putting into place of training and employment programs for Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | year = 1999 | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/it_ctte/completed_inquiries/1999-02/selfreg/report/e08.pdf | title = Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters:- Commercial Radio Codes of Practice and Guidelines | format = pdf - 16 pages | work = Report by the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies: In the Public Interest: Monitoring Australia's media (Appendix 8 of the Report published in 2000) | publisher = Parliament of Australia: Senate | accessdate = 2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bill Leak cartoon ===
A cartoon that portrayed an Aboriginal father holding a beer can and unable to remember his son's name was published in [[The Australian]] newspaper in 2016. The cartoon was created by [[Bill Leak]], a cartoonist already familiar to controversy. The cartoon was reported to the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], which chose to investigate whether the cartoon breached section 18c of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. Although the case was later dropped by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission|Commission]], there was immense public discussion about whether the cartoon should be allowed under [[Freedom of speech]]. The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government also proposed erasing section 18c of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]] to protect what they allege is a matter of "freedom of speech". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-20/bill-leak-'singled-out'-for-racial-discrimination-investigation/7952590|title=Bill Leak 'singled out' for 18C racial discrimination investigation|date=2016-10-20|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/bill-leak-cartoon-reviewed-for-racial-hatred/news-story/687803550b49792faaaae85c220b83f5|title=Subscribe {{!}} theaustralian|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-12/eric-abetz-welcomes-bill-leak-cartoon-complaint-withdrawal/8020420|title=Eric Abetz welcomes withdrawal of Bill Leak cartoon complaint|date=2016-11-12|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The nobles and savages paradox==
[[Frances Peters-Little]], an Aboriginal film-maker, has observed that television portrayals of Indigenous people are divided into [[noble savage|nobles]] or savages.&lt;ref name=pl&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peters-Little, Frances|title='Nobles and Savages' on the Television|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=27|year=2003|pages=16&amp;ndash;38|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=821868189194324;res=E-LIBRARY|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the savage end of the pole is the portrayal of Aboriginal criminality in the mainstream news media.  Many systematic content reviews of mass media have found that the race of criminal offenders is mentioned more often when the offenders are Aboriginal.&lt;ref name=ewart/&gt;&lt;ref name=goodall&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goodall, Heather|title=Constructing a Riot: Television News and Aborigines|journal=Media Information Australia|volume=68|date=May 1993|pages=70&amp;ndash;77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Heather Goodall]] has argued that photos used repeatedly in the coverage of the 1987 [[Brewarrina]] riot, which took place after an Aboriginal death in custody, illustrate how mainstream media pander to whites' expectations of Aboriginal violence.  The first of two iconic images depicted a young Aboriginal man throwing a stone at a hotel, evoking "an Aboriginal threat to the country pub, that symbol of Australian rural life, mateship and social networks."&lt;ref name=goodall/&gt;  The second, a photo of a breaking window, was shot so close-up that one can no longer recognize the image as one of Brewarrina; instead, one could only see an Indigenous Australian relentlessly destroying white property.&lt;ref name=goodall/&gt;

These negative images, however, coexist with "invariably positive and sympathetic" portrayals of Aboriginals in advertisements and documentaries, which typically depict them in "'traditionalist' roles, dress, poses, and activities."&lt;ref name=pl/&gt;&lt;ref name=jak&gt;{{cite book|author=Jakubowicz, Andrew|title=Racism, Ethnicity, and the Media|location=St. Leonards|publisher=Allen and Unwin Pty.

'''''Mr. Vampire 1992''''', also known as '''''Chinese Vampire Story''''', is a 1992 Hong Kong comedy horror film directed by Ricky Lau. The film is the fifth of a series of five [[jiangshi film]]s directed by Ricky Lau in the ''[[Mr. Vampire]]'' franchise. The Chinese title of the film literally translates to '''''New Mr. Vampire'''''.

''Mr. Vampire 1992'' is considered to be the true sequel to the original 1985 ''Mr. Vampire'', as the main cast ([[Lam Ching-ying]], [[Ricky Hui]] and [[Chin Siu-ho]]) in the first film reprised their roles. ''Mr. Vampire 1992'' is also set directly after the events in ''Mr. Vampire'', with some references to the first film, such as Man-choi commenting on how he felt after being infected with the "[[jiangshi|hopping corpse]] virus". New characters were introduced in ''Mr. Vampire 1992'', and some actors from the first film, such as [[Billy Lau]], were recast in new roles.

==Plot==
The film is based on the concept of the souls of aborted fetuses who reside in statues awaiting reincarnation. One of these is a particularly nasty soul who possesses a nanny who in turn sets to work to find the suitable host pregnant lady which turns out to be Priest Kau's childhood sweetheart (who is married to the General).

Mudflap transforms into a construction crane. In the Japanese version of the series; ''Transformers: Galaxy Force'', the character is called '''[[Demolishor]]'''.

In the cartoon, Mudflap was originally one of the Autobot civilian refugees hiding on [[Earth]]. Disgruntled with having to exist in secret amongst the lowly  human race and stopping at traffic lights, Mudflap was sought out and recruited to join the [[Decepticon]]s by [[Starscream (Unicron Trilogy)|Starscream]], but then he left and wandered Earth. Eventually Mudflap rejoins the Autobots.

His toyline bio, however, tells a different story. In this version of events, Mudflap was an undercover Decepticon operative placed on Earth before the Autobots had even arrived. Having infiltrated the construction industry, he spent his time sabotaging the infrastructure of human society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicron.us/tf2005/toypix/mudflap.htm Transformers Cybertron: Mudflap&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
[[image:mudflap-animated.jpg|left|thumb|Mudflap in the ''Transformers: Cybertron'' animated series]]
Mudflap's voice in the ''Cybertron'' cartoon is performed with some variation of a [[French language|French]] accent.

In episode 15, "Race", the Autobot Mudflap rants about his dislike for the disorderly humans when he is approached by Starscream and Thundercracker. Focusing on his dislike for being forced to live with the humans, Starscream is able to talk him into joining the Decepticons.

In episode 20, "Ice", Starscream and Mudflap confront the Autobot's human allies at the North Pole, but are opposed by Scattorshot. Although Scattorshot gets the better of Mudflap initially, Starscream uses water to freeze up Scattorshot's systems. The humans and Mini-Con Recon Team use Mudflap's dropped gun to signal the other Autobots, who come to their rescue.

*Ep.23-"Trust": Mudflap battles Snarl and Leobreaker on the Jungle Planet, but loses.
*Ep.24-"Trap": He got trapped in a stasis field like Megatron.

Landmine discovered that Mudflap had joined the Decepticons in episode 27 "Revelations". They fought in episode 28 "Critical." Mudflap followed Megatron to Starscream's island headquarters in episode 29 "Assault," but Landmine followed him there.

In episode 30, "Starscream", Mudflap aided Megatron in fighting Wing Saber, then fought with Evac.

In episode 31, "United", Scourge, Mudflap, Crumplezone, Ransack and Thundercracker followed Megatron on the Space Bridge to Cybertron. They were joined by Thunderblast, who claimed she'd rather work for Megatron than Starscream.

*Ep.33-"Balance": When Megatron, Scourge, and Thunderblast head into the debris field surrounding Cybertron, Mudflap, thinking Megatron has betrayed him, heads back to Earth.
*Ep.37-"Family": As Mudflap is beating up some trees, he wonders to himself why he had joined the Decepticons. Landmine shows up and Mudflap becomes an Autobot again.
*Ep.49-"End": He helped everyone against Galvatron.

When the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the [[Jungle Planet]] back into its orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The Jungle Planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. The combined strength of Scourge, the Autobots, the former Decepticons (Dark Crumplezone, Ransack, Thunderblast and Thundercracker), and their allies from the various planets (including Mudflap) were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.

When the character of [[Signal Lancer]] was animated in the final episode of Cybertron, the animators used a slightly modified transformation sequence from Mudflap.

Mudflap is described as a vicious Decepticon who likes to use his saw on Autobots, but secretly wishes he was one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/movie-decepticons-181/mudflap-1788/ TFW2005.com - Mudflap]&lt;/ref&gt; Though marketed in the toy line supporting the 2007 film ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', he does not appear in it. In addition, he is not related to the Mudflap seen in the 2009 sequel ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.

===Titan Magazines===
This version of Mudflap only appeared in issues 23 and 24 of the UK Titan Magazine Transformers series. He was among a group of Decepticons on Earth in an alternate timeline story.

One name considered for the character was "Sawtooth", but the name was unavailable, so they stuck with Mudflap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=News/Item&amp;newsid=4EC7EA7D-D56F-E112-46AC70D02754072E transformers-fr_FR - default&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudflap appears in the second Transformers installment as an [[Autobot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-04-01-transformers-first-look_N.htm|title=First look: Robo-brawlers big, small in new 'Transformers' By Anthony Breznican, USA TODAY | work=USA Today | date=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This character is not related to Mudflap who appeared in the toy line for the first film. He, like his twin brother [[Skids (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Skids]], typically speaks hip-hop. Originally forming an old [[ice cream truck]] with Skids, Mudflap gains his own vehicle mode following the Shanghai operation. Their robot modes were revealed for a short time on the web, but were taken off due to the request by Activision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tformers.com/article.php?sid=9677|title=New Transformers 2 Autobot Revealed! |date=2008-06-21|publisher=TFormers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudflap is 11 foot 4&amp;nbsp;inches tall and weighs 1.2 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;http://transformerslive.blogspot.com/2009/05/transformers-movie-universe-preview.html&lt;/ref&gt; He has an oversized left arm, while his brother Skids has an oversized right arm and had a license plate that reads "MDFLP".

According to the biography and statistics published on the Hasbro web site Mudflap is 8 feet tall and he has a nearly psychic link with his brother allowing them to make coordinated attacks. It also states that Skids and Mudflap used to serve as messengers before becoming warriors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/en_US/discover/Battle-Bios.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Skids and Mudflap appeared in commercials for [[Burger King]] during the release of the 2009 film.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Himt2R2_8s Burger King commercial with Skids and Mudflap&lt;/ref&gt;

===IDW Publishing===
In ''Tales of the Fallen'' #6 [[Arcee]] is taken by [[Thundercracker]] and given to the Decepticon medic [[Flatline (Transformers)|Flatline]], who experiments on her. Upon waking up she discovers [[Skids (Transformers)|Skids]] and Mudflap are also captives of the Decepticons.&lt;ref&gt;http://chrismowry.blogspot.com/2010/01/arcee-5-pages.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudflap first appeared in ''Transformers: Alliance'' #4 as one of the Autobots who responded to Optimus Prime's call to Earth. He joined with Optimus' team as part of NEST.

Mudflap appears in ''[[Transformers: Nefarious]]'' #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. [[Alice (Transformers)|Alice]] steals an [[RV]] in [[Seattle]] and is chased by [[Skids (Transformers)|Skids]] and Mudflap, who keep her occupied until [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]] arrives and defeats her. She is taken to NEST headquarters on [[Diego Garcia]] to be examined by [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]]. Sideswipe is disgusted by her decision to disguise herself as a human.

In California the Autobots set a trap for Starscream's minions Divebomb, [[Fearswoop]] and [[Skystalker]] by having Theodore Galloway pose as an arms dealer attempting to purchase Cybertronian technology. The trap is uncovered and the Autobots send in Arcee, Chromia, Elita-One, Ironhide, Mudflap and Skids. Divebomb and Skystalker are killed while Fearswoop is captured by the Autobots and taken back to the NEST base on [[Diego Garcia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = John Barber| penciller = Carlos Magno| inker = Aburtov and Graphiksslava| story = | title = Transformers: Rising Storm| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = February 2011| publisher = IDW Publishing| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie plot===
Mudflap, who originally transforms into half of an [[ice cream truck]], fails to capture [[Sideways (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Sideways]] in [[Shanghai]], China. When he returns to the N.E.S.T. base on [[Diego Garcia]] he scans a new vehicle form, that of a concept car. Initially he wanted the "''[[Chevrolet Spark|green one]]''" but his brother beat him to it so he took the red-[[Chevrolet Trax (concept car)|orange one]]. They then approach and accompany [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)|Bumblebee]] who rescues Sam Witwicky from [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and [[Starscream]]. The twins then accompany [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]], Sam and friends and in their search for the ancient Seeker [[Jetfire]] and is teleported with them to [[Egypt]]. Finding themselves at a dead end, Mudflap's brawl with Skids unintentionally causes them to find the Tomb of the Primes before Bumblebee tosses them out. The twins then accompany Simmons and Leo into devising a plan to destroy the Sun Harvester. They encounter [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]], in which Mudflap is sucked in by Devastator's vortex grinder while attempting in vain to hang on for dear life. Though swallowed, Mudflap breaks out of Devastator as he and Skids battle against the giant before the two are knocked off. The two are briefly seen taking cover under Devastator and are not seen afterwards.

Mudflap and Skids were originally set to appear in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', but they were cut from the final film due to many fans considering them to be racist and due to time restraints. Despite this, he and Skids do appear in vehicle form at the end of an Autobot convoy at the beginning of the film. In the comic version of the movie they are both killed by Sentinel Prime.

===Controversy===
[[File:Car at New York Internatonial Auto Show.JPG|left|thumb|Chevy Trax concept car]]
There has been a strong negative reaction to Mudflap and [[Skids (Transformers)|Skids]] in ''Revenge of the Fallen'' as the pair were received as embodying racist stereotypes. The characters have been given ape-like appearance, speak in street-slang dialogue, and confess an inability to read (though the film clarifies that they only have difficulty reading the ancient Language of the Primes that no other modern Transformer can read either, not reading in general and in the film itself they admit to not reading often); one of the characters also has a gold tooth. Manohla Dargis of the ''[[New York Times]]'' said that "''the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, [[Jar Jar Binks]] was set loose by [[George Lucas]].''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/movies/24transform.html?hpw | work=The New York Times | first=Manohla | last=Dargis | accessdate=2010-05-13 | title=Invasion of the Robot Toys, Redux | date=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Scott Mendelson said, "''To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement.''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-mendelson/huff-post-review---transf_b_219510.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Scott | last=Mendelson | title=Huff Post Review: &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Transformers Revenge of the Fallen&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;: The IMAX Experience(2009) | date=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Knowles]], founder of [[Ain't It Cool News]], went further, asking his readers "''not to support this film''" because "You'll be taking [your children] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes and racism around.''" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aintitcool.com/node/41512&lt;/ref&gt; ''Director [[Michael Bay]] has defended the robots as "''good clean fun''" and insisted that "''We're just putting more personality in the film.''" Bay stated that he made the robots for the kids, but he did remove them from Dark of the Moon in response.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616182622/http://www.reelzchannel.com/movie-news/10349/spot-skids-and-mudflap-in-transformers-dark-of-the-moon-and-michael-bay-will-pay-you-25000/ "Spot 'Skids' and 'Mudflap' in Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Michael Bay Will Pay You $25,000"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musical fiction''' is a genre of fiction in which music is paramount: both as subject matter, and through the rhythm and flow of the prose; that is, music is manifested through the language itself. 

Notable authors who have written novels of musical fiction include [[Don DeLillo]] (''Great Jones Street''), [[Tom Perotta]] (''The Wishbones''), [[Lewis Shiner]] (''Glimpses''), [[Roddy Doyle]] (''The Commitments''), [[Robert Dunn (novelist)|Robert Dunn]] (''Pink Cadillac''), [[Nick Hornby]] (''High Fidelity''), [[Ibi Kaslik]] (''The Angel Riots''), [[Scott Spencer (author)|Scott Spencer]] (''The Rich Man's Table''), Brian Paone (''Yours Truly, 2095''), and Randy Blazak (''The Mission of the Sacred Heart'').

==Description==
In her anthology The Best of Rock Fiction, editor June Skinner Sawyers writes, “Rock fiction has not received the proper respect it deserves, which is unfortunate given the caliber of writers who have captured its fleeting essence on the written page.”&lt;ref&gt;Sawyers, June Skinner (Ed.) (2005). ''The Best in Rock Fiction.'' Milwaukee: Hal Leonard, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same anthology, Rolling Stone writer Anthony DeCurtis talks about “the edgy relationship” between music and the written word. “Words are long-standing symbols of permanence. Music ultimately is ephemeral, evaporating into your unreliable memory once you’ve heard it. In taking music as their inspiration, writers seek to capture some of that immediacy, that spirit of the moment, and hold it still for their reader’s pleasure.”&lt;ref&gt;Sawyers, June Skinner (Ed.) (2005). ''The Best in Rock Fiction.'' Milwaukee: Hal Leonard, pp. xii-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natalia Milena Cuevas Tapia''' (born 18 March 1966) is a Chilean singer, comedian, impressionist, and actress.

==Biography==
Natalia Cuevas studied dance at the [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago]] for two years. She also took a course in vocal techniques and singing at the Alicia Puccio Academy. While still at school, she participated as a singer in several television contests.&lt;ref name=lacustres&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ellanquihue.cl/prontus4_nots/site/artic/20050205/pags/20050205002523.html |title=Natalia Cuevas hará reír a los lacustres |work=Diario Llanquihue |language=Spanish |date=5 February 2005 |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some attempts, she managed to find work as a chorister on the [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]] television programs ''{{ill|Éxito (TV series)|es|Éxito (programa de televisión)|lt=Éxito}}'' and ''{{ill|Martes 13|es|Martes 13 (programa de televisión)}}''.&lt;ref name=Cooperativa&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/entretencion/musica/natalia-cuevas/2003-01-30/161100.html |title=Natalia Cuevas |publisher=[[Radio Cooperativa]] |language=Spanish |date=30 January 2003 |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time she worked singing jingles and was part of the [[University of Chile]] Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name=lacustres/&gt;

She took her first steps as a comedian in the group Contratiempo.&lt;ref name=Cooperativa/&gt; In the early 1990s she was invited onto the comic program ''{{ill|Jappening con ja|es}}'', where she appeared for two years.&lt;ref name=lacustres/&gt; On the show she began to develop impressions of various singers and television personalities, such as [[Marta Sánchez]], {{ill|Eli de Caso|es}}, [[Myriam Hernández]], and [[Cecilia Pantoja|Cecilia]].

In 2001 Cuevas appeared for the first time at the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival|Viña del Mar Festival]], accompanying the comedian and singer Memo Bunke. In her performance, Cuevas imitated [[Paloma San Basilio]], Myriam Hernández, [[Palmenia Pizarro]], and Cecilia. Both comedians received Gold and Silver Seagull awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/site/edic/20010224210536/pags/20010225013410.html |title=Natalia la reina del Festival |trans-title=Natalia the Queen of the Festival |work=[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]] |language=Spanish |date=25 February 2001 |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year she participated in the [[Chilevisión]] program ''Calor humano''. She was also invited onto ''[[Viva el lunes]]'' several times. She later joined ''{{ill|Por fin es lunes|es}}'', a Canal 13 program hosted by {{ill|Antonio Vodanovic|es}} and [[Margot Kahl]].&lt;ref name=Cooperativa/&gt;

In 2003 she returned to the Viña del Mar Festival, this time solo. In her routine she played Marjorie, a character of her own creation that she had shown for the first time on ''Jappening con ja''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lacuarta.com/diario/2003/02/07/07.17.4a.ESP.NATALIA.html |title=Natalia Cuevas: 'Con mi pareja estamos preparando la rutina para el Festival' |trans-title=Natalia Cuevas: 'With My Partner We are Preparing the Routine for the Festival' |work=[[La Cuarta]] |language=Spanish |date=7 February 2003 |archive-url=https://archive.is/hzxUB#selection-471.1-471.78 |archive-date=11 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her performance she also imitated Cecilia, [[Patricia Maldonado Aravena|Patricia Maldonado]], {{ill|Gloria Simonetti|es}}, Palmenia Pizarro, [[Shakira]], [[Thalía]], and Myriam Hernandez. Cuevas was awarded a silver torch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/site/edic/20030222193553/pags/20030223020507.html |title=Provocadora presentación |trans-title=Provocative Performance |work=[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]] |language=Spanish |date=23 February 2003 |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 she reappeared at Viña del Mar, but did not achieve the success of previous years. The comedian was nervous and abandoned her routine earlier than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/todas/2004/02/22/139411/natalia-cuevas-huyo-del-monstruo.html |title=Natalia Cuevas huyó del Monstruo |trans-title=Natalia Cuevas Fled the Monster |first=Felipe |last=Gálvez |work=[[El Mercurio]] |location=Viña del Mar |language=Spanish |date=22 February 2004 |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 she participated in the Canal 13 program ''{{ill|Mi nombre es…|es|lt=Mi nombre es… VIP}}'', where she imitated the singer Cecilia. The following year she appeared at the {{ill|Antofagasta Festival|es|Festival de Antofagasta}}, imitating President [[Michelle Bachelet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/entretencion/television/television-nacional/yuri-y-natalia-cuevas-marcaron-ultima-jornada-de-festival-de-antofagasta/2013-02-16/093003.html |title=Yuri y Natalia Cuevas marcaron última jornada de Festival de Antofagasta |trans-title=Yuri and Natalia Cuevas Marked the Last Day of the Antofagasta Festival |publisher=[[Radio Cooperativa]] |language=Spanish |date=16 February 2013 |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is currently working on comic imitations and sketches on the program ''{{ill|Morandé con compañía|es}}''.

==Private life==
In March 2013, she revealed through an interview with the television program ''[[Bienvenidos (Chilean TV series)|Bienvenidos]]'' that during her childhood she was sexually abused by a priest. According to Cuevas, she had not come forward because, "the child always believes that he is provoking this situation, so he feels afraid to confess it, because he thinks that he will be challenged or punished."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/entretencion/television/natalia-cuevas-revelo-que-fue-abusada-por-un-sacerdote-cuando-nina/2013-03-18/152837.html |title=Natalia Cuevas reveló que fue abusada por un sacerdote cuando niña |trans-title=Natalia Cuevas Reveals That She was Abused By a Priest as a Girl |publisher=[[Radio Cooperativa]] |language=Spanish |date=18 March 2013 |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of Communications''' ({{lang-cy|Y Swyddfa Gyfathrebiadau}}), commonly known as '''Ofcom''', is the UK government-approved regulatory and competition authority for the broadcasting, [[telecommunication]]s and [[mail|postal]] industries of the United Kingdom.

Ofcom has wide-ranging powers across the television, radio, telecoms and postal sectors. It has a statutory duty to represent the interests of citizens and consumers by promoting competition and protecting the public from harmful or offensive material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your rights – Ofcom|work=The Liberty Guide to Human Rights|publisher=[[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]]|date=12 August 2010|url=http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/right-of-free-expression/controls-on-broadcasting/ofcom.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111014919/http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/right-of-free-expression/controls-on-broadcasting/ofcom.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 January 2014|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lunt|first1=Peter|last2=Livingstone|first2=Sonia|year=2007

Some of the main areas Ofcom presides over are licensing, research, codes and policies, complaints, competition and protecting the radio spectrum from abuse (e.g. pirate radio stations).

The regulator was initially established by the Office of Communications Act 2002 and received its full authority from the [[Communications Act 2003]].&lt;ref name="OoCA2002"/&gt;

==History==
The creation of Ofcom was announced in the [[Queen's Speech]] to the UK Parliament, in June 2001. The new body, which would replace several existing authorities, was conceived as a "super-regulator" to oversee media channels that were rapidly converging through digital transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1398580.stm|title=Queen announces media shake-up|publisher=BBC News|date=20 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ofcom launched on 29 December 2003, formally inheriting the duties that had previously been the responsibility of five different regulators:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3354093.stm|title='Super-regulator' Ofcom launches|publisher=BBC News|date=29 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the Radio Authority
*the Radiocommunications Agency

In July 2009, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] opposition leader [[David Cameron]] said in a speech against the proliferation of [[quango]]s that:&lt;blockquote&gt;With a Conservative government, Ofcom as we know it will cease to exist… Its remit will be restricted to its narrow technical and enforcement roles. It will no longer play a role in making policy. And the policy-making functions it has today will be transferred back fully to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.&lt;ref name="theregister-2009-07-06"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ofcom top of Tory deathlist – Quangogeddon |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/06/cameron_ofcom/ |author=Chris Williams |date=6 July 2009|work=The Register |accessdate =23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ofcom hits back at David Cameron|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/06/ofcom-david-cameron|author=Leigh Holmwood|date=6 July 2009|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Under Cameron's subsequent premiership of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|2010 UK coalition government]], the [[Public Bodies Act 2011]] did remove or modify several of Ofcom's duties, although it did not substantially reduce Ofcom's remit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/ofcom|title=Ofcom|publisher=Politics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2011, Ofcom took over responsibility for regulating the postal services industry from the [[Postal Services Commission]] (Postcomm).

In April 2015, Ofcom announced that telephone companies would have to provide customers with a set charge for the cost of calling numbers starting 084, 087 and 09. The streamlining of these charges must be printed in each customer's contract and monthly bills. The change came into force on 1 July 2015 and affected over 175 million phone numbers, making it the biggest overhaul of telephoning in over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11565249/Ofcom-cracks-down-on-hidden-charges-in-TV-phone-ins.html|title=Ofcom cracks down on hidden charges in TV phone-ins|date=27 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2016, the regulation of [[video on demand]] was transferred to Ofcom from [[ATVOD]], the Authority for Television on Demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ofcom to take on regulation of video-on-demand services|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/14/video-on-demand-ofcom-atvod|author=Jasper Jackson|date=14 October 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Digital Economy Act 2017]] extended Ofcom's remit and powers. Ofcom were given powers concerning the minimum broadband speed provided by [[Internet service provider]]s, the ability to financially penalise communications providers for failing to comply with licence commitments and the power to require [[public service broadcaster]]s to include a minimum quantity of children's programming made in the United Kingdom. The act also transferred to Ofcom the regulation of the [[BBC]], a duty previously undertaken by the [[BBC Trust]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Digital Economy Act will come between you and porn|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/03/digital-economy-act-explainer/|work=engadget|author=Jamie Rigg|date=3 May 2017|access-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Economy Bill: Networks and porn sites face fines|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36725774|website=BBC News|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and updated the Ofcom Electronic Communications Code to make it easier for [[telecommunications companies]] to erect and extend mobile masts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Small cells and 5G: What the Digital Economy Bill changes mean for operators|url=http://www.telecomstechnews.com/news/2016/oct/18/small-cells-and-5g-what-digital-economy-bill-changes-mean/|date=18 October 2016|author=Paul Carter|work=Telecoms Tech|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''News International phone hacking scandal'''

{{Main|News International phone hacking scandal}}
In July 2011, in the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal, Ofcom came under pressure to launch an inquiry into whether the parent company of [[News International]], [[News Corporation]], was still the "fit and proper" owner of a controlling stake in the satellite broadcasting company [[BSkyB|British Sky Broadcasting]] (BSkyB). On 13 July former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] urged Ofcom to launch an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/07/13/bloomberg1376-LOAAC60UQVI901-5319LIBGU2PL77S07RDVI9V238.DTL|title=Brown Urges Ofcom to Probe News Corp.'s Existing BSkyB Stake|accessdate=24 July 2011|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=13 July 2011}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-13/brown-urges-regulator-to-probe-news-corp-s-existing-bskyb-shareholding.html|title=Brown Calls on Regulator to Probe News Corp.'s Existing BSkyB Shareholding|accessdate=24 July 2011|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=14 July 2011|first=Robert|last=Hutton}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July the Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] stated that the Government would launch a review of laws on what constituted a "fit and proper" owner for broadcasting companies in the United Kingdom, and that anyone found not to meet that standard can be forced to give up their current holdings in a company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8639225/Phone-Hacking-Rupert-Murdochs-grip-on-BSkyB-may-be-threatened-warns-Nick-Clegg.html|title=Phone Hacking: Murdoch's grip on BSkyB may be threatened, warns Clegg|accessdate=24 July 2011|work=The Telegraph|date=15 July 2011|location=London|first=James|last=Kirkup}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 22 July 2011, it was reported that Ofcom had begun an investigation into whether the phone-hacking scandal may have changed BSkyB's status as the "fit and proper" holder of a UK broadcasting licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/efce3662-b48a-11e0-a21d-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss|title=UK regulator begins probe into BSkyB's status|accessdate=24 July 2011|work=Financial Times|date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day [[Ed Richards (chief executive)|Ed Richards]], the then chief executive of Ofcom, replied to [[Simon Hughes]] MP, [[Don Foster (politician)|Don Foster]] MP and [[Tim Farron]] MP following a letter which they had written to him on 8 July concerning News Corporation's shareholding in BSkyB.&lt;ref name=ofcomlet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2011/07/22/letter-to-simon-hughes-don-foster-and-tim-farron-mp-from-ed-richards/|title=Letter to Simon Hughes, Don Foster and Tim Farron MP from Ed Richards July 22, 2011|accessdate=25 July 2011|publisher=Ofcom|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920060643/http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2011/07/22/letter-to-simon-hughes-don-foster-and-tim-farron-mp-from-ed-richards/|archivedate=20 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter Richards confirmed that Ofcom considers that News Corporation's current shareholding of 39.14% in BSkyB does give it a material influence over the company; that Ofcom is not precluded from acting by ongoing police investigations; and that Ofcom's process is not dependent upon a criminal conviction being secured.&lt;ref name=ofcomlet/&gt;

In April 2012, Ofcom's probe moved from a monitoring phase to an "evidence gathering" phase.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Rushton [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9229535/Ofcom-steps-up-fit-and-proper-probe-into-BSkyB.html ''Ofcom steps up 'fit and proper' probe into BSkyB''], ''The Daily Telegraph''. 26 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Television and radio===

Ofcom licenses all UK commercial television and radio services in the UK. Broadcasters must comply by the terms of their licence, or risk having it revoked. Ofcom also publishes the Broadcasting Code, a series of rules which all broadcast content on television and radio must follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ofcom broadcasting|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/|publisher=Ofcom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadcasting Code requires that content inappropriate for children should not be broadcast between the hours of 5:30{{nbsp}}a.m. and 9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. Premium-rate film services may broadcast content equivalent to a [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] 15 certificate at any time of day provided a [[Personal identification number|PIN]]-protected system is in place to restrict access to those authorised to view it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix 3: International Comparison of Classification and Content Regulation – The United Kingdom|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/appendix-3-international-comparison-classification-and-content-regulation/united-kingdo|publisher=Australian Law Reform Commission|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcasting of pornography with a BBFC [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] is not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ofcom to consider product placement on TV and radio|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/article/476966/ofcom-consider-product-placement-tv-radio|date=25 May 2005|author=Joe Lepper|work=Brand Republic|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Ofcom revoked the licences of four free-to-air television channels for promoting adult chat services during daytime hours and transmitting content that was too sexually explicit. The companies involved were fined £157,250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adult TV channels become first to lose licences|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11847846|date=26 November 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ofcom's [[jurisdiction]] does not cover television and radio channels which are broadcast in the UK but licensed abroad. In 2012 Ofcom lodged a complaint with the Dutch media regulator regarding the content of adult chat television channels which are broadcast in the UK but licensed in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ofcom lodges porn TV complaint with Dutch regulator|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/17297090/ofcom-lodges-porn-tv-complaint-with-dutch-regulator|work=BBC newsbeat|author=Del Crookes|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a survey of 200 British respondents, Ofcom published in 2016 a list of about 50 words classified in four grades of offensiveness, from "milder" to "strongest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Ofcom Have Officially Ranked Every British Swear Word|url=http://www.look.co.uk/news/ofcom-officially-ranked-swear-words-557942|magazine=Look Magazine|author=Will Butler|date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telephone and broadband ===

Ofcom regulates the UK telecoms sector, defining and enforcing the conditions by which all mobile and fixed-line phone and broadband companies must abide. These 'general conditions' are wide-ranging rules relating to matters such as telephone numbering, emergency services, sales, marketing and interconnection standards. Ofcom's investigation unit monitors compliance with the conditions and resolves disputes between providers.

Ofcom is also the competition authority for telecoms, enforcing remedies in markets where it believes dominant operators may have a potentially harmful influence on competition or consumers. One of its most high-profile interventions was to require BT to split its wholesale and retail arms into separate companies, bringing about the creation of Openreach which supplies wholesale services to both BT Retail and competing providers.&lt;ref name="sitefinder-ofcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/18328/|title=Overview of UK telecommunications regulation|publisher=Chartered Institute for IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2015, Ofcom made a number of changes to the way phone calls to UK service numbers would be charged. Under the new legislation, which was promoted by an information campaign entitled [[UK Calling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ukcalling.info/| title=UK Calling | publisher=Ofcom}}&lt;/ref&gt; call charges must be clearly stated on all materials that advertise a service number. The changes came after research found that callers are often confused about service call charges, and thus can avoid calling these numbers. The July 2015 changes also saw 'freephone numbers' 0800 and 0808 become free to call from both mobiles and landlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=burton|first1=Tony|title=July number Change|url=http://www.0345-numbers.uk/uncategorized/ofcom-poster/|website=0345 Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Ofcom launched an interactive "Mobile coverage and fixed broadband checker",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maps.ofcom.org.uk/check-coverage/|title=Mobile coverage and fixed broadband checker|website=maps.ofcom.org.uk|access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing people to check mobile coverage and broadband speeds via their post code.

===Spectrum licensing and protection===

Ofcom is responsible for the management, regulation, assignment and licensing of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] in the UK, and licenses portions of it for use in television and radio broadcasts, mobile phone transmissions, private communications networks, wireless devices and so on.  The process of licensing varies depending on the type of use required.  Some licences simply have to be applied and paid for, other commercial licences are subject to a bidding process.  Most of the procedures in place have been inherited from the systems used by the previous regulators. However, Ofcom may change some of these processes in future.

Ofcom protects the radio spectrum in a number of ways:

* Working within international organisations ([[ITU]], [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT]] and [[Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications|BEREC]]).
* Licensing UK-controlled commercial radio spectrum; the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] controls its own spectrum.  Within the international framework for frequency use; Ofcom liaises through the UK Government to produce the UKFAT (UK Frequency Allocation Table). The current table was produced in 2017.
* Investigate and, when necessary, carry out enforcement activities to clear interference or illegal use from the spectrum.  Until June 2010 Ofcom investigated all interference cases within the UK.  Interference reporting has now been transferred to the BBC.  This contract specifically excludes any requirement to investigate interference relating to AM radio reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioandtvhelp.co.uk/interference/rtis_info/about_us|title=About Us|publisher=Radio &amp; Television Investigation Service|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial and spectrum licence holders report to Ofcom and in all cases illegal ("[[pirate radio|pirate]]") radio operations are still reported to Ofcom.

===Postal services===
In October 2010 the government announced plans for Ofcom to inherit the functions of [[Postcomm]] as part of a wider set of public service sell-off measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ofcom to cut staff by a fifth
 |author=Tim Bradshaw |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=21 October 2010 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/93ac5de2-dd25-11df-9236-00144feabdc0.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Postal Services Act 2011]] regulatory responsibility for postal services transferred to Ofcom on 1 October 2011, with its primary duty to maintain the UK's six-day-a-week universal postal service.

===Consultations===

Ofcom makes extensive use of consultations with industry and the public to help it make decisions based upon the evidence presented. Consultation processes begin with publishing documents on its website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/ |title=List of Ofcom consultations |publisher=Stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking for views and responses. If the document is perceived to be long and complicated, a [[plain English]] [[wiktionary:summary|summary]] is usually published as well. A period, usually of 10 weeks, is allowed for interested persons, companies or organisations to send in their responses to the consultation.

After this consultation period, Ofcom publishes all the responses on its website, excluding any personal or confidential information. Ofcom then prepares a summary of the responses received, and uses this information as a basis for its decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ofcom – Official Website – Homepage |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofcom has received criticism for incurring unnecessary costs as a result of "extravagant Thames-side offices" and a "top-heavy salary bill",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidrowan.com/2003/12/interview-stephen-carter-david-currie.html|title=Interview: Stephen Carter &amp; David Currie, Ofcom (Evening Standard)|author=David Rowan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013055452/http://www.davidrowan.com/2003/12/interview-stephen-carter-david-currie.html|date=31 December 2003|archive-date=13 October 2008|website=davidrowan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for inflexibility in its regulation of commercial radio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/05/radio.ofcom | location=London |work=The Guardian  | title=Ofcom accused of 'Nero approach' | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for "poor service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsfixbritain.com/ofcomissues.htm |title=Poor Service from OFCOM |publisher=Letsfixbritain.com |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to ongoing expenditure concerns, Ofcom made the following statement regarding the 2017/2018 budget: "Ofcom has delivered 12 consecutive years of like-for-like real-terms budget reductions, and we will continue to reduce spending wherever we can."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2017/ofcom-confirms-priorities-for-201718|title=Ofcom confirms priorities for 2017/18|date=30 March 2017|website=ofcom.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Al Jazeera ===
The Qatar-based newsmedia outlet was reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40843126|title=Israel moves against Al Jazeera|author=|date=6 August 2017|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Ofcom in January 2017, following an exposé about Israeli diplomatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/israel-embassy-scandal-shai-masot-resigns-threat-take-down-mps-labour-nus-critical-pro-palestinian-a7524446.html|title=Israeli embassy official caught discussing 'take down' of pro-Palestinian MPs quits|author=Lizzie Dearden|date=12 January 2017|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; corp irregularities and influence peddling amongst political and student groups in the UK.
After investigations exceeding eight months, Ofcom reported that Al Jazeera was in line with journalism standards and cleared the filmmakers of the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/09/ofcom-clears-al-jazeera-ntisemitism-expose-israeli-embassy-official|title=Ofcom clears al-Jazeera of antisemitism in exposé of Israeli official|first=Graham|last= Ruddick|date=9 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Press TV ===
In May 2011, Ofcom ruled that [[Press TV]], an Iranian [[English language|English-language]] satellite channel, was responsible for a serious breach of UK broadcasting rules and could face a fine for airing an interview with [[Maziar Bahari]], the ''[[Newsweek]]'' journalist arrested covering the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|Iranian presidential election in 2009]], that was obtained by force while he was held in a Tehran jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|title=Iran's Press TV censured for interview with arrested journalist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/23/iran-press-tv-maziar-bahari|work=The Guardian |accessdate=25 May 2011|date=23 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the release of Ofcom's findings, Press TV claimed that [[Maziar Bahari]] was "an [[MI6]] contact person"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/181242.html |title=PressTV – A British game against PressTV |publisher=Press TV |accessdate=28 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132829/http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/181242.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; taking guidance from "[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]], protocol No. 7".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/181711.html |title=PressTV – Empire continues to sweat over Press TV |publisher=Press TV |accessdate=28 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125248/http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/181711.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Press TV called Ofcom's ruling "part of an anti-Iranian campaign," and that "A quick look at senior decision makers at OFCOM demonstrates that the regulator is mostly made up of former [[Channel 4]] and BBC executives, some of whom are well-linked to and influenced by powerful pro-Israeli politicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/187554.html |title=PressTV – OfCom, UK Office of Miscommunication |publisher=Press TV |accessdate=28 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121009/http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/187554.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/184355.html |title=PressTV – The OFCOM sitcom |publisher=Press TV |accessdate=28 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018234722/http://edition.presstv.ir/detail.fa/184355.html |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sitefinder database and freedom of information===
The [[Sitefinder database]] is a national database of mobile phone base stations in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/sitefinder/faq |title=Ofcom &amp;#124; Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007 an Information Tribunal ruled that the public should have access to the database under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Data row hits mobile mast website |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7024206.stm | work=Technology |publisher=BBC News | date=2 October 2007 &lt;!-- 13:35 GMT --&gt;  | accessdate =6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Ofcom has no legal power to force mobile phone operators to add information to the database, UK mobile phone operators consequently ceased updating it.&lt;ref name="sitefinder-ofcom"/&gt;
Ofcom appealed against the Freedom of Information Act ruling, together with one UK mobile operator – T-Mobile.&lt;ref name="theregister-2007-09-13"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ofcom fails to prevent release of cell locations – But operators might not play ball |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/09/13/sitefinder/ |author=Bill Ray |date=13 September 2007 &lt;!-- 10:51 GMT --&gt;  |work=Networks |accessdate =23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to accusations of the organisation's complicity with the mobile telecommunications industry in keeping information about mast locations secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phone mast locations kept from public |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/phone-mast-locations-kept-from-public-450616.html |author=Geoffrey Lean, Environment Editor |date=27 May 2007 |work=The Independent |accessdate=23 February 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221171034/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/phone-mast-locations-kept-from-public-450616.html |archivedate=21 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ofcom's stated reasons for the appeal have ranged from "preventing terrorist attacks" on the sites of phone masts to "protecting the intellectual property" of the mobile telecommunications industry.&lt;ref name="theregister-2007-09-13"/&gt;

In April 2008, the High Court found in favour of the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] and over-ruled Ofcom's objections. Ofcom appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], who in turn referred a point of law to the [[European Court of Justice]], and then in October 2011 ordered that the matter should be remitted to the [[First-tier Tribunal|Information Rights Tribunal]] to reconsider the public interest balancing exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sitefinder: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/sitefinder/faq|publisher=Ofcom|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2012, the Information Rights Tribunal upheld its decision of 4 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panopticonblog.com/2012/12/17/eir-exemptions-and-aggregation-a-round-trip/ |title=EIR Exemptions and Aggregation : a round trip |publisher=Panopticon Blog |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deryn Consulting controversy===

In 2017 Ofcom’s advisory committee for Wales awarded Deryn Consulting a contract to monitor the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and [[Welsh Government]]. It was subsequently reported that the contract had not been put out to tender and that Huw Roberts and [[Nerys Evans]] held positions for both Deryn and Ofcom.&lt;ref&gt;Private Eye, March 9th, 2018. p13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wales Online|title=Ofcom Wales under fire after contract awarded to insiders' company|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/ofcom-wales-under-fire-after-12649696|author=Martin Shipton|date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract was terminated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wales Online|title=A controversial contract awarded by Ofcom to a Welsh lobbying firm has been terminated|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/controversial-contract-awarded-ofcom-welsh-13493333|author=Martin Shipton|date=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ofcom concluded that it had broken its own procurement rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wales Online|title=Ofcom admits it broke its own rules in giving contract to lobbying firm run by its own advisors|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/ofcom-admits-broke-rules-giving-13801707|author=Martin Shipton|date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pantomime comics''' or a '''silent comic''' are [[comics]] which are delivered in [[mime]]. They make use of little to no [[dialogue]], [[speech balloon]]s or [[Glossary of comics terminology#Caption|caption]]s written underneath the images. Instead the stories or gags are told entirely through pictures.&lt;ref&gt;http://kickstartart.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/KSALesson_Comic-Strip.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Pantomime comics have the advantage of being easily understandable to people - like children - who are slow readers. The genre is also universally popular since [[translation]] is not required, lacking the usual [[language barrier]]s. [[Sergio Aragonés]], a famous artist in the field, once said in a 1991 interview with [[Comics Journal]]: ''"What happens is like a supersimplification. “Something you can say with words, you have to eliminate all the words until it can be told in a little story without words.  You just think a little longer.  But it becomes rewarding in the end because everybody can understand your cartoons no matter what your nationality.  And that, to me, has been always a big thing—to do cartoons that everybody can understand, every age, every nationality.  It is different.  It’s like in the theater.  You have regular theater, and you have pantomime, like [[Marcel Marceau]] or [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]. And I apply that to cartooning and it works."''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcj.com/sergio-aragones-and-the-art-of-pantomime-cartooning/&lt;/ref&gt; Pantomime comics tend to be popular in the [[gag-a-day]] comics genre, where they typically only exist of just three or four images per episode. But some [[graphic novel]]s with longer [[narrative]]s also make use of pantomime. This allows for a more visual experience, where the actual meaning of the events is left to the readers' own interpretation. Some famous pantomime comics artists are [[Sergio Aragonés]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcj.com/sergio-aragones-and-the-art-of-pantomime-cartooning/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guy Bara]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bara.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaval (cartoonist)|Chaval]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/chaval.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henning Dahl Mikkelsen]],&lt;ref&gt;http://toonopedia.com/ferdnand.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Oberländer]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/o/oberlander_adolf.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wil Raymakers]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/raymakers_w.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Soglow]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcj.com/otto-soglow-and-the-little-king-the-silent-runs-deep/&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Gluyas Williams]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/williams_gluyas.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jim Woodring]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/woodring.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radical Entertainment Inc.''' is a Canadian [[video game developer]] based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] and a subsidiary of [[Activision]]. The studio was founded in 1991 by industry veterans Rory Armes and Dave Davis, as well as newcomer Ian Wilkinson. It is best known for developing three games in the ''[[Crash Bandicoot]]'' franchise, and the ''[[Prototype (series)|Prototype]]'' series of games.

On 28 June 2012, due to the financial failure of ''[[Prototype 2]]'', Radical Entertainment suffered a "significant reduction" in staff, and would from then on focus solely on supporting other Activision studios, while ceasing development on their own projects.&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5922129/prototype-creators-shutting-down |title=''Prototype'' Creators Shutting Down [UPDATE] |last=Schreier |first=Jason |date=28 June 2012 |website=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]] |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Studio head]] Dr. David "Dave" Fracchia left the company in May 2014. Radical Entertainment most recently contributed to ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' in 2014.

== History ==

=== Origin (1991–2005) ===
[[File:Radical Entertainment old logo.gif|thumb|left|Former Radical Entertainment logo used until ca. 1999.]]
Radical Entertainment was founded in 1991 by Rory Armes, Dave Davis, and Ian Wilkinson, of which Davis and Armes had previously worked at Vancouver-based [[Distinctive Software]]. The studio primarily developed [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] ports and adaptations of other video games, peaking at eight projects in 1994. Between 1997 and 1998, several employees left the studio to form [[Barking Dog Studios]].

=== 369 Interactive ===
In 2003, Radical Entertainment opened a development division, 369 Interactive, which was set to develop multiple titles based on the ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'' franchise, in partnership with [[Ubi Soft]].

=== Acquisition by Vivendi Universal (2005–2008) ===
Although Radical Entertainment developed few titles for Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the titles gained massive success and warranted the company's interest in the developers. In 2005, Vivendi acquired Radical Entertainment, however, as described by a former developer at Radical, the mood did not change much and Radical still operated as an independent game developing company. After being acquired by Vivendi, Radical began to make many games such as ''[[Scarface: The World Is Yours]]'' and ''[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]'' while being published under Vivendi's [[Sierra Entertainment]] label. Radical was also given the license to continue development of the ''[[Crash Bandicoot (series)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' franchise which was also published under Sierra Entertainment. Radical took over the development of ''[[Crash Tag Team Racing]]'' from [[Traveller's Tales]]. Due to the success of ''Crash Tag Team Racing'', Radical then started the development of ''[[Crash of the Titans]]'' and proclaimed that "Crash was home at Radical" stating that Radical would develop all further ''Crash'' games. The critical and commercial success of ''Crash of the Titans'' spawned one more sequel, ''[[Crash: Mind over Mutant]]'', which managed to both critically beat its predecessor as well as commercially. During the development of ''Crash: Mind Over Mutant'', Radical began working on its first original IP, ''[[Prototype (video game)|Prototype]]''.

=== Subsidiary of Activision (2008–2009) ===
In 2008 it was announced that Vivendi Games and [[Activision]] were to form [[Activision Blizzard]]. The merger changed the mood of Radical and made it more like a first-party developer, instead of indie. At the time of the merge Radical was working on three different projects, one was an unnamed project and the other two were ''Crash: Mind Over Mutant'' and ''Prototype''. After the merger took place, about half of Radical's staff was cut under Activision Blizzards restructuring. This resulted in the cancellation of the unnamed project while development of Crash and Prototype were unaffected. As revealed later by a former developer at Radical, the unnamed project was ''Scarface 2'', which had been at development at Radical for over two years and had nearly [[gone gold]], the developer stated that Activision canceled the project. ''Crash: Mind Over Mutant'' was the last games to be published under the Sierra Entertainment label, however some rare editions are given the Activision label instead. Nevertheless, Activision is given credit within the video game. ''Prototype'' was published only underneath the Activision label.

After the release of ''Prototype'' in 2009 Radical did not officially announce any new projects, though it was revealed again by another former developer that Radical was working on another unnamed project, which had been in development for over a year. However, when Radical Entertainment experienced layoffs which resulted in over 60 people losing jobs, the project (Crash Landed) was cancelled by Activision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/experience-going-indie/ |title=Feral developers: why game industry talent is going indie |last=Kuchera |first=Ben |date=24 August 2011 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2010 [[Spike Video Game Awards]], Radical announced ''[[Prototype 2]]'', which was set to be their largest game.

=== ''Prototype 2'', layoffs (2010–present) ===
Radical Entertainment released the first details for ''Prototype 2'' in an interview with EGMi. In the same interview they revealed that they halted the development on an unknown game, possibly the rumoured ''Crash Bandicoot'' title, after the massive success of ''Prototype''. However, other candidates for the halted game were rumored to be an unknown Spider-Man game and a Jason Bourne game. This title was later revealed to be cancelled. In January 2011, an artist posted video footage showing the cancelled [[Jason Bourne]] game called ''Treadstone''.&lt;ref name="Engadget"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/05/13/work-on-canned-bourne-game-treadstone-revealed-in-vid/ |title=Work on canned Bourne game 'Treadstone' revealed in vid |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |date=13 May 2011 |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL Tech]] |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was cancelled when the Bourne license was reacquired by [[Ludlum Entertainment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/07/30/bourne-game-rights-forget-vivendi-return-to-ludlum-entertainmen/ |title=Bourne game rights forget Vivendi, return to Ludlum Entertainment |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |date=30 July 2008 |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL Tech]] |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then licensed to [[Electronic Arts]].&lt;ref name="Engadget" /&gt;

To celebrate the release of ''Prototype 2'', Radical Entertainment revealed that, to coincide, they were releasing RadNet. Similar to ''[[Call of Duty: Elite]]'', RadNet is an online gaming hub. RadNet contains competitive challenges which in turn give the player rewards for in-game use, Avatar accessories, development videos and Dynamic themes. An iPhone game, ''Protoslice'', was also released to coincide with the release of the game, the iPhone app had partial overseen development by Radical, whilst the actual game was not developed by them.

''Prototype 2'' was released in April 2012 as Radical Entertainment's biggest game launch ever. The game was well-received, with positive reviews on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Versions, with the PC release coming at a later date in 2012. The sales for ''Prototype 2'' dominated the sales of games in April 2012, and achieved higher sales than ''[[Kinect Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/prototype-2-tops-dismal-april-sales/1100-6376131/ |title=Prototype 2 tops dismal April sales |last=Sinclair |first=Brendan |date=14 June 2012 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, ''Prototype 2'' sold less than a million copies in the two months following release.

On 28 June 2012, Activision announced that Radical Entertainment had seen a "significant reduction in staff", and that the studio "will cease development of its own games going forward", prompting media speculation that the developer had closed.&lt;ref name="Kotaku" /&gt; The publisher cited ''Prototype 2''{{'s}} failure to "find a broad commercial audience" as the reason behind Radical's closure. According to Activision, some employees will remain working for Radical Entertainment supporting other existing Activision Publishing projects, thus, while keeping the studio active, leaves them as a support team.&lt;ref name="Kotaku" /&gt;

==Background and history==
[[Drag kings]] are mostly female [[performance artist]]s who dress in [[masculinity|masculine]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and personify male [[gender]] stereotypes as part of their routine.&lt;ref name="Competitive Drag Kings Strut Stuff"&gt;{{cite web  |last=Aronoff  |first=Jen  |title=Competitive Drag Kings Strut Stuff: With some spit and polish, women perform in growing world of cross-dressing pageantry  |publisher=[[The Daily Gamecock|The University of South Carolina Daily Gamecock]]  |date=2005-10-19  |url=http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2005/10/19/TheMix/Competitive.Drag.Kings.Strut.Stuff-1025370.shtml  |accessdate=2007-07-29  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016152029/http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2005/10/19/TheMix/Competitive.Drag.Kings.Strut.Stuff-1025370.shtml  |archivedate=2007-10-16  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical show may incorporate dancing and singing, sometimes live or [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] to pre-recorded tracks.&lt;ref name="Drag King Contest by Dujour"&gt;{{cite web  |last=Dujour  |first=Dick  |title=Drag King Contest  |publisher=[[San Francisco Bay Times]]  |date=2006-08-24

In 1993 The LAB produced a drag king contest at the DNA lounge hosted by [[Elvis Herselvis]] and [[Justin Bond]], Stafford was declared the winner.&lt;ref name=SFDKCAU&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of SF Drag King Contests|url=http://sfdragkingcontest.com/aboutus.html|publisher=SF Drag King Contest|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first annual S.F. Drag King contest was held in May 1994 at the San Francisco Eagle bar, in the SOMA district.&lt;ref name=DKSFW&gt;{{cite news|last=Linn|first=Amy|title=Drag Kings: From San Francisco to London, women are donning men's clothes, assuming males personas, and challenging the very concept of gender.

The following summer in 1995, as a part of a weekly alternative club called Klubstitute in the San Francisco's Mission district, the Mr. Klubstitute pageant took place.&lt;ref name=DKSFW/&gt; It included emcee [[Elvis Herselvis]] and the eight contestants were judges on fashion, talent, and question-and-answer.&lt;ref name=DKSFW/&gt; [[Jane Wiedlin]] and [[Gina Schock]] of [[The Go-Go's]], the late Arturo Galster&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0303332/reference&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin Vivian Bond]] [[John Cameron Mitchell]] have appeared at S.F Drag King Contest

Over the first twelve years the performances evolved from more spontaneous performances being rehearsed months in advanced and big production numbers.&lt;ref name=SFC/&gt;

In 2006 then supervisor [[Tom Ammiano]] and the S.F.Board of Supervisors presented a proclamation honoring the event.&lt;ref name=SFBTDDC&gt;{{cite news|last=DuJour|first=Dick|title=Drag King Contest|url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?article_id=5448&amp;sec=article|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=SF Bay Times|date=August 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2007 then-Senator [[Carol Migden]] and The California Senate presented a proclamation for SFDKC, an event "that celebrates the diversity of genders and in appreciation of the creative performances that contribute and enrich San Francisco’s entertainment community."&lt;ref name=SFBTDD/&gt;

In ''Female Masculinity'' Judith Halberstam notes that in the 1990s most major U.S. cities have some drag king acts as part of its queer club subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halberstam|first=Judith|title=Female Masculinity|year=1998|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822322436|pages=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYAi9OEYRekC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Alias the Spider"''' is a [[comic-book]] feature from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] that appeared in [[Quality Comics]]' ''[[Crack Comics]]'' for nearly three years, starting with issue #1 in 1940. He was created by writer-artist [[Paul Gustavson]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan  | author-link =   | contribution = Alias the Spider  | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 10  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Golden Age version of the character is in the public domain; but the rights to all subsequent versions are currently owned by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
Only one adventure of the Spider has ever been reprinted by [[DC Comics]], which acquired the Quality Comics stable of characters when that company went out of business in 1956: the story from ''Crack Comics'' #25, in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #441.

The Spider later made sporadic cameo appearances in ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' and ''[[The Young All-Stars]]''. As a Quality Comics character, he was one of the heroes who went with [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] to protect [[Earth-X]] during [[World War II]], becoming part of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]. This was the fulfillment of a storyline that began in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #107-108, which introduced most of Quality Comics' characters to the [[DC Universe]]. Previously only [[Plastic Man]] and [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]] had been used.

==Fictional character biography==
===Tom Hallaway===
The Spider is playboy Tom Hallaway, who had tired of seeing criminals have their own way harassing and murdering honest citizens, so he adopts the guise of The Spider to settle the score. The Spider fights crime in a yellow shirt and blue shorts. He is armed with a bow and arrows, a special car known as the Black Widow, and the assistance of his valet Chuck (who helps Hallaway in both of his identities without anyone making any sort of connection). Hallaway uses a special arrow called the "Spider's Seal", which has a flat disc on the end; he shoots it at thugs' hands to disarm them.

In the continuity that followed [[DC Comics]]' "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]" company-crossover storyline, the Spider is not heroic. Now given the full name Tom Ludlow Hallaway, he did not become the Spider out of an altruistic motive, but rather because he was a smuggler, kidnapper and murderer who used the guise of a superhero as a cover to help him eliminate the competition. Though originally based in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], he is a member of the Ludlow clan from New England. The family inadvertently ran up against the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]], a near-immortal  sometime-villain introduced during the 1930s-1940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. The family had a history of ill-gotten gains, having originally amassed its vast wealth by killing their partners in a business enterprise.

Instead of working with the Freedom Fighters, this revised Spider is a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] (also known as The [[Law's Legionnaires]]). The Crisis on Infinite Earths had erased the Golden Age [[Green Arrow]] and [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]] from existence, and the Spider helped fill the void in the team. [[Shining Knight]], the [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and his partner Stuff, the original [[Star-Spangled Kid]] and [[Stripesy]], and the [[Crimson Avenger]] were on board with the Spider.  As depicted in ''[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]'' #9, during the final case of the Seven Soldiers, the Spider betrays them to their old enemy, the Iron Hand (who had created the cosmic menace known as the [[Nebula Man]]). The Spider kills the Vigilante's friend Billy Gunn, but is stopped by the Crimson Avenger's partner [[Wing (DC Comics)|Wing]], who stops the Nebula Man (though at the cost of his own life).

With the only people who knew him to be a criminal dead, the Spider continues his heroic facade. He becomes the hero-in-residence of [[Keystone City]] after the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] retired in 1950. Unfortunately his Ludlow heritage catches up with him, as does the Shade. The Spider had been planning to face the Shade for quite a while. He had saved fragments of the Shade's shadow substance, intending to plant them at the scene of a double murder, that of [[Jay Garrick]] (the Golden Age Flash) and his wife Joan. The Spider hoped to lessen the Shade's power by keeping him captive near a roaring fireplace, but the added light only increased the shadows.  The Shade creates arrow-casting monsters that shoot the Spider with black arrows. The Shade is able to prevent the Garricks' murders, but convinces his old enemy the Flash not to publicize his role.

===Lucas Ludlow-Dalt===
The Spider's son, '''Lucas Ludlow-Dalt''', takes up the bow and arrow (and his original yellow and blue costume) in the pages of ''[[Starman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Starman]]'', helping [[Culp (comics)|Culp]], [[Mist (comics)|The Mist]], [[Rag Doll (comics)| the Rag Doll]], [[Doctor Phosphorus]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and several other villains lay siege to Opal City during the "[[Grand Guignol]]" storyline. This Spider had trained all his life for revenge on the Shade, and comes close to getting it. [[List of Starman characters#The O'Dares|Matt O'Dare]] prevents the Spider from killing the Shade, and he is chased off to parts unknown. Lucas later attempts to kill [[Starman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Jack Knight]] in the final issue of ''Starman'' (and nearly kills [[List of Starman characters#The O'Dares|Mason O'Dare]], if not for the timely intervention of the spirit of the deceased magician [[Zatara]]). The Shade tells Jack Knight he is going to bring him in, since he is a Ludlow.

''Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.'' #9 also depicted the beginning of vengeful activity for another Spider, though this may be the same Spider that was depicted in ''Starman''.

The Spider takes up his bow again in the pages of the most recent [[Hawkman]] series, facing off against Hawkman, [[Hawkgirl]] and [[Green Arrow]]. The Green Arrow shoots the Spider in his aiming eye with an arrow, hoping to end the criminal's career by maiming him.  The Spider manages to re-learn archery from a new perspective (and far quicker than is usual for any normal human).

===I, Spyder===
''Seven Soldiers'' #0 featured the advent of yet another Spider, although he spelled the name "I, Spyder". This character, named '''Thomas Ludlow Dalt''', was one of the five heroes brought together by the [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] to form a new incarnation of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]. Prior to this, he was abducted by the Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp after accepting a contract to kill them at their home base in the aforementioned bog. It was revealed that the Seven had hired him in order to lure him into their headquarters so they could hopefully prepare him to defeat the Sheeda (though one character criticised recruiting 'another schmuck with a bow and arrows'). Thomas was given several augmentations in terms of his abilities and gear which included new clothes, a jet-black helicopter with a black widow hourglass symbol on its base as well as 'cold blood and perfect aim'. This Spider is also the son of Thomas Hallaway, and the brother of Lucas, who usurps the identity by killing his brother.  His glory is short lived however, as he is killed by the evil [[Sheeda]] and resurrected as their agent.

However, this Spyder was not actually villainous like his father. After a failed assassination attempt on Bulleteer's life, Spyder was greeted by the ghost of Greg Saunders, the original [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]. What occurred during their confrontation is not shown but in ''Seven Soldiers'' #1, Spyder shoots the Sheeda queen Gloriana Tenebrae, knocking her from her floating castle, and she is hit and killed by a car driven by the Bulleteer.

'''St James''' in [[Saint Peter Port]], [[Guernsey]], formerly called the church of '''St James-the-Less''', has since 1985 become a concert and assembly hall providing the island with a unique and versatile venue.

==History==
In October 1815 Admiral [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|James de Saumarez]] suggested the idea of building a church for use by the British garrison based in Guernsey where services could be held in English (as against French in other island churches). The church was designed by [[John Wilson (architect)|John Wilson]] and completed by 1818,&lt;ref name="STJH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjames.gg/history.php  |title=History |publisher=stjames.gg}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ring |first=Trudi [[et alii]] |title=Northern Europe: International Dictionary of Historic Places |publisher=Routledge |date=1996 |ISBN=978-1884964015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|694}} at a cost of nearly £7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toms |first=Carel |title=St Peter Port, People &amp; Places |ISBN=1 86077 258 7 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}

Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-elizabeth-college-and-st-james-the-less-st-peter-port-french-stagecoach-caudebec-en-d23642 |title=Elizabeth College and St James-the-Less, St Peter Port; ?French Stagecoach; ?Caudebec-en-Caux ?1832 |publisher=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used as a chapel by nearby [[Elizabeth College, Guernsey|Elizabeth College]].

In 1970 the church became redundant and started to decay until in 1981 ''The Friends of St James'' association was formed to restore and manage the building. The [[States of Guernsey]] agreed to pay for this restoration in 1983 and the building was officially re-opened on 5 July 1985 by HRH the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]].&lt;ref name=STJH/&gt; The restoration of the building winning a [[Civic Trust Awards|Civic Trust Award]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.civictrustawards.org.uk/benet/region/Channel%20Islands |title=Schemes in Channel Islands |publisher=Civic Trust Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caduquemin.com/Projects/Historical_Buildings/St__James.aspx |title=St. James |publisher=C.A.

In 2002 the Dorey Centre, comprising meeting rooms, café and administration offices, were completed,&lt;ref name=STJH/&gt; which gave the centre  additional facilities such as exhibition space and to cater for formal dinners and weddings. The gallery was chosen to house the Guernsey Millennium Tapestry.

'''Temistocle Solera''' (25 December 1815 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1878) was an Italian opera composer and [[librettist]].

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Ferrara]]. He received his education at the Imperial College in [[Vienna]] and at the [[University of Pavia]]. Throughout his life he actively participated in anti-Austrian resistance. At one point, he was incarcerated for his activities. He completed several literary works, including the novel ''Michelino'', his style influenced by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]. He then found work as a librettist; his collaboration with the composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]] began in 1839 and lasted for a few years.&lt;ref name="dierdre"&gt;O'Grady, Dierdre. ''The last troubadours: poetic drama in Italian opera 1597-1887''. (New York: Routledge, Chapman and Hall, 1991). 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Solera then found work as the [[impresario]] for the [[Teatro Real|Royal Theatre]] in [[Madrid]]. He died in [[Milan]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="dierdre"/&gt;

'''''The Brady Bunch''''' is an American [[sitcom]] created by [[Sherwood Schwartz]] that aired from September 26, 1969, to March 8, 1974, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The series revolves around a large [[Stepfamily|blended family]] with six children. Considered one of the last of the old-style family sitcoms, the series aired for five seasons and, after its cancellation in 1974, went into [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in September 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/656581/brady-bunch-actor-ann-b-davis-dies-88|title=Ann B Davis obit|publisher=Straight.com|accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the series was never a critical success or hit series during its original run, it has since become a popular staple in syndication, especially among children and teenaged viewers.

''The Brady Bunch''{{'}}s success in syndication led to several television reunion films and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series: ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour]]'' (1976–77), ''[[The Brady Bunch#The Brady Girls Get Married .2F The Brady Brides|The Brady Girls Get Married]]'' (1981), ''[[The Brady Bunch#The Brady Girls Get Married .2F The Brady Brides|The Brady Brides]]'' (1981), ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]'' (1988), and ''[[The Bradys]]'' (1990). In 1995, the series was adapted into a satirical comedy theatrical film titled ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'', followed by ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'' in 1996. A second sequel, ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]]'', aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in November 2002 as a [[television film|made-for-television film]]. In 1997, "Getting [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]]" (season three, episode 12) was ranked number 37 on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=June 28 July 4 |pages= |publisher= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The durability of the show has resulted in it becoming widely recognized as an American [[cultural icon]].

== Development ==

In 1966, following the success of his TV series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', Sherwood Schwartz conceived the idea for ''The Brady Bunch'' after reading in ''The Los Angeles Times'' that "30% of marriages [in the United States] have a child or children from a previous marriage." He set to work on a [[television pilot|pilot]] script for a series tentatively titled ''Mine and Yours''.&lt;ref name=Brady&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edelstein |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Lovece |first2=Frank |authorlink2=Frank Lovece|title=The Brady Bunch Book |year=1990|publisher=Warner Books |location=New York|isbn=0-446-39137-9 |pages=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz then developed the script to include three children for each parent. While Mike Brady is depicted as being a widower, Schwartz originally wanted the character of Carol Brady to have been a divorcée, but the network objected to this. A compromise was reached whereby Carol's marital status (whether she was divorced or widowed) was never directly revealed.

Schwartz shopped the series to the "big three" television networks of the era. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]] all liked the script, but each network wanted changes before they would commit to filming, so Schwartz shelved the project.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Biography Channel]] documentary titled "''The Brady Bunch''", retrieved on June 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although similarities exist between the series and two 1968 theatrical release films, United Artists' ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'' (starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]]) and [[National General Pictures|CBS]]'s ''[[With Six You Get Eggroll]]'' (starring [[Brian Keith]] and [[Doris Day]]), the original script for ''The Brady Bunch'' predated the scripts for both of these films. Nonetheless, the outstanding success of the United Artists film ([[1968 in film|the 11th-highest-grossing film of 1968]]) was a factor in ABC's decision to order episodes for the series.&lt;ref name=Brady /&gt;

After receiving a commitment for 13 weeks of television shows from ABC in 1968, Schwartz hired film and television director [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] to direct the pilot, cast the six children from 264 interviews during that summer, and hired the actors to play the mother role, the father role, and the housekeeper role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz |first1=Sherwood |last2=Schwartz|first2=Lloyd J. |title=Brady, Brady, Brady: The Complete Story of The Brady Bunch as Told by the Father/Son Team who Really Know|year=2010|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-4164-X|pages=46, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the sets were built on [[Paramount Television]] stage 5, adjacent to the stage where ''[[H.R.

Filming of the pilot began on Friday, October 4, 1968, and lasted eight days.

==Premise==
Mike Brady ([[Robert Reed]]), a widowed [[architect]] with three sons, Greg ([[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]]), Peter ([[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]), and Bobby ([[Mike Lookinland]]), marries Carol Martin ([[Florence Henderson]]), who herself has three daughters: Marcia ([[Maureen McCormick]]), Jan ([[Eve Plumb]]), and Cindy ([[Susan Olsen]]). The wife and daughters take the Brady surname. Included in the blended family are Mike's live-in housekeeper, Alice Nelson ([[Ann B. Davis]]), and the boys' dog, Tiger. (In the pilot episode, the girls also have a pet:  a cat named Fluffy.  Fluffy never appeared in any episodes following the pilot.)  The setting is a large, suburban, two-story house designed by Mike, in a Los Angeles suburb.&lt;ref name = "BB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/thebradybunch.html|title=Brady Bunch synopsis|publisher=Sitcoms Online|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first season, awkward adjustments, accommodations, gender rivalries, and resentments inherent in blended families dominate the stories. In an early episode, Carol tells Bobby that the only "steps" in their household lead to the second floor (in other words, that the family contains no "stepchildren", only "children"). Thereafter, the episodes focus on typical preteen and teenaged adjustments such as sibling rivalry, puppy love, self-image, character building, and responsibility.  Noticeably absent was any political commentary, especially regarding the [[Vietnam War]], which was being waged at its largest extent during the height of the series.&lt;ref&gt;History Channel, "The Social History of Television" (Aug 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast and characters==
{{Main article|List of The Brady Bunch characters}}

===Main===
The regular cast appeared in an opening title sequence in which video head shots were arranged in a three-by-three grid, with each cast member appearing to look at the other cast members. The sequence used the then-new "[[multi-dynamic image technique]]" created by Canadian filmmaker [[Christopher Chapman]]; as a result of the popular attention it garnered in this sequence, it has been referred to in the press as "the Brady Bunch effect".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/christopher-chapman-oscar-winner-invented-brady-bunch-effect/article27056899/ ''The Globe and Mail'', Obituary: "Christopher Chapman, Oscar Winner who invented 'Brady Bunch' effect"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-chapman-dead-creator-brady-834893 ''The Hollywood Reporter'', "Oscar-Winning Creator of 'The Brady Bunch' Effect Dies at 88"]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', the show's opening title sequence ranked number eight on a list of TV's top-10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;Tomashoff, Craig.

===Recurring characters===
*Sam Franklin ([[Allan Melvin]]) is Alice's boyfriend. He is the owner of a local [[butcher]] shop. Sam appears in only eight episodes, but they span all five seasons. He is also frequently mentioned in dialogue, and Alice occasionally goes on dates with him off-screen. By the time of the 1981 made-for-TV movie ''The Brady Girls Get Married'', Alice and Sam are married.
*Tiger the dog – [[Tiger (dog)|the original dog]] that played Tiger died early in the first season.&lt;ref&gt;"Growing up Brady" by Barry Williams with Chris Kreski, p. 210, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement dog proved problematic, so the producers decided the dog would appear only when essential to the plot. Tiger appeared in about half the episodes in the first season and about half a dozen episodes in the second season. Tiger seemingly vanished without an explanation and was not shown again after "The Impractical Joker" (last episode shown with Tiger) and "What Goes Up" (last episode made with Tiger).
[[File:Robbie Rist Cousin Oliver Brady Bunch 1974.JPG|thumb|180px|Robbie Rist as Cousin Oliver]]
*Mr. Phillips ([[Jack Collins (actor)|Jack Collins]]) is Mike's boss at the architectural firm. He appears in only three episodes, all during season two, but is often mentioned in other episodes when  issues occur around Mike's work.
*Cousin Oliver ([[Robbie Rist]]) – in the middle of season five, producers added a new character named Oliver, Carol Brady's young nephew, who was sent to live with the Bradys while his parents were living in South America. The character was added in an attempt to fill the age gap left by the maturing Brady children – the youngest (Susan Olsen) was 12 years old during the show's final season. Lloyd Schwartz, son of creator and executive producer Sherwood Schwartz, later admitted that the character threw off the balance of the show and said that fans regarded the character as an interloper. Oliver appeared in the final six episodes of season five, which proved to be the final season, as ABC cancelled the series in 1974. The addition of the character has been cited as the  moment the series "[[jumped the shark]]".&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2010 p.201&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Cousin Oliver" has been used to describe the addition of a young character to a series in an attempt to save a series from cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ariano|first1=Tara|last2=Bunting|first2=Sarah D. |title=Television Without Pity: 752 Things We Love to Hate (And Hate to Love) About TV|year=2006|publisher=Quirk Books|isbn=1-59474-117-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production notes==

===Theme song and credits sequence===
The theme song, penned by Schwartz and [[Frank De Vol]], and originally arranged, sung, and performed by Paul Parrish, Lois Fletcher, and John Beland{{failed verification|date=August 2016}} under the name the [[Peppermint Trolley Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dannyfaragher.com/bio/the-peppermint-trolley-company/ |title=The Biography of the Peppermint Trolley Company | publisher=Danny Faragher}}&lt;/ref&gt; quickly communicated to audiences that the Bradys were a blended family. The Brady family is shown in a tic-tac-toe board-style graphic with Carol on the top center, Alice in the middle block, and Mike on bottom middle. To the right are three blocks with the boys from the oldest on top to the youngest. To the left are three blocks with the girls from the oldest to the youngest. In season two, the Brady kids took over singing the theme song. In season three, the boys sing the first verse, girls sing the second verse, and all sing together for the third and last verse. The sequence was created and filmed by [[Howard A. Anderson, Jr.]], a visual effects pioneer who worked on the title sequences for many popular television series.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/howard-anderson-jr#|title=Howard Anderson, Jr. Interview|publisher=Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences' Archive of American Television|accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end credits feature an instrumental version of the theme song's third verse. In season one, it was recorded by the Peppermint Trolley Company. From season two on, the theme was recorded in-house by Paramount musicians.

===The Brady house===
The house used in exterior shots, which bears little relation to the interior layout of the Bradys' home, is located in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]], within the city limits of Los Angeles. &lt;!-- Please do not insert the address of the house, to respect to the current owners' privacy.--&gt; According to a 1994 article in the ''Los Angeles Times'', the [[San Fernando Valley]] house was built in 1959 and selected as the Brady residence because series creator Schwartz felt it looked like a home where an architect would live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidbrady.com/times/latbrady.html |title=Here's the story of the Brady Bunch house |publisher=Davidbrady.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A false window was attached to the front's [[A-frame house|A-frame]] section to give the illusion that it had two full stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alleman|first=Richard |title=Hollywood: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie L.A.|year=2003|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-8041-3777-3|pages=427–428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary establishing shots of the house were filmed with the owner's permission for the 1990 TV series ''[[The Bradys]]''. The owner refused to allow Paramount to restore the property to its 1969 look for ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' in 1995, so a [[facade]] resembling the original home was built around an existing house.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The house was for sale in 2018 with an asking price of $1.885 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iconic-brady-bunch-house-for-sale-after-nearly-50-years/|title=Iconic "Brady Bunch" house for sale after nearly 50 years|last=O'Kane|first=Caitlin|work=[[CBS News]]|date=July 19, 2018|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and television network [[HGTV]] outbid seven others for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/08/07/it-turns-out-hgtv-outbid-lance-bass-for-the-brady-bunch-house/ |title=It turns out HGTV outbid Lance Bass for the 'Brady Bunch' house |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 7, 2018 |access-date=August 8, 2018 |first=Sonia |last=Rao }}&lt;/ref&gt; HGTV plans to expand the home for ''[[A Very Brady Renovation]]'', though it will look the same from the street. The six actors who played the TV children posed for a photo in front on November 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.journalnow.com/news/trending/brady-bunch-cast-members-reunite-at-tv-family-home/article_d5027d07-fad8-5f89-9dc9-f99ac945cd6c.html|title='Brady Bunch' cast members reunite at TV family home|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 1, 2018|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the series, the address of the house was given as 4222 Clinton Way (as read aloud by Carol from an arriving package in the first-season episode entitled "Lost Locket, Found Locket").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McHugh|first=Erin |title=Where?|year=2005|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=1-4027-2572-8|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no city was ever specified, it was presumed from references to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], the [[Los Angeles Rams]],  and a [[Hollywood]] movie studio, among many others, that the Bradys lived in [[Southern California]], most likely Los Angeles or one of its suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansour|first=David |title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century|year=2005|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=0-7407-5118-2|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|title=Encyclopedia of Television: Series, Pilots and Specials 1974–1984|volume=2|year=1985|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=0-918432-61-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of the Brady house was used at least three times for other Paramount shows, twice for ''[[Mannix]]'' and once for ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'', while ''The Brady Bunch'' was in production. In the case of ''Mission: Impossible'', the Brady furniture was also used.&lt;ref&gt;Mannix – season three, episode 19 – "Who is Sylvia?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mannix – season four, episode two – "One for the Lady"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mission: Impossible – season six, episode 20 – "Double Dead"&lt;/ref&gt; A re-creation of the Brady house was constructed for the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode "[[Sunshine Days]]", which also revolved around ''The Brady Bunch''.

Ratings data prior to 1972 is scarce for shows which did not place in the Top 30.  Beginning in 2017, TV Ratings Guide began publishing vintage television ratings as they became readily available from old newspaper publishings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvratingsguide.com/2017/08/1973-74-top-30-abc-wrangles-10-entries.html |title=1973-74 Ratings History}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Brady Bunch'' never achieved high ratings during its primetime run (never placing in the top 30 during the five years it aired) and was cancelled in 1974 after five seasons and 117 episodes; it was cancelled shortly after the series crossed the [[100 episodes|minimum threshold]] for [[broadcast syndication|syndication]]. At that point in the story, Greg graduated from high school and was about to enroll in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradyworld.com/cover/history.htm|title=Brady Bunch history|publisher=Bradyworld.com|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular reception===
When the episodes were repeated in syndication, they usually appeared every weekday in late-afternoon or [[Prime Time Access Rule|early-evening]] slots on local stations. This enabled children to watch the episodes when they came home from school, making the program widely popular and giving it iconic status among those who were too young to have seen the series during its primetime run.

According to Schwartz, the reason the show has become a part of [[Americana]], even though other shows have run longer, were rated higher, and were critically acclaimed, is that the episodes were written from the standpoint of the children and addressed situations that children could understand (such as boy trouble, sibling rivalry, and meeting famous people such as a rock star or baseball players). The Bradys are also portrayed as a harmonious family, though they do have times when one of the children does not cooperate with his or her parents or the other children.

==Syndication and distribution==
Since its first airing in syndication in September 1975, an episode of the show has been broadcast somewhere in the United States and abroad every day of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rubin, Lawrence C. |title=Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-based Interventions|year=2008|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=0-8261-0119-4|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes were also shown on ABC daytime from July 9, 1973 to April 18, 1975 and from June 30 to August 29, 1975, at 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST/10:30 CST.

The show was aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] starting in the 1980s until 1997, [[Nick at Nite]] in 1995 (for a special event), and again from 1998 to 2003 (and briefly during the spring of 2012), [[TeenNick]] (under the channel's former name The N) from March to April 2004, on [[TV Land]] on and off from 2002 to 2015, [[Nick Jr.]] (as part of the [[NickMom]] block from 2012 to 2013), and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January to June 2013 and again starting September 5, 2016, until September 30, 2016.

Episodes in the syndicated version have been edited for time to allow for commercial breaks, down from the original version of 25–26 minutes.

===Current airings===
Since its launch as a national network in 2010, the [[Weigel Broadcasting]] owned classic TV network [[MeTV]] airs a weekly two-hour block of the show every Sunday morning/early afternoon promoted as the "Brady Bunch Brunch". In the years following, MeTV has also periodically aired the series weekday mornings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metvnetwork.com/shows/the-brady-bunch The Brady Bunch on Me-TV - Me TV Network.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Decades (TV channel)|Decades]] - a sister network of MeTV - also occasionally airs the show. 

Online, the show is available on [[Hulu]] and CBS All Access, though not all episodes are available for either service.

==Discography==
During the series' original run, the Brady kids recorded several albums on Paramount's record label. While [[session musician]]s provided backing, the actors from the series provided their own singing voices (which was not always the case for early 1970s television crossover acts). None of the albums or singles from The Brady Kids ever became hits on any national music [[Billboard charts|charts]].

==Spin-offs, sequels, and reunions==
Several [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s and [[sequel]]s to the original series have been made, featuring all or most of the original cast. These include another sitcom, an animated series, a variety show, television movies, a dramatic series, a stage play, and theatrical movies:
{{anchor|kellyskids}}

===''Kelly's Kids''===
A final-season ''Brady Bunch'' episode, "Kelly's Kids", was intended as a pilot for a prospective spin-off series of the same name. [[Ken Berry]] starred as Ken Kelly, a friend and neighbor of the Bradys, who with his wife Kathy ([[Brooke Bundy]]) adopted three orphaned boys of different racial backgrounds. One of the adopted sons was played by Todd Lookinland, the younger brother of Mike Lookinland. While ''Kelly's Kids'' was not subsequently picked up as a full series, producer Sherwood Schwartz reworked the basic premise for the short-lived 1980s sitcom ''[[Together We Stand]]'' starring [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Dee Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddard|first=Sylvia |title=The Brady Bunch: An Outrageously Funny, Far-Out Guide To America's Favorite TV Family|year=1996|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-96053-0|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Brady Kids''===
{{Main article|The Brady Kids}}
A 22-episode animated [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series, produced by [[Filmation]] and airing on ABC from September 1972 to August 1974, is about the Brady kids having various adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erickson|first=Hal |title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 1993|date=1995|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-0029-3|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family's adults were never seen or mentioned, and the "home" scenes were in a very large, well-appointed tree house. Several animals were regular characters, including two non-English-speaking pandas (Ping and Pong), a talking bird (Marlon) which could do magic, and an ordinary pet dog (Mop Top, not Tiger). The first 17 episodes featured the voices of all six of the original child actors from the show, but Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, and Christopher Knight were replaced for the last five episodes due to a contract dispute.

===''The Brady Bunch Variety Hour''===
{{Main article|The Brady Bunch Hour}}
On November 28, 1976, a two-hour [[television special]] entitled ''The Brady Bunch Variety Hour'' aired on ABC. [[Eve Plumb]] was the only regular cast member from the original show who declined to be in the series and the role of Jan was recast with [[Geri Reischl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddard|first=Sylvia |title=The Brady Bunch: An Outrageously Funny, Far-Out Guide To America's Favorite TV Family|year=1996|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-96053-0|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], the sibling team behind ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'', ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny and Marie]]'', and other variety shows and children's series of the era, the show was intended to air every fifth week in the same slot as ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', but ended up being scheduled sporadically throughout the season, leading to inconsistent ratings and its inevitable cancellation.

In 2009, ''Brady Bunch'' cast member Susan Olsen, with Lisa Sutton, published a book, ''[[Love to Love You Bradys]]'', which dissects and celebrates the ''Variety Hour'' as a cult classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/32597867/ns/today-books/t/love-you-bradys-exposes-troubled-set/|title='Love to You Bradys' exposes troubled set|date=August 31, 2009|publisher=today.com|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TV reunion movie called ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' was produced in 1981. Although scheduled to be shown in its original full-length movie format, NBC at the last minute divided it into half-hour segments and showed one part a week for three weeks, and the fourth week debuted a spin-off sitcom titled ''The Brady Brides''. The reunion movie featured the entire original cast; this proved to be the only time the entire cast worked together on a single project following the cancellation of the original series. The movie's opening credits featured the season-one "Grid" and theme song, with the addition of ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradyworld.com/episodes/brides.htm |title=Brady World – Episode Guide |publisher=Bradyworld.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie shows what the characters had been doing since the original series ended: Mike is still an architect, Carol is a real-estate agent, Greg is a doctor, Marcia is a fashion designer, Peter is in the Air Force, Jan is also an architect, Bobby and Cindy are in college, and Alice has married Sam. Eventually, they all reunite for Marcia and Jan's double wedding.

''The Brady Brides'' features [[Maureen McCormick]] (Marcia) and [[Eve Plumb]] (Jan) in regular roles. The series begins with Marcia and Jan and their new husbands buying a house and living together. The clashes between Jan's uptight and conservative husband, Philip Covington III (a college professor in science who is several years older than Jan, played by Ron Kuhlman) and Marcia's slovenly and more [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] husband, Wally Logan (a fun-loving salesman for a large toy company, played by [[Jerry Houser]]), were the pivot on which many of the stories were based, not unlike ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''. [[Florence Henderson]] and [[Ann B. Davis]] also appeared regularly. Ten episodes were aired before the sitcom was cancelled. This was the only Brady show in sitcom form to be filmed in front of a live studio audience. [[Bob Eubanks]] guest-starred as himself in an episode where the two couples appear on ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''.

Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' was rerun on various networks in its original full-length movie format.

===''A Very Brady Christmas''===
{{Main article|A Very Brady Christmas}}
A second TV reunion movie, ''A Very Brady Christmas'', aired in December 1988 on CBS and featured all the regular cast (except [[Susan Olsen]], who was on her honeymoon at the time of filming; the role of Cindy was played by [[Jennifer Runyon]]), as well as three grandchildren, Peter's girlfriend, Valerie, and the spouses of Greg, Marcia, and Jan (Nora, Wally, and Phillip, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Owen|first=Rob |title=Gen X TV: "The Brady Bunch" to "Melrose Place"|year=1999|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=0-8156-0585-4|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nielsen ratings]] for ''A Very Brady Christmas'' were the highest of any television movie that season for CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newcomb|first=Horace |title=Encyclopedia of television: A-C, Volume 1|edition=2|year=2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1-57958-411-X|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Bradys''===
{{Main article|The Bradys}}
Due to the success of ''A Very Brady Christmas'', CBS asked ''Brady Bunch'' creator Sherwood Schwartz and his son Lloyd to create a new series for the network. According to Lloyd Schwartz,  his father and he initially balked at the idea because they felt a new series would harm the Brady franchise. They finally relented because CBS was "desperate for programming". A new series featuring the Brady clan was created entitled ''The Bradys''. All the original ''Brady Bunch'' cast members returned for the series, except for [[Maureen McCormick]] (Marcia), who was replaced with [[Leah Ayres]].

As with ''A Very Brady Christmas'', ''The Bradys'' also featured elements of comedy and drama and featured storylines that were of a more serious nature than that of the original series and its subsequent spin-offs. Lloyd Schwartz later said he compared ''The Bradys'' to another dramedy of the time, ''[[thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]''. The two-hour series premiere episode aired on February 9, 1990, at 9 pm on CBS and initially drew respectable ratings. Subsequent episodes were moved to 8 pm, where ratings quickly declined. Due to the decline, CBS cancelled the series after six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2010 p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Day by Day'': "A Very Brady Episode"===
The ''[[Day by Day (TV series)|Day by Day]]'' episode titled "A Very Brady Episode" (February 5, 1989), on NBC, reunited six of the original ''The Brady Bunch'' cast members: [[Robert Reed]], [[Florence Henderson]], [[Ann B. Davis]], [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]], [[Mike Lookinland]] and [[Maureen McCormick]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Day by Day Season 2 Episode 11 A Very Brady Episode|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/day-by-day/a-very-brady-episode-5078/|website=TV.com|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Day by Day Episode Guide 1989 Season 2 - A Very Brady Episode, Episode 11|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/day-by-day-1989/episode-11-season-2/a-very-brady-episode/200841|website=TVGuide.com|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Very Brady Renovation''===
In November 2018, it was announced that [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]], [[Mike Lookinland]], [[Maureen McCormick]], [[Susan Olsen]], [[Eve Plumb]], and [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] would be reuniting for the upcoming 2019 [[HGTV]] series ''[[A Very Brady Renovation]]'', which will follow a full overhaul of the house used in the sitcom’s exterior shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘The Brady Bunch’ Kids Reunite To Launch HGTV Series That Will Renovate Sitcom’s House|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/brady-bunch-reunites-to-launch-hgtv-series-that-will-reunion-hgtv-renovation-a-very-brady-reonvation-1202494148/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brady Bunch cast reunites at iconic house ahead of HGTV renovation series|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/the-brady-bunch-reunion-hgtv/|website=Ew.com|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptations==
Twenty years following the conclusion of the original series, a film adaptation, ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]],'' went into production and was released in 1995 from [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film is set in the present day (1990s) and the Bradys, still living their lives as if it were the 1970s, are unfamiliar with their surroundings. It stars [[Gary Cole]] and [[Shelley Long]] as Mike and Carol Brady, with [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] (Greg), [[Christine Taylor]] (Marcia), Paul Sutera (Peter), [[Jennifer Elise Cox]] (Jan),  [[Jesse Soffer|Jesse Lee]] (Bobby), [[Olivia Hack]] (Cindy),  [[Henriette Mantel]] (Alice), and cameo appearances from [[Ann B. Davis]] as a long-haul truck driver and [[Florence Henderson]] as Carol's mother.

A sequel, ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'', was released in 1996. The cast of the first film returned for the sequel. A second sequel, ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]],'' was made-for-television and aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 2002. [[Gary Cole]] and [[Shelley Long]] returned for the third film, while the Brady kids and Alice were recast.

==DVD releases==
[[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]] released all five seasons on DVD in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] from 2005 to 2006, before [[CBS Home Entertainment]] took over DVD rights to the [[Paramount Television]] library (though CBS DVD releases are still distributed by Paramount). Paramount/CBS has released the series on DVD in other countries as well.

On April 3, 2007, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment released the complete series [[box set]], which includes the TV movies ''A Very Brady Christmas'' and "The Brady 500" (an episode of ''The Bradys''), as well as two episodes of ''The Brady Kids'' animated series. The box art for this set features green [[Shag (fabric)|shag carpeting]] and 1970s-style wood paneling.

8 years later on April 7, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment re-released the complete series box set, a repackaged version at a lower price, but it does not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Brady-Bunch-The-Complete-Series/20655|title=Paramount to Re-Release a 20-DVD Set of 'The Complete Series'|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122222448/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Brady-Bunch-The-Complete-Series/20655|archivedate=January 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}
A '''warrior ''' is a person specializing in [[combat]] or [[war]]fare, especially within the context of a [[tribal society|tribal]] or [[clan]]-based warrior culture society that recognizes a separate warrior class or [[caste]].   

==History==
Warriors seem to have been present in the earliest pre-state societies. Along with hunting, war was considered to be a definitive male activity. No matter the pretext for combat, it seemed to have been a rite of passage for a boy to become a man. Warriors took upon costumes and equipment that seemed to have a symbolic significance; combat itself would be preceded by ritual or sacrifice. Men of fighting age often lived apart in order to encourage bonding, and would ritualise combat in order to demonstrate individual prowess among one another. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=R.G|title=Warrior: A Visual History of the Fighting Man|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-3203-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the basic weapons used by warriors appeared before the rise of most hierarchical systems. Bows and arrows, clubs, spears, and other edged weapons were in widespread use. However with the new findings of metallurgy, the aforementioned weapons had grown in effectiveness. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=R.G|title=Warrior: A Visual History of the Fighting Man|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-3203-8|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first hierarchical systems evolved 5000 years ago, the gap between the rulers and the ruled had increased. Making war to extend the outreach of their territories, rulers often forced men from lower orders of society into the military role. This had been the first use of professional soldiers —a distinct difference from the warrior communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=R.G|title=Warrior: A Visual History of the Fighting Man|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-3203-8|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The warrior ethic in many societies later became the preserve of the ruling class. Egyptian pharaohs would depict themselves in war chariots, shooting at enemies, or smashing others with clubs. Fighting was considered a prestigious activity, but only when associated with status and power. European mounted knights would often feel contempt for the foot soldiers recruited from lower classes. Even in meso American societies of pre-Columbian America, the elite aristocratic soldiers remained separated from the lower classes of stone-throwers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=R.G|title=Warrior: A Visual History of the Fighting Man|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-3203-8|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the belief of the caste and clan based warrior who saw war as a place to attain valor and glory, warfare was a practical matter that could change the course of history. History always showed that men of lower orders who, provided that they were practically organized and equipped, almost always outfought warrior elites through an individualistic and humble approach to war. This was the approach of the Roman legions who had only the incentive of promotion, as well as a strict level of discipline. When Europe's standing armies of the 17th and 18th centuries developed, discipline was at the core of their training. Officers had the role of transforming men that they viewed as lower class to become reliable fighting men. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=R.G|title=Warrior: A Visual History of the Fighting Man|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-3203-8|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the Ancient Greek ideals of the 'citizen soldier', many European societies during the Renaissance began to incorporate conscription and raise armies from the general populace. A change in attitude was noted as well, as officers were told to treat their soldiers with moderation and respect. For example, men who fought in the American Civil War often elected their own officers. With the mobilization of citizens in the armies sometimes reaching the millions, societies often made efforts in order to maintain or revive the warrior spirit. This trend continues to the modern day. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=R.G|title=Warrior: A Visual History of the Fighting Man|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-3203-8|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the heroic connotations of the term "warrior", this metaphor is especially popular in publications advocating or recruiting for a country's military.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Wong, Leonard]], "[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/599 Leave No Man Behind: Recovering America’s Fallen Warriors]." ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'', July 2005; vol. 31: pp. 599-622.; [[Bradley C.S. Watson]], "[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/1/55 The Western Ethical Tradition and the Morality of the Warrior]." ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'', October 1999; vol. 26: pp. 55-72; Samet, Elizabeth D., "[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/623 Leaving No Warriors Behind: The Ancient Roots of a Modern Sensibility]." ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'', July 2005; vol. 31: pp. 623-649; Miller, Laura L. and Charles Moskos, "[http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/4/615 Humanitarians or Warriors?: Race, Gender, and Combat Status in Operations Restore Hope]." ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'', July 1995; vol. 21: pp. 615-637&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women as warriors==
While the warrior class in tribal societies is typically all-male, there are some exceptions on record where women (typically unmarried, young women) formed part of the warrior class, particularly in pre-modern Japan.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

A purported group of fighting women is the legendary [[Amazons]], recorded in Classical Greek mythology.  Similarly, the Valkyries are depicted in Norse mythology, particularly the Icelandic Etta. During the [[Viking Age]] a type of female warrior was the ''skjaldmær'', or [[shieldmaiden]]. Hard historical evidence of non-mythological female warrior classes have been harder to come by, but some studies have been done (e.g. Birka warrior). However, groups of female warriors typically belong in [[folkelore]] and [[mythology]], rather than in reality where there were only exceptional cases of women engaging directly in combat roles.

A 2017 study led by Charlotte Hedenstierna-Jonson produced DNA results confirming the remains excavated in [[Birka|Birka, Sweden]], were a [[Birka female Viking warrior|female warrior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/09/2017/viking-warrior-from-birka-grave-confirmed-as-female|title=Viking warrior from Birka grave confirmed as female|last=|first=|date=8 September 2017|work=Archaeology News from Past Horizons|access-date=16 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908191627/http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/09/2017/viking-warrior-from-birka-grave-confirmed-as-female|archive-date=17 September 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, prominent historian and viking specialists, such as [[Judith Jesch]], have disputed the findings, calling their thinking "sloppy" and citing issues of academic validity, including referential errors, a lack of involvement from linguistics experts, and no physical evidence that the skeleton in question actually engaged in any battle.&lt;ref&gt;http://norseandviking.blogspot.com/2017/09/lets-debate-female-viking-warriors-yet.html?m=1&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, archaeologist Anna Kjellström, who worked with Hedenstierna-Jonson on the initial study, voiced her own doubts claiming it was clear the "material and the contextual information given... did not match the data".&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/have-we-finally-found-hard-evidence-for-viking-warrior-women/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women not only fought on the field{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} but led entire hosts of men within [[Picts|Pictish]], [[Ancient Britons|Brythonic]], and [[Ancient Ireland|Irish]] tribes in Pre-Christian culture. [[Boudicca]] of the [[Iceni]] is a famous example of a female leader of warriors, who [[Boudica#Boudica's uprising|rebelled]] against [[Roman Britain|Roman rule in Britain]]. [[Tomoe Gozen]] is celebrated in Japanese history as a woman samurai General in the 12th Century. [[Joan of Arc]], nicknamed "The Maid of Orléans" is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Lancastrian phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. These women survive in few historical testimonies like those of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

'''''Where the Wind Settles''''' is a 2015 Taiwanese historical period film directed by Wang Toon. Spanning the years from 1949 to 2010, the film chronicles the lives of several mainland Chinese people who resettled in Taiwan near the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]].

==Plot==
During the last phase of the [[Huaihai Campaign]] in 1949, injured [[Republic of China Army]] captain Sheng Peng ([[Tony Yang]]) and subordinate soldiers Huang Te-shun (Li Xiaochuan) and Fan Chung-yueh ([[George Hu]]) retreat when it becomes clear the battle is irretrievably lost. As they trek across the countryside in northern [[Jiangsu]], they encounter an abandoned boy named "Dog Two" (Zou Xuanqi), whom they carry along. They rejoin the nationalist troops and soon board a ship bound for [[Keelung]], Taiwan. On board they meet Chiu Hsiang ([[Bea Hayden]]) and her intellectual family.

In Taiwan, Sheng is discharged for his injury, while Huang and Fan desert the army to join him. The trio squeeze into a flat in a [[military dependents' village]] in [[Taipei]], but [[Republic of China Military Police|military police]] soon arrive in the village to catch deserters like Huang and Fan, who face possible execution. Their crisis is solved when Sheng bribes government clerks to acquire [[National Identification Card (Republic of China)|National ID Cards]]. They begin to work, and the boy—now named Feng-hsien—starts school. Sheng re-encounters Chiu Hsiang, who offers to teach Feng-hsien piano lessons at her residence. Through the lessons, Sheng and Chiu Hsiang grow closer, as do Feng-hsien and Chiu Hsiang's baby sister Chiu Mei. 

Both Huang and Fan fancy Lin Ah-yu ([[Ko Chia-yen]]), a Taiwanese woman who barely speaks [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. Despite their language barrier, Huang and Lin fall in love and get married. Fan, very unhappy, moves out to live in the mountains in the south. Years later, Huang dies in a fire trying to save a child and Fan comes back to mourn him.

Sheng, having left his wife in mainland China for more than a decade, is by now secretly in love with Chiu Hsiang. Chiu Hsiang tells Sheng she will go to the United States to marry Chang Ming-jui, an old acquaintance. They exchange gifts, and when they sit down to talk on another ocacsion, Chiu Hsiang confesses her love for him. Their new-found happiness is abruptly terminated when Chiu's professor father is taken away by secret police for alleged dissidence. As Chang Ming-jui has many "[[guanxi|connections]]" who may secure her father's safety, Chiu Hsiang has no choice but to leave Sheng.

Sheng is heartbroken, and it hasn't escaped Lin Ah-yu's attention. Already widowed for a few years but still sharing the same hut (but not the same room) as he, Lin secretly loves Sheng. But when she confesses her love, he rejects her. She moves out the next day.

In the 1970s, Feng-hsien ([[Mason Lee]]) and Chiu Mei ([[Amber Kuo]]) resume their friendship which soon blossoms into love. Sheng Peng meets Lin by accident, and invites her to Feng-hsien and Chiu Mei's wedding. During the wedding she also meets Chiu Hsiang who now lives in the United States. Sheng Peng dies of a heart attack in 1987, the same year Taiwan ends its [[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]] (and lifts the travel ban to mainland China). In 2010, Sheng Feng-hsien (Tao Chuan-cheng), already an old man, travels to Sheng Peng's hometown in [[Shandong]] to meet with Sheng Peng's brother-in-law (Fan Kuang-yao). He learns that Sheng Peng's wife Ma Chiao-lin (Jiang Ruijia) and baby died within a year after Sheng Peng went to Taiwan.
