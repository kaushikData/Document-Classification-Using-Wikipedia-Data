'''Adhyatma Niketan''' ([[Hindi]]: अध्यात्म निकेतन) is an ''[[ashram]]'' in [[Gwalior]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. It is situated on Koteshwar Road, Near Vinay Nagar sector-1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adhyatmaniketan.com/contact.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107105333/http://adhyatmaniketan.com/contact.htm |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is around 7&amp;nbsp;km from the Gwalior Railway station.

The land was purchased by [[Huzur Malik Saheb]] Sant Yogi ManSingh ji in 1961 for the sum of Rs. 12,000 /- in order to establish an [[ashram]]. When [[Swami Vishnu Tirth]] Ji Maharaj visited Gwalior on 11 April 1961, the place was inaugurated and named 'Adhyatma Niketan'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adhyatmaniketan.com/ashram.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107105337/http://adhyatmaniketan.com/ashram.htm |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is spread over {{convert|2.5|acre|m2}} of land at the foot-hill of [[Gwalior Fort]]. The rear part of Adhyatma Niketan is used as a residence by [[Sant Kripal Singh]] Ji Maharaj,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shivomworld.com/lineage/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050119220840/http://www.shivomworld.com/lineage/ |archive-date=19 January 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his family members and the front part is donated to the trust called 'Adhyatmic Shikshan and Sadhana Kendra'.

The Ashram has one big and spacious auditorium which is used for satsang, spiritual discourses, bhajan, [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] awakening and [[shaktipat]] initiation &lt;ref&gt;http://adhyatmajyoti.org/present_ashrams.html&lt;/ref&gt;  etc., especially on the occasions of the Ashram's various festivals, when a large number of devotees gather there. On the eastern side lies the samadhin of Huzur Malik Saheb. The samadhi has sufficient space inside to accommodate around 200-250 devotees at a time for worship and meditation. Various kinds of stones including white marble have been used.

==Satsang at Adhyatma Niketan==

[[Satsang]] at Adhyatma Niketan has assumed the greatest significance. It is understood that the disciple or [[sadhaka]] gains maximum spiritual benefit through satsang with the least effort.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beezone.com/DevatmaShakti/IntroIndex.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexius Meinong Ritter&lt;ref&gt;{{German title|Ritter}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Handschuchsheim''' (17 July 1853&amp;nbsp;– 27 November 1920) was an [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]], a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] known for his unique [[ontology]]. He also made contributions to philosophy of mind and theory of value.
{{toclimit|3}}

==Life==
Alexius Meinong's father was the Austrian officer Anton von Meinong (1799–1870), who was granted the hereditary title of [[Ritter]] in 1851 and reached the rank of [[Major General]] in 1858 before retiring in 1859.

Alexius Meinong studied at the [[Akademisches Gymnasium]], [[Vienna]] and later the [[University of Vienna]], where he read [[history]] and philosophy as a pupil of [[Franz Brentano]]. He was professor and Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Graz]], where he founded the Graz psychological institute (in 1894) and the [[Graz School]] of experimental psychology. Meinong supervised the promotions of [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (founder of [[Gestalt psychology|''Gestalt'' psychology]]) and [[Adalbert Meingast]], as well as the habilitation of [[Alois Höfler]] and [[Anton Oelzelt-Newin]].

==Work==

===Ontology===
Meinong wrote two early essays on [[David Hume]], the first dealing with his theory of abstraction, the second with his theory of relations, and was relatively strongly influenced by [[Empiricism#British empiricism|British empiricism]]. He is most noted, however, for his Theory of Objects (''Über Gegenstandstheorie'', 1904), which grew out of his work on intentionality and his belief in the possibility of [[intentionality|intending]] [[nonexistent]] objects. The theory is based around the purported empirical observation that it is possible to think about something, such as a golden mountain, even though that object does not exist. Since we can refer to such things, they must have some sort of being.  Meinong thus distinguishes the "being" of a thing, in virtue of which it may be an object of thought, from a thing's "existence", which is the substantive ontological status ascribed to — for example — horses but not to unicorns.  Meinong called such nonexistent objects "homeless";&lt;ref&gt;In Über die Stellung der Gegenstadntheorie im System der Wissenschaften.&lt;/ref&gt; others have nicknamed their place of residence "[[Meinong's jungle]]" because of their great number and exotic nature.

Historically, Meinong has been treated, especially by [[Gilbert Ryle]],&lt;ref&gt;See Ryle's "Intentionality-Theory and the Nature of Thinking". ''Revue Internationale de Philosophie'' (Meinong issue) 104-105 (1973).  Ryle here compliments Meinong in two ways, the first rather backhanded: for showing us what not to do in theorizing about intentional content. But the other compliment is genuine and echoes Russell's admiration for Meinong's acute observation in pinpointing problems, his habit of tenaciously inferring consequences, and his nose for fine distinctions.&lt;/ref&gt; as an eccentric whose theory of objects was allegedly dealt a severe blow in [[Bertrand Russell]]'s essay "On Denoting".  However, Russell himself thought highly of the vast majority of Meinong's work and, until formulating his [[theory of descriptions]], held similar views about non-existent objects.&lt;ref&gt;See Russell's article, "Meinong's Theory of Complexes and Assumptions", reprinted in his collection, ''Essays in Analysis'', ed. Douglas Lackey (New York: George Braziller, 1973) This anthology contains five pieces dealing with Meinong's work, three of them reviews in which Russell expresses a good deal of admiration, in spite of significant misgivings about Meinong's ontology.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, recent Meinongians such as [[Terence Parsons]] and [[Roderick Chisholm]] have established the consistency of a Meinongian theory of objects, while others (e.g., [[Karel Lambert]]) have defended the uselessness of such a theory.&lt;ref&gt;Sierszulska, A., ''Meinong on Meaning and Truth: A Theory of Knowledge'' ([[Heusenstamm]]: [[:de:Ontos Verlag|Ontos Verlag, 2005]]), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=bRCQVbOCqHMC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 159-160].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meinong is also seen to be controversial in the field of [[philosophy of language]] for holding the view that "[[existence]]" is merely a property of an object, just as color or mass might be a property. Closer readers of his work, however, accept that Meinong held the view that objects are "indifferent to being"&lt;ref name="Meinong, A. 1960 Page 86"&gt;Meinong, A. “The Theory of Objects” in ''Realism and the Background of Phenomenology'', ed. Roderick Chisholm (Glencoe, Ill: Free Press, 1960). 86&lt;/ref&gt; and that they stand "beyond being and non-being".&lt;ref name="Meinong, A. 1960 Page 86"/&gt; On this view Meinong is expressly denying that existence is a property of an object. For Meinong, what an object is, its real essence, depends on the properties of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, J.N. “Meinong’s Theory of Objects.” Oxford University Press. (1933) Page 49&lt;/ref&gt; These properties are genuinely possessed whether the object exists or not, and so existence cannot be a mere property of an object.{{synthesis inline|date=June 2015}}

===Types of objects===
Meinong holds that objects can be divided into three categories on the basis of their ontological status. Objects may have one of the following three modalities of being and non-being:
* Existence (''Existenz'', verb: ''existieren''), or actual reality (''Wirklichkeit''), which denotes the material and temporal being of an object
* Subsistence (''Bestand'', verb: ''bestehen''), which denotes the being of an object in a non-temporal sense.
* Absistence or Being-given (''Gegebenheit'', as in the German use ''es gibt'', i.e. "there are", "it is given"), which denotes being an object but not having being.

Certain objects can exist (mountains, birds, etc.); others cannot in principle ever exist, such as the objects of mathematics (numbers, theorems, etc.): such objects simply subsist. Finally, a third class of objects cannot even subsist, such as impossible objects (e.g. square circle, wooden iron, etc.). Being-given is not a minimal mode of being, because it is not a mode of being at all. Rather, to be "given" is just to be an object. Being-given, termed "absistence" by [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J.N. Findlay]], is better thought of as a mode of non-being than as a mode of being.&lt;ref&gt;Though Meinong speaks of it loosely as a "third order of being" in his "The Theory of Objects" in ''Realism and the Background of Phenomenology'',  ed. Roderick Chisholm, (Glencoe, Ill: Free Press, 1960) 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Absistence, unlike existence and subsistence, does not have a negation; everything absists. (Note that all objects absist, while some subset of these subsist, of which a yet-smaller subset exist.) The result that everything absists allows Meinong to deal with our ability to affirm the non-being (''Nichtsein'') of an object. Its absistence is evidenced by our act of intending it, which is logically prior to our denying that it has being.&lt;ref&gt;A version of the argument is given in "The Theory of Objects", "Realism and the Background of Phenomenology",  ed. Roderick Chisholm, (Glencoe, Ill: Free Press, 1960) 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object and subject===
Meinong distinguishes four classes of "objects":
* "''Object''" (''Objekt''), which can be real (like horses) or ideal (like the concepts of difference, identity, etc.)
* "''Objective''" (''Objectiv''), e.g. the affirmation of the being (''Sein'') or non-being (''Nichtsein''), of a being-such (''Sosein''), or a being-with  (''Mitsein'') - parallel to existential, categorical and hypothetical judgements. Objectives are close to what contemporary philosophers call states of affairs (where these may be actual—may "obtain"—or not).
* "''Dignitative''", e.g. the true, the good, the beautiful
* "''Desiderative''", e.g. duties, ends, etc.

To these four classes of objects correspond four classes of psychological acts:
* (re)presentation (''das Vorstellen''), for objects
* thought (''das Denken''), for the objectives
* feeling (''das Fühlen''), for dignitatives
* desire (''das Begehren''), for the desideratives.

The '''argument from religious experience''' is an argument for the [[existence of God]]&lt;!--[Why only materialism?:], as against [[materialism]]--&gt;. It holds that the best explanation for [[religious experiences]] is that they constitute genuine experience or perception of a divine reality. Various reasons have been offered for and against accepting this contention.

Contemporary defenders of the argument are [[Alister Hardy]] and [[Dinesh D'Souza]].

== Outline ==

In essence, the argument's structure is as follows:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
# There are compelling reasons for believing that claims of [[religious experience]] point to and validate [[Supernatural|spiritual realities]] that exist in a way that [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] material manifestation;
# According to [[materialism]], nothing exists in a way that transcends material manifestation;
# According to [[classical theism]]&lt;!-- (and many theistic faiths)--&gt;, God endows human beings with the ability to perceive –&amp;nbsp;although imperfectly&amp;nbsp;– religious, spiritual and/or transcendent realities through religious, spiritual and/or transcendent experience.
# To the extent that premise 1. is accepted, therefore, [[theism]] is more plausible than materialism.

As statements 2 to 4 are generally treated as uncontroversial,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} discussion has tended to focus on the status of the first.

===Suggested reasons for accepting the premise===
Some principal arguments that have been made in favor of the premise include:
*Very substantial numbers of ordinary people report having had such experiences, though this isn't to say that religious believers aren't ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne ''Belief in God in an Age of Science' "the surveys conducted by the distinguished biologist [[Alister Hardy]]"Swinburne references David Hay ''Religious Experience Today'' (1990) chapters 5, 6 and Appendix&lt;/ref&gt; Such experiences are reported in almost all known cultures.
*These experiences often have very significant effects on people's lives, frequently inducing in them acts of extreme self-sacrifice well beyond what could be expected from evolutionary arguments.
*These experiences often seem very real to the people involved, and are quite often reported as being shared by a number of people.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [[New Testament]] speaks of Jesus, after his resurrection, appearing to 10 or more people at once (see e.g. 1 Corinthians 15:6, Luke 24, Mt 28, Jn 16, Acts 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Although mass delusions are not inconceivable, one needs compelling reasons for invoking this as an explanation.
*[[Richard Swinburne|Swinburne]] suggests that, as two basic principles of rationality, we ought to believe that things are as they seem unless and until we have evidence that they are mistaken (principle of credulity), and that those who do not have an experience of a certain type ought to believe others who say that they do in the absence of evidence of deceit or delusion (principle of testimony) and thus, although if you have a ''strong'' reason to disbelieve in the existence of God you will discount these experiences, in other cases such evidence should count towards the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, ''Is there a God?'' p 133–136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested reasons for disputing the premise===
On the other hand, the following reasons have been offered for rejecting the premise:
* These might be mis-firings of evolved mechanisms selected for very different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;This is broadly Dawkins' line in [[The God Delusion]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Religious texts such as the Bible that speak of revelations are of disputable historical accuracy.&lt;ref name="Facts"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Cliff |title=Is The Bible Historically Accurate? |publisher=Positive Atheism |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/mail/eml9823.htm |accessdate=11 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613135307/http://positiveatheism.org/mail/eml9823.htm |archivedate=13 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is conceivable that some claimed religious experiences are lies, possibly done for attention or acceptance.&lt;ref name="Facts"/&gt;
* [[Argument from inconsistent revelations]]: Different people have had, or believed to have had, religious experiences pointing to the existence of different religions. Not all of these can be correct.  Kraemer highlighted a link between arguments of religious experience and self-righteousness (perception of superiority over those who do not receive providence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World|first=Hendrik|last=Kraemer|year=2009|publisher=Centre for Contemporary Christianity|isbn=8190869108|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It has been argued that religious experiences are little more than hallucinations aimed at fulfilling basic psychological desires of immortality, purpose, etc. [[Sigmund Freud]], for example, considered God to be simply a psychological "illusion"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''The Future of an Illusion'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0-393-00831-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the mind, instead of an actual existing entity. This argument can be based upon the fact that since we know about some believers for whom this argument is correct (their reports for religious experiences are nothing more than illusions), we assume that perhaps all such reports may be illusions.

== Alternate formulations ==

American analytic philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Alston]] developed arguments for accepting knowledge gained from religious experience based on drawing analogies with knowledge gained from [[sense experience]].&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Webb|first=Mark|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-link=Edward Zalta|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Religious experience|year=2017|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religious-experience/|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases they apply their arguments to Christian religious experiences, but accept that they may equally apply to other religious experiences.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

Plantinga argues that just as the knowledge gained from sense experience is regarded as [[Basic belief|properly basic]] despite being unsupported based on [[foundationalism]] in the mould of [[Descartes]], religious experiences should be accepted as providing properly basic knowledge of God.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

Alston argues that if sets of practices used to form beliefs produce conclusions that are coherent over time both internally and with other belief-forming practices, they should be accepted. He argues this is the only way our ordinary beliefs are justified, and that by the same criteria belief based on Christian religious experience is justified.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

'''Baltasar Gracián y Morales''', [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] ({{IPA-es|baltaˈsaɾ ɣɾaˈθjan}}; 8 January 1601{{snd}}6 December 1658), better known as '''Baltasar Gracián''', was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Jesuit]] and [[Spanish Baroque literature|baroque]] prose writer and [[philosopher]]. He was born in [[Belmonte de Gracián|Belmonte]], near [[Calatayud]] ([[Aragon]]). His writings were lauded by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].

==Biography==
The son of a doctor, in his childhood Gracián lived with his uncle, who was a [[priest]]. He studied at a Jesuit school in 1621 and 1623 and [[theology]] in Zaragoza.  He was ordained in 1627 and took his final vows in 1635.

He assumed the vows of the [[Jesuits]] in 1633 and dedicated himself to teaching in various Jesuit schools. He spent time in [[Huesca]], where he befriended the local scholar [[Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa]], who helped him achieve an important milestone in his intellectual upbringing. He acquired fame as a preacher, although some of his oratorical displays, such as reading a letter sent from Hell from the pulpit, were frowned upon by his superiors. He was named Rector of the Jesuit College of [[Tarragona]] and wrote works proposing models for courtly conduct such as ''El héroe'' (''The Hero''), ''El político'' (''The Politician''), and ''El discreto'' (''The Discreet One''). During the Spanish war with [[Catalonia]] and France, he was chaplain of the army that liberated [[Lleida]] in 1646.

In 1651, he published the first part of the ''Criticón'' (''Faultfinder'') without the permission of his superiors, whom he disobeyed repeatedly. This attracted the Society's displeasure. Ignoring the reprimands, he published the second part of ''Criticón'' in 1657, as a result was sanctioned and exiled to [[Graus]] at the beginning of 1658. Soon Gracian wrote to apply for membership in another religious order. His demand was not met, but his sanction was eased off: in April 1658 he was sent to several minor positions under the College of [[Tarazona]]. His physical decline prevented him from attending the provincial congregation of Calatayud and on 6 December 1658 Gracian died in Tarazona, near Zaragoza in the Kingdom of [[Aragon]].

Gracián is the most representative writer of the Spanish [[Baroque]] literary style known as ''[[Conceptismo]]'' (Conceptism), of which he was the most important theoretician; his ''Agudeza y arte de ingenio'' (''Wit and the Art of Inventiveness'') is at once a [[poetics|poetic]], a [[rhetoric]] and an [[anthology]] of the conceptist style.

The Aragonese village where he was born, Belmonte de Calatayud, changed its name to Belmonte de Gracián in his honour.

==''Criticón''==
[[File:El Criticon 1651.jpg|thumb|''Criticón'', first edition (1651).]]
The three parts of the ''Criticón'', published in 1651, 1653, and 1657, achieved fame in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries. It is, without a doubt, the author's masterpiece and one of the great works of the [[Siglo de Oro]]. It is a lengthy allegorical novel with philosophical overtones. It recalls the [[Byzantine novel|Byzantine style of novel]] in its many vicissitudes and in the numerous adventures to which the characters are subjected, as well as the [[picaresque novel]] in its satirical take on society, as evidenced in the long pilgrimage undertaken by the main characters, Critilo, the "critical man" who personifies disillusionment, and Andrenio, the "natural man" who represents innocence and primitive impulses. The author constantly exhibits a perspectivist technique that unfolds according to the criteria or points of view of both characters, but in an antithetical rather than plural way as in [[Miguel de Cervantes]]. The novel reveals a philosophy, [[pessimism]], with which one of its greatest readers and admirers, the 19th century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], identified.

The following is a summary of the ''Criticón'', reduced almost to the point of a sketch, of a complex work that demands detailed study.

Critilo, man of the world, is shipwrecked on the coast of the island of Santa Elena, where he meets Andrenio, the natural man, who has grown up completely ignorant  of civilization. Together they undertake a long voyage to the Isle of Immortality, travelling the long and prickly road of life. In the first part, "En la primavera de la niñez" ("In the Spring of Childhood"), they join the royal court, where they suffer all manner of disappointments; in the second part, "En el otoño de la varonil edad" ("In the Autumn of the Age of Manliness"), they pass through [[Aragon]], where they visit the house of Salastano (an [[anagram]] of the name of Gracián's friend Lastanosa), and travel to France, which the author calls the "wasteland of Hipocrinda", populated entirely by hypocrites and dunces, ending with a visit to a house of lunatics. In the third part, "En el invierno de la vejez" ("In the Winter of Old Age"), they arrive in Rome, where they encounter an academy where they meet the most inventive of men, arriving finally at the Isle of Immortality. He is intelligent and contributed greatly to the world. One of his most famous phrases is "Respect yourself if you would have others respect you."

==''The Art of Worldly Wisdom''==
{{wikiquote|Oráculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia}}
Gracián's style, generically called [[conceptism]], is characterized by [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] and the concentration of a maximum of significance in a minimum of form, an approach referred to in Spanish as ''agudeza'' (wit), and which is brought to its extreme in the ''[[Oráculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia]]'' (literally ''Manual Oracle and Art of Discretion'', commonly translated as ''The Art of Worldly Wisdom''), which is almost entirely composed of three hundred maxims with commentary. He constantly plays with words: each phrase becomes a puzzle, using the most diverse rhetorical devices.

Its appeal has endured:  in 1992, Christopher Maurer's translation of this book remained 18 weeks (2 weeks in first place) in the [[Washington Post]]'s list of Nonfiction General Best Sellers. It has  sold nearly 200,000 copies.

==Critical reception==
The [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] wrote of Gracián that "He has been excessively praised by [[Schopenhauer]], whose appreciation of the author induced him to translate the ''Oráculo manual'', and he has been unduly depreciated by [[George Ticknor|Ticknor]] and others. He is an acute thinker and observer, misled by his systematic misanthropy and by his fantastic literary theories".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=326}}

[[Nietzsche]] wrote of the ''Oráculo'', "Europe has never produced anything finer or more complicated in matters of moral subtlety," and Schopenhauer, who translated it into German, considered the book "Absolutely unique... a book made for constant use...a companion for life" for "those who wish to prosper in the great world." A translation of the ''Oráculo manual'' from the Spanish by Joseph Jacobs (London: Macmillan and Co., Limited), first published in 1892, was a huge commercial success, with many reprintings over the years (most recently by Shambala).  Jacobs’ translation is alleged to have been read by [[Winston Churchill]], seven years later, on the ship taking him to the Boer Wars.

In Paris, in 1924, a revision and reprint of the translation into French by Abraham-Nicolas Amelot de La Houssaie, with a preface by [[André Rouveyre]], attracted a wide readership there, and was admired by [[André Gide]]. A new translation by Christopher Maurer (New York: Doubleday) became a national bestseller in the U.S. in 1992 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385421311], and the English edition, which sold almost 200,000 copies, was translated into Finnish, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and many other languages.

[[File:Goryeo-Kshitigarbha (Chijang)-late.14c.jpg|right|thumb|14th century [[Goryeo]] painting of [[Ksitigarbha]] holding a ''cintamani'']]
'''Cintāmaṇi''' (Sanskrit; Devanagari: चिन्तामणि), also spelled as '''Chintamani''' (or the ''Chintamani Stone''), is a [[wish]]-fulfilling [[Gemstone|jewel]] within both [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] traditions, said by some to be the equivalent of the [[philosopher's stone]] in Western alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;[[René Guénon|Guénon, René]] (2004) [1962]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qEQQht2Y2CQC Symbols of Sacred Science]''. Sophia Perennis, USA. {{ISBN|0-900588-78-0}}. p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several [[Mani Jewel]] images found in Buddhist scripture.

In Buddhism it is held by the [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattvas]] (divine beings with great compassion, wisdom and power) [[Avalokiteshvara]] and [[Ksitigarbha]]. It is also seen carried upon the back of the [[Wind horse|Lung Ta]] (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan [[Prayer flag#Symbols and prayers|prayer flags]]. By reciting the [[Dharani]] (small hymn) of Cintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddha, able to understand the truth of the Buddha, and turn afflictions into [[Bodhi]]. It is said to allow one to see the Holy [[Retinue]] of [[Amitabha]] and assembly upon one's deathbed.  In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several of different forms of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Donkin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=leHFqMQ9mw8C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Cintamani&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0XxtTKCgHcaqlAephvX6DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cintamani&amp;f=false ''Beyond price: pearls and pearl-fishing : origins to the Age of Discoveries''], American Philosophical Society, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-87169-224-5}}. p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Hinduism it is connected with the gods, [[Vishnu]] and [[Ganesha]]. In Hindu tradition it is often depicted as a fabulous jewel in the possession of the [[Nāga|Naga]] king or as on the forehead of the [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'', originally written in the 10th century AD, contains a story about the cintamani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concise Yoga Vāsiṣṭha |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |first=Swami |last=Venkatesananda |authorlink=Swami Venkatesananda |year=1984 |isbn=0-87395-955-8 |oclc=11044869 |pages=346–353 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FFdOj2dv8cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hindu Vishnu Purana speaks of the "[[Syamantaka|Syamanta jewel]], bestowing prosperity upon its owner, ecapsulates the Yadu clan system".&lt;ref&gt;The Past before us: Historical traditions of early North India, Romila Thapar, Harvard, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Vishnu Purana is attributed to the mid-first millennium AD. It draws on earlier religion or folklore.

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
*'''Cintāmaṇi''' (Sanskrit; Devanagari: चिन्तामणि): 'Wish-Fulfilling Gem' ({{bo|t=ཡིད་བཞིན་ནོར་བུ|w=yid bzhin norbu}})&lt;ref&gt;Scheidegger, Daniel (2009). 'The First Four Themes of Klong chen pa's ''Tsig don bcu gcig pa''.' Achard, Jean-Luke (director) (2009). [http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ret/pdf/ret_16.pdf ''Revue d'Etudes Tibetaines'']. April 2009. p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''mani'' (jewel) is translated in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''ruyi'' or ''ruyizhu'' 如意珠 "as-one-wishes jewel" or ''ruyibaozhu'' 如意寶珠 "as-one-wishes precious jewel". ''Ruyibaozhu'' is pronounced in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''nyoi-hōju'' or ''nyoi-hōshu'' 如意宝珠. ''Ruyizhu'' is pronounced in [[Korean language|Korean]] ''yeouiju'' 여의주.

==History==
[[File:ManiStone.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mani stone]]]]
In Buddhism the Chintamani is said to be one of four [[relic]]s that came in a chest that fell from the sky (many [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]] fell from the sky in caskets) during the reign of king Lha [[Thothori Nyantsen]] of Tibet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Though the king did not understand the purpose of the objects, he kept them in a position of reverence. Several years later, two mysterious strangers appeared at the court of the king, explaining the four relics, which included the Buddha's bowl (possibly a [[Singing Bowl]]) and a [[mani stone]] with the [[Om Mani Padme Hum]] [[mantra]] inscribed on it. These few objects were the bringers of the [[Dharma]] to [[Tibet]].

The [[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'s ''ruyizhu'' entry says:&lt;blockquote&gt;A ''{{IAST|maṇi}}''-jewel; magical jewel, which manifests whatever one wishes for (Skt. ''{{IAST|maṇi}}'', ''{{IAST|cintā-maṇi}}'', ''{{IAST|cintāmaṇi-ratna}}''). According to one's desires, treasures, clothing and food can be manifested, while sickness and suffering can be removed, water can be purified, etc. It is a metaphor for the teachings and virtues of the Buddha. ... Said to be obtained from the dragon-king of the sea, or the head of the great fish, [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]], or the relics of a Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhism-dict.net/ddb/ "ruyizhu", in Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Kintamani, Bali|Kintamani]] mountainous region in [[Bali]] was named after the Cintamani.

{{Confucianism}}
The '''Confucian church''' ({{zh|p=Kǒng jiàohuì|c=孔教会}} or {{zh|p=Rú jiàohuì|儒教会}}) is a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] religious and social institution of the [[local church|congregational]] type.  It was first proposed by [[Kang Youwei]] (1858–1927) in the last years of the 19th century, as a [[state religion]] of [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] on the model of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Ya-pei Kuo, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Confucian church" model was later continued amongst [[overseas Chinese]] communities,&lt;ref name="Yong Chen, 2012. p. 174"&gt;Yong Chen, 2012. p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; who established independent Confucian churches active on the local level, especially in [[Indonesia]] and the [[United States]].

In contemporary China, since 2000, there has been a [[New Confucianism|revival of Confucianism]] with the proliferation of Confucian academies ({{zh|p=[[Academies (Shuyuan)|shūyuàn]]|c=书院}}), the opening and reopening of [[temple of Confucius|temples of Confucius]], the new phenomenon of [[grassroots]] Confucian communities or congregations ({{zh|c=社区儒学|p=shèqū rúxué}}) and renewed talks about a national "Confucian church".&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; A national [[Holy Confucian Church]] ({{zh|c=孔圣会|p=Kǒngshènghuì}}) was established with the participation of many Confucian leaders on November 1, 2015; the current spiritual leader is [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]].

==Kang Youwei's national Confucian Church==
The idea of a "Confucian Church" as the [[state religion]] of [[China]] was proposed in detail by Kang Youwei as part of an early [[New Confucianism|New Confucian]] search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism, at a time when it was de-institutionalised with the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the Chinese empire.&lt;ref name="Yong Chen, 2012. p. 174"/&gt;  Kang modeled his ideal "Confucian Church" after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchical and centralised institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches, Sunday prayers and choirs, missions, journals, and even baptism sometimes, devoted to the worship and the spread of the teachings of [[Confucius]].&lt;ref name="Yong Chen, 2012. p. 174"/&gt;{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=95}}

The large community of Confucian literati who were left bereft of a ritual and organisational outlet for their values and identity after the dissolution of state Confucianism, supported such projects.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=95}} Similar models were also followed by various newly created Confucian [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]], such as the Xixinshe, the Daode Xueshe, and the Wanguo Daodehui.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=95}}

The Confucian Church was founded by a disciple of Kang, Chen Huanzhang, in 1912, and within a few years it established 132 branches countrywise.&lt;ref name="Billioud, 2010. p. 207"&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; From 1913 to 1916, an important debate took place whether Confucianism should become the state religion (''guo jiao'') and as such inscribed in the constitution of China.&lt;ref name="Billioud, 2010. p. 207"/&gt; This finally didn't occur, and anti-religious campaigns mounting in the 1920s led to a dissolution of the Confucian church.&lt;ref name="Billioud, 2010. p. 207"/&gt;

==Modern churches and congregations==
While Kang's idea was not realised in China, it was carried forward in [[Hong Kong]] and amongst [[overseas Chinese]] peoples.&lt;ref name="Yong Chen, 2012. p. 174"/&gt;  The Hong Kong branch of Kang's movement took the name of "[[Confucian Academy]]" ({{zh|孔教学院}}), while the [[Indonesia]]n branch became the [[Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia]].  Members believe in ''[[Tian]]'' with Confucius as the prophet ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''nabi'').&lt;ref name="Yong Chen, 2012. p. 175"/&gt;  Chinese people in the [[United States]] established independent, local Confucian churches such as the Confucius Church of Sacramento or the Confucius Church of Salinas.

In contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into different, yet interwoven, directions: the proliferation of Confucian academies,&lt;ref name="Yong Chen, 2012. p. 175"/&gt; the resurgence of Confucian rites,&lt;ref name="Yong Chen, 2012. p. 175"&gt;Yong Chen, 2012. p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities. Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of [[Chinese lineage associations]] and their [[ancestral shrine]]s, as well as cults and temples of natural and national gods within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the revival of Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen. 2015. (a). p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of revival are folk religious&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Chinese salvationist religions|salvationist religious]]&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; groups with a Confucian focus or Confucian churches, for example the ''Yidan xuetang'' (一耽学堂) based in [[Beijing]],&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mengmutang'' (孟母堂) of [[Shanghai]],&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 29"&gt;Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition]] or Phoenix Churches,&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 34"&gt;Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; the Confucian Fellowship (儒教道坛 ''Rújiào Dàotán'') in northern [[Fujian]] which has spread rapidly over the years after its foundation,&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 34"/&gt; and ancestral shrines of the Kong family operating as well as Confucian-teaching churches.&lt;ref name="Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 29"/&gt;

Also, the Hong Kong [[Confucian Academy]] has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, Confucian hospitals, restoration of temples and sponsorship of other activities.{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=148}} In 2009 Zhou Beichen founded another institution that inherits the idea of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, the Holy Hall of Confucius (孔圣堂 ''Kǒngshèngtáng'') in [[Shenzhen]] affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of [[Qufu]],{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=152-156}} the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 by the [[Holy Confucian Church]] (孔圣会 ''Kǒngshènghuì'').

Chinese folk religion's temples and kinship ancestral shrines on special occasion may choose Confucian liturgy (that is called 儒 ''rú'', or sometimes 正统 ''zhèngtǒng'', meaning "[[orthoprax]] ritual style") led by Confucian ritual masters (礼生 ''lǐshēng'') to worship the gods enshrined, instead of Taoist or popular ritual.&lt;ref name="Clart, 2003. pp. 3-5"&gt;Clart, 2003. pp. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; "Confucian businessmen" (''rushang'', also "learned businessman"), is a recently recovered term to identify people of the entrepreneurial or economic elite who recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business.&lt;ref&gt;Billioud, 2010. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary [[New Confucianism|New Confucian]] scholars Jiang Qing&lt;ref name="Yong Chen, 2012. p. 175"/&gt; and Kang Xiaoguang are amongst the most influential supporters of institutionalising the Confucian revival as a national "Confucian Church".&lt;ref&gt;Angle, 2012. § ''Ritual, Education, and the State''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jiang Qing is the current spiritual leader of the Holy Confucian Church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15344">'''[[Edward Said]]''' (1 November 1935 – 25 September 2003) was a literary theorist, cultural critic, and political activist for Palestine. He was University Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and edited several academic books. A founding figure in [[postcolonialism]], he wrote dozens of books, lectures, and essays. Anthologies of his essays have been published, and several of his interviews and conversations have also been edited into book form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">The term "'''epistemic feedback'''" is a form of [[feedback]] which refers to an interplay between what is being observed (or measured) and the result of the observation.&lt;ref&gt;
   ''Physics and philosophy: selected essays'', Henry Margenau,
   1978, 404 pages, p.287, webpage:
   [https://books.google.com/books?id=qACjM08hNfQC&amp;pg=PA287 BG287]:
   states, "involves an interplay between what is being
   measured and the result of the measurement".
&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept can apply to a process to obtain information, where the process, itself, changes the information when being obtained. For example, instead of quietly asking customers for their opinions about food in a restaurant, making an announcement about food quality, as being tested in a survey, could cause cooks to focus on having high-quality results. The concept can also apply to changing the method of observation, rather than affecting the data. For example, if after asking several customers about food, they noted the food as generally good or fair, then the questions might be changed to ask, more specifically, which food items were most/least liked. Hence, the interplay can alter either the observations, or the method of observation, or both.

== Viewing negative or positive effects ==
The effects of epistemic feedback can be viewed as either negative or positive, depending on the goal of the observations. When trying to get a secret survey of results, then epistemic feedback can be seen as a negative factor which distorts the original data. However, if the goal is to improve quality, then epistemic feedback could be a positive factor to periodically report areas which need improvement. The risk comes when the feedback temporarily slants the evaluation of quality, so that long-term performance is hindered by current distortion in the way results were measured.

== Methods to compensate for feedback ==
Some methods to compensate for epistemic feedback are to use a "[[double-blind study]]" or to conduct secret surveys to quietly check the results. Also, "[[controlled experiment]]s" can be used, where the outcome is adjusted for the [[placebo effect]] of reactions to unchanged parameters. Additionally, [[longitudinal studies]], re-assessing the results over a long period of time, can reduce the impact of short-term feedback on the observed results.

'''Ferdinand de Saussure''' ({{IPAc-en|s|oʊ|ˈ|sj|ʊər}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|Saussure, Ferdinand de}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|fɛʁdinɑ̃ də sosyʁ|lang}}; 26 November 1857 – 22 February 1913) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[linguist]] and [[semiotician]]. His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics|semiology]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, R. H. 1979. A Short History of Linguistics, 2nd Edition. Longman Linguistics Library. London and New York. p. 201: Robins writes Saussure's statement of "the structural approach to language underlies virtually the whole of modern linguistics".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. and T. J. Taylor. 1989. Landmarks in Linguistic Thought: The Western Tradition from Socrates to Saussure. 2nd Edition. Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle, ''Makers of modern culture'', Routledge, 2002, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lodge, Nigel Wood, ''Modern Criticism and Theory: A Reader'', Pearson Education, 2008, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Margaret. 2011.

Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language. Edinburgh University Press. p.241 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of two major founders (together with [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]) of semiotics/semiology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winfried Nöth]], ''Handbook of Semiotics'', Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his translators, [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]], summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of "the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in linguistics, [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. 1988. Language, Saussure and Wittgenstein. Routledge. pix.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they have undergone extension and critique over time, the dimensions of organization introduced by Saussure continue to inform contemporary approaches to the phenomenon of [[language]]. [[Prague school]] linguist [[Jan Mukařovský]] writes that Saussure's "discovery of the internal structure of the [[Sign (linguistics)|linguistic sign]] differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic 'things'... and from mental processes", and that in this development "new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature".&lt;ref&gt;Mukarovsky, J. 1977. On Poetic Language. The Word and Verbal Art: Selected Essays by Jan Mukarovsky. Translated and edited by J. Burbank and Peter Steiner. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruqaiya Hasan]] argues that "the impact of Saussure’s theory of the linguistic sign has been such that modern linguists and their theories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-Saussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Linguistic sign and the science of linguistics: the foundations of appliability.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Geneva]] in 1857. His father was [[Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure]], a [[mineralogist]], [[entomologist]], and [[taxonomist]]. Saussure showed signs of considerable talent and intellectual ability as early as the age of fourteen.&lt;ref name="sljusareva-1972"&gt;Слюсарева, Наталья Александровна: ''Некоторые полузабытые страницы из истории языкознания – Ф. де Соссюр и У. Уитней.'' (Общее и романское языкознание: К 60-летию Р.А. Будагова). Москва 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1870, he began attending the Institution Martine (previously the Institution Lecoultre until 1969), in Geneva. There he lived with the family of a classmate, Elie David.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFW34Ir-aKAC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=%22institution+martine%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=36RKRoO3HD&amp;sig=-uQvxknvtQBPvaQIPsAMlc-Ubak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT35XU_4rTAhVHxlQKHc_dBs0Q6AEIKTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institution%20martine%22&amp;f=false|title=Saussure|last=Joseph|first=John E.|date=2012-03-22|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199695652|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating at the top of class, Saussure expected to continue his studies at the Gymnase de Genève, but his father decided he was not mature enough at fourteen and a half, and sent him to the Collège de Genève instead. Saussure was not pleased, as he complained: "I entered the Collège de Genève, to waste a year there as completely as a year can be wasted."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu6xCK_EFlcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=martine&amp;f=false|title=Saussure|last=Joseph|first=John E.|date=2012-03-22|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191636974|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year of studying [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]] and taking a variety of courses at the [[University of Geneva]], he commenced graduate work at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1876.

Two years later, at 21, Saussure published a book entitled ''Mémoire sur le système primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-européennes'' (''Dissertation on the Primitive Vowel System in Indo-European Languages''). After this he studied for a year at the [[University of Berlin]] under the ''[[Privatdozent]]en'' [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]], with whom he studied Celtic, and [[Hermann Oldenberg]] with whom he continued his studies of Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (2012:253)&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Leipzig to defend his doctoral dissertation ''De l'emploi du génitif absolu en Sanscrit'', and was awarded his doctorate in February 1880. Soon, he relocated to the [[University of Paris]], where he lectured on Sanskrit, [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and [[Old High German]] and occasionally other subjects.

Ferdinand de Saussure is one of the world’s most quoted linguists, which is remarkable as he himself hardly published anything during his lifetime. Even his few scientific articles are not unproblematic. Thus, for example, his publication on Lithuanian phonetics&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand de Saussure, « Aaccentuation lituanienne ». In : Indogermanische Forschungen. Vol. 6, 157 – 166&lt;/ref&gt; is grosso modo taken from studies by the Lithuanian researcher Friedrich Kurschat, with whom Saussure traveled through Lithuania in August 1880 for two weeks and whose (German) books Saussure had read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=8mpbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kurschat&amp;lr=&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Beiträge zur Kunde der littauischen Sprache. Erstes Heft: Deutsch-littauische Phraseologie der Präpositionen. Königsberg 1843, Zweites Heft: Laut- und Tonlehre der littauischen Sprache. Königsberg 1849|last=Kurschat|first=Friedrich|date=1843, 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Saussure, who had studied some basic grammar of Lithuanian in Leipzig for one semester but was unable to speak the language, was thus dependent on Kurschat. It is also questionable to what extent the Cours itself can be traced back to Saussure (alone). Studies have shown that at least the current version and its content are more likely to have the so-called editors Charles Bally and Albert Sèchehaye as their source than Saussure himself&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Trabant, « Saussure contre le Cours ». In: Francois Rastier (Hrsg.): De l'essence double du langage et le renouveau du saussurisme. Limoges: Lambert-Lucas. {{ISBN|978-2-35935-160-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He taught at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] for eleven years during which he was named Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honor]]).&lt;ref&gt;Culler, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; When offered a professorship in Geneva in 1892, he returned to Switzerland. Saussure lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European at the [[University of Geneva]] for the remainder of his life. It was not until 1907 that Saussure began teaching the Course of General Linguistics, which he would offer three times, ending in the summer of 1911. He died in 1913 in [[Vufflens-le-Château]], [[Vaud]], Switzerland. His brothers were the linguist and Esperantist [[René de Saussure]], and scholar of ancient Chinese astronomy, [[Léopold de Saussure]]. In turn, his son was the psychoanalyst [[Raymond de Saussure]].

Saussure attempted, at various times in the 1880s and 1890s, to write a book on general linguistic matters. His lectures about important principles of language description in Geneva between 1907 and 1911 were collected and published by his pupils posthumously in the famous ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'' in 1916. Some of his manuscripts, including an unfinished essay discovered in 1996, were published in ''Writings in General Linguistics'', but most of the material in it had already been published in Engler's critical edition of the ''Course'', in 1967 and 1974. (TUFA)

==Work and influence==
Saussure's theoretical reconstructions of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] vocalic system and particularly his [[laryngeal theory|theory of laryngeals]], otherwise unattested at the time, bore fruit and found confirmation after the decipherment of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] in the work of later generations of linguists such as [[Émile Benveniste]] and [[Walter Couvreur]], who both drew direct inspiration from their reading of the 1878 ''Mémoire''.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. F. K. Koerner]], 'The Place of Saussure's Memoire in the development of historical linguistics,' in Jacek Fisiak (ed.) ''Papers from the Sixth International Conference on Historical Linguistics,''(Poznań, Poland, 1983) John Benjamins Publishing, 1985  pp.323-346, p.339.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saussure had a major impact on the development of linguistic theory in the first half of the 20th century. His two currents of thought emerged independently of each other, one in Europe, the other in America. The results of each incorporated the basic notions of Saussure's thought in forming the central tenets of [[structuralism|structural linguistics]]. According to him, linguistic entities are parts of a system and are defined by their relations to one another within said system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Linguistics|last=Aronoff|first=Mark|last2=Rees-Miller|first2=Janie|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=9781405186766|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thinker used the game of [[chess]] for his analogy, citing that the game is not defined by the physical attributes of the chess pieces but the relation of each piece to the other pieces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Saussure's status in contemporary theoretical linguistics, however, is much diminished, with many key positions now dated or subject to challenge, but post-structuralist 21st-century reception remains more open to Saussure's influence.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Gasparov. ''Beyond Pure Reason'', pp1-8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His main contribution to structuralism was his theory of a two-tiered reality about language. The first is the ''langue'', the abstract and invisible layer, while the second, the ''parole'', refers to the actual speech that we hear in real life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Michel Foucault|last=Fendler|first=Lynn|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2010|isbn=9781472518811|location=London|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework was later adopted by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Claude Levi-Strauss]], who used the two-tiered model to determine the reality of myths. His idea was that all myths have an underlying pattern, which form the structure that makes them myths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These established the structuralist framework to literary criticism.

In Europe, the most important work in that period of influence was done by the [[Prague school]]. Most notably, [[Nikolay Trubetzkoy]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] headed the efforts of the Prague School in setting the course of [[phonology|phonological theory]] in the decades from 1940. Jakobson's universalizing structural-functional theory of phonology, based on a [[markedness]] hierarchy of [[distinctive features]], was the first successful solution of a plane of linguistic analysis according to the Saussurean hypotheses. Elsewhere, [[Louis Hjelmslev]] and [[the Copenhagen school (linguistics)|the Copenhagen School]] proposed new interpretations of linguistics from structuralist theoretical frameworks.

In America, Saussure's ideas informed the distributionalism of [[Leonard Bloomfield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Earl Joseph| title = From Whitney to Chomsky: Essays in the History OfAmerican Linguisitcs| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RUvdfiILAngC&amp;pg=PA139| year = 2002| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| isbn = 978-90-272-4592-2| page = 139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the post-Bloomfieldian structuralism of such scholars as [[Eugene Nida]], [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]], [[George L. Trager]], Rulon S. Wells III, [[Charles Hockett]] and, through [[Zellig Harris]], the young [[Noam Chomsky]]. In addition to Chomsky's theory of [[transformational grammar]], other contemporary developments of structuralism included [[Kenneth Pike]]'s theory of [[tagmemics]], [[Sidney Lamb]]'s theory of [[stratificational grammar]], and [[Michael Silverstein]]'s work. [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is a theory considered to be based firmly on the Saussurean principles of the sign, albeit with some modifications. [[Ruqaiya Hasan]] describes [[systemic functional linguistics]] as a 'post-Saussurean' linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Michael Halliday]] argues:

{{quote|Saussure took the sign as the organizing concept for linguistic structure, using it to express the conventional nature of language in the phrase "l'arbitraire du signe". This has the effect of highlighting what is, in fact, the one point of arbitrariness in the system, namely the phonological shape of words, and hence allows the non-arbitrariness of the rest to emerge with greater clarity. An example of something that is distinctly non-arbitrary is the way different kinds of meaning in language are expressed by different kinds of grammatical structure, as appears when linguistic structure is interpreted in functional terms &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, MAK. 1977. Ideas about Language. Reprinted in Volume 3 of MAK Halliday's Collected Works. Edited by J.J. Webster. London: Continuum. p113.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Course in General Linguistics''===
{{Main article|Course in General Linguistics}}

Saussure's most influential work, ''Course in General Linguistics'' (''Cours de linguistique générale''), was published posthumously in 1916 by former students [[Charles Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye]], on the basis of notes taken from Saussure's lectures in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;Macey, D. (2009). The Penguin dictionary of critical theory. Crane Library at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Course'' became one of the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] linguistics works of the 20th century not primarily for the content (many of the ideas had been anticipated in the works of other 20th century linguists) but for the innovative approach that Saussure applied in discussing linguistic phenomena.

Its central notion is that language may be analyzed as a [[formal system]] of differential elements, apart from the messy dialectics of real-time production and comprehension. Examples of these elements include his notion of the [[sign (linguistics)|linguistic sign]], which is composed of the signifier and the signified. Though the sign may also have a referent, Saussure took that to lie beyond the linguist's purview.

Throughout the book, he stated that a linguist can develop a diachronic analysis of a text or theory of language but must learn just as much or more about the language/text as it exists at any moment in time (i.e. "synchronically"): "Language is a system of signs that expresses ideas". A science that studies the life of signs within society and is a part of social and general psychology. Saussure believed that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign, he called it semiology.

===Laryngeal theory===
While a student, Saussure published an important work in [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] [[philology]] that proposed the existence of ghosts in Proto-Indo-European called ''sonant coefficients''. The Scandinavian scholar [[Hermann Möller]] suggested that they might actually be laryngeal consonants, leading to what is now known as the laryngeal theory. It has been argued that the problem that Saussure encountered, trying to explain how he was able to make systematic and predictive hypotheses from known linguistic data to unknown linguistic data, stimulated his development of [[structuralism]]. His predictions about the existence of primate coefficients/laryngeals and their evolution proved a success when [[Hittite texts]] were discovered and deciphered, some 50 years later.

===Later critics===
{{POV|what=subsection|talk=POV in %22Later Critics%22 subsection|date=January 2018}}
The closing sentence of Saussure's ''Course in General Linguistics'' has been challenged in many{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}} academic disciplines and subdisciplines with its contention that "linguistics has as its unique and true object the language envisioned in itself and for itself".&lt;ref&gt;Boris Gasparov. ''Beyond Pure Reason'', pp59-60, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; By the latter half of the 20th century, many of Saussure's ideas were under heavy criticism.

Saussure's linguistic ideas are still considered important for their time but have since suffered considerably under rhetorical developments aimed at showing how linguistics had changed or was changing with the times. As a consequence, Saussure's ideas are now often presented by professional linguists as outdated and as superseded by developments such as [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[generative grammar]] or have been so modified in their basic tenets as to make their use in their original formulations difficult without risking distortion, as in [[systemic linguistics]]. That development is occasionally overstated, however; [[Jan Koster]] states, "Saussure, considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language,"&lt;ref&gt;Koster, Jan. 1996. "Saussure meets the brain", in R. Jonkers, E. Kaan, J. K. Wiegel, eds., Language and Cognition 5. Yearbook 1992 of the Research Group for Linguistic Theory and Knowledge Representation of the University of Groningen, Groningen, pp. 115–120.[http://www.let.rug.nl/koster/old%20papers/saussure.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Over-reactions can also be seen in comments of the cognitive linguist Mark Turner&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Mark. 1987. Death is the Mother of Beauty: Mind, Metaphor, Criticism. University of Chicago Press, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; who reports that many of Saussure's concepts were "wrong on a grand scale". It is necessary to be rather more finely nuanced in the positions attributed to Saussure and in their longterm influence on the development of linguistic theorizing in all schools; for a more recent rereading of Saussure with respect to such issues, see Paul Thibault.&lt;ref&gt;Thibault, Paul. 1996. Re-reading Saussure: The Dynamics of Signs in Social Life. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as many principles of structural linguistics are still pursued, modified and adapted in current practice and according to what has been learnt since about the embodied functioning of brain and the role of language within this, basic tenets begun with Saussure still can be found operating behind the scenes today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Semiology===
Saussure is one of the founding fathers of [[semiotics]]. His term for the field was "semiology." Instead of focusing his theory on the origins of language and its historical aspects, Saussure concentrated on the patterns and functions of language itself. He believed that the relationship that exists between the signifier and the signified is purely [[Semiotic arbitrariness|arbitrary]] and analytical. His "sign/signifier/signified/referent" scheme forms the core of the field. Equally crucial but often overlooked or misapplied is the dimension of the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes of linguistic description.

Some linguists have pointed out to the fact that Saussure did not 'invent' semiotics but built upon [[Neoplatonist]]/[[Augustinianism|Augustinian]] knowledge from the [[Middle Ages]], particularly in regard to the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]: "as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies".&lt;ref&gt;Munteanu, E. 'On the Object-Language/Metalanguage Distinction in Saint Augustine's Works: De Dialectica and de Magistro', p. 65. In: Cram, D., Linn, A. R., &amp; Nowak, E. (eds.). ''History of Linguistics 1996'': Volume 2: ''From Classical to Contemporary Linguistics''. John Benjamins Publishing Company. Retrieved April 16, 2015 from https://books.google.com/books?id=IWtCAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence outside linguistics===
The principles and methods employed by structuralism were later adapted in diverse fields by French intellectuals such as [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Lacan]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. Such scholars took influence from Saussure's ideas in their own areas of study (literary studies/philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, respectively). However, their analogous interpretations of Saussure's linguistic theories led to proclamations of the end of structuralism in the two disciplines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

'''La''' '''Fondation Brigitte Bardot''' ('''FBB'''), (''The Brigitte Bardot Foundation)'' is a French foundation dedicated to [[animal rights|animal protection]] created by French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] in 1986. Since 1992, the foundation has been recognized as a "public utility" (French: [[Déclaration d'utilité publique]]).

== History ==
[[Brigitte Bardot|Bardot's]] initial involvement with animal rights was in 1962, after seeing photographs of the conditions in which animals were killed. Upon this, Bardot immediately began advocating against the use of painful electric shock pistols in [[slaughterhouse]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Initiales B.B., éditions Grasset.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a vegetarian. In 1967, Bardot was received at the [[Élysée Palace]] where she met with [[Charles_de_Gaulle|Charles de Gaulle]], the then president of France. It was a few years later that Bardot obtained the "stunning before slaughter" rights from the government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} 

In 1977, Bardot went on to campaign against the hunting of baby Harp seals. Upon invitation from [[Paul Watson]], of the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|Sea Shepherd Conservation Society,]] [[Brigitte Bardot|Bardot]] embarked on a five day trip to the ice fields in [[Blanc-Sablon, Quebec|Blanc-Sablon]], [[Canada]], receiving significant media attention. In addition, the trip also gained Bardot the support of French president, [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing|Valéry Giscard d'Estaing,]] leading to changes regarding the import of seal products.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

''The Brigitte Bardot Foundation'' (La Fondation Brigitte Bardot) was launched by Bardot in [[Saint-Tropez]], in 1986 where she auctioned her jewellery and other personal possessions to raise 3 million French francs for her campaigns and activities. 

In 1988, the organization moved to [[Paris]]. It was here that Bardot led a television series entitled ''S.O.S. Animaux.'' The show aired from 1989 through 1992, over which time it spread its purpose of influencing public opinion of animal cruelty.{{Citation needed span|text=|date=January 2018|reason=}}

In 1991, Bardot donated her Saint Tropez property, ''La Madrague'' to the foundation so as to raise the capital required to obtain a [[Déclaration_d'utilité_publique|declaration of public utility]]. The declaration was granted on February 21, 1992, by the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1995, the [[Dalai Lama]] became an honorary member of the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brigittebardot.unblog.fr/la-fondation-brigitte-bardot/|title=La fondation Brigitte-Bardot|access-date=2018-01-20|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Foundation celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006. It reached 75,000 members by the year 2014.&lt;ref name="membres2014"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondationbrigittebardot.fr/la-fondation-brigitte-bardot/organisation|title=Éditorial de Brigitte Bardot pour les 25 ans de la Fondation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Official website of the Fondation Brigitte Bardot|language=fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The foundation has helped create shelters for [[elephant]]s in [[South Africa]], [[koala]]s in [[Australia]], dancing [[bear]]s in [[Bulgaria]], and [[primate]]s in [[Cameroon]]. It has also reintroduced several animal species that had completely disappeared in [[Senegal]] and participated in the reintroduction of [[wolf|wolves]] to the [[Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rap-enq/r0825-t2.asp |title=Rapport fait au nom de la commission d’enquête sur les conditions de la présence du loup en France et l'exercice du pastoralisme dans les zones de montagne |publisher=[[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] |date=2 May 2003 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mobile veterinary clinic has also been created for the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries.

The foundation is a regular plaintiff in lawsuits against animal cruelty. In January 2016, to support the proposition of a law to ban [[Foie gras controversy|force-feeding on ducks and geese]], the foundation invited [[Pamela Anderson]] to speak at the [[National Assembly (France)|French National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=fr |url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Foie-gras-Pamela-Anderson-met-le-feu-a-l-Assemblee-Nationale-899479 |title=Pamela Anderson met le feu à l'Assemblée Nationale |work=[[Paris Match]] |author=Beaudoin |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While funding other French animal shelters, the foundation has also created its own shelter, ''La Mare Anzou'', located in a ruined mansion in the department of [[Eure (departement)|Eure]] in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Fondation-Brigitte-Bardot-le-combat-continue-149429 |title=Fondation Brigitte Bardot : le combat continue ! |date=26 September 2011 |first=Maryvonne |last=Ollivry |work=[[Paris Match]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers several hectares, where 200 dogs and 250 cats wait for adoption. This shelter is also a "retirement home" for several horses, cows, etc. After complaints from local residents about noise nuisance threatened to close the shelter in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=fr |url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Le-refuge-de-Brigitte-Bardot-en-danger-750586 |title=Le refuge de Brigitte Bardot en danger |work=[[Paris Match]] |author=Beaudoin |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the foundation began soundproofing construction, investing 3 million euros to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=fr |url=http://www.fondationbrigittebardot.fr/img/20150525Paris_Normandie.pdfl |title=Un expert est missionné |publisher=Official website of the Fondation Brigitte Bardot |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 2006, Brigitte Bardot published a letter to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in the Foundation's newsletter, ''L'info-journal'' (published every trimester since 1992), condemning the practice of the [[Eid al-Adha]] in France. This caused her be charged with and later fined for [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|incitement to racial hatred]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434193.stm|title=Bardot fined over racial hatred|date=2008-06-03|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the foundation launched a campaign against [[Horse meat|hippophagy]] titled ''Le cheval vous l'aimez comment?'' ( "The horse, how do you like it?").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/vous/article/2009/12/04/vous-aimez-le-cheval-mangez-en_1276252_3238.html |title=Vous aimez le cheval ? Mangez-en ! |date=4 December 2009 |first=Jean-Claude |last=Ribaut |work=[[Le Monde]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was banned from the Salon du Cheval (Paris Horse Show), the organizers of the event stating, "This is not a place to develop a view point on hippophagy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.europe1.fr/politique/salon-du-cheval-brigitte-bardot-privee-de-stand-anti-viande-chevaline-34743 |title=Salon du Cheval : Brigitte Bardot privée de stand anti-viande chevaline |publisher=[[Europe 1]] |date=3 December 2007 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of this year, the foundation launched ''Fourrure : signe extérieur de cruauté'' ("Fur : external sign of cruelty"), a national campaign of posters and television spots against fur. The French fur association attempted to ban these advertisements, without success. In December 2005, a new communication campaign ''Fourrure, le look qui tue'' ("Fur, the look that kills") was launched in France. The foundation has also supported the yearly "day without fur," on every first Saturday of winter sales since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=fr |url=http://www.fondationbrigittebardot.fr/participer-a-une-manifestation/journee_sans_fourrure2015 |title=Journée Sans Fourrure le 10 janvier 2015 |publisher=Official website of the Fondation Brigitte Bardot |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the boat "[[MV Brigitte Bardot]]," co-financed by the foundation and the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] of [[Paul Watson]], was damaged by a wave. It was repaired and put back on the water the next year. In 2015, it was exhibited in Paris after a campaign in the [[Faroe Islands]] to save the [[cetacean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=fr |url=http://www.seashepherd.fr/news-and-media/news-20150618-fr-01.html |title=Le navire de Sea Shepherd, le Brigitte Bardot, est arrivé aux îles Féroé |publisher=[[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gloria Evangelina Anzaldúa''' (September 26, 1942&amp;nbsp;– May 15, 2004) was an American scholar of [[Chicana]] cultural theory, [[feminist]] theory, and [[queer theory]]. She loosely based her best-known book, ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]'', on her life growing up on the Mexico–Texas border and incorporated her lifelong experiences of social and cultural marginalization into her work. She also developed theories about the marginal, in-between, and mixed cultures that develop along borders.

==Early life and education==
Anzaldúa was born in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] of south [[Texas]] on September 26, 1942, to Urbano Anzaldúa and Amalia Anzaldúa ''née'' García.  Gloria Anzaldúa's great-grandfather, Urbano Sr., once a precinct judge in [[Hidalgo County, Texas|Hidalgo County]], was the first owner of the Jesús María Ranch on which she was born. Her mother grew up on an adjoining ranch, Los Vergeles ("the gardens"), which was owned by her family, and she met and married Urbano Anzaldúa when both were very young. Anzaldúa was a descendant of many of the prominent Spanish explorers and settlers to come to the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and also had indigenous ancestry. The surname Anzaldúa is of [[Basque people|Basque]] origin.

When she was eleven, her family relocated to [[Hargill, Texas]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://voices.cla.umn.edu/artistpages/anzaldua.php |title= Gloria Anzaldúa | publisher= Voices From the Gaps, University of Minnesota |id= (handle link: [https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/167856 167856]) |date= |accessdate= 2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, she received a B.A. in English, Art, and Secondary Education from [[University of Texas–Pan American]], and an M.A. in English and Education from the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. While in Austin, she joined politically active cultural [[poets]] and [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[dramatists]] such as Ricardo Sanchez, and [[Hedwig Gorski]].

==Career and major works ==

After obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[English language|English]] from the then Pan American University (now [[University of Texas Rio Grande Valley]]), Anzaldúa worked as a preschool and special education teacher. In 1977, she moved to California, where she supported herself through her writing, lectures, and occasional teaching stints about feminism, Chicano studies, and creative writing at [[San Francisco State University]], the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[Florida Atlantic University]], and other universities.

She is perhaps most famous for co-editing ''[[This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color]]'' (1981) with [[Cherríe Moraga]], editing ''Making Face, Making Soul/Haciendo Caras: Creative and Critical Perspectives by Women of Color'' (1990), and co-editing ''This Bridge We Call Home: Radical Visions for Transformation'' (2002). She also wrote the semi-autobiographical ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]'' (1987). She was close to completing the book manuscript, ''Light in the Dark/Luz en lo Oscuro:  Rewriting Identity, Spirituality, Reality'', which she also planned to submit as her dissertation. It has now been published posthumously by Duke University Press (2015). Her children's books include ''Prietita Has a Friend'' (1991), ''Friends from the Other Side&amp;nbsp;— Amigos del Otro Lado'' (1993), and ''Prietita y La Llorona'' (1996). She has also authored many fictional and poetic works.

She made contributions to fields of [[feminism]] and contributed to the field of cultural theory/[[Chicana]] and [[queer]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects05/cf/issuestheory.html|title=Chicana Feminism – Theory and Issues|website=www.umich.edu|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anzaldúa wrote a speech called "Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to Third World Women Writers" focusing on the shift towards an equal and just gender representation in literature but away from racial and cultural issues because of the rise of female writers and theorists. She also stressed in her essay the power of writing to create a world that would compensate for what the real world does not offer.&lt;ref&gt;Keating (ed.), ''The Gloria Anzaldúa Reader'' (2009), pp. 26-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''This Bridge Called My Back''===

Anzaldúa's essay '"La Prieta" deals with her manifestation of thoughts and horrors that have constituted her life in Texas. Anzaldúa identifies herself as an entity without a figurative home and/or peoples to completely relate to. To supplement this deficiency, Anzaldúa created her own sanctuary, Mundo Zurdo, whereby her personality transcends the norm-based lines of relating to a certain group. Instead, in her Mundo Zurdo, she is like a "[[Shiva]], a many-armed and legged body with one foot on brown soil, one on white, one in straight society, one in the gay world, the man's world, the women's, one limb in the literary world, another in the working class, the socialist, and the occult worlds".&lt;ref&gt;(205)&lt;/ref&gt; The passage describes the identity battles which the author had to engage in throughout her life. Since early childhood, Anzaldúa has had to deal with the challenge of being a woman of color. From the beginnings she was exposed to her own people, to her own family's racism and "fear of women and sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;(198)&lt;/ref&gt; Her family's internalized racism immediately cast her as the "other" because of their bias that being white and fair-skinned means prestige and royalty, when color subjects one to being almost the scum of society (just as her mother had complained about her ''prieta'' dating a ''mojado'' from Peru). The household she grew up in was one in which the male figure was the authoritarian head, while the female, the mother, was stuck in all the biases of this paradigm. Although this is the difficult position in which white, patriarchal society has cast women of color, gays and lesbians, she does not make them out to be the archenemy, because she believes that "casting stones is not the solution"&lt;ref&gt;(207)&lt;/ref&gt; and that racism and sexism do not come from only whites but also people of color. Throughout her life, the inner racism and sexism from her childhood would haunt her, as she often was asked to choose her loyalties, whether it be to women, to people of color, or to gays/lesbians. Her analogy to Shiva is well-fitted, as she decides to go against these conventions and enter her own world: Mundo Zurdo, which allows the self to go deeper, to transcend the lines of convention and, at the same time, to recreate the self and the society. This is for Anzaldúa a form of religion, one that allows the self to deal with the injustices that society throws at it and to come out a better person, a more reasonable person.

An entry in the book titled "Speaking In Tongues: A Letter To Third World Women Writers", spotlights the dangers Anzaldúa considers women writers of color deal with, and these dangers are rooted in a lack of privileges. She talks about the transformation of writing styles and how we are taught not to air our truths. Folks are outcast as a result of speaking and writing with their native tongues. Anzaldúa wants more women writers of color to be visible and be well represented in text. Her essay compels us to write with compassion and with love. For writing is a form of gaining power by speaking our truths, and it is seen as a way to decolonize, to resist, and to unite women of color collectively within the feminist movement.

===''Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza''===

Anzaldúa is highly known for this semi-autobiographical book, which discusses her life growing up on the Mexico–Texas border. It was selected as one of the 38 best books of 1987 by ''Literary Journal''. ''Borderlands'' examines the condition of women in Chicano and Latino culture. Anzaldúa discusses several critical issues related to Chicana experiences: [[heteronormativity]], [[colonialism]], and [[patriarchy|male dominance]]. She gives a very personal account of the oppression of Chicana lesbians and talks about the gendered expectations of behavior that normalizes women's deference to male authority in her community. She develops the idea of the "new [[mestiza]]" as a "new higher consciousness" that will break down barriers and fight against the male/female dualistic norms of gender. The first half of the book is a series of essays, which feature a view into a life of isolation and loneliness in the borderlands between cultures. The latter half of the book is poetry. In the book, Anzaldúa uses two variations of English and six variations of Spanish. By doing this, she deliberately makes it difficult for non-bilinguals to read. Language was one of the barriers Anzaldúa dealt with as a child, and she wanted readers to understand how frustrating things are when there are language barriers. The book was written as an outlet for her anger and encourages one to be proud of one's heritage and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhu.es/antonia.dominguez/latinas/anzaldua.htm|title=Gloria Anzaldúa|website=www.uhu.es|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;''Light in the Dark⁄Luz en lo Oscuro: Rewriting Identity, Spirituality, Reality''&lt;/big&gt;'''

Anzaldúa wrote ''Light in the Dark'' during the last decade of her life. Drawn from her unfinished dissertation for her PhD in Literature from [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], the book is carefully organized from The Gloria Anzaldúa Papers, 1942-2004 by [[AnaLouise Keating]], Anzaldúa's literary trustee. The book represents her most developed philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/light-in-the-dark-luz-en-lo-oscuro|title=Light in the Dark⁄Luz en lo Oscuro|work=Duke University Press|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout ''Light in the Dark'', Anzaldúa weaves personal narratives into deeply engaging theoretical readings to comment on numerous contemporary issues—including the September 11 attacks, neocolonial practices in the art world, and coalitional politics. She valorizes [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] forms and methods of knowing, being, and creating that have been marginalized by Western thought, and theorizes her writing process as a fully embodied artistic, spiritual, and political practice. ''Light in the Dark'' contains multiple transformative theories including include the nepantleras, the [[Coyolxauhqui]] imperative, spiritual activism, and others.

== Themes in writing ==

===Nepantlism===
Anzaldúa drew on Nepantla, a Nahuatl word that means "in the middle" to conceptualise her experience as a Chicana woman. She coined the term, "Nepantlera". "Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20IV%20Special/AnaLouiseKeating-FM.pdf|title = From Borderlands and New Mestizas to Nepantlas and Nepantleras Anzaldúan Theories for Social Change|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keating|first = AnaLouise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirituality===
Anzaldúa described herself as a very spiritual person and stated that she experienced four [[out-of-body experience]]s during her lifetime. In many of her works, she referred to her devotion to la Virgen de Guadalupe ([[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]), [[Nahuatl]]/[[Toltec]] divinities, and to the [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] [[Orisha|orishás]] Yemayá and Oshún.&lt;ref&gt;Anzaldúa, Gloria E. ''Light in the Dark/Luz en lo Oscuro: Rethinking Identity, Spirituality, Reality''. Durham and London: Duke, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, she expressed regret that scholars had largely ignored the "unsafe" spiritual aspects of ''Borderlands'' and bemoaned the resistance to such an important part of her work.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Anzaldúa, Gloria with AnaLouise Keating. ''Interviews/Entrevistas''. New York: Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In her later writings, she developed the concepts of spiritual activism and nepantleras to describe the ways contemporary social actors can combine spirituality with politics to enact revolutionary change.

===Language/"Linguistic terrorism"===
Anzaldua's works weave English and Spanish together as one language, an idea stemming from her theory of "borderlands" identity. Her autobiographical essay, "La Prieta," was published in (mostly) English in ''This Bridge Called My Back'', and in (mostly) Spanish in ''Esta puente, mi espalda: Voces de mujeres tercermundistas en los Estados Unidos''. In her writing, Anzaldúa uses a unique blend of eight dialects, two variations of English and six of Spanish. In many ways, by writing in a mix of languages, Anzaldúa creates a daunting task for the non-bilingual reader to decipher the full meaning of the text. Language, clearly one of the borders Anzaldúa addressed, is an essential feature to her writing. Her book is dedicated to being proud of one's heritage and to recognizing the many dimensions of her culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

Anzaldúa emphasized in her writing the connection between language and identity. She expressed dismay with people who gave up their native language in order to conform to the society they were in. Anzaldúa was often scolded for her improper Spanish accent and believed it was a strong aspect to her heritage; therefore, she labels the qualitative labeling of language "linguistic terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://geanzaldua.weebly.com/what-is-linguistic-terrorism.html What is Linguistic Terrorism?], The Gloria E. Anzaldúa Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; She spent a lot of time promoting acceptance of all languages and accents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geanzaldua.weebly.com/about-gloria.html About Gloria], The Gloria E. Anzaldúa Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to expose her stance on linguistics and labels, Anzaldúa explained, "While I advocate putting Chicana, ''[[tejana]]'', working-class, dyke-feminist poet, writer theorist in front of my name, I do so for reasons different than those of the dominant culture... so that the Chicana and lesbian and all the other persons in me don't get erased, omitted, or killed."&lt;ref&gt;Anzaldúa, G. (1998). "To(o) Queer the Writer—''Loca, escritora y chicana''." In C. Trujillo (Ed.), ''Living Chicana Theory'' (pp. 264). San Antonio, TX: Third Woman Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health and body ===
Anzaldúa began menstruating when she was only three months old, a symptom of the [[endocrine]] condition that caused her to stop growing physically at the age of twelve.&lt;ref name="reader"&gt;Gloria Anzaldúa, "La Prieta," ''The Gloria Anzaldúa Reader'', ed. AnaLouise Keating, Duke University Press, 2009, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, she would wear special girdles fashioned for her by her mother in order to disguise her precocious sexual development. Her mother would also ensure that a cloth was placed in Anzaldúa's underwear as a child in case of bleeding. Anzaldúa remembers, "I'd take [the bloody cloths] out into this shed, wash them out, and hang them really low on a cactus so nobody would see them.... My genitals... [were] always a smelly place that dripped blood and had to be hidden." She eventually underwent a [[hysterectomy]] in 1980 when she was 38 years old to deal with uterine, cervical, and ovarian abnormalities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

=== ''Mestiza''/Border Culture ===
One of her major contributions was her introduction to United States academic audiences of the term ''[[mestizaje]],'' meaning a state of being beyond [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] ("either-or") conception, into academic writing and discussion. In her theoretical works, Anzaldúa called for a "new mestiza," which she described as an individual aware of her conflicting and meshing identities and uses these "new angles of vision" to challenge binary thinking in the [[Western world]]. The "borderlands" that she refers to in her writing are geographical as well as a reference to mixed races, heritages, religions, sexualities, and languages. Anzaldúa is primarily interested in the contradictions and juxtapositions of conflicting and intersecting identities. She points out that having to identify as a certain, labelled, sex can be detrimental to one's creativity as well as how seriously people take you as a producer of consumable goods.&lt;ref&gt;Gloria Anzaldúa, "To(o) Queer the Writer—Loca, escritoria y chicana", ''Invasions; writings by Queers, Dykes and Lesbians'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The "new mestiza" way of thinking is illustrated in [[postcolonial feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/femteacher.21.1.0001&lt;/ref&gt;

Anzaldúa called for people of different races to confront their fears to move forward into a world that is less hateful and more useful. In "La Conciencia de la Mestiza: Towards a New Consciousness," a text often used in [[women's studies]] courses, Anzaldúa insisted that [[separatism]] invoked by [[Chicanos]]/[[Chicanas]] is not furthering the cause but instead keeping the same racial division in place. Many of Anzaldúa's works challenge the [[status quo]] of the movements in which she was involved. She challenged these movements in an effort to make real change happen to the world rather than to specific groups. Scholar Ivy Schweitzer writes, "her theorizing of a new borderlands or mestiza consciousness helped jump start fresh investigations in several fields -- feminist, Americanist [and] postcolonial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schweitzer|first=Ivy|date=Jan 2006|title=For Gloria Anzaldúa: Collecting America, Performing Friendship|journal=PMLA|volume=121|issue=1, Special Topic: The History of the Book and the Idea of Literature|pages=285–291|doi=10.1632/003081206x129774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexuality ===
In the same way that Anzaldúa often wrote that she felt that she could not be classified as only part of one race or the other, she felt that she possessed a multi-sexuality. When growing up, Anzaldúa expressed that she felt an "intense sexuality" towards her own father, animals, and even trees. She was attracted to and later had relationships with both men and women, although she identified herself as a lesbian in most of her writing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Anzaldúa wrote extensively about her queer identity and the marginalization of queer people, particularly in communities of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/csrc/aztlan/2009/00000034/00000002/art00005|title=Queering the Cosmic Race: Esotericism, Mestizaje, and Sexuality in the Work of Gabriela Mistral and Gloria Anzaldúa|first=Tace|last=Hedrick|date=1 September 2009|publisher=|journal=Aztlan: A Journal of Chicano Studies|volume=34|issue=2|pages=67–98|accessdate=26 September 2017|via=IngentaConnect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminism ===
Anzaldúa self-identifies in her writing as a feminist, and her major works are often associated with [[Chicana feminism]] and [[postcolonial feminism]]. Anzaldúa writes of the oppression she experiences specifically as a woman of color, as well as the restrictive gender roles that exist within the Chicano community. In ''Borderlands'', she also addresses topics such as sexual violence perpetrated against women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|last=Anzaldua|first=Gloria|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy ==
Anzaldúa died on May 15, 2004, at her home in [[Santa Cruz, California]], from complications due to [[diabetes]]. At the time of her death, she was working toward the completion of her dissertation to receive her doctorate in Literature from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/04-17/cisneros.asp|title=Classes without Quizzes|website=currents.ucsc.edu|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded posthumously in 2005.

Several institutions now offer awards in memory of Anzaldúa.

The Chicana/o Latina/o Research Center (CLRC) at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] offers the annual ''Gloria E. Anzaldúa Distinguished Lecture Award'' and ''The Gloria E. Anzaldúa Award for Independent Scholars and Contingent Faculty'' is offered annually by the [[American Studies Association]]. The latter "...honors Anzaldúa's outstanding career as an independent scholar and her labor as contingent faculty, along with her groundbreaking contributions to scholarship on women of color and to queer theory. The award includes a lifetime membership in the ASA, a lifetime electronic subscription to American Quarterly, five years access to the electronic library resources at the University of Texas at Austin, and $500".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theasa.net/prizes_and_grants/page/anzaldua_award_for_independent_scholars/|title=The Gloria E.

In 2007, three years after Gloria Anzaldúa's death, the [[Society for the Study of Gloria Anzaldúa]] (SSGA) was established to gather scholars and community members who continue to engage Anzaldúa's work. The SSGA co-sponsors a conference – El Mundo Zurdo – every 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for the Study of Gloria Anzaldúa|url=http://www.gloriaanzaldua.com/?page_id=4|work=About the SSGA|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gloria E. Anzaldúa Poetry Prize is awarded annually, in conjunction with the Anzaldúa Literary Trust, to a poet whose work explores how place shapes identity, imagination, and understanding. Special attention is given to poems that exhibit multiple vectors of thinking: artistic, theoretical, and social, which is to say, political. First place is publication by Newfound, including 25 contributor copies, and a $500 prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gloria E. Anzaldúa Poetry Prize|url=https://newfound.org/poetry-prize/|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Women's Studies Association]] honors Anzaldúa, a valued and long-active member of the organization, with the annual Gloria E. Anzaldúa Book Prize, which is designated for groundbreaking monographs in women's studies that makes significant multicultural feminist contributions to women of color/transnational scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/bookprizes#Anzaldua|title=NWSA|website=www.nwsa.org|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate what would have been Anzaldúa's 75th birthday, on September 26, 2017 [[Aunt Lute Books]] published the anthology ''Imaniman: Poets Writing in the Anzaldúan Borderlands'' edited by [[ire'ne lara silva]] and [[Dan Vera]] with an introduction by [[United States Poet Laureate]] [[Juan Felipe Herrera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labloga.blogspot.com/2017/02/from-anzalduas-borderlands-to-imaniman.html|title=La Bloga: Imaniman: Sparked From the Communal Soul|first=Olga Garcia|last=Echeverria|date=26 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featuring the work of 52 contemporary poets on the subject of Anzaldúa's continuing impact on contemporary thought and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auntlute.com/8305/recent_release/imaniman-poets-writing-in-the-anzalduan-borderlands/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421094015/http://auntlute.com/8305/recent_release/imaniman-poets-writing-in-the-anzalduan-borderlands/ |archivedate=2017-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Google commemorated Anzaldúa's achievements and legacy through a [[Google Doodle|Doodle]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgm9_A5iL50|title=Gloria E.

'''Graham Priest''' (born 1948) is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the [[CUNY]] [[Graduate Center]], as well as a regular visitor at the [[University of Melbourne]] where he was Boyce Gibson Professor of Philosophy and also  at the [[University of St Andrews]].

==Education==
Priest was educated at the [[St John's College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://grahampriest.net/ Official website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[London School of Economics]]. His thesis advisor was [[John Lane Bell]]. He also holds a [[DLitt]] from the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Faculty/Core-Bios/Graham-Priest Priest's CUNY Graduate Center homepage]; [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/old/gp/gp.html Priest's St. Andrews homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210114951/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/old/gp/gp.html |date=10 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
He is known for his defence of [[dialetheism]], his in-depth analyses of the [[paradox|logical paradox]]es (holding the thesis that there is a uniform treatment for many well-known paradoxes, such as the semantic, set-theoretic and Liar paradoxes), and his many writings related to [[paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent]] and other [[non-classical logic]]s.

Priest, a long-time resident of Australia, now residing in New York City, is the author of numerous books, and has published articles in nearly every major philosophical and logical journal. He was a frequent collaborator with the late [[Richard Sylvan]], a fellow proponent of dialetheism and paraconsistent logic.

Priest has also published on [[metaphilosophy]].

In addition to his work in philosophy and logic, Priest practiced Karate-do. He is 3rd Dan, International Karate-do Shobukai; 4th Dan, Shi’to Ryu, and an Australian National Kumite Referee and Kata Judge. Presently, he practices Taichi.

'''Herman Johan "Hans" Achterhuis''' (born September 1, 1942, [[Hengelo]])&lt;ref&gt;http://personenencyclopedie.info/A/Achi/ACHTERHUIS,%20Herman%20Johan/view{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is Professor Emeritus in Systematic Philosophy at the [[University of Twente]], The Netherlands and one of the country's foremost philosophers. For now his research concerns particularly social and [[political philosophy]] and [[philosophy of technology]].

His list of publications shows a great scope (in fields of medical care, labour, third-world-philosophy). In 1967 he took his doctoral degree on [[Albert Camus]].

His latest books handle the topics of utopianism (‘De erfenis van de utopie’, ‘The Legacy of Utopia’) and the tension between morality and politics in relation to the Kosovo War (“Politiek van Goede bedoelingen’, ‘Policy of good intentions’). He is co-author of the volume American Philosophy of Technology; The Empirical Turn. This work includes contributions on [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Don Ihde]] and [[Langdon Winner]].

== Main thoughts ==

His ideas add up to a philosophy of things ([[object (philosophy)|objects]]) and a plea for a [[morality]] of [[machines]]. Rather than being morally neutral, things guide our behaviour (barriers in the subway forcing us to buy a ticket). This is why they are capable of exerting moral pressure that is much more effective than imposing sanctions or trying to reform the way people think. Utopia has been superseded but the world can still be improved, if we take seriously our moral ties to the machines and devices that surround us.
== Philosopher Laureate ==
In 2011 Achterhuis was chosen as the first [[Philosopher Laureate of the Netherlands]]. This honorary title was an initiative of the Magazine [[Filosofie]], and the [[Philosophy Month Foundation]] (Stichting Maand van de Filosofie), together with the newspaper [[Trouw]]. The person is chosen by a group of journalists and academics. The aim of the initiative  is to allow a philosophy heavyweight to speak in the media, to place news events in a broader context. In 2013 Achterhuis was succeeded as Philosopher Laureate by [[René Gude]] (Soerabaja, 2 March 1957 – Amsterdam, 13 March 2015).

'''Illegal immigration''' refers to the [[wikt:migration|migration]] of people into a country in ways that violate the [[immigration law]]s of that country, or the remaining in a country of people who no longer have the legal right to remain. 

Illegal immigration, as well as [[immigration]] in general, is overwhelmingly financially upward, from a poorer to a richer country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mark|last=Taylor|title=The Drivers of Immigration in Contemporary Society: Unequal Distribution of Resources and Opportunities|work=Human Ecology|volume=35|number=6|date=December 2007|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/3194641502768341|accessdate=10 December 2009|doi=10.1007/s10745-007-9111-z|pages=775–776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in another country illegally includes a variety of restrictions, as well as the risk of being detained and deported or of facing other sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=V.

Asylum seekers who were denied asylum may face [[impediment to expulsion]], for example if the home country refuses to receive the person or if new asylum reasons occur after the decision. In some countries or cases, these people are considered as illegal immigrants, and in others, they may get a temporary residence permit, for example with reference to the principle of [[non-refoulement]] in the international [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Refugee Convention]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]], referring to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], has shown in a number of indicative judgments that there are enforcement barriers to expulsion to certain countries, for example due to the risk of torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"fulltext":["impediment to expulsion"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328055357/http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{ |date=28 March 2017 }},"kpthesaurus":["350"]} Search results on "Impediment to expulsion" in the European Court of Human Rights archive&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
There have been campaigns in many countries since 2007 discouraging the use of the term "illegal immigrant". They are generally based on the argument that the act of immigrating illegally does not make the people themselves illegal, but rather they are "people who have immigrated illegally". In the [[United States]], a "Drop the I-Word" campaign was launched in 2010 advocating for the use of terms such as '''undocumented immigrants''' or '''unauthorized immigrants''' when referring to the foreign nationals who reside in a country illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colorlines.com/droptheiword/|title=Drop the I-Word Campaign|work=Race Forward|access-date=2 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223051558/http://colorlines.com/droptheiword/|archive-date=23 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picum.org/words-matter/|title=Words matter • PICUM|publisher=|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220225318/http://picum.org/words-matter/|archive-date=20 December 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News associations that have discontinued or discourage the use of the adjective "illegal" to describe nouns that describe people include the US [[Associated Press]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ap.org/2013/04/02/illegal-immigrant-no-more/ Illegal Immigrant no more] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822002138/http://blog.ap.org/2013/04/02/illegal-immigrant-no-more/ |date=22 August 2013 }} Associated Press Blog, 2013 April 2&lt;/ref&gt; UK [[Press Association]], [[European Journalism Observatory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nazhmidinova|first=Rukhshona|title=User Generated Racism: Russia’s media and migrants|url=http://en.ejo.ch/8244/ethics_quality/user-generated-racism-russias-media-migrants#more-8244|publisher=The European Journalism Observatory|accessdate=5 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505202900/http://en.ejo.ch/8244/ethics_quality/user-generated-racism-russias-media-migrants#more-8244|archive-date=5 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Journalism Centre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How journalism can rid migration of its sour reputation|url=http://ejc.net/magazine/article/how-journalism-can-rid-migration-of-its-sour-reputation#.U2eXWIGSxA0|publisher=European Journalism Centre|accessdate=5 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505180957/http://ejc.net/magazine/article/how-journalism-can-rid-migration-of-its-sour-reputation#.U2eXWIGSxA0|archive-date=5 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association of European Journalists]], [[Australian Press Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Asylum seekers', 'illegal immigrants' and entry without a visa|url=http://www.presscouncil.org.au/advisory-guidelines/|work=Advisory Guidelines 2011|publisher=Australian Press Council|accessdate=5 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801075645/http://www.presscouncil.org.au/advisory-guidelines/|archive-date=1 August 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian [[Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Angela|title=Missing the Boat?

For example, Associated Press continues to use the term "illegal immigration" to describe the action of entering or residing in a country illegally.

In contrast, in some contexts the term "illegal immigrants" is shortened, often pejoratively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://keller.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/llegals/?_r=0|title=‘Illegals’|access-date=16 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525114202/https://keller.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/llegals/?_r=0|archive-date=25 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "'''illegals'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html|title=Here’s the Reality About Illegal Immigrants in the United States|last=Yee|first=Vivian|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629024527/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html|archive-date=29 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/07/25/crimes_by_illegals_are_buried_in_amnesty_push|title= Crimes by Illegals are Buried in Amnesty Push|access-date= 4 June 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220220/http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/07/25/crimes_by_illegals_are_buried_in_amnesty_push|archive-date= 14 July 2014|dead-url= no|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bazelon |first=Emily |date=23 August 2015 |title=The Unwelcome Return of 'Illegals' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/magazine/the-unwelcome-return-of-illegals.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=19 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818140913/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/magazine/the-unwelcome-return-of-illegals.html |archive-date=18 August 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/15/121-murders-attributed-illegal-immigrants-released/?page=all|title= 121 murders attributed to illegals released by Obama administration|last1= Dinan|first1= Stephen|website= The Washington Times|access-date= 21 August 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150811040145/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/15/121-murders-attributed-illegal-immigrants-released/?page=all|archive-date= 11 August 2015|dead-url= no|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the term '''undocumented''' has been cited by [[The New York Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal, Undocumented, Unauthorized: The Terms of Immigration Reporting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/insider/illegal-undocumented-unauthorized-the-terms-of-immigration-reporting.html|access-date=10 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310171926/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/insider/illegal-undocumented-unauthorized-the-terms-of-immigration-reporting.html|archive-date=10 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a "term preferred by many immigrants and their advocates, but it has a flavor of [[euphemism]] and should be used with caution outside quotation". [[Newsweek]] questions the use of the phrase 'undocumented immigrants' as a method of euphemistic [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]], namely, "a psychological technique that can influence the perception of social phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You Say ‘Illegal Alien.’ I Say ‘Undocumented Immigrant.’ Who’s Right?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/you-say-illegal-alien-i-say-undocumented-immigrant-whos-right-750644|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325231936/http://www.newsweek.com/you-say-illegal-alien-i-say-undocumented-immigrant-whos-right-750644|archive-date=25 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsweek also suggests that persons who enter a country unlawfully cannot be entirely "undocumented" because they "just lack the certain specific documents for legal residency and employment. Many have drivers licenses, debit cards, library cards, and school identifications which are useful documents in specific contexts but not nearly so much for immigration." For example, in the U.S., youths brought into the country illegally are granted access to public K-12 education and benefits regardless of citizenship status,&lt;ref name="Gonzales"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=Roberto G.|year=2011|title=Learning to Be Illegal:  Undocumented Youth and Shifting Legal Contexts in the Transition to Adulthood|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|publisher=[[American Sociological Association]]|volume=76|issue=4|pages=602–619|doi=10.1177/0003122411411901|url=http://www.asanet.org/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Aug11ASRFeature.pdf|accessdate=March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000648/http://www.asanet.org/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Aug11ASRFeature.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the youths are documented for educational purposes, and are not entirely undocumented. U.S. immigration laws do use the phrase '''illegal immigrant''' at least in some contexts.

A related term, '''irregular migration''', is sometimes used e.g. by the [[International Organization for Migration]], but it describes a somewhat wider concept which also includes illegal emigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iom.int/key-migration-terms|title=Key Migration Terms|date=14 January 2015|publisher=|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112042555/https://www.iom.int/key-migration-terms|archive-date=12 January 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal immigration vs unauthorized immigration===
Overstaying a visa is a [[civil violation]] handled by [[immigration court]], while entering (including re-entering) the US without approval from an immigration officer is a crime: specifically a [[misdemeanor]] on the first offense. Illegal reentry after deportation is a federal offense. This is the distinction between the larger group referred to as '''unauthorized immigrants''' and the smaller subgroup referred to as '''criminal immigrants'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[CNN]] |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/24/politics/undocumented-immigrants-not-necessarily-criminal/index.html |title=Are undocumented immigrants committing a crime? Not necessarily |first=Laura |last=Jarrett |date=24 February 2017 |quote=Under federal law, it is a crime for anyone to enter into the US without the approval of an immigration officer -- it's a misdemeanor offense that carries fines and no more than six months in prison. Many foreign nationals, however, enter the country legally every day on valid work or travel visas, and end up overstaying for a variety of reasons. But that's not a violation of federal criminal law -- it's a civil violation that gets handled in immigration court proceedings.&lt;br&gt;So although there are more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the US, they haven't all committed a crime just by being in the country. |access-date=11 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704035122/https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/24/politics/undocumented-immigrants-not-necessarily-criminal/index.html |archive-date=4 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|bolded terminology is not contained in cited source - July 2018|date=July 2018}}

A paper by Spanish economists found that upon legalizing the undocumented immigrant population in Spain, the fiscal revenues increased by around €4,189 per newly legalized immigrant.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The paper found that the wages of the newly legalized immigrants increased after legalization, some low-skilled natives had worse labor market outcomes and high-skilled natives had improved labor market outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

According to economist [[George Borjas]], immigrants may have caused the decline of real wages of US workers without a high school degree by 9% between 1980 and 2000 due to increased competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George|last=Borjas|title=The Labor Demand Curve is Downward Sloping: Reexamining the Impact of Immigration on the Labor Market|work=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=118|number=4|pages=1335–1374|year=2003 |doi=10.1162/003355303322552810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists, such as [[Gordon Hanson]] and [[Douglas Massey]], criticized this view, and said that it is oversimplified and does not account for contradictory evidence, such as the low net illegal immigration from Mexico to the US before the 1980s despite significant economic disparity.&lt;ref name="logic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/ImmigrationCSR26.pdf|title=The Economic Logic of Illegal Immigration.

Since the decline of working class [[blue-collar]] jobs in manufacturing and industry, younger native-born generations have acquired higher education. In the US, only 12% of the labor force has less than a high school education, but 70% of illegal workers from Mexico lack a high school degree.&lt;ref name="logic"/&gt; The majority of new blue-collar jobs qualify as Massey's "underclass" work, and suffer from unreliability, subservient roles and, critically, a lack of potential for advancement. These "underclass" jobs, which have a disproportionate number of undocumented immigrants, include harvesting crops, unskilled labor in landscaping and construction, house-cleaning, and maid and [[busboy]] work in hotels and restaurants. However, as even these "underclass" jobs have higher relative wages than those in home countries they are still attractive for undocumented immigrants and since many undocumented immigrants often anticipate working only temporarily in the destination country, the lack of opportunity for advancement is seen by many as less of a problem. Support for this claim can be seen in a Pew Hispanic Center poll of over 3,000 undocumented immigrants from Mexico in the US, which found that 79% would voluntarily join a [[temporary worker]] program that allowed them to work legally for several years but then required them to leave.&lt;ref name="pew survey"&gt;{{cite web|first=Roberto|last=Suro|title=Survey of Mexican Migrants, Part One: Attitudes about Immigration and Major Demographic Characteristics|work=Pew Hispanic Center|date=2 March 2005|url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/41.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211132206/http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/41.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this it is assumed that the willingness to take undesirable jobs is what gives undocumented immigrants their employment.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; Evidence for this may be seen in the average wages of illegal day laborers in California, which was between $10 and $12 per hour according to a 2005 study, and the fact that this was higher than many entry-level white collar or service jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Abel|last1=Valenzuela, Jr.|first2=Nik|last2=Theodore|first3=Edwin|last3=Meléndez|first4=Ana Luz|last4=Gonzalez|title=On the Corner: Day Labor in the US|work=UCLA Center for the Study of Urban Poverty|date=January 2006|accessdate=11 December 2009|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/issr/csup/uploaded_files/Natl_DayLabor-On_the_Corner1.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010012928/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/issr/csup/uploaded_files/Natl_DayLabor-On_the_Corner1.pdf|archivedate=10 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entry-level white collar and service jobs offer advancement opportunities only for people with work permits and citizenship.

Research{{which?|date=September 2018}} indicates that the advantage to firms employing undocumented immigrants increases as more firms in the industry do so, further increases with the breadth{{clarify|reason=What is market breadth?|date=September 2018}} of a firm's market, and also with the labor intensity of the firm's production process. However, the advantage decreases with the skill level of the firm's workers, meaning that illegal immigrants do not provide as much competitive advantage when a high-skilled workforce is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/pubs/wp/wp1202a.pdf |title=Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, ''Does Employing Undocumented Workers Give Firms a Competitive Advantage?'', November 2012 |access-date=8 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412073407/http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/pubs/wp/wp1202a.pdf |archive-date=12 April 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for illegal immigration==

===Trade liberalization===
In recent years, developing countries have pursued the benefits of [[globalization]] by adopting measures to liberalize trade. But rapid opening of domestic markets may lead to displacement of large numbers of agricultural or unskilled workers, who are more likely to seek employment and a higher quality of life by illegal immigration.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Poverty===
Undocumented immigrants are not impoverished by standards of their home countries. The poorest classes in a developing country may lack the resources needed to mount an attempt to cross illegally, or the connections to friends or family already in the destination country. Studies from the Pew Hispanic Center have shown that the education and wage levels of illegal Mexican immigrants in the US are around the median for Mexico and that they are not a suitable predictor of one's choice to immigrate.&lt;ref name="pew survey"/&gt;

Other examples do show that increases in poverty, especially when associated with immediate crises, can increase the likelihood of illegal migration. The [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], subsequent to the start of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), was associated with widespread poverty and a lower valuation for the peso relative to the dollar.&lt;ref name="pietro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epriee.ncl.ac.uk/dipietro.pdf |accessdate=12 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217070854/http://www.epriee.ncl.ac.uk/dipietro.pdf |archivedate=17 February 2005|title=Trade, Legal, and Illegal Immigration|publisher=University of Westminster|author=Giorgio di Pietro}}{{dubious|date=March 2012}} Accessed 11 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It also marked the start of a massive swell in Mexican immigration, in which net illegal migration to the US increased every year from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s.

There are also examples where [[natural disasters]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] can amplify [[poverty]]-driven migration flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=59616|title=Ethiopia: High population growth could slow development|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=4 March 2012|work=IRIN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611185946/http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=59616|archive-date=11 June 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having family who have immigrated or being from a community with many immigrants is a much better predictor of one's choice to immigrate than poverty.&lt;ref name="pew survey"/&gt; Family reunification visas may be applied for by legal residents or naturalized citizens to bring their family members into a destination state legally, but these visas may be limited in number and subject to yearly quotas. This may result in family members entering illegally in order to reunify. From studying Mexican migration patterns, Douglas Massey finds that the likelihood that a Mexican national will emigrate illegally to the US increases dramatically if they have one or more family members already residing in the United States, legally or illegally.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;

===Wars and asylum===
[[File:20101009 Arrested refugees immigrants in Fylakio detention center Thrace Evros Greece restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Arrested refugees-immigrants in Fylakio detention center, Evros, Greece.]]
[[Unauthorised arrival]] into another country may be prompted by the need to escape civil war or [[Political repression|repression]] in the country of origin. However, somebody who flees such a situation is in most countries under no circumstances an undocumented immigrant. If victims of forced displacement apply for asylum in the country they fled to and are granted refugee status they have the right to remain permanently. If [[asylum seekers]] are not granted some kind of legal protection status, then they may have to leave the country, or stay as illegal immigrants.

According to the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] [[refugees]] should be exempted from immigration laws and should expect protection from the country they entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm|title=Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|date= 28 July 1951|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=19 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725074145/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm |archivedate=25 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, up to the countries involved to decide if a particular immigrant is a refugee or not, and hence whether they are subject to the immigration controls. Furthermore, countries that did not sign the 1951 Refugee Convention or do not attempt to follow its guidelines are likely to consider refugees and asylum seekers as illegal immigrants.

===Deprivation of citizenship===
{{See also|Denaturalization}}
In a 2012 news story, the [[Common Sense Media|''CSM'']] reported, "The estimated 750,000 [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]], one of the most miserable and oppressed minorities in the world, are deeply resentful of their almost complete absence of civil rights in [[Myanmar]]. In 1982, the military junta stripped the Rohingya of their Myanmar citizenship, classing them as illegal immigrants and rendering them [[Statelessness|stateless]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peter Ford |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2012/0612/Why-deadly-race-riots-could-rattle-Myanmar-s-fledgling-reforms |title=Why deadly race riots could rattle Myanmar's fledgling reforms |publisher=''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' |date=12 June 2012 |access-date=6 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105222644/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2012/0612/Why-deadly-race-riots-could-rattle-Myanmar-s-fledgling-reforms |archive-date=5 January 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, people born on national territory (henceforth not "immigrants") do not automatically obtain the nationality of their birthplace, and may have no legal title of residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://149.101.23.2/graphics/publicaffairs/factsheets/948.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070503023041/http://149.101.23.2/graphics/publicaffairs/factsheets/948.htm |archivedate=3 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems faced by illegal immigrants==
Aside from the possibility that they may be intercepted and deported, illegal immigrants also face other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/migration-exploitation-illegal-labor-domestic-servitude-sex|title=Spheres of Exploitation: Thwarting Actors Who Profit from Illegal Labor, Domestic Servitude, and Sex Work|author=Meghan Benton|authors=|date=January 2014|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|page=|docket=|quote=|author-link=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of access to services===
Illegal immigrants usually have no or very limited access to [[public health]] systems, proper housing, [[education]] and [[bank]]s. Some immigrants [[forgery|forge]] identity documents  to get the access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=98736 |title=World´S Top Teaching Award In Medieval Studies Goes To Fsu Professor |publisher=American Chronicle |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194755/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=98736 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
{{main article|Human Trafficking}}
After the end of the legal international [[slave trade]] by the Europeans and the United States in the early 19th century, the illegal importation of [[slave]]s has continued, albeit at much reduced levels.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} For example, research at [[San Diego State University]] estimates that there are 2.4 million victims of human trafficking among illegal Mexican immigrants in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/240223.pdf |title=Looking for a Hidden Population: Trafficking of Migrant Laborers in San Diego County |access-date=1 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729070836/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/240223.pdf |archive-date=29 July 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not as common as in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, some women are smuggled into the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/09/23_16691.shtml|title=Modern slavery thriving in the U.S.|first=Janet|last=Gilmore|date=23 September 2004|work=UC Berkeley News|accessdate=4 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018163408/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/09/23_16691.shtml|archive-date=18 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have been kidnapped or tricked into slavery to work as laborers, after entering the country, for example in factories. Those trafficked in this manner often face additional barriers to escaping slavery, since their status as undocumented immigrants makes it difficult for them to gain access to help or services. For example, [[Burma|Burmese]] women trafficked into Thailand and forced to work in factories or as prostitutes may not speak the language and may be vulnerable to abuse by police due to their undocumented immigrant status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bales |first = Kevin |authorlink = Kevin Bales |title = Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy |publisher = University of California Press |year= 1999 |isbn = 0-520-22463-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidnapping and ransoms===
In some regions, people that are still en route to their destination country are also sometimes kidnapped, for example for [[ransom]]. In some instances, they are also [[torture]]d, [[rape]]d, and killed if the requested ransom does not arrive. One case in point are the [[Demographics of Eritrea|Eritrean]] migrants that are en route to Israel. A large number of them are captured in north Sinai (Egypt) and Eastern Sudan and held in the buildings in north Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asmarino.com/alewana/2038-close-the-torture-houses-in-north-sinai-and-egypt|title=Close the Torture Houses in North Sinai and Egypt|work=[AI] Asmarino Independent|access-date=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704101108/http://asmarino.com/alewana/2038-close-the-torture-houses-in-north-sinai-and-egypt|archive-date=4 July 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sound of torture documentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[revolutions of 1989|fall of the Iron Curtain]], [[Western Europe]] is being confronted with a serious problem related to the sexual exploitation of undocumented immigrants (especially from [[Eastern Europe]]), for the purpose of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/ukraine/eeeu.htm|title=Eastern Europe Exports Flesh to the EU: The Natashi Trade|first=Francois|last=Loncle|date=December 2001|accessdate=4 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225080438/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/ukraine/eeeu.htm|archive-date=25 December 2005|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States human trafficking victims often pass through the porous border with Mexico. In an effort to curb the spread of this affliction, California Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]] and Mexico Attorney General [[Marisela Morales Ibáñez]] signed an accord in 2012 to expand prosecutions of criminals typically members of transnational gangs who engage in the trafficking of human beings between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/human-trafficking-victims_n_1929297.html|title=Human Trafficking Victims Often Undocumented Immigrants, Transnational Initiatives Launch To Curb Growing Trend|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129072023/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/human-trafficking-victims_n_1929297.html|archive-date=29 November 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploitation of labour===
{{main|Exploitation of labour}}
Most countries have laws requiring workers to have proper documentation, often intended to prevent or minimize the employment of undocumented immigrants.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}} However the penalties against employers are often small and the acceptable identification requirements vague, ill-defined and seldom checked or enforced, making it easy for employers to hire illegal labor.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}} Where the [[minimum wage]] is several times the prevailing wage in the home country, employers sometimes pay less than the legal minimum wage or have unsafe working conditions, relying on the reluctance of illegal workers to report the violations to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Michael|last2=Eggerth|first2=Donald|last3=Jacobson|first3=Jeffrey|title=Undocumented Status as a Social Determinant of Occupational Safety and Health: The Workers' Perspective|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|date=2015|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1127–1137|doi=10.1002/ajim.22531|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%27_perspective|accessdate=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405073634/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%27_perspective|archive-date=5 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

Immigrants from countries that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the [[United States–Mexico border]], the Mona Channel between the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], [[Fuerteventura]], and the [[Strait of Otranto]].

An official estimate puts the number of people who died in illegal crossings across the U.S.–Mexican border between 1998 and 2004 at 1,954 (see [[immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border]]).

[[Human smuggling]] is the practice of intermediaries aiding undocumented immigrants in crossing over international borders in financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, [[human trafficking]]. A human smuggler will facilitate [[illegal entry]] into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, [[fraud]], or [[deception]] to obtain and transport people.

Types of notorious human smugglers include [[Snakehead (gang)|Snakehead]] [[gang]]s present in [[mainland China]] (especially in [[Fujian]]) that smuggle laborers into [[Pacific Rim]] states (making [[Chinatown]]s frequent centers of illegal immigration) and "coyotes", who smuggle undocumented immigrants to the [[Southwestern United States]] and have been known to abuse or even kill their passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20060723-9999-1m23killed.html|title=Immigrant found slain in Grant Hill house|first=Lola|last=Sherman|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=23 July 2006|accessdate=4 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620221607/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20060723-9999-1m23killed.html|archive-date=20 June 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes undocumented immigrants are abandoned by their human traffickers if there are difficulties, often dying in the process.

At present, a French born child of foreign parents does not automatically obtain French nationality until residency duration conditions are met&lt;ref name="iom5" /&gt;. Since 1 January 2005, a child born in Ireland does not automatically acquire Irish nationality unless certain conditions are met.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation.ie"/&gt;

===Sham marriages===
Another method is by entering into a [[sham marriage]] where the marriage is contracted into for purely immigration advantage by a couple who are not in a genuine relationship. Common reasons for sham marriages are to gain [[immigration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Ginger owner sentenced for sham-marriage scheme |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011129819_thaiginger20m.html |publisher=Seattle Times |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=11 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006165550/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011129819_thaiginger20m.html |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this is called '''immigration fraud'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owner of Thai Ginger admits to immigration fraud – paying people to 'marry' her relatives|url=http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/bel/news/65882672.html|publisher=Bellevue Reporter|date=23 October 2009|accessdate=11 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028085213/http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/bel/news/65882672.html|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) residency, work or [[citizenship]] rights for one or both of the spouses, or for other benefits.

In the United Kingdom, those who arrange, participate in, or officiate over a sham marriage may be charged with a number of offenses, including assisting unlawful immigration and conspiracy to facilitate breach of immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;Crown Prosecution Service, [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/h_to_k/immigration/#b01 Immigration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215741/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/h_to_k/immigration/#b01 |date=8 April 2014 }}, accessed 4 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main article|Immigration in Australia}}
Official government sources put the number of visa overstayers in Australia at approximately 50,000. This has been the official number of illegal immigrants for about 25 years and is considered to be low. Other sources have placed it at up to 100,000, but no detailed study has been completed to quantify this number, which could be significantly higher.

On 1 June 2013, the ''Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Act 2013'' commenced. This new law puts the onus on businesses to ensure that their employees maintain the necessary work entitlements in Australia. The new legislation also enables the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship to levy infringement notices against business (AUD $15,300) and individual (AUD $3,060) employers on a [[strict liability]] basis – meaning that there is no requirement to prove fault, negligence or intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vsure.com.au/employer-sanctions-legislation/ |title=Employer Sanctions Legislation |publisher=vSure |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060141/http://www.vsure.com.au/employer-sanctions-legislation/ |archive-date=23 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immi.gov.au/managing-australias-borders/compliance/legalworkers/factsheet.htm |title=Fact Sheet – Employing Legal Workers |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061217/http://www.immi.gov.au/managing-australias-borders/compliance/legalworkers/factsheet.htm |archive-date=23 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhutan===
{{Main article|Illegal immigration in Bhutan}}
[[Immigration in Bhutan]] by Nepalese settlers ([[Lhotshampa]]) began slowly towards the end of the 19th century. The government passed the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985]] to clarify and try to enforce the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958]] to control the flood of illegal immigration. Those individuals who could not provide proof of residency prior to 1958 were adjudged to be undocumented immigrants. In 1991 and 1992, [[Bhutan]] expelled roughly 139,110 ethnic [[Nepal]]is, most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since. The United States has offered to resettle 60,000 of the 107,000 [[Bhutanese refugees]] of Nepalese origin now living in U.N. refugee camps in Nepal. The Bhutanese government, even today, has not been able to sort the problem of giving citizenship to those people who are married to Bhutanese, even though they have been in the country for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm |title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' |author = Bhaumik, Subir |date = 7 November 2007 |work = BBC News |accessdate = 19 September 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080819203907/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm |archive-date = 19 August 2008 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{See also|Illegal immigration in Brazil}}
Brazil has long been part of international migration routes. In 2009, the government estimated the number if illegal immigrants at about 200,000 people; a [[Catholic]] charity working with immigrants said there were 600,000 illegal immigrants (75,000 of which from [[Bolivia]]). That same year, the [[Brazilian Parliament]] approved an amnesty, opening a six-month window for all foreigners to seek legalization irrespective of their previous standing before the law. Brazil had last legalized all immigrants in 1998; bilateral deals, one of which promoted the legalization of all reciprocal immigrants with Bolivia to date, signed in 2005, are also common.&lt;ref name="Globo"&gt;{{cite web |author=Da BBC |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL365307-5598,00.html |title=Globo.com |publisher=G1.globo.com |date= |accessdate=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925090704/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL365307-5598,00.html |archive-date=25 September 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After signing the 2009 amnesty bill into law, President [[Lula da Silva]] said, in a speech, that "repression and intolerance against immigrants will not solve the problems caused by [[2008 economic crisis|the economic crisis]]", thereby also harshly criticizing the "policy of discrimination and prejudice" against immigrants in developed nations.

According to a pro-Indian scholar, the trip to India from Bangladesh is one of the cheapest in the world, with a trip costing around Rs.2000 (around $30 US), which includes the fee for the "Tour Operator". As Bangladeshis are cultural similar to the [[Bengali people]] in India, they are able to pass off as Indian citizens and settle down in any part of India to establish a future.,&lt;ref name=ibtimes/&gt; for a very small price. This false identity can be bolstered with false documentation available for as little as Rs.200 ($3 US) can even make them part of the vote bank.&lt;ref name=facingglobal /&gt;


India is constructing barriers on its eastern borders to combat the surge of migrants. The [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier]] is 4,000&amp;nbsp;km (2,500&amp;nbsp;mi) long.

Tibetans started pouring into Nepal after a failed anti-Chinese [[1959 Tibetan uprising|uprising in Tibet]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41818 NEPAL: Tibetans Warned of Deportation to China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609162646/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41818 |date=9 June 2012 }}.

===Philippines===
It was estimated by Teresita Ang-See, a prominent leader and activist of the [[Chinese Filipino]] community, that by 2007, as much as 100,000 illegal immigrants from [[China]] are living in the Philippines, a tenth of the ethnic Chinese population. The latest influx has come in part because of Manila's move in 2005 to liberalise entry procedures for Chinese tourists and investors, a move that helped triple the number of Chinese visitors to 133,000 last year. Many of the new Chinese immigrants encounter hostility from many Filipinos, including Filipino-born Chinese, for being perceived as engaging in criminal activities and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landingin |first=Roel |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/194f1172-3a01-11dc-9d73-0000779fd2ac.html |title=Paradox for Philippines as Chinese set up shop |publisher=FT.com |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===

Russia experiences a constant flow of immigration. On average, 200,000 legal immigrants enter the country every year; about half are ethnic [[Russians]] from other republics of the former Soviet Union. In addition, there are an estimated 10–12 million illegal immigrants in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia cracking down on illegal migrants|work=International Herald Tribune|date=15 January 2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/15/news/migrate.php|accessdate=15 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915210918/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/15/news/migrate.php|archive-date=15 September 2008|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a significant influx of ethnic [[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], and [[Uzbeks]] into large Russian cities in recent years, which has been viewed very unfavorably by many citizens and contributed to [[Russian nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2452989.stm|title=Moscow to deport Tajiks by air|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=19 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040714090020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2452989.stm|archive-date=14 July 2004|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/news/hotspots/06-10-2006/84915-Georgia_Russia-0|title=Russian police determined to oust Georgians from Moscow|work=English pravda.ru|access-date=19 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304032232/http://english.pravda.ru/news/hotspots/06-10-2006/84915-Georgia_Russia-0|archive-date=4 March 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://russiatoday.ru/news/news/2622 Russian nationalists protest against illegal immigration in Irkutsk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306035049/http://russiatoday.ru/news/news/2622 |date=6 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many immigrant ethnic groups have much higher birth rates than native Russians, further shifting the balance. Some [[Chinese people|Chinese]] flee the overpopulation and birth control regulations of their home country and settle in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]] and in southern [[Siberia]]. Russia's main Pacific port and naval base of [[Vladivostok]], once closed to foreigners, today is bristling with Chinese markets, restaurants and trade houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Chinese_Come_To_Russia.html|title=Chinese Come To Russia|work=terradaily.com|access-date=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117173305/http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Chinese_Come_To_Russia.html|archive-date=17 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been occurring a lot since the Soviet collapse.

Illegal border crossing is considered a crime, and captured illegal border crossers have been sentenced to prison terms. For example, ''[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]'' reported in October 2008 the case of a [[North Korea]]n who was detained after illegally crossing the [[Amur River]] from China. Considered by Russian authorities an "[[economic migrant]]", he was sentenced to 6 months in prison and was to be deported to the country of his nationality after serving his sentence, even though he may now risk an even heavier penalty there. That was just one of the 26 cases year-to-date of illegal entrants, of various nationalities, receiving criminal punishment in [[Amur Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rg.ru/2008/10/29/reg-priamurje/koreets-anons.html|author=Yevgeniy Basenko (Евгений Басенко)|title=A North Korean has swum across the Amur, only to end up in a Russian prison.

===Saudi Arabia===
{{Main article|Illegal immigration in Saudi Arabia}}
In 2004, [[Saudi Arabia]] began construction of a [[Saudi–Yemen barrier]] between its territory and [[Yemen]] to prevent the unauthorized movement of people and goods into and out of the Kingdom. Anthony H. Cordesman labeled it a "separation barrier."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony H. Cordesman, ''Saudi Arabia: National Security in a Troubled Region'',

===Schengen Area===

[[File:Non-EU citizens found to be illegally present in the EU-28 and EFTA, Eurostat 2015.png|thumb|Eurostat: Non-EU citizens found to be illegally present in the EU-28 and EFTA, 2015]]
The Schengen Area is a multilateral agreement between 26 states in which they in most cases abolish the border control between themselves. These states include most of the EU countries, as well as the EEC countries Norway, Switzerland and Iceland. Any person who is physically inside any of the Schengen states will usually be able to travel to any other Schengen state without hindrance from the law enforcement, even if he or she has no legal right to enter another Schengen Area member state. A person who wishes to immigrate illegally to a Schengen Area member state may therefore find it more practical to enter it through another member state. According to a BBC report from 2012, over 80% of illegal immigrants entering the European Union pass through Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18371800 |work=BBC |title=Journey across crisis-hit Greece:Immigration challenge |date=9 June 2012 |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630212258/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18371800 |archive-date=30 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU countries that are not members of the Schengen Agreement are still committed to allow lawful entry by citizens of EU countries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l33152 |title = Access to European Union law |access-date = 5 August 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150731231854/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l33152 |archive-date = 31 July 2015 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; they may however exercise border control at [[File:Migrants in Hungary 2015 Aug 003.jpg|thumb|Migrants along the Balkan route crossing from Serbia into Hungary, 24 August 2015]]their discretion.

Citizens within The EU is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries that together cover much of the European continent &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/index_en.htm|title=How the EU works|work=europa.eu|access-date=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810063033/http://europa.eu/about-eu/index_en.htm|archive-date=10 August 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Schengen Agreement does not regulate treatment of persons who enter the Schengen Area illegally. This is therefore left to the individual states, and other applicable international treaties and European [[case law]]. Illegal immigration to Schengen and to Europe in general was increasing sharply since approximately early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10865652/Illegal-immigration-to-Europe-shows-sharp-rise.html|title = Illegal immigration to Europe shows sharp rise|publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author = David Barrett|access-date = 5 April 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180531080844/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10865652/Illegal-immigration-to-Europe-shows-sharp-rise.html|archive-date = 31 May 2018|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main causes for this increase are the conflicts that followed the [[Arab Spring]]; in particular, the civil war in Syria has driven millions of people from their homes, and the disintegration of the Libyan government removed a major barrier for the African migrants.

Illegal immigration to some of the Schengen Area states might face different consideration depending on countries such as Bulgaria, France, Greece.

The Venezuelan government has no specific policies on refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LSGZ-7AYHES?OpenDocument|title=Colombia: UNHCR signs agreement with Venezuelan "Banco del Pueblo Soberano"|work=ReliefWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childsoldiersglobalreport.org/content/venezuela Venezuela | Child Soldiers Global Report 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826063839/http://www.childsoldiersglobalreport.org/content/venezuela |date=26 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="701">'''Interjectional theory''' is a theory of language formulated by the pre-Socratic philosopher [[Democritus]], ca. 460 BC to ca. 370 BC, who argued that human speech derives from a variety of sounds and outcries of an emotional nature.  These ideas were later held by [[Epicurus]] and [[Lucretius]] who cited Democritus as their authority.  The theory continued to influence the study of the [[origin of language]] into the 18th century when it was again put forward by [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]].

'''Jean-Michel Berthelot''' (1945 – 5 February 2006) was a [[French people|French]] [[sociologist]], [[philosopher]], [[epistemologist]] and [[social theorist]], specialist in [[philosophy of social sciences]], [[history of sociology]], [[sociology of education]], [[sociology of knowledge]], [[sociology of science]] and [[sociology of body]].

== Epistemology and history of sociology ==
Berthelot's philosophy and history of social sciences was influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[French historical epistemology]] of [[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard]], [[Georges Canguilhem|Canguilhem]], [[Alexandre Koyré|Koyré]] and [[Gilles-Gaston Granger|Gaston Granger]], the [[falsifiability]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]] and the epistemological reflections of sociologists, from [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], [[Max Weber|Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]] to [[Jean-Claude Passeron|Passeron]], [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]].

Jean-Michel Berthelot's epistemological work combined the [[philosophy and history of science]] in the study of [[Sociological theory|sociological theories]] to understand the logic of construction and [[Theory of justification|justification]] of sociological knowledge. Berthelot created a typology of [[sociological explanation]]s, constituted by six logical [[schemas of intelligibility]]: causal, actancial, hermeneutic, structural, functionalist and dialectic. These types of explanation were the result of formalization of [[theory]] and [[arguments]] in the history of sociology.

Berthelot, at the same time, criticized the [[epistemic relativism]] and defended the pluralism and openness in sociology, which makes him, in the contemporary debate on philosophy of social sciences, a [[rationalist]] and [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]]. The pluralism in sociology, in Berthelot's epistemology, is not only inevitably, but even fruitful for the research and theoretical debate.

==Education and career==
Wilson received her baccalaureate summa cum laude in mathematics from the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1987, before starting a doctorate program in philosophy at the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] in 1994, and eventually receiving her doctorate in philosophy from [[Cornell University]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Wilson accepted an appointment as the William Wilhartz Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Michigan]] in 2002, before moving to the [[University of Toronto, Scarborough]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; From 2014 to 2016, Wilson held a simultaneous appointment as a Regular Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Eidyn Research Centre at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Wilson has also held visiting positions at the [[University of Cologne]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], the [[University of Barcelona]], [[Australian National University]], and the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas and publications==

'''Kalani Oceanside Retreat''', also known as '''Kalani Honua''' or '''Kalani''', is a non-profit retreat center located on the [[Big Island of Hawai'i]]. It was established in 1975 and focuses on natural and holistic living, yoga and relaxation, and spiritual retreats. Kalani is staffed by a core group of administrators, managers, and coordinators, plus over 100 volunteers from around the world.  

In May 2018, during the [[2018 lower Puna eruption]], Kalani closed its operations, ostensibly temporarily, stating "Recent earthquake activity on [[Kilauea]]’s south flank and lava eruptions in the [[Leilani Estates]] Subdivision are affecting air quality."&lt;ref&gt;https://register.kalani.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Hale ʻĀina - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Northeastern part of the main campus with Hale ʻĀina]]
Kalani Oceanside Retreat, founded by [[Richard Koob]] and Earnest Morgan in 1975, is a non-profit retreat center, occupying a 120-acre compound located in the [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna District]] of the [[Big Island of Hawai'i]].  Kalani's mission is "to provide a fun, safe, and educational retreat village which encourages ALOHA love for life in each person's own deepest way through participation in abundant nature, culture, and wellness experiences". In keeping with the focus on nature, culture, and wellness, Kalani hosts diverse residential workshops; sponsors community arts and special events programs; provides lodging and meals for guests; oversees volunteer, sabbatical, and visiting artist education programs; and houses a sustainable community of residents in an ecovillage.&lt;ref name=Yamamoto2011&gt;Yamamoto, Luci, and Gorry, Conner. 2011.

== History ==

[[File:Ocean Vista - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Ocean Vista (western part of Kalani Kai)]]
In 1975, professional dancers [[Richard Koob]] and Earnest Morgan purchased the original 19-acre property, which they called Kalani Honua, translated as "harmony of Heaven on Earth". They based the center on their ideal of building a community to "celebrate art, nature, health, and spirit".

In the early years, Kalani was a small family operation. A conscious effort was made to include Hawaiian natives in the growing community. 

Workshops and classes focused on topics such as Hawaiian culture, yoga, dance, painting, music, and creative writing. Workshop and course offerings increased as Kalani became known as a destination retreat center. Extensive volunteer, sabbatical, and visiting artist education programs were developed, and Kalani grew to be the largest and oldest retreat center in Hawaii.

Over time, the Kalani campus was expanded to its current 120 acres, with purchase of the adjacent 94-acre Kalani Kai ("Heavenly Sea") parcel, and the 6-acre Kalani Mauka ("Heavenly Uplands") parcel, land specifically dedicated to building a sustainable agricultural community.&lt;ref name=Gleason2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Staton2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koob2002/&gt;

Kalani oversees a residential volunteer education program, with more than 100 volunteers on site at a time. Volunteers are expected to contribute to the community through work in the kitchen, housekeeping, grounds, maintenance, or administrative office, and are encouraged to participate in daily life in the community, as well as workshops, classes, and Arts Program activities. Sabbatical and Visiting Artist programs are offered to encourage self-development and artistic endeavor, as well as to enrich the community.&lt;ref&gt;Rodman, Margaret C. 2007.

As of 2013, the annual economic impact of Kalani was estimated at nearly $10 million. The majority of Kalani's expenditures stay in the state, and contribute to the local economy of the Puna District,  the poorest district in Hawaiʻi. All proceeds from guest stays go into Kalani’s community programming and services. According to Kalani founder Richard Koob "[Kalani buys] as much produce as we can from local farmers, with many farmers growing specifically to supply Kalani’s needs".&lt;ref name=Gleason2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Retirement2013/&gt;

== Structure and management ==
[[File:Kalani Oceanside Retreat Hale.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Hale (guest accommodation)]]

Kalani's facilities include simple guest lodging, a large community dining area (dining lanai), numerous buildings and rooms dedicated to workshops and classes, resident housing and camping areas, and a clothing optional pool and spa area. Grounds include gardens, open space, recreational areas, permaculture plantings, and natural areas.&lt;ref name=Mann2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Staton2003/&gt;

Kalani's Wellness Department offers land and aquatic bodywork, including traditional [[Lomilomi massage|Hawaiian LomiLomi]], [[Thai massage]], and [[Watsu]].&lt;ref name =Yamamoto2011/&gt;{{rp|233}}&lt;ref name=Ballou2010&gt;Ballou, Linda. 2010.

Kalani serves healthy buffet-style meals in a roofed patio known in Hawaii as a "lanai". The dining lanai is considered to play a central role in the community, described as a gathering place where one "can experience the daily rhythms of assembly and departure reminiscent of ancient village life". A guide to Kalani's cuisine describes the food as "a Pacific fusion of local, Thai, Indian, Italian, and many other cuisines".&lt;ref name=Mather2009&gt;Mather, Jonathan, Joohee Mather, and George Pisue.

For 38 years [[Richard Koob]] served as the Director of Kalani. Lester John ("LJ") Bates III was appointed as Kalani’s Executive Director in November 2012, and after a period of transition Richard Koob officially retired in July 2013. Richard continues as a Kalani Board Member and Director Emeritus, assisting with the realization of Kalani's second thirty-year plan. Kalani appointed a new Executive Director, Joel Tan, in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kalanioceanside.org/about About Us]. ''KalaniOceanside.org''. Retrieved May 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalani operates with a small paid staff and a large volunteer workforce. Institutional structure comprises a sustainable living educational focus in all departments: Programs, Cultural Heritage, Culinary/Kitchen,  Ho'okipa/Housekeeping, Maintenance, New Construction, Permaculture/Horticulture, Information Management,  Student/Faculty Services, Wellness/Massage, and Administration.&lt;ref name=Gleason2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=KalaniBoard2012/&gt;

Kalani houses an "[[ecovillage]]" of resident [[Environmental stewardship|"stewards"]] who live onsite and contribute to the community in a variety of ways.  Resident housing is primarily in clusters of [[Sustainable architecture|eco-cottages]], with an emphasis on [[sustainable living]].&lt;ref name=Mann2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crichlow2008/&gt;

== Environment ==
Kalani is located on the [[Red Road (Hawaii)|Red Road]] (Highway 137 or Kapoho-Kalapana Road), named because it used to be paved with red cinder from the Kapoho eruption of 1960. The road winds along rugged cliffs overlooking the ocean, through tropical rainforest, recent lava flows, and tunnel-like canopies of kamani (''[[Calophyllum inophyllum]]''), milo (''[[Thespesia populnea]]''), and hala (''[[Pandanus tectorius]]'') trees. 

Nearby natural areas include the [[Kapoho, Hawaii|Kapoho Tide Pools]] (officially named the Wai Opae Tide Pools Marine Life Conservation District), a protected coral reef ecosystem; Ahalunai Beach Park, a volcanically heated hot pond; Isaac Hale Beach Park, a protected section of coastline popular for swimming, surfing, and boating; MacKenzie State Recreation Area, a secluded park featuring groves of ironwood trees and lava tubes that open to the ocean; Aʻakepa, a hidden expanse of lava flats and tide pools with tidal channels and small lagoons; and Kehena Beach, a natural black sand beach.&lt;ref name =Yamamoto2011/&gt;{{rp|}}

'''Luck egalitarianism''' is a view about [[distributive justice]] espoused by a variety of [[egalitarian]] and other [[political philosopher]]s. According to this view, justice demands that variations in how well off people are should be wholly determined by the responsible choices people make and not to differences in their unchosen circumstances. This expresses the intuition that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own.

==Theory==
Luck egalitarians therefore distinguish between outcomes that are the result of brute luck (e.g. misfortunes in [[genetics|genetic makeup]], or being struck by a bolt of [[lightning]]) and those that are the consequence of conscious options (such as career choice or fair gambles). Luck egalitarianism is intended as a fundamental normative idea that might guide our thinking about justice rather than as an immediate policy prescription. The idea has its origin in [[John Rawls]]' thought that distributive shares should not be influenced by arbitrary factors. Luck egalitarians disagree among themselves about the proper way to measure how well off people are (for instance, whether we should measure [[material wealth]], psychological [[happiness]] or some other factor) and the related issue of how to assess the value of their resources.

Many philosophers think that the term "luck egalitarianism"&lt;!-- who? --&gt; is a misnomer, because many so-called "luck egalitarians" (of the 'resourcist' strand at least) do not in fact want to equalize luck or eliminate uncertainty, but instead believe that individuals should be equal in the amount of resources they have when facing luck or uncertainty.

==Criticism of theory==

The position is controversial within some currents of egalitarian thought, and the [[philosopher]] [[Elizabeth S. Anderson]] has been a vocal critic of it &amp;mdash; on the ground that, amongst other things, the fact that something is chosen does not necessarily make it acceptable. An example of this would be a robber offering someone the choice "Your [[money]] or your [[life]]," which choice some theorists, including Thomas Hobbes (''Leviathan'' XIV: "Covenants Extorted by Feare are Valide") have regarded as presumptively binding. She also claims that luck egalitarianism expresses a demeaning pity towards the disadvantaged, basing their claims to compensation not on equality but inferiority, and excludes many individuals from the social conditions of their freedom simply on the basis that it is judged to be their fault for losing them. Further, it involves the state making highly moralistic and intrusive judgements about the choices that individuals make, and seems to lead to very counter-intuitive conclusions: those who voluntarily enter jobs with higher-than-average risks, or who 'choose' to live in geographical locations prone to natural disasters may make no claim on others if they suffer as a result of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Elizabeth S.|date=1999-01-01|title=What Is the Point of Equality?|jstor=10.1086/233897|journal=Ethics|volume=109|issue=2|pages=287–337|doi=10.1086/233897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Hurley has argued that any attempt to ground egalitarianism in issues concerning luck and responsibility must fail, because there is no non-circular way of specifying an ''egalitarian'' baseline rather than any other baseline. For instance, a luck inegalitarian could believe that the baseline from which we should correct luck is one where huge inequalities exist. Without merely assuming equality, there seems to be no way of coming to prefer one approach over the other.

==Global luck egalitarianism==

Global luck egalitarianism is a view about distributive justice at the global level associated with cosmopolitan moral theory. It starts from the premise that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own and applies this intuition across borders. Global luck egalitarians characteristically believe that moral agents may have duties to mitigate the brute luck of distant others. Proponents of this school of thought are amongst others [[Simon Caney]] and arguably [[Charles Beitz]]; opponents, most of whom reject the above premise either in its entirety or with respect to inequalities in which one party's welfare is at least above some minimum level, include [[Robert Nozick]].

==Advocates of theory==
Prominent advocates of luck egalitarianism have included [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Richard Arneson]], [[Gerald Cohen]], [[John Roemer]], Eric Rakowski, and Kok-Chor Tan.

The '''Moderate objectivism''' account of moral principles is based on the [[ethics]] of Sir [[William David Ross]] (1877–1940).  Moderate objectivism adheres to basic notions of the [[Natural Law Theory]].  W. D. Ross refers to these moderate objectivists' accounts of moral principles as “''[[prima facie]]'' principles” which are valid rules of action that one should generally adhere to but, in cases of moral conflict, may be overridable by another moral principle, hence the moderation.

==Overview==
''Prima facie'' principles contain duties that are correlated with many ethical theories.  Such duties include fidelity, fulfilling commitments, truth and promises; justice, giving people what they deserve;  respect for freedom; beneficence, improving the conditions of others; non-injury; self-improvement, stemming from the possibility of improving one’s own condition with respect to virtue, intelligence, and happiness; non-parasitism, and most importantly reparation, the duty of making up for wrongful acts previously done to others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Ross believed that these duties are to be followed and remain with each person's thought processes of behavior because it is their moral obligation to do so.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Also, ''prima facie'' principles prove the existence of ethical principles that are binding on rational beings.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Pojman, on the other hand created ten similar principles “necessary for the good life within a flourishing human community.”  He refers to these principles as the “core morality.”  These simple, common sense principles include such moral rules as:
*do not kill innocent people,
*do not cause unnecessary pain,
*do not lie or deceive, cheat or steal,
*honor your promises,
*do not deprive another of his/her freedom,
*show gratitude,
*help others,
*do justice, and
*obey just laws.

Both ''prima facie'' and core morality are exceedingly similar unlike the ideas of objectivism and absolutism.  As said before, absolutists pursue the notion of “do the act that is set and given and do nothing else regardless of the situation.”{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  A good example of ethical absolutism is [[Kantian ethics#Moral philosophy|Kantian deontology]].

The absolutist idea is one that is set in stone and there is no changing a single part or the whole theory would be paradoxical, conflicting with all the beliefs an absolutist has come to live by.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} A more moderate following would be the moderate objectivism because these objectivists are inclined to act according to the principle of benevolence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Understandably, absolutists initially made the choice to follow these strict, concrete ways, but when it comes to something that involves acts of vindictiveness there is no way a being of reason could go through with such an act; it would be completely immoral according to a moderate objectivist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5913">'''Natural morality''' describes a form of [[morality]] that is based on how humans evolved, rather than a morality acquired from [[Norm (sociology)|societal norms]] or religious teachings.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] is central to the modern conception of natural morality, although its roots go back at least to [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. 
&lt;!--
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seigfried|first=Hans|date=July 1992|title=Nietzsche's natural morality|journal=The Journal of Value lnquiry|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers.|volume=26|issue=3|pages=423-431|issn=1573-0492 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Darwinian morality==
[[Charles Darwin]] defends a naturalist approach to [[morality]]. In ''[[The Descent of Man]]'', he argues that moral behaviour has outgrown from animal tendency for [[empathy]] through [[evolution of morality]]. By comparing human and animal behavior through a [[naturalist]] approach, he concludes that moral sense is based on the species' sociability, notably [[altruism]].

===Altruism and selfishness===
In Darwin's view, empathy lays as the foundation for our actions, as opposed to [[selfishness]]. He states that humans can generally distinguish between altruism (the "high moral rules") and selfishness (the "low moral rules"):&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p.122].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The higher are founded on the social instinct, and relate to the welfare of others. They are supported by the approbation of our fellow-men and by reason. The lower rules, though some of them when implying self-sacrifice hardly deserve to be called lower, relate chiefly to self, and arise from public opinion, matured by experience and cultivation..}}

===Morality from sympathy===
Darwin suggests [[sympathy]] is at the core of sociability and is an [[instinct]]ive emotion found in most [[Sociality|social animals]]. The ability to recognize and act upon  others' distress or danger, is a suggestive evidence of instinctive sympathy; common mutual services found among many social animals, such as hunting and travelling in groups, warning others of danger and mutually defending one another, are some examples of instinctive sympathy Darwin offers.&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p. 100-104].&lt;/ref&gt; He insists it must be sympathy that compels an individual to risk his or her own life for another from his community.&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p. 103].&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin suggests further that the role of acceptance of others acts as a guide for conduct; sympathy enables to obtain approval of others instead of rejection. Social animals, when separated from the herd, cannot endure solitude and oftentimes perish. Darwin argues social animals have a natural dislike for solitude, and states: "solitary confinement is one of the severest punishments which can be inflicted."&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p. 108].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural morality for survival===
Because of the instinctive nature of sympathy and its general recurrence among many [[social animals]], Darwin deduces this emotional character must be inherited through [[natural selection]]. From a naturalist point of view, it is probable that instinctive sympathy was first developed for animals to thrive by living in society just as the pleasure of eating was first acquired to induce animals to eat.&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p. 106].&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, morality is a crucial instinct for survival in social animals. As Darwin notes in ''The Descent of Man'':&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p. 113].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|No tribe could hold together if murder, robbery, treacher, etc, were common.}}
Instinctive altruism effectively enables individuals to guarantee survival of the group, which in turn will aid survival of the individual. In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin notes:&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p.115].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Actions regarded by savages, and were probably so regarded by primeval man, are good or bad, solely as they obviously affect the welfare of the tribe - not that of the species, nor that of an individual member of the tribe. This conclusion agrees well with the belief that the so-called moral sense is aboriginally derived from the social instincts, for both relate at first exclusively to the community.}}

===Human morality===
Mankind is a social animal, and has inherited its moral traits through the [[evolution of morality]]. As Darwin notes, the moral difference between mankind and animals, however, is "certainly one of degree and not of kind."&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p. 126].&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions such as remorse, regret or shame one may feel, stem from human's incessant reflection on past experiences and preoccupation with the judgement of others.&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, 2d ed. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F944&amp;pageseq=203 p. 109].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Capitalism}}
'''Neo-capitalism''' is an economic ideology which blends some elements of [[capitalism]] with other systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876355,00.html "Neocapitalism"]. ''[[Time Magazine]]''. October 30, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The new capitalism was new compared to the capitalism in the era before [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Social and economic ideology that arose in the second half of the 20th century and in which the capitalist doctrine becomes deeper, being based on the technological revolution and on the internationalization of the markets.

It is a term used to designate a new form of capitalism that is characterized for correcting its excesses by means of the application of measures that guard over the social well-being.

The important aspects include a great economic freedom, attaching the private property of the industries and companies, moderated with a centralized economic planning, which can include that the state is an owner of some means of production.

It tries to support a balance between the economic growth, lower inflation, low levels of unemployment, good conditions of work, social assistance and good public services, across the intervention of the state in the economy.

It arises in the technological companies reconstructed in the postwar period.

One of its more outstanding representatives is the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economist [[Paul Samuelson]].

The '''New Bach Edition''' (NBE), in [[German language|German]] '''Neue Bach-Ausgabe''' (NBA), is the second complete edition of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], published by [[Bärenreiter]]. The name is short for Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke). It is a historical-critical edition (German: ''historisch-kritische Ausgabe'') of Bach's complete works by the [[Johann Sebastian Bach Institute]] (Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Institut) in Göttingen and the [[Bach Archive]] (Bach-Archiv) in Leipzig,

When Bach died most of his work was unpublished. The first complete edition of Bach's music was published in the second half of the nineteenth century by the [[Bach Gesellschaft]] ([[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]], BGA). The second complete edition includes some discoveries made since 1900, but there are relatively few such scores.  The significance of the NBE lies more in its incorporation of the latest scholarship.&lt;ref name="musiclibrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53519953.html | title=Joahann Sebastian Bach: Ratswahlkantaten, II.(Review) | publisher=[[Music Library Association]]  via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required) | work=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] | date=1998 | accessdate=September 26, 2012 | author=Melamed, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the NBE is an [[urtext edition]] rather than a facsimile edition, it includes many facsimiles of Bach manuscripts. 

==History==

In 1950, the commemorations of the bicentennial of Bach's death in [[Göttingen]] and [[Leipzig]] led to the initiative to publish his complete works in a critical scientific edition. Musicologists such as [[Friedrich Blume]], Max Schneider, {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Smend|de}} and [[Heinrich Besseler]], and sponsors such as [[Bernhard Sprengel]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto Benecke|de}} made the project possible, supported by the editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Vötterle|de}}.

The [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] recommended to pursue the project as a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen, then [[West Germany]], and Leipzig, then [[East Germany]], in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was indivisible. The Bach Archive and the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute collaborated, their directors [[Werner Neumann]] and [[Alfred Dürr]] made the new edition their life's project.  The publishers were [[Bärenreiter]] in [[Kassel]], chosen in 1951 by the Federal Government, and from 1954 the Deutscher Verlag für Musik, a new publisher in Leipzig which was involved until the unification of Germany.

Initially the duration of the edition was estimated as 15 to 20 years, but the scientific work with the sources required much more time than anticipated. The first volumes appeared in 1954. The edition was completed in June 2007.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article939434/Praeludium_zur_Deutschen_Einheit.html |title=Präludium zur Deutschen Einheit |author=Volker Tarnow |date=12 June 2007 |language=German |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[Die Welt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.uc.edu/libraries/ccm/incs/neuebachausgabe.html |title=Neue Bach-Ausgabe |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The edition contains in eight series over 100 volumes of scores (Notenbände), each Score (Partitur) volume complemented with a Critical Commentary (Kritischer Bericht) volume. The ninth series contains Addenda (7 volumes), and furthermore there is a  Supplement of 9 volumes (Supplementbände):&lt;ref name="NBA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |title=Johann Sebastian Bach / 1685-1750 / New Edition of the Complete Works |accessdate=7 January 2011 |publisher=[[Bärenreiter]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103204656/http://baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:IX. Addenda (approximately 7 volumes)
:Supplement: Bach Documents (9 volumes)

Each Score volume contains a preface and a selection of [[facsimile]]s of its sources. In the Score volumes variants and fragments of compositions are published along with complete works. The Critical Commentary volumes describe the history and sources (manuscript sources, early editions), and their interdependence, for each composition, and discuss editorial issues.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;

== Relevance ==

The New Bach Edition presents a reliable version of Bach's music for both scientists and performers. Its strict philological methods were exemplary for critical scientific editions in the second half of the 20th century. 

In preparation for the NBE, lost compositions were found, whereas some known compositions proved to be not Bach's works. The examination of the sources corrected the chronology of his compositions.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt" /&gt;

The second revised edition of the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], and the Bach-Digital website refer to the NBE volume and page number for every listed composition by Bach. In addition to listing the page number of the score, the Bach Digital website also mentions the page number where the composition is discussed in the corresponding Critical Commentary volume.&lt;ref&gt;(BWV&lt;sup&gt;2a&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Alfred Dürr]], Yoshitake Kobayashi (eds.), Kirsten Beißwenger.

In February 2010 the Bach Archive and the publisher announced a revision of single volumes, in order to include new sources and findings. The first in this series of revisions was the [[Mass in B minor]] (updating the second volume of the NBE).
Approximately 15 more volumes are planned, including [[Bach cantata#Weimar|Weimar cantatas]] (five works), the ''[[St John Passion]]'', the motets, the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|violin sonatas]], the [[Cello Suites (Bach)|cello suites]] and others.&lt;ref name="Revised"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/en/spotlight-on/gesamt-und-werkausgaben/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ | title=New Bach Edition – Revised (NBArev) | publisher=Baerenreiter | accessdate=September 28, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AYaBsn3W?url=https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/spotlight-on/gesamt-und-werkausgaben/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ | archivedate=September 9, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4447">'''Phintys''' was a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] philosopher, probably from the third century BC.  She wrote a work on the correct behaviour of women, two extracts of which are preserved by [[Stobaeus]].

According to Stobaeus, Phintys was the daughter of Callicrates,&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus, iv 23.11&lt;/ref&gt; who is otherwise unknown.{{sfn|Plant|2004|p=84}}  Holger Thesleff suggests that this Callicrates might be identified with [[Callicratidas]], a Spartan general who died at the [[Battle of Arginusae]].{{sfn|Waithe|1987|p=26}}  If so, this would make Phintys a Spartan, and date her birth to the late fifth century BC, and her [[floruit]] to the fourth century. I. M. Plant considers this emendation "fanciful".{{sfn|Plant|2004|p=84}}  [[Iamblichus]] mentions '''Philtys''' in his list of female Pythagoreans;&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Life of Pythagoras'', 267&lt;/ref&gt; he says that she was from [[Crotone|Croton]] and that her father was called Theophrius.  I. M. Plant believes that Iamblichus' Philtys, though also a Pythagorean and similarly named, is distinct from Stobaeus' Phintys.{{sfn|Plant|2004|p=84}}

Two fragments attributed to Phintys are preserved in Stobaeus.{{sfn|Plant|2004|p=84}}  However, not all scholars agree that the fragments are authentic: Lefkowitz and Fant argue that the works attributed to female Pythagoreans, including Phintys, were actually rhetorical exercises written by men.{{sfn|Lefkowitz|Fant}}  They are written in the Doric dialect, and amount to about 80 lines of prose.{{sfn|Thesleff|1961|p=18}}  The language used dates to around the fourth century BC, although some features of it appear to be deliberate archaisms; it was likely actually composed in the third century BC,{{sfn|Plant|2004|p=84}} though a date as late as the second century AD was suggested by Friedrich Wilhelm in 1915.{{sfn|Thesleff|1961|p=34}}  

The fragments discuss the differences between men and women,{{sfn|Plant|2004|p=84}} and argues for chastity as the most important virtue for women.{{sfn|Wider|1986|p=36}}  She gives a series of ways that women ought to practice self-control, concluding that the most effective way is to only have sex with her husband in order to produce legitimate children.{{sfn|Wider|1986|pp=36–7}}  Along with her defence of women's chastity, Phintys argues that the practice of philosophy is appropriate for women as well as men.{{sfn|Plant|2004|p=84}}

'''Pramana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रमाण, {{IAST|Pramāṇa}}) literally means "[[Proof (truth)|proof]]" and "means of knowledge".&lt;ref name=sepramana&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=pramANa&amp;direct=se&amp;script=hk&amp;link=yes&amp;mode=3 pramANa] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jalo&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Pramana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 520-521&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to [[epistemology]] in Indian philosophies, and is one of the key, much debated fields of study in [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], since ancient times. It is a theory of knowledge, and encompasses one or more reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge.&lt;ref name=jalo/&gt; The focus of Pramana is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn't, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.&lt;ref name=kp/&gt;&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six&lt;ref&gt;A few Indian scholars such as Vedvyasa discuss ten, Krtakoti discusses eight, but six is most widely accepted; see Andrew J. Nicholson (2013), ''[[Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History]]'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 149-150&lt;/ref&gt; ''pramanas'' as correct means of accurate knowledge and to truths: [[perception]] (Sanskrit ''pratyakṣa),'' [[inference]] (''anumāna''), comparison and analogy (''[[upamāna]]''),  postulation, derivation from circumstances (''arthāpatti''), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof (''[[anupalabdhi]]'') and word, testimony of past or present reliable experts (''[[Śabda]]'').&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood&gt;[[Gavin Flood]], An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by each school of Indian philosophies.

The various schools of Indian philosophies vary on how many of these six are epistemically reliable and valid means to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;P Bilimoria (1993), Pramāṇa epistemology: Some recent developments, in Asian philosophy - Volume 7 (Editor: G Floistad), Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-5107-1}}, pages 137-154&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Carvaka]] school of Hinduism holds that only one (perception) is a reliable source of knowledge,&lt;ref name=kamal/&gt; Buddhism holds two (perception, inference) are valid means,&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=jag/&gt; Jainism holds three (perception, inference and testimony),&lt;ref name=jag&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mimamsa]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]] schools of Hinduism hold all six are useful and can be reliable means to knowledge.&lt;ref name=eliottjag&gt;
*Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248;
*John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; The various schools of Indian philosophy have debated whether one of the six forms of ''pramana'' can be derived from other, and the relative uniqueness of each. For example, Buddhism considers Buddha and other "valid persons", "valid scriptures" and "valid minds" as indisputable, but that such testimony is a form of perception and inference ''pramanas''.&lt;ref name=danper/&gt;

The science and study of ''Pramanas'' is called ''Nyaya''.&lt;ref name=kp&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}, pages 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Pramāṇa'' literally means "proof" and is also a concept and field of Indian philosophy. The concept is derived from the Sanskrit root, ''prama'' (प्रमा) which means "correct notion, true knowledge, basis, foundation, accurate notion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=pramA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 pramA] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Grimes (1996), A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 237-238&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the concept ''Pramana'' implies that which is a "means of acquiring ''prama'' or certain, correct, true knowledge".&lt;ref name=sepramana/&gt;

''Pramāṇa'' forms one part of a trio of concepts, which describe the ancient Indian view on how knowledge is gained. The other two concepts are knower and knowable, each discussed in how they influence the knowledge, by their own characteristic and the process of knowing. The two are called ''Pramātŗ'' (प्रमातृ, the subject, the knower) and ''Prameya'' (प्रमेय, the object, the knowable).&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=pramAtR&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning= pramAtR] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=prameya&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 prameya] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Pramana'' is commonly found in various schools of Hinduism. In Buddhist literature, ''Pramana'' is referred to as ''Pramāṇavāda''.&lt;ref&gt;Tom J. F. Tillemans (2011), Buddhist Epistemology (pramāṇavāda), The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy (Editors: William Edelglass and Jay L. Garfield), {{doi|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195328998.003.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pramana'' is also related to the Indian concept of ''Yukti'' (युक्ति) which means active application of epistemology or what one already knows, innovation, clever expedients or connections, methodological or reasoning trick, joining together, application of contrivance, means, method, novelty or device to more efficiently achieve a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html yukti] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rnar&gt;R Narasimha (2012), Asia, Europe, and the Emergence of Modern Science: Knowledge Crossing Boundaries, Palgrave Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-1137031723}}, pages 95-97&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yukti'' and ''Pramana'' are discussed together in some Indian texts, with ''Yukti'' described as active process of gaining knowledge in contrast to passive process of gaining knowledge through observation/perception.&lt;ref&gt;R Narasimha (2012), Asia, Europe, and the Emergence of Modern Science: Knowledge Crossing Boundaries, Palgrave Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-1137031723}}, pages 95-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CA Scherrer-Schaub (1981), ''Le term yukti: primiere etude'', Etudes Asiatiques, 35: 185-199&lt;/ref&gt; The texts on ''Pramana'', particularly by [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mimamsa]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]] schools of Hinduism, include in their meaning and scope "Theories of Errors", that is why human beings make error and reach incorrect knowledge, how can one know if one is wrong, and if so, how can one discover whether one's epistemic method was flawed, or one's conclusion (truth) was flawed, in order to revise oneself and reach correct knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;EI Warrier (2012), Advaita Vedānta from 800 to 1200 (Editor: Karl Potter), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120830615}}, pages 512-530, 684&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Larson and Ram Bhattacharya, The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies (Editor:Karl Potter), Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691073019}}, pages 361-362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L Schmithausen (1965), Maṇḍana Miśra's Vibhrama-viveka, Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften.

==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism}}
Hinduism identifies six ''pramanas'' as correct means of accurate knowledge and to truths: ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''Anumāṇa'' (inference), ''Upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''Arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), ''Anupalabdhi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and ''Śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; 

An early [[Vedas|Late Vedic]] text, [[Taittiriya Aranyaka|Taittirīya Āraṇyaka]] (c. 9th–6th centuries BCE), lists "four means of attaining correct knowledge": ''smṛti'' ("tradition" or "scripture"), ''pratyakṣa'' ("perception"), ''aitihya'' ("tradition"), and ''anumāna'' ("inference").&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Keith (1989), [https://books.google.com/books?id=p9zCbRMQbyEC&amp;pg=PA482&amp;dq=pratyaksa ''The Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads''], Part II, p.482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lG85RD9YZoC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=taittiriya+pratyaksa ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools''], p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

In some texts such as by Vedvyasa, ten ''pramanas'' are discussed, Krtakoti discusses eight epistemically reliable means to correct knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Nicholson (2013), ''[[Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History]]'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 149-150&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely discussed ''pramanas'' are:&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter and Sibajiban Bhattacharya (1994), Epistemology, in The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691073842}}, pages 53-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Coward et al, Epistemology, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 5, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0426-0}}, pages 51-62&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Pratyakṣa''''' (प्रत्यक्ष) means perception. It is of two types in Hindu texts: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref name=kamal&gt;MM Kamal (1998), The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 46(2): 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception:&lt;ref name=kpmat/&gt; ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient scholars proposed "unusual perception" as ''pramana'' and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some schools of Hinduism considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from ''Pratyakṣa-pranama'', so as to contrast ''nirnaya'' (definite judgment, conclusion) from ''anadhyavasaya'' (indefinite judgment).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Anumāna''''' (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''.&lt;ref name=kamal/&gt; In all except one Hindu philosophies,&lt;ref&gt;Carvaka school is the exception&lt;/ref&gt; this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: ''pratijna'' (hypothesis), ''hetu'' (a reason), and ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: ''sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and ''paksha'' (the object on which the ''sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand ''Vyapti'' - the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Upamāna''''' (उपमान) means comparison and analogy.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;VN Jha (1986), "The upamana-pramana in Purvamimamsa", SILLE, pages 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Upamana'', states Lochtefeld,&lt;ref name=jl721/&gt; may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later.&lt;ref name=jl721&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Upamana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 721&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of comparison is formally called ''upameyam'', the object of comparison is called ''upamanam'', while the attribute(s) are identified as ''samanya''.&lt;ref name=mw457&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, pages 457-458&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, explains [[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier Williams]], if a boy says "her face is like the moon in charmingness", "her face" is ''upameyam'', the moon is ''upamanam'', and charmingness is ''samanya''. The  7th century text [[Bhaṭṭikāvya]] in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not.&lt;ref name=mw457/&gt; In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of ''Upanama'' and their value in epistemology are debated.
*'''''Arthāpatti''''' (अर्थापत्ति) means postulation, derivation from circumstances.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; In contemporary logic, this ''pramana'' is similar to circumstantial [[Modus ponens|implication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36920/arthapatti Arthapatti] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this ''pramana'' as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Arthapatti" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable. Another common example for ''arthapatti'' in ancient Hindu texts is, that if "Devadatta is fat" and "Devadatta does not eat in day", then the following must be true: "Devadatta eats in the night". This form of postulation and deriving from circumstances is, claim the Indian scholars, a means to discovery, proper insight and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (1996), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, pages 41-63&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu schools that accept this means of knowledge state that this method is a valid means to conditional knowledge and truths about a subject and object in original premises or different premises. The schools that do not accept this method, state that postulation, extrapolation and circumstantial implication is either derivable from other ''pramanas'' or flawed means to correct knowledge, instead one must rely on direct perception or proper inference.&lt;ref&gt;DM Datta (1932), The Six Ways of Knowing: A Critical study of the Advaita theory of knowledge, University of Calcutta, Reprinted in 1992 as {{ISBN|978-8120835269}}, pages 221-253&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Anupalabdi''''' (अनुपलब्धि) means non-perception, negative/cognitive proof.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; ''Anupalabdhi pramana'' suggests that knowing a negative, such as "there is no jug in this room" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Abhava" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the two schools of Hinduism that consider ''Anupalabdhi'' as epistemically valuable, a valid conclusion is either ''sadrupa'' (positive) or ''asadrupa'' (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other ''pramana'', Indian scholars refined ''Anupalabdi'' to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept "non-perception" as a ''pramana''. The schools that endorsed ''Anupalabdi'' affirmed that it as valid and useful when the other five ''pramanas'' fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;

:'''''Abhava''''' (अभाव) means non-existence. Some scholars consider ''Anupalabdi'' to be same as ''Abhava'',&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt; while others consider ''Anupalabdi'' and ''Abhava'' as different.&lt;ref name=ds&gt;D Sharma (1966), Epistemological negative dialectics of Indian logic — Abhāva versus Anupalabdhi, Indo-Iranian Journal, 9(4): 291-300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 155-174, 227-255&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhava-pramana'' has been discussed in ancient Hindu texts in the context of ''[[Padārtha]]'' (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A ''Padartha'' is defined as that which is simultaneously ''Astitva'' (existent), ''Jneyatva'' (knowable) and ''Abhidheyatva'' (nameable).&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; Specific examples of ''padartha'', states Bartley, include ''dravya'' (substance), ''[[guna]]'' (quality), ''karma'' (activity/motion), ''samanya/jati'' (universal/class property), ''samavaya'' (inherence) and ''vishesha'' (individuality). ''Abhava'' is then explained as "referents of negative expression" in contrast to "[[Sense and reference|referents]] of positive expression" in ''Padartha''.&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; An absence, state the ancient scholars, is also "existent, knowable and nameable", giving the example of negative numbers, silence as a form of testimony, ''asatkaryavada'' theory of causation, and analysis of deficit as real and valuable. ''Abhava'' was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: ''dhvamsa'' (termination of what existed), ''atyanta-abhava'' (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), ''anyonya-abhava'' (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and ''pragavasa'' (prior, antecedent non-existence).&lt;ref name=chba&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), ''Padartha'', in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, pages 415-416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Lal (Editor), The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Vol. 5, Sahitya Akademy, {{ISBN|81-260-1221-8}}, page 3958&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Śabda''''' (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name="eliottjag"/&gt; Hiriyanna explains ''Sabda-pramana'' as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.&lt;ref name=mhir&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;  He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through ''Sabda'' (words).&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the ''Sabda'' of reliable sources.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as [[Carvaka]], state that this is never possible, and therefore ''Sabda'' is not a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Different schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] accept one or more of above ''pramanas'' as valid epistemology.&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt;

===Carvaka school===
[[Carvaka]] school accepted only one valid source of knowledge - perception.&lt;ref name=jag/&gt; It held all remaining methods as outright invalid or prone to error and therefore invalid.&lt;ref name=kamal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya (2010), What the Cārvākas Originally Meant?, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 38(6): 529-542&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaisheshika school===
Epistemologically, the [[Vaiśeṣika]] school considered the following as the only proper means of knowledge:&lt;ref name=jag/&gt;

#[[Perception]] (''Pratyakṣa'')
#[[Inference]] (''Anumāna'')

===Sankhya, Yoga, Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, and Dvaita Vedanta schools===
According to the [[Sankhya]], [[Yoga]], and two sub-schools of Vedanta, the proper means of knowledge must rely on these three pramanas:&lt;ref name=jag/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pramana"&gt;[http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Pramana Pramana] at Hindupedia, the Hindu Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

#Pratyakṣa &amp;mdash; perception
#Anumāna &amp;mdash; inference
#[[Shabda|Śabda]] &amp;mdash; testimony/word of reliable experts

===Nyaya school===
The [[Nyāya]] school accepts four&lt;ref name=jag/&gt; means of obtaining knowledge (''pramāṇa''), viz., Perception, Inference, Comparison and Word.&lt;ref name="Pramana"/&gt;

#Perception, called ''Pratyakṣa'', occupies the foremost position in the Nyaya epistemology. Perception is defined by sense-object contact and is unerring. Perception can be of two types - ordinary or extraordinary. Ordinary (''Laukika'' or ''Sādhārana'') perception is of six types, viz., visual-by eyes, olfactory-by nose, auditory-by ears, tactile-by skin, gustatory-by tongue and mental-by mind. Extraordinary (''Alaukika'' or ''Asādhārana'') perception is of three types, viz., ''Sāmānyalakṣana'' (perceiving generality from a particular object), ''Jñānalakṣana'' (when one sense organ can also perceive qualities not attributable to it, as when seeing a chilli, one knows that it would be bitter or hot), and ''Yogaja'' (when certain human beings, from the power of ''Yoga'', can perceive past, present and future and have supernatural abilities, either complete or some). Also, there are two modes or steps in perception, viz., ''[[Nirvikalpa]]'', when one just perceives an object without being able to know its features, and ''[[Savikalpa]]'', when one is able to clearly know an object. All laukika and alaukika pratyakshas are savikalpa. There is yet another stage called ''Pratyabhijñā'', when one is able to re-recognise something on the basis of memory.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
#Inference, called ''Anumāna'', is one of the most important contributions of Nyaya. It can be of two types – inference for oneself (''Svārthānumāna'', where one does not need any formal procedure, and at the most the last three of their 5 steps), and inference for others (''Parāthānumāna'', which requires a systematic methodology of 5 steps). Inference can also be classified into 3 types: ''Pūrvavat'' (inferring an unperceived effect from a perceived cause), ''Śeṣavat'' (inferring an unperceived cause from a perceived effect) and ''Sāmānyatodṛṣṭa'' (when inference is not based on causation but on uniformity of co-existence). A detailed analysis of error is also given, explaining when anumāna could be false.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
#Comparison, called ''Upamāna''. It is produced by the knowledge of resemblance or similarity, given some pre-description of the new object beforehand.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
#Word, or ''Śabda'' are also accepted as a ''pramāṇa''. It can be of two types, ''Vaidika'' ([[Vedas|Vedic]]), which are the words of the four sacred Vedas, or can be more broadly interpreted as knowledge from sources acknowledged as authoritative, and ''Laukika'', or words and writings of trustworthy human beings.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Prabhakara Mimamsa school===
In Mimamsa school of Hinduism linked to Prabhakara considered the following pramanas as proper:&lt;ref name=jag/&gt;
# ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception)
# ''Anumāṇa'' (inference)
# ''Śabda'' (word, testimony)
# ''Upamāṇa'' (comparison, analogy)
# ''Arthapatti'' (postulation, presumption)

===Advaita Vedanta and Bhatta Mimamsa schools===
In [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedānta]], and Mimamsa school linked to [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]], the following pramanas are accepted:&lt;ref name=jag/&gt;{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=228}}
# [[Pratyaksha|Pratyakṣa]] (perception)
# [[Anumāṇa]] (inference)
# [[Śabda]] (word, testimony)
# [[Upamāṇa]] (comparison, analogy)
# [[Arthapatti|Arthāpatti]] (postulation, presumption)
# Anupalabdi, Abhava (non-perception, cognitive proof using non-existence)

==Buddhism==
{{main|Buddhist logic}}
{{Buddhism}}
Padmākara Translation Group (2005: p.&amp;nbsp;390) annotates that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Strictly speaking, pramana (''tshad ma'') means "valid cognition." In (Buddhism) practice, it refers to the tradition, principally associated with Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, of logic (''rtags rigs'') and epistemology (''blo rigs'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Śāntarakṣita]] (author); [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmākara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005). ''The Adornment of the Middle Way: Shantarakshita's Madhyamakalankara with commentary by Jamgön Mipham.'' Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-59030-241-9}} (alk. paper): p.390&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhism accepts only two ''pramana'' (''tshad ma'') as valid means to knowledge: Pratyaksha (''mngon sum tshad ma'', perception) and Anumāṇa (''rjes dpag tshad ma'', inference).&lt;ref name=danper/&gt; Rinbochay adds that Buddhism also considers scriptures as third valid ''pramana'', such as from Buddha and other "valid minds" and "valid persons". This third source of valid knowledge is a form of perception and inference in Buddhist thought. Valid scriptures, valid minds and valid persons are considered in Buddhism as ''Avisamvadin'' (''mi slu ba'', incontrovertible, indisputable).&lt;ref name=danper&gt;Daniel Perdue, Debate in Tibetan Buddhism, {{ISBN|978-0937938768}}, pages 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lati Rinbochay and Elizabeth Napper (1981), Mind in Tibetan Buddhism, {{ISBN|978-0937938027}}, page 115-119&lt;/ref&gt; Means of cognition and knowledge, other than perception and inference, are considered invalid in Buddhism.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=jag/&gt;

In Buddhism, the two most important scholars of pramāṇa are [[Dignāga]] and [[Dharmakīrti]].&lt;ref&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sautrantrika===
Dignāga and Dharmakīrti are usually categorized as expounding the view of the [[Sautrāntika]] tenets, though one can make a distinction between the Sautrāntikas Following Scripture (Tibetan: ལུང་གི་རྗེས་འབྲང་གི་མདོ་སྡེ་པ Wylie: lung gi rjes 'brang gi mdo sde pa) and the Sautrāntikas Following Reason (Tibetan: རིགས་པ་རྗེས་འབྲང་གི་མདོ་སྡེ་པ Wylie: rigs pa rjes 'brang gi mdo sde pa) and both these masters are described as establishing the latter.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita32"&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.&amp;nbsp;32–39&lt;/ref&gt; Dignāga's main text on this topic is the ''[[Pramāṇa-samuccaya]]''.

These two rejected the complex [[Abhidharma]]-based description of how in the [[Vaibhāṣika]] school and the Sautrāntika Following Scripture approach connected an external world with mental objects, and instead posited that the mental domain never connects directly with the external world but instead only perceives an aspect based upon the sense organs and the sense consciousnesses. Further, the sense consciousnesses assume the form of the aspect (Sanskrit: Sākāravāda) of the external object and what is perceived is actually the sense consciousness which has taken on the form of the external object. By starting with aspects, a logical argument about the external world as discussed by the Hindu schools was possible. Otherwise their views would be so different as to be impossible to begin a debate. Then a logical discussion could follow.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita32" /&gt;

This approach attempts to solve how the material world connects with the mental world, but not completely explaining it. When pushed on this point, Dharmakīrti then drops a presupposition of the Sautrāntrika position and shifts to a kind of [[Yogācāra]] position that extramental objects never really occur but arise from the habitual tendencies of mind. So he begins a debate with Hindu schools positing external objects then later to migrate the discussion to how that is logically untenable.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita32" /&gt;

Note there are two differing interpretations of Dharmakīrti's approach later in Tibet, due to differing translations and interpretations. One is held by the [[Gelug]] school leaning to a moderate [[Philosophical realism|realism]] with some accommodation of universals and the other held by the other schools who held that Dharmakīrti was distinctly antirealist.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita37"&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apoha====
A key feature of Dignāga's logic is in how he treats generalities versus specific objects of knowledge. The Nyāya Hindu school made assertions about the existence of general principles, and in refutation Dignāga asserted that generalities were mere mental features and not truly existent. To do this he introduced the idea of ''Apoha'', that the way the mind recognizes is by comparing and negating known objects from the perception. In that way, the general idea or categories of objects has to do with differences from known objects, not from identification with universal truths. So one knows that a perceived chariot is a chariot not because it is in accord with a universal form of a chariot, but because it is perceived as different from things that are not chariots. This approach became an essential feature of Buddhist epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.&amp;nbsp;35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madhyamaka===
The contemporary of Dignāga but before Dharmakīrti, [[Bhāvaviveka]], incorporated a logical approach when commenting upon [[Nāgārjuna]]. He also started with a Sautrāntika approach when discussing the way appearances appear, to debate with realists, but then took a [[Middle Way]] view of the ultimate nature of phenomenon. But he used logical assertions and arguments about the nature of that ultimate nature.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita32" /&gt;

His incorporation of logic into the Middle Way system was later critiqued by [[Candrakīrti]], who felt that the establishment of the ultimate way of abiding since it was beyond thought and concept was not the domain of logic. He used simple [[logical consequence]] arguments to refute the views of other tenet systems, but generally he thought a more developed use of logic and epistemology in describing the Middle Way was problematic. Bhāvaviveka's use of autonomous logical arguments was later described as the [[Svātantrika]] approach.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita32" /&gt;

===In Tibet===
Modern Buddhist schools employ the 'three spheres' (Sanskrit: trimaṇḍala; Tibetan: 'khor gsum): 
#subject
#object, and
#action.&lt;ref&gt;Thub-bstan-chos-kyi-grags-pa, Chokyi Dragpa, Heidi I. Koppl, Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche (2004). ''Uniting Wisdom and Compassion: Illuminating the thirty-seven practices of a bodhisattva''. Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-377-X}}. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=FF8vymsxTwMC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=trimandala+three+vajra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0_t54Zd_D4&amp;sig=RY558G9XFBByjQU_4mRtNw_kzDc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result] (accessed: February 4, 2009) p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

When Madhyamaka first migrated to Tibet, [[Śāntarakṣita]] established a view of Madhyamaka more consistent with Bhāvaviveka while further evolving logical assertions as a way of contemplating and developing one's viewpoint of the ultimate truth.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita32" /&gt;

In the 14th Century [[Je Tsongkhapa]] presented a new commentary and approach to Madhyamaka, which became the normative form in Tibet. In this variant, the Madhyamaka approach of Candrakīrti was elevated instead of Bhāvaviveka's yet Tsongkhapa rejected Candrakirti's disdain of logic and instead incorporated logic further.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita32" /&gt;

The exact role of logic in Tibetan Buddhist practice and study may still be a topic of debate,&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita37" /&gt; but it is definitely established in the tradition. [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]] remarked in his 19th century commentary on Śāntarakṣita's ''Madhyamakālaṅkāra'':
{{cquote|The Buddha's doctrine, from the exposition of the two truths onward, unerroneously sets forth the mode of being of things as they are. And the followers of the Buddha must establish this accordingly, through the use of reasoning. Such is the unerring tradition of Śakyamuni. On the other hand, to claim that analytical investigation in general and the inner science of pramana, or logic, in particular are unnecessary is a terrible and evil spell, the aim of which is to prevent the perfect assimilation, through valid reasoning, of the Buddha's words&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita"&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.&amp;nbsp;38–39&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">In [[mathematics]], an '''[[:ru:R-функция|R-function]]''', or '''Rvachev function''', is a [[real-valued function]] whose sign does not change if none of the signs of its arguments change; that is, its sign is determined solely by the signs of its arguments.&lt;ref&gt;V.L. Rvachev, “On the analytical description of some geometric objects”, ''Reports of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences'', vol. '''153''', no. 4, 1963, pp. 765–767 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Shapiro, Semi-analytic geometry with R-Functions, Acta Numerica, Cambridge University Press,  2007, 16: 239-303&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpreting positive values as ''true'' and negative values as ''false'', an R-function is transformed into a "companion" [[Boolean function]] (the two functions are called ''friends''). For instance, the R-function ''ƒ''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') = min(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is one possible friend of the logical conjunction (AND). R-functions are used in [[computer graphics]] and [[geometric modeling]] in the context of [[implicit surface]]s and the [[function representation]]. They also appear in certain [[boundary-value problem]]s, and are also popular in certain [[artificial intelligence]] applications, where they are used in [[pattern recognition]].

R-functions were first proposed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Vladimir Logvinovich Rvachev|ru|3=Рвачев, Владимир Логвинович}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.kpi.kharkov.ua/apm/all/rva75en.htm 75 years to Vladimir L. Rvachev] (75th anniversary biographical tribute)&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Логвинович Рвачёв}}) in 1963, though the name, "R-functions", was given later on by Ekaterina L. Rvacheva-Yushchenko, in memory of their father, Logvin Fedorovich Rvachev ({{lang-ru|Логвин  Фёдорович Рвачёв}}).

'''Shadworth Hollway Hodgson''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (1832-1912) was an [[England|English]] [[philosopher]].

He worked independently, without academic affiliation.  He was acknowledged by [[William James]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/James/James_1912/James_1912_pref.html&lt;/ref&gt; as a forerunner of [[Pragmatism]], although he viewed his work as a completion of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] project.  Hodgson was a member of a London philosophy club with James, called the "Scratch Eight." Hodgson regarded the poets [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] as his chief inspirations, and had no academic background, though he was a member of the [[Metaphysical Society]].

He was the first president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] and held that post from 1880 to 1894.

His principal work was ''The Metaphysic of Experience'' (1898) which prepared the way for New Realism. He objected to the stance of [[empiricism]] in its postulating of persons and things, and insisted that neither subject nor object are warranted as initial considerations of philosophy.

Attention to Hodgson was briefly enlivened by an article by Wolfe Mays in a British Phenomenology journal in the 1970s.

The volumes of Hodgson's principal work were often shipped with uncut pages and visits to libraries with these volumes has revealed that sometimes most pages of all 4 volumes remained uncut even one hundred years later.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2847">In [[Catholic spirituality]], '''spiritual dryness''' or '''desolation''' is a lack of spiritual consolation in one's spiritual life. It is a form of spiritual crisis experienced subjectively as a sense of separation from God or lack of spiritual feeling, especially during [[contemplative prayer]]. Paradoxically, it is thought that spiritual dryness can lead to greater love of God.&lt;ref name="cathency"&gt;{{CathEncy |author= Augustin Poulain |title= Mystical Theology |id= 14621a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==

The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (CCC) describes spiritual dryness as a difficulty sometimes experienced in one's prayer life, which may lead to discouragement. Dryness can expose a lack of "rootedness" in the faith, but also provides an opportunity to cling more strongly to God. The CCC makes reference to the seed that fell on the rocks in [[Parable of the Sower]], as well as to the [[The Grain of Wheat|Grain of Wheat]] allegory found in the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref name="ccc2731"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P9Q.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church], paragraph 2731&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' calls it a form of "passive purification," the fruit of which is "the purification of love, until the soul is so inflamed with love of God that it feels as if wounded and languishes with the desire to love Him still more intensely."&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt;

The theme of spiritual dryness can be found in the [[Book of Job]], the [[Psalms]], the experiences of the [[Elijah#Mt._Horeb|Prophets]], and many passages of the [[New Testament]], as illustrated above.&lt;ref&gt;

==Description by saints==
A number of Catholic [[saint]]s have written about their experiences of spiritual dryness. In the 16th century, [[Saint John of the Cross]] famously described it as "the [[Dark Night of the Soul]]". The 17th-century [[Benedictine]] mystic Fr. [[Augustine Baker]] called it the "great desolation".&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt; [[Mother Teresa#Spiritual life|Mother Teresa's]] diaries show that she experienced spiritual dryness for most of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, D., [https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/faith-and-character/faith-and-character/mother-teresas-long-dark-night.html Mother Teresa's Long Dark Night], Catholic Education Resource Centre, 2013, accessed 18 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Substance theory''', or '''substance–attribute theory''', is an [[ontology|ontological]] theory about [[Object (philosophy)|objecthood]], positing that a ''substance'' is distinct from its [[property (philosophy)|properties]]. A ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' is a property-bearer that must be distinguished from the properties it bears.&lt;ref name=Langton&gt;{{cite book |title=Kantian humility: our ignorance of things in themselves |author=Rae Langton |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpHUgZzu0EkC&amp;pg=PA28 |page=28 |isbn=0-19-924317-4 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Substance'' is a key concept in ontology and [[metaphysics]], which may be classified into [[monist]], [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]], or [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralist]] varieties according to how many substances or individuals are said to populate, furnish, or exist in the world. According to monistic views, there is only one substance. [[Stoicism]] and [[Spinoza]], for example, hold monistic views, that [[pneuma]] or [[God]], respectively, is the one substance in the world. These modes of thinking are sometimes associated with the idea of [[immanence]]. Dualism sees the world as being composed of two fundamental substances, for example, the Cartesian [[substance dualism]] of mind and matter. Pluralist philosophies include [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms]] and [[Aristotle]]'s [[hylomorphic]] [[categories (Aristotle)|categories]].

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
===Aristotle&lt;!--'Primary substance', 'Primary substances', 'Secondary substance' and 'Secondary substances' redirect here--&gt;===
[[Aristotle]] used the term "substance" ({{lang-el|οὐσία}} ''[[ousia]]'') in a secondary sense for [[genus|genera]] and [[species]] understood as [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic forms]]. Primarily, however, he used it with regard to his [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] of substance, the specimen ("this person" or "this horse") or [[identity (philosophy)|individual]], ''qua'' individual, who survives [[accident (philosophy)|accidental change]] and in whom the [[essence|essential properties]] inhere that define those [[problem of universals|universals]].{{quote|A substance—that which is called a substance most strictly, primarily, and most of all—is that which is neither said of a subject nor in a subject, e.g. the individual man or the individual horse. The species in which the things primarily called substances are, are called secondary substances, as also are the genera of these species. For example, the individual man belongs in a species, man, and animal is a genus of the species; so these—both man and animal—are called secondary substances.&lt;ref name="Ackrill1988"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Ackrill |year=1988 |title=A New Aristotle Reader |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400835829 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz8-DgxETuAC&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Aristotle|''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' 2a13 (trans. [[J. L. Ackrill]])}}

In chapter 6 of book I the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' Aristotle argues that any change must be analysed in reference to the property of an invariant subject: as it was before the change and thereafter. Thus, in his hylomorphic account of change, ''matter'' serves as a relative substratum of transformation, i.e., of changing (substantial) form. In the ''Categories'', properties are predicated only of substance, but in chapter 7 of book I of the ''Physics'', Aristotle discusses substances coming to be and passing away in the "unqualified sense" wherein '''primary substances'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (πρῶται οὐσίαι; ''Categories'' 2a35) are generated from (or perish into) a material substratum by having gained (or lost) the essential property that formally defines substances of that kind (in the secondary sense). Examples of such a substantial change include not only conception and dying, but also metabolism, e.g., the bread a man eats becomes the man. On the other hand, in [[accident (philosophy)|accidental]] change, because the essential property remains unchanged, by identifying the substance with its formal essence, substance may thereby serve as the relative subject matter or property-bearer of change in a qualified sense (i.e., barring matters of life or death). An example of this sort of accidental change is a change of color or size: a tomato becomes red, or a juvenile horse grows.

Aristotle thinks that in addition to primary substances (which are particulars), there are '''secondary substances'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (δεύτεραι οὐσίαι), which are universals (''Categories'' 2a11–a18).&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/ Aristotle's Categories (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the "bare particulars" nor "property bundles" of modern theory have their antecedent in Aristotle, according to whom, all matter exists in some form. There is no ''prime matter'' or pure [[classical elements|elements]], there is always a mixture: a ratio weighing the four potential combinations of primary and secondary properties and analysed into discrete one-step and [[gray code#Motivation|two-step]] abstract transmutations between the elements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

However, according to [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotle's theology]], a form of invariant form exists without matter, beyond the [[cosmos]], powerless and oblivious, in the eternal substance of the [[unmoved movers]].

===Stoicism===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
{{see also|Stoic categories}}
The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] rejected the idea that [[incorporeal]] beings inhere in matter, as taught by [[Plato]]. They believed that all being is [[Matter|corporeal]] infused with a creative fire called [[pneuma]]. Thus they developed a scheme of [[Categories (Stoic)|categories]] different from [[Categories (Aristotle)|Aristotle's]] based on the ideas of [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]].

===Neoplatonism===
[[Neoplatonists]] argue that beneath the surface phenomena that present themselves to our senses are three higher spiritual principles or [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]], each one more sublime than the preceding. For [[Plotinus]], these are the soul or [[anima mundi|world-soul]], being/intellect or divine mind (''[[nous]]''), and "the one".&lt;ref name=Paula&gt;''Neoplatonism (Ancient Philosophies)'' by Pauliina Remes (2008), University of California Press {{ISBN|0520258347}}, pages 48–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern philosophy==
[[René Descartes]] means by a substance an entity which exists in such a way that it needs no other entity in order to exist. Therefore, only God is a substance in this strict sense. However, he extends the term to created things, which need only the concurrence of God to exist. He maintained that two of these are mind and body, each being distinct from the other in their attributes and therefore in their essence, and neither needing the other in order to exist. This is Descartes' [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|substance dualism]].

[[Baruch Spinoza]] denied Descartes' "real distinction" between mind and matter. Substance, according to Spinoza, is one and indivisible, but has multiple "attributes". He regards an attribute, though, as "what we conceive as constituting the [single] essence of substance". The single essence of one substance can be conceived of as material and also, consistently, as mental. What is ordinarily called the natural world, together with all the individuals in it, is [[immanence|immanent]] in God: hence his famous phrase ''deus sive natura'' ("[[God or Nature]]").

[[John Locke]] views substance through a corpuscularian lens where it exhibits two types of qualities which both stem from a source. He believes that humans are born tabula rasa or “blank slate” – without innate knowledge.  In ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' Locke writes that “first essence may be taken for the very being of anything, whereby it is, what it is.” If humans are born without any knowledge, the way to receive knowledge is through perception of a certain object. But, according to Locke, an object exists in its primary qualities, no matter whether the human perceives it or not; it just exists. For example, an apple has qualities or properties that determine its existence apart from human perception of it, such as its mass or texture. The apple itself is also “pure substance in which is supposed to provide some sort of ‘unknown support’ to the observable qualities of things”{{vague|reason= Is it Millican or Locke we are quoting?|date=June 2018}} that the human mind perceives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millican|first1=Peter|title="Locke on Substance and our Ideas of Substances"|journal=Locke on Substances and Our Ideas of Substances|date=2015|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundational or support qualities are called primary essences which “in the case of physical substances, are the underlying physical causes of the object's observable qualities”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Jan-Erik|title="Locke on Real Essence"|journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; But then what is an object except “the owner or support of other properties”? Locke rejects Aristotle’s category of the forms, and develops mixed ideas about what substance or “first essence” means. Locke’s solution to confusion about first essence is to argue that objects simply are what they are – made up of microscopic particles existing because they exist. According to Locke, the mind cannot completely grasp the idea of a substance as it “always falls beyond knowledge”.&lt;ref name="Locke: A Very Short Introduction"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=John|title=Locke: A Very Short Introduction|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a gap between what first essence truly means and the mind’s perception of it that Locke believes the mind cannot bridge, objects in their primary qualities must exist apart from human perception.

The molecular combination of atoms in first essence then forms the solid base that humans can perceive and add qualities to describe - the only way humans can possibly begin to perceive an object. The way to perceive the qualities of an apple is from the combination of the primary qualities to form the secondary qualities. These qualities are then used to group the substances into different categories that “depend on the properties [humans] happen to be able to perceive”.&lt;ref name="Locke: A Very Short Introduction"/&gt; The taste of an apple or the feeling of its smoothness are not traits inherent to the fruit but are the power of the primary qualities to produce an idea about that object in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Jan-Erik|title=Locke On Real Essence|journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason that humans can’t sense the actual primary qualities is the [[mental distance]] from the object; thus, Locke argues, objects remain [[nominalism|nominal]] for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atherton|first1=Margaret|title=The Empiricists: Critical Essays on Locke, Berkely, and Hume|date=1999|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the argument then returns to how “a philosopher has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are found in them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1959|publisher=Dover Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mind’s conception of substances “[is] complex rather than simple” and “has no (supposedly innate) clear and distinct idea of matter that can be revealed through intellectual abstraction away from sensory qualities”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milican|first1=Peter|title=Locke on Substances and Our Ideas of Substances|journal=Locke on Substances and Our Ideas on Substances|date=2015|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last quality of substance is the way the perceived qualities seem to begin to change – such as a candle melting; this quality is called the tertiary quality. Tertiary qualities “of a body are those powers in it that, by virtue of its primary qualities, give it the power to produce observable changes in the primary qualities of other bodies”; “the power of the sun to melt wax is a tertiary quality of the sun”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Jan-Erik|title=Locke on Real Essence|journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are “mere powers; qualities such as flexibility, ductility; and the power of sun to melt wax”.  This goes along with{{vague|date=June 2018}} “passive power: the capacity a thing has for being changed by another thing”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garret|first1=Jan|title=A Lockean Glossary|journal=A Lockean Glossary|date=February 27, 2004|url=people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/303/lockglos.htm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any object, at the core are the primary qualities (unknowable by the human mind), the secondary quality (how primary qualities are perceived), and tertiary qualities (the power of the combined qualities to make a change to itself{{confusing|reason = neither "power", nor "qualities" can grammatically serve as the referent of "itself"|date=June 2018}}  and other objects).

The corpuscularian hypothesis, by{{vague| reason = "stated by"? "according to"?|date=June 2018}} [[Robert Boyle]], states that "all material bodies are composites of ultimately small{{vague| reason =  indivisibly small? infinitesimally small?|date=June 2018}} particles of matter" that "have the same material qualities{{vague|date=June 2018}} as the larger composite bodies do".&lt;ref name="Sheridan"&gt;Sheridan, P. (2010). Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. London: Continuum. pp. 34, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this basis, Locke defines his first group, primary qualities, as "the ones that a body doesn't lose, however much it alters".&lt;ref name ="Locke"&gt;Locke, J. (1979). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', Book II (P. H. Nidditch, Ed.). Clarendon: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; The materials retain their primary qualities even if they are broken down because of the unchanging nature of their atomic particles.&lt;ref name="Sheridan" /&gt; If someone is curious about an object and they{{who|reason= if this meant the curious person, it would still be acceptable only if it were reasonable to assume the reader is drunk|date=June 2018}} say it is solid and extended, these two descriptors are primary qualities.&lt;ref name="Stumpf"&gt;Stumpf, S. E. (1999). Socrates to Sartre: a history of philosophy. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill. p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The second group consists of secondary qualities which are "really nothing but the powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities".&lt;ref name="Locke" /&gt; Locke argues that the impressions our senses perceive from the objects (i.e. taste, sounds, colors, etc.) are not natural properties of the object itself, but things they induce in us by means of the "size, shape, texture, and motion of their imperceptible parts", or their atoms.&lt;ref name="Locke" /&gt; The bodies send insensible particles to our senses which let us perceive the object through different faculties; what we perceive is based on the object's composition. With these qualities, people can achieve the object through bringing "co-existing powers and sensible qualities to a common ground for explanation".&lt;ref name="Constantin"&gt;Constantin, Ion, PhD.C., I.F.P.C.R.M. (2012). PHILOSOPHY OF SUBSTANCE: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. Linguistic and Philosophical Investigations, 11, 135-140. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/1030745650&lt;/ref&gt; Locke supposes that one wants to know what "binds these qualities" into an object, and argues that a "[[substratum]]" or "substance" has this effect, defining "substance" as follows: {{quote|The idea that we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist ''sine re substante'', without something to support them, we call that support ''substantia''; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or upholding.|John Locke|''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''; book 2, chapter 23; "Of our Complex Ideas of Substances"}} This substratum is a construct of the mind in an attempt to bind all the qualities seen together; it is only "a supposition of an unknown support of qualities that are able to cause simple ideas in us".&lt;ref name="Locke" /&gt; Without making a substratum, people would be at a loss as to how different qualities relate. Locke does, however, mention that this substratum is an unknown, relating it to the story of the world on the turtle's back and how the believers eventually had to concede that the turtle just rested on "something he knew not what".&lt;ref name="Locke" /&gt; This is how the mind perceives all things and from which it can make ideas about them; it is entirely relative, but it does provide a "regularity and consistency to our ideas".&lt;ref name="Stumpf" /&gt; Substance, overall, has two sets of qualities that define it, and how we perceive it. These qualities rush to our minds which must organize them. As a result, it creates a substratum for each object to which it groups related qualities.

==Irreducible concepts==
{{see also|Noumenon|Phenomenon}}
Two irreducible concepts encountered in substance theory are the ''bare particular'' and ''inherence''.

===Bare particular===
In substance theory, a bare particular of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] is the element without which the object would not exist, that is, its substance, which exists independently from its properties, even if it is impossible for it to lack properties entirely. It is "bare" because it is considered without its properties and "particular" because it is not [[Abstraction|abstract]]. The properties that the substance has are said to inhere in the substance.

===Inherence===
Another primitive concept in substance theory is the [[inherence]] of properties within a substance. For example, in the sentence, "The apple is red" substance theory says that red inheres in the apple. Substance theory takes the meaning of an apple having the property of redness to be understood, and likewise that of a property's inherence in substance, which is similar to, but not identical with, being part of the substance.

The inverse relation is [[Participation (philosophy)|participation]].  Thus in the example above, just as red inheres in the apple, so the apple participates in red.

==Arguments supporting the theory==
Two common [[argument]]s supporting substance theory are the argument from grammar and the argument from conception.

===Argument from grammar===
The argument from grammar uses [[traditional grammar]] to support substance theory. For example, the sentence "Snow is white" contains a grammatical subject "snow" and the predicate "is white", thereby asserting ''snow is white''. The argument holds that it makes no grammatical sense to speak of "whiteness" disembodied, without asserting that snow or something else ''is'' white. Meaningful assertions are formed by virtue of a grammatical subject, of which properties may be predicated, and in substance theory, such assertions are made with regard to a substance.

[[Bundle theory]] rejects the argument from grammar on the basis that a grammatical subject does not necessarily refer to a metaphysical subject. Bundle theory, for example, maintains that the grammatical subject of statement refers to its properties. For example, a bundle theorist understands the grammatical subject of the sentence, "Snow is white", to be a bundle of properties such as white. Accordingly, one can make meaningful statements about bodies without referring to substances.

===Argument from conception===
Another argument for the substance theory is the argument from conception. The argument claims that in order to conceive of an object's properties, like the redness of an apple, one must conceive of the object that has those properties. According to the argument, one cannot conceive of redness, or any other property, distinct from the substance that has that property.

==Criticism==
The idea of substance was famously critiqued by [[David Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Forbidden History of Science|last=Hockney|first=Mike|publisher=Hyperreality Books|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} who held that since substance cannot be perceived, it should not be assumed to exist. But the claim that substance cannot be perceived is neither clear nor obvious, and neither is the implication obvious.{{according to|date=February 2017}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and after him [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]] also rejected the notion of "substance", and in the same movement the concept of [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] - seeing both concepts as holdovers from [[Platonic idealism]]. For this reason, [[Althusser]]'s "anti-humanism" and Foucault's statements were criticized, by [[Jürgen Habermas]] and others, for misunderstanding that this led to a fatalist conception of [[social determinism]]. For Habermas, only a subjective form of [[liberty]] could be conceived, to the contrary of Deleuze who talks about "''a'' life", as an impersonal and [[immanence|immanent]] form of liberty.

For Heidegger, Descartes means by "substance" that by which "we can understand nothing else than an entity which ''is'' in such a way that it need no other entity in order to ''be''." Therefore, only God is a substance as ''Ens perfectissimus'' (most perfect being). Heidegger showed the inextricable relationship between the concept of substance and of subject, which explains why, instead of talking about "man" or "humankind", he speaks about the ''[[Dasein]]'', which is not a simple subject, nor a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www20.uludag.edu.tr/~kadir/Roma.pdf |author=A. Kadir Cucen |title=Heidegger's Critique of Descartes' Metaphysics |publisher=Uludag University |date=2002-01-18 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred North Whitehead]] has argued that the concept of substance has only a limited applicability in everyday life and that metaphysics should rely upon the [[Process philosophy|concept of process]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ronny Desmet and Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Éditions Chromatika, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-2-930517-08-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic theologian [[Karl Rahner]], as part of his critique of [[transubstantiation]], rejected substance theory and instead proposed the doctrine of ''transfinalization'', which he felt was more attuned to modern philosophy. However, this doctrine was rejected by [[Pope Paul VI]] in his encyclical ''[[Mysterium fidei (encyclical)|Mysterium fidei]]''.

==Bundle theory==
{{Main|Bundle theory}}

In direct opposition to substance theory is bundle theory, whose most basic premise is that all concrete particulars are merely constructions or 'bundles' of attributes or qualitative properties:

:Necessarily, for any concrete entity, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, if for any entity, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a constituent of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is an attribute.&lt;ref name="Loux2002"/&gt;

The bundle theorist's principal objections to substance theory concern the [[bare particular]]s of a substance, which substance theory considers independently of the substance's properties. The bundle theorist objects to the notion of a thing with no properties, claiming that such a thing is inconceivable and citing John Locke, who described a substance as "a something, I know not what." To the bundle theorist, as soon as one has any notion of a substance in mind, a property accompanies that notion.
&lt;!--The contents of the foregoing section is also found at [[bare particular]].  Please keep these articles consistent.--&gt;

===Identity of indiscernibles counterargument===

The [[indiscernible|indiscernibility]] argument from the substance theorist targets those bundle theorists who are also metaphysical realists. Metaphysical realism uses the identity of ''universals'' to compare and identify particulars. Substance theorists say that bundle theory is incompatible with metaphysical realism due to the [[identity of indiscernibles]]: particulars may differ from one another only with respect to their attributes or relations.

The substance theorist's indiscernibility argument against the metaphysically realistic bundle theorist states that numerically different concrete particulars are discernible from the self-same concrete particular only by virtue of qualitatively different attributes.

:Necessarily, for any complex objects, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, if for any entity, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constituent of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constituent of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is numerically identical with &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Loux2002"/&gt;

The indiscernibility argument points out that if bundle theory and discernible concrete particulars theory explain the relationship between attributes, then the identity of indiscernibles theory must also be true:
:Necessarily, for any concrete objects, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, if for any attribute, Φ, Φ is an attribute of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; if and only if Φ is an attribute of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is numerically identical with &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Loux2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.J. |last=Loux |year=2002 |title=Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction |series=Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy Series |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415140348 |lccn=97011036 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgxkGIgPlooC&amp;pg=PA106 |pages=106–107, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indiscernibles argument then asserts that the identity of indiscernibles is violated, for example, by identical sheets of paper. All of their qualitative properties are the same (e.g. white, rectangular, 9 x 11&amp;nbsp;inches...) and thus, the argument claims, bundle theory and metaphysical realism cannot both be correct.

However, bundle theory combined with [[Trope (philosophy)#Trope theory in philosophy (metaphysics)|trope theory]] (as opposed to metaphysical realism) avoids the indiscernibles argument because each attribute is a trope if can only be held by only one concrete particular.

The argument does not consider whether "position" should be considered an attribute or relation. It is after all through the differing positions that we in practice differentiate between otherwise identical pieces of paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5583">'''Teofil Żebrawski''' (1800–1887) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[Bibliography|bibliographer]], architect, [[biologist]], [[archeologist]], [[cartographer]] and [[geodesist]]; an [[Erudition|erudite]] and [[polymath]]. Pioneer of the modern Polish mathematical bibliography.

He was an author of works mainly about road, iron road and bridge constructions, [[cartography]], [[topography]] and [[entomology]]. Author of Polish, French and German dictionary of architecture, building engineering and materials science terms. Author and publisher of [[Free City of Kraków]] maps from 1833, [[city map]] of Kraków from 1834 and health resorts map of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Bukovina|Bukowina]]. Żebrawski derived the [[chain curve]] formula and applied it to the bridge arc calculations. He published a paper on the main causes of [[train derailment]] and its present methods. He introduced his own method of maps and map graticule classification. He researched and described changes in fauna of [[butterfly|butterflies]] in [[Kraków]] region. Żebrawski directed restorations of Dominicans Church in [[Kraków]], altars of [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|St. Mary's Basilica]] and Royal Graves of the [[Wawel Cathedral]].

Żebrawski was also a translator. His notable translations to [[Polish language]] includes ''The Poems of Ossian'' originally written by [[James Macpherson]] and ''Diversarum Artium Schedula — Libri III'' by [[Theophilus Presbyter]].

He participated in the [[November Uprising]] (1830–1831) as a [[First Lieutenant]]-Engineer (''[[porucznik]]-inżynier'') of [[Józef Dwernicki]] corps and in the [[Kraków Uprising]] (1846) as a [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] (''kapitan'').

==Biography==
Żebrawski was born on 5 April 1800 in [[Wojnicz]], Poland. In 1818 graduated [[Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School]] in Kraków. After that, he studied philosophy, nature, English [[philology]], mathematics and astronomy at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków, and mining, building engineering and topography at the [[Szkoła Akademiczno-Górnicza]] in [[Kielce]]. In 1832 he graduated doctor of philosophy and liberal science at the Jagiellonian University. In the years of 1832–1834 he worked as a lecturer and then adjunct of the Natural History and Botanics Department at the Jagiellonian University. In 1837–1853 he worked as a land and water transport inspector of Kraków.

In 1830s, Żebrawski designed and built a road through the Free City of Kraków with two bridges over [[Krzeszówka]] and [[Dłubnia]]. Between 1825–1831, he made a [[triangulation]] of [[Dobrzyń Land]], [[Pułtusk]] [[obwód]], [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]], [[Sandomierz]] region, regions between [[Warsaw]], [[Włodawa]] and [[Bug River|Bug]], and [[Wilno Governorate]] region. Part of these measurements were used in the 1839 map of [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]].

In 1866, he became a member of the [[Kraków Science Society]] (''Towarzystwo Naukowe Krakowskie'') and in 1872, member of the [[Academy of Learning]] (''Akademia Umiejętności'').

He died in Kraków on 5 February 1887.

{{Zen Buddhism}}
'''''The Gateless Barrier''''' ([[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]: 無門關 ''Wúménguān''; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 無門関 ''Mumonkan''), sometimes inaccurately translated as '''''The Gateless Gate''''', is a collection of 48 [[Zen|Chan]] ([[Zen]]) [[koan]]s compiled in the early 13th century by the Chinese Zen master [[Wumen Huikai]] (無門慧開; Japanese: ''Mumon Ekai''; 1183–1260). The title has a double meaning and can also be understood as '''Wumen's Barrier'''; the compiler's name, which literally means "No Gate", is the same as the title's first two characters. Wumen's preface indicates that the volume was published in 1228. Each koan is accompanied by a commentary and verse by Wumen. A classic edition includes a 49th case composed by Anwan (pen name for Cheng Ch'ing-Chih) in 1246. Wu-liang Tsung-shou also supplemented the volume with a verse of four stanzas composed in 1230 about the three checkpoints of Zen master Huanglong.  These three checkpoints of Huanglong should not be confused with Doushuai's Three Checkpoints found in Case 47.

Along with the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' and the oral tradition of [[Hakuin Ekaku]], ''The Gateless Gate'' is a central work much used in [[Rinzai School]] practice. Five of the koans in the work concern the sayings and doings of [[Zhaozhou Congshen|Zhaozhou]]; four concern [[Yunmen Wenyan|Ummon]].

The common theme of the koans of the Wumen Guan and of Wumen's comments is the inquiry and introspection of dualistic conceptualization. Each koan epitomizes one or more of the polarities of consciousness that act like an obstacle or wall to the insight. The student is challenged to transcend the polarity that the koan represents and demonstrate or show that transcendence to the Zen teacher.

== Structure and contents ==
The text was originally prepared by Wumen as a record of his teaching during a monastic training period held at ''Longxiang'' (Soaring Dragon) monastery in the summer of 1228.  Wumen selected the 48 koans and commented on and added a verse for each koan.  His teachings were transcribed and after the training period were compiled into the collection called the Wumen Guan.

As was customary in China at the time, an edition might have additions of text inserted by a subsequent owner or publisher. The most well known version of the text is from the Japanese wood block edition made from the 1246 manuscript edition that contains the following sections.

* An untitled introduction by Xi Xiang (習巷), publisher of the 1228 edition, written in the self-deprecating style of Zen humor.
* An untitled dedication by Wumen to the Emperor and Empress. Works without such dedications were subject to Imperial censorship as being seditious.
* An untitled foreword by Wumen followed by a verse on the title.
* A table of contents with the title of each koan. However, the koans are unnumbered in both the table of contents and the body of the text and there are no page numbers in the text, so the table of contents is just the list of the koan's titles in order of appearance.
* The 48 koans presented in four parts consisting of (1) a title composed of four characters, (2) the body of the koan beginning with the name of the protagonist of the case, (3) a comment beginning with the words "Wumen says" (無門曰), and a verse beginning with the words "The ode says" (頌曰).
* An untitled afterword by Wumen that ends with the words "The end of the volume the Gateless Checkpoint."
* An appendix believed to be written by Wumen titled "Zen Caveats" or "Zen Warnings"" consisting of twelve one-line aphorisms about Zen practice written in the style of Zen contrariness that points to not falling for either side of dualistic thinking. For example, Zen is known as the school of Buddhism that does not stand on written words and one caveat says, "Neglecting the written records with unrestrained ideas is falling into a deep pit."
* An appendix titled "Huanglong's Three Checkpoints" (黄龍三關) written by Wuliang Zongshou (無量宗壽) in the late spring of 1230 C.E.. Huanglong Huinan (J. Oryo Enan), 1002-1069. was a Zen master who promulgated three questions as one-line koans: "Everyone exists by a particular cause of birth. What is your cause of birth?" "How is my hand like the hand of Buddha?" "How is my leg like the leg of a donkey?"  Wulaing wrote four four-line stanzas (Sanskrit ''gathas'').  Each of the first three stanzas comments on one of Huanglong's three questions and the fourth stanza is a summation.  Wulaing writes that he penned the four verses to thank and commemorate Wumen's recent stay at Ruiyan (瑞巖)(Lucky Cliff) monastery where Wumen was the visiting head teacher for the training period.
* A short untitled addendum by Wuan written on the republishing of the work in the summer of 1245 C.E. Wuan called his brief addition the 49th case. It referred to [[Bodhidharma]]'s famous Zen motto: "Not maintaining written words, but pointing directly to the human heart-mind to see one's own nature to become Buddha".
* An undated postscript by Menggong (孟拱) consisting of a very brief story of a military ambassador who used his army as farmers to reclaim a wasteland and thus pacify the region. This appears to be a metaphor for the practice of Zen.
* An appendix by Anwan dated the beginning of summer 1246, presented in the same format as one of the 48 main koans and consisting of (1) an untitled introduction, (2) a title, "Younger Brother's 49th Standard Talk", (3) the body of the case, (4) a comment beginning with "Anwan says", and (5) a verse beginning with "The ode says", followed by Anwan's signature with the place and date of the writing.

==Zen Caveats==
The Wumen Guan has an appendix titled "Zen Caveats" (禪箴) with one-line aphorisms dealing with Zen practice  The word ''zhēn'' (箴) means "caveat", "warning", or "admonition", but it also has the meaning of "needle" or "probe" (as in [[acupuncture]] needles) and is sometimes translated as "Zen Needles".  As with the main koans, each caveat challenges the Zen student's attachment to dualistic concepts, here those especially related to Zen practice.

: Following the rules and protecting the regulations is binding oneself without rope.

: Moving freely vertically and horizontally without obstruction is the way of outsiders and the nightmare army.

: To preserve the heart mind and to purify it by letting impurities settle to the bottom in quiescence is the perverted Zen of silent illumination.

: Neglecting the written records with unrestrained ideas is falling into a deep pit.

: To be awake and not ignorant is to wear chains and shoulder a [[cangue]].

: Thinking good and thinking evil are the halls of heaven and hell.

: A view of Buddha and a view of Dharma are the two enclosing mountains of iron.

: A person who perceives thoughts as they immediately arise is fiddling with spectral consciousness.

: However, being on a high plateau practicing samadhi is the stratagem of living in the house of ghosts.

: To advance results in ignoring truth; to retreat results in contradicting the lineage.

: Neither to advance nor to retreat is being a breathing corpse.

: Just say, how will you walk?

: You must work hard to live in the present and, to finish, all the more. I do not advise the unfortunate excess of continual suffering.

'''Tibetan Buddhism''' is the form of [[Buddhist]] doctrine and institutions named after the lands of [[Tibet]], but also found in the regions surrounding the [[Himalayas]] and much of [[Central Asia]]. It derives from the latest stages of [[Indian Buddhism]] and preserves "the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=White |first=David Gordon (ed.) |year=2000 |page=21 |title=Tantra in Practice |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-05779-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been spread outside of Tibet, especially due to the Mongol power of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), founded by [[Kublai Khan]], that also ruled [[China]].

Tibetan Buddhism applies [[Tantra|Tantric]] practices, especially [[deity yoga]], and aspires to [[Buddhahood]] or the [[rainbow body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=John|title=Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy980CH84mEC&amp;pg=PA392|date=2007|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=[[Ithaca, New York]]|isbn=978-1-55939-282-2|pages=392–3, 415|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhism in Tibet has four major schools, namely [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]], [[Sakya]] and [[Gelug]] (developed out of [[Sakya]]). The [[Jonang]] is a smaller school, and the [[Rimé movement]] is an eclectic movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools. Among the prominent proponents of Tibetan Buddhism are the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Panchen Lama]], the leaders of Gelug school in Tibet.

==Nomenclature==
Westerners unfamiliar with Tibetan Buddhism initially turned to China for an understanding. There the term used was "lamaism" (literally, "doctrine of the lamas": ''lama jiao'') to distinguish it from a then-traditional Chinese form (''fo jiao''). The term was taken up by western scholars including [[Hegel]], as early as 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lopez |first=Donald S. Jr. |authorlink=Donald S. Lopez, Jr. |title=Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West |year=1999 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-49311-3 |pages=6, 19f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as it implies a discontinuity between Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, the term has been discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term, "[[Vajrayāna]]" is occasionally used mistakenly for Tibetan Buddhism. More accurately, it signifies a certain subset of practices included in, not only Tibetan Buddhism, but other forms of Buddhism as well.

The native Tibetan term for all Buddhism is "doctrine of the internalists" (''nang-pa'i chos'': …of those who emphasise introspection).

In the west, the term "Indo-Tibetan Buddhism" has become current, in acknowledgement of its derivation from the latest stages of Buddhist development in northern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snellgrove |first=David |authorlink=David Snellgrove |title=Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. Indian Buddhists &amp; Their Tibetan Successors, Vol.2 |year=1987 |publisher=Shambala Publications |location=Boston |isbn=0-87773-379-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Tibetan Buddhism}}

===Tibetan Empire - first dissemination (7th-9th century)===
{{Main|Tibetan Empire}}

Buddhism was formally introduced into Tibet during the [[Tibetan Empire]] (7th-9th century AD). Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures from India were first translated into Tibetan under the reign of the [[Tibet]]an king [[Songtsän Gampo]] (618-649),&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/survey_tibetan_history/chapter_1.html: Berzin, Alexander, ''A Survey of Tibetan History'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century King [[Trisong Detsen]] (755-797) established it as the official religion of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, C.I.: ''The revolt of 755 in Tibet'', in: ''The History of Tibet'', ed. Alex McKay, Vol. 1, London 2003, p. 273-285 (discusses the political background and the motives of the ruler).&lt;/ref&gt; Trisong Detsen invited Indian Buddhist scholars to his court, including [[Padmasambhava|Padmasambhāva]] (8th century) and [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788)), who founded the [[Nyingma]], ''The Ancient Ones'', the oldest school of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"&gt;Berzin. Alexander (2000). ''How Did Tibetan Buddhism Develop?'': [http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/buddhism-in-tibet/how-did-tibetan-buddhism-develop StudyBuddhism.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There was also influence from the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādins]] from Kashmir to the southwest&lt;ref&gt;Conze, 1993, 106&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Khotan]] to the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/buddhism-in-tibet/how-did-tibetan-buddhism-develop: Berzin, Alexander (2000). ''How Did Tibetan Buddhism Develop?'']; [http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/about-buddhism/the-world-of-buddhism/spread-of-buddhism-in-asia: Berzin, Alexander (1996). ''The Spread of Buddhism in Asia'']&lt;/ref&gt; Trisong Detsen also invited the [[Chinese Chán|Chan]] master [[Moheyan]]{{refn|group=note|和尚摩訶衍; his name consists of the same Chinese characters used to transliterate “[[Mahayana]]”) (Tibetan: ''Hwa shang Mahayana'')}} to transmit the Dharma at Samye Monastery. According to Tibetan sources, Moheyan lost the socalled [[council of Lhasa]] (793), a debate sponsored by Trisong Detsen on the nature of emptiness with the Indian master [[Kamalaśīla]], and the king declared [[Kamalaśīla]]s philosophy should form the basis for Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yzzj.fodian.net/BaoKu/FoDianWenInfo.aspx?ID=FW00000462 定解宝灯论新月释] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102032603/http://yzzj.fodian.net/BaoKu/FoDianWenInfo.aspx?ID=FW00000462 |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, Zuihō (undated).

===Era of fragmentation (9th-10th century)===
A reversal in Buddhist influence began under King Langdarma (r. 836-842), and his death was followed by the socalled ''Era of Fragmentation'', a period of Tibetan history in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier [[Tibetan Empire]] collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa. p.173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan Renaissance - second dissemination (10th-12th century)===
[[File:Atisha.gif|thumb|Atiśa]]

The late 10th and 11th century saw a revival of Buddhism in Tibet. Coinciding with the early discoveries of "[[Terma (religion)|hidden treasures]]" (''terma''),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/study/comparison_buddhist_traditions/tibetan_traditions/four_traditions_tibetan_buddhism/transcript_1.html: Berzin, Alexander. ''The Four Traditions of Tibetan Buddhism: Personal Experience, History, and Comparisons'']&lt;/ref&gt; the 11th century saw a revival of Buddhist influence originating in the far east and far west of Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, 1993, 104ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, [[Rinchen Zangpo]] (958-1055) was active as a translator and founded temples and monasteries. Prominent scholars and teachers were again invited from India.

In 1042 [[Atisha|Atiśa]] (982-1054 AD) arrived in Tibet at the invitation of a west Tibetan king. This renowned exponent of the Pāla form of Buddhism from the Indian university of [[Vikramashila]] later moved to central Tibet. There his chief disciple, Dromtonpa founded the [[Kadampa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, under whose influence the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|New Translation]] schools of today evolved.

The [[Sakya]], the ''Grey Earth'' school, was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo ({{bo|w='khon dkon mchog rgyal po}}, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great [[Lotsawa]], Drogmi Shākya ({{bo|w=brog mi lo tsā wa ye shes}}). It is headed by the [[Sakya Trizin]], traces its lineage to the [[mahasiddha]] Virūpa,&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"/&gt; and represents the scholarly tradition. A renowned exponent, [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251AD), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.

Other seminal Indian teachers were [[Tilopa]] (988–1069) and his student [[Naropa]] (probably died ca. 1040 AD).The [[Kagyu]], the ''Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word'', is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was [[Milarepa]], an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master [[Naropa]] via [[Marpa Lotsawa]], Milarepa and [[Gampopa]]&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"/&gt;

===Mongol dominance (13th-14th century)===
{{Main|Yuan dynasty}}

Tibetan Buddhism exerted a strong influence from the 11th century CE among the peoples of [[Inner Asia]], especially the [[Mongols]]. The Mongols invaded Tibet in 1240&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa. p.61: 'thirty thousand troops, under the command of Leje and Dorta, reached Phanpo, north of Lhasa.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders. p. 309, ''his grandson Godan Khan invaded Tibet with 30000 men and destroyed several Buddhist monasteries north of Lhasa''&lt;/ref&gt; and 1244.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, ibid. p.194: Shakabpa, 1967 pp.61-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols had annexed [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]] to the east. Sakya Paṇḍita was appointed Viceroy of Central Tibet by the Mongol court in 1249.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gwydionwilliams.com/42-china/tibet/how-tibet-emerged-within-the-chinese-empire/|title=How Tibet Emerged Within the Wider Chinese Power-Political Zone|date=2015-04-18|work=Long Revolution|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tibet was incorporated into the Mongol Empire, retaining nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative{{sfn|Wylie|1990|p=104}}&lt;ref&gt;"To counterbalance the political power of the lama, Khubilai appointed civil administrators at the Sa-skya to supervise the mongol regency."&lt;/ref&gt; rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. Tibetan Buddhism was adopted as the ''de facto'' [[state religion]] by the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), founded by [[Kublai Khan]], whose capital is Xanadu (Beijing, China).&lt;ref name="Huntington_et_al"/&gt;

===Tibetan autonomy (14th-18th century)===
With the decline of the Yuan dynansty and the loose administration of the following (Han-Chinese) [[Ming dynasty]], Central Tibet was ruled by successive local families from the 14th to the 17th century, and Tibet would gain de facto a high autonomy after the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Rossabi194"&gt;Rossabi 1983, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family rule and establishment of Gelugpa school (14th-17th century)====
{{main article|Phagmodrupa Dynasty|Rinpungpa|Tsangpa}}

[[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen|Jangchub Gyaltsän]] (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302–1364) became the strongest political family in the mid 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Petech, L. ''Central Tibet and The Mongols''. (Serie Orientale Roma 65). Rome: Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente 1990:  85–143&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the reformist scholar [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419) founded the [[Gelug]] sect which would have a decisive influence on Tibet's history. Internal strife within the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions, led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family [[Rinpungpa]], based in [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 the Rinpungpa family was overthrown by the [[Tsangpa]] Dynasty of [[Shigatse]] which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. They would play a pivotal role in the events which led to the rise of power of the Dalai Lama's in the 1640s.

====Ganden Phodrang government  (17th-18th century)====
{{Main article|Ganden Phodrang}}

The ''Ganden Phodrang'' was the Tibetan regime that was established by the [[5th Dalai Lama]] with the help of the Güshi Khan of the Khoshut Mongols in 1642. After the civil war in the 17th century and the Mongol intervention, the Gelugpa school dominated Tibetan Buddhism, and successive Dalai Lamas and Panchans ruled [[Tibet]] as regional governance from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.

===Qing rule (18th-20th century)===
The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1912) established a Chinese full rule over Tibet after a [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720)|Qing expedition force]] defeated the [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] (who controlled Tibet) in 1720, and lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Emblems of Empire: Selections from the Mactaggart Art Collection, by John E. Vollmer, Jacqueline Simcox, p154&lt;/ref&gt; The Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty supported Tibetan Buddhism, especially the [[Gelug]] sect, for most times of their dynasty of China.&lt;ref name="Huntington_et_al"&gt;The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art, by John C. Huntington, Dina Bangdel, Robert A. F. Thurman, p48&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rimé movement]] was a 19th-century movement involving the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools of Tibetan Buddhism, along with some [[Bon]] scholars.&lt;ref name="Lopez, Donald S. 1998 p. 190"&gt;Lopez, Donald S. (1998). ''Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Having seen how the [[Gelug]] institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] (1820-1892) and [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrül]] (1813-1899) compiled together the teachings of the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]], including many near-extinct teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 165-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the ''[[Nyingma#Rinchen Terdzod|Rinchen Terdzod]]'' and the ''[[Sheja Dzö]]''.

===20th century===
[[File:Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama in 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[14th Dalai Lama]] meeting with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] in 2014. Due to his widespread popularity, the Dalai Lama has become the modern international face of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1912, following the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Tibet became de facto independent under the 13th [[Dalai Lama]] government based in [[Lhasa]], maintaining the current territory of what is now called the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]].&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Chamdo]] Tibet was annexed by the Chinese People's republic in 1950. In 1959 the [[14th Dalai Lama]] and a great number of clergy fled the country, to settle in India and other neighbouring countries. The events of the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76) saw religion as one of the main political targets of the Chinese Communist Party and most of the several thousand temples and monasteries in Tibet were destroyed, with many monks and lamas imprisoned.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 108"&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Matters were made much worse by the Chinese Cultural Revolution. During this time, private religious expression, as well as Tibetan cultural traditions were being suppressed. Much of the Tibetan textual heritage was destroyed, and monks and nuns were forced to disrobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World|last=Cantwell|first=Cathy|last2=Kawanami|first2=Hiroko|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Tibet however there was a renewed interest in Tibetan Buddhism in places such as Nepal and Bhutan, while the spread of Tibetan Buddhism in the Western world was accomplished by many of the refugee Tibetan Lamas who escaped Tibet.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 108"/&gt;

After the liberalization policies in China during the 1980s, the religion began to recover with some temples and monasteries being reconstructed.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 110"&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhism is now an influential religion among educated Chinese and also in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 110"/&gt;

===21st century===
Today, Tibetan Buddhism is adhered to widely in the [[Tibetan Plateau]], [[Mongolia]], northern [[Nepal]], [[Kalmykia]] (on the north-west shore of the Caspian), [[Siberia]]  ([[Tuva]] and [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]), the [[Russian Far East]] and northeast China. It is the [[state religion]] of [[Buddhism in Bhutan|Bhutan]].&lt;ref&gt;The 2007 U.S. State Department report on religious freedom in Bhutan notes that "Mahayana Buddhism is the state religion..." and that the Bhutanese government supports both the Kagyu and Nyingma sects. [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90227.htm State.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian regions of [[Sikkim]] and [[Ladakh]], both formerly independent kingdoms, are also home to significant Tibetan Buddhist populations, as are the Indian states of [[Himachal Pradesh]] (which includes [[Dharamshala]] and the district of Lahaul-Spiti), [[West Bengal]] (the hill stations of [[Darjeeling]] and [[Kalimpong]]) and [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

In the wake of the [[Tibetan diaspora]], Tibetan Buddhism has gained adherents in the West and throughout the world. Fully ordained Tibetan Buddhist Monks now work in academia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eview.anu.edu.au/one_world/index.php Bruce A (ed). One World – Many Paths to Peace ANU E-Press 2009 (launched by the 14th Dalai Lama)] (accessed 11 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Samuel sees the character of Tibetan Buddhism in the West as
{{quote|...that of a national or international network, generally centred around the teachings of a single individual lama. Among the larger ones are the FPMT, which I have already mentioned, now headed by [[Lama Zopa]]  and the child-reincarnation of [[Lama Yeshe]]; the New Kadampa, in origin a break-away from the FPMT; the Shambhala network, deriving from [[Chögyam Trungpa]] 's organization and now headed by his son; and the networks associated with [[Namkhai Norbu]]  Rinpoche (the Dzogchen Community) and [[Sogyal Rinpoche]]  (Rigpa).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Geoffrey; Tantric Revisionings: New Understandings of Tibetan Buddhism and Indian Religion, page 303 - 304&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Castle Books: 291&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bodhisattva#Mahayana Buddhism|Bodhisattvas]]'' are revered beings who have conceived the [[Bodhisattva vows|will and vow]] to dedicate their lives with ''bodhicitta'' for the sake of all beings. Widely revered Bodhisattvas in Tibetan Buddhism include [[Avalokiteshvara]], [[Manjushri]], [[Vajrapani]], and [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].

Buddhahood is defined as a state free of the obstructions to liberation as well as those to omniscience.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Dhargyey (1978), 64f; Dhargyey (1982), 257f, etc; [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]], 364f; Tsong-kha-pa II: 183f. The former are the afflictions, negative states of mind, and the [[three poisons]] – desire, anger, and ignorance. The latter are subtle imprints, traces or "stains" of delusion that involves the imagination of inherent existence.&lt;/ref&gt; When one is freed from all mental obscurations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]], 152f&lt;/ref&gt; one is said to attain a state of continuous bliss mixed with a simultaneous cognition of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]], 243, 258&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vipassanā|true nature of reality]].&lt;ref name="Hopkins 1996"&gt;Hopkins (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In this state, all limitations on one's ability to help other living beings are removed.&lt;ref&gt;Dhargyey (1978), 61f; Dhargyey (1982), 242-266; [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]], 365&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhism claims to teach methods for achieving Buddhahood more quickly (known as the [[Vajrayāna]] path).&lt;ref&gt;Thurman, Robert (1997): 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is said that there are countless beings who have attained buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]], 252f&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhas spontaneously, naturally and continuously perform activities to benefit all sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]], 367&lt;/ref&gt; However it is believed that one's ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'' could limit the ability of the Buddhas to help them. Thus, although Buddhas possess no limitation from their side on their ability to help others, sentient beings continue to experience suffering as a result of the limitations of their own former negative actions.&lt;ref&gt;Dhargyey (1978), 74; Dhargyey (1982), 3, 303f; [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]], 13f, 280f; [http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/hinayana-and-mahayana-comparison: Berzin, Alexander (2002). ''Hinayana and Mahayana: Comparison'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lamrim===
{{Main|Lamrim}}
''Lamrim'' (Tibetan: "stages of the path") is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] textual  form for presenting the stages in the complete path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]] as taught by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of ''lamrim'', presented by different teachers of the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Sakya]] school, too, has a somewhat similar textual form, the ''[[lamdré]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, all versions of the ''lamrim'' are elaborations of [[Atisha|Atiśa]]'s 11th-century root text ''[[Bodhipathapradīpa|A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment]]'' (''Bodhipathapradīpa'').&lt;ref name="thubten"&gt;[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/index.html Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Atisha's lamrim system generally divides practitioners into those of ''lesser'', ''middling'' and ''superior'' scopes or attitudes:
*The lesser person is to focus on the preciousness of human birth as well as contemplation of death and impermanence.
*The middling person is taught to contemplate [[karma]], [[dukkha]] (suffering) and the benefits of liberation and refuge. 
*The superior scope is said to encompass the four [[Brahmavihara]]s, the [[bodhisattva]] vow, the six [[paramitas]] as well as Tantric practices.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''lamrim'' texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways and with different emphasis depending on the school and tradition it belongs to. [[Gampopa]] and [[Tsongkhapa]] expanded the short root-text of Atiśa into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like [[karma]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], Buddhist cosmology and the practice of [[meditation]] are gradually explained in logical order.

===Tantrism===
Tibetan Buddhism is a form of [[Vajrayana]] (''Vajra vehicle'') or Buddhist [[Tantra]], affirming the views espoused in the texts known as the [[Buddhist Tantras]] (dating from around the 7th century CE onwards).&lt;ref&gt;Powers, 2007, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tantra]] (Tibetan: ''rgyud'') generally refers to forms of religious practice which emphasize the use of unique visualizations, ideas, symbols and rituals for inner transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, 2007, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vajrayana is seen by its adherents as the fastest and most powerful vehicle for enlightenment because it contains many special techniques and because it takes the effect ([[Buddhahood]] itself, or [[Buddha nature]]) as the path (and hence is sometimes known as the "effect vehicle").&lt;ref&gt;Powers, 2007, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; 

These texts also generally affirm the use of sense pleasures in Tantric ritual as a path to enlightenment, as opposed to non-Tantric Buddhism which affirms that one must renounce all sense pleasures.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 82"&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; These practices are based on the theory of transformation which states that negative or sensual mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting, the [[Hevajra tantra]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) ''Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors''. pp 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another element of the Tantras is their use of transgressive practices, such as drinking alcohol or sexual yoga. While in many cases these transgressions were interpreted only symbolically, in other cases they are practiced literally.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 83"&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madhyamaka and the tenets system===
[[Madhyamaka]] is the dominant Buddhist philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism and is generally seen as the highest view, but is interpreted in various ways. [[śūnyatā|Shunyata]], the true nature of reality, or the emptiness of inherent existence of all things, is traditionally propounded according to a hierarchical classification of four classical Indian philosophical schools. While the classical tenets-system, as propagated by the Gelugpa, is limited to four tenets (Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka), more complicated systems include also the ''shentong''-view of the Jonang and the Kagyu, and also differentiates between the radical emptiness of the Gelugpa-school, and the experiential emptiness of the Nyingma and the Shakya.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145, 150}}

Two tenets belong to the path referred to as the [[Hinayana]], and are both [[Sarvastivada]]-subschools. They do not include Theravada, the only surviving of the 18 classical schools of Buddhism:{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=135}}
* [[Vaibhāṣika]] ({{bo|w=bye brag smra ba}}). The primary source for the Vaibhāṣika is the ''[[Abhidharma-kosa|Abhidharma-kośa]]'' of [[Vasubandhu]] and its commentaries. This system affirms an atomistic view of reality as well the view that perception directly experiences external objects.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 67"&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sautrāntika]] ({{bo|w=mdo sde pa}}). The ''Abhidharmakośa'' was also an important source for the Sautrāntikas. [[Dignāga]] and [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]] are the most prominent exponents. As opposed to Vaibhāṣika, this view holds that we do not directly perceive the external world, only phenomenal forms caused by objects and our senses.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 67"/&gt;

The other two tenets are [[Mahayana]]:
* [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], also called ''Cittamātra''  "Mind-Only" ({{bo|w=sems-tsam-pa}}). Yogacārins base their views on texts from [[Maitreya]], [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] and [[Vasubandhu]]. Yogacara is often interpreted as a form of [[Idealism]].&lt;ref name="Kapstein 67"/&gt; The system is entirely rejected by the Gelugpa, but elements of it form part of the teachings of the other schools.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=136}}
* [[Madhyamaka]] ({{bo|w=dbu-ma-pa}}) - The philosophy of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] and [[Aryadeva|Āryadeva]], which affirms that everything is empty of essence ([[svabhava]]) and is ultimately beyond concepts.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 67"/&gt;
:* [[Rangtong]], a term introduced by [[Dolpopa]], which rejects any inherent existing self or nature.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=146-147}} This includes:
::* [[Svatantrika]]
:::* Sautrantika Svātantrika Madhyamaka - [[Bhāviveka]]
:::* Yogācāra Svātantrika Madhyamaka - [[Śāntarakṣita]] and [[Kamalaśīla]], the oldest Buddhist teachings to be introduced in Tibet{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=138}}
::* [[Prasaṅgika]], based on [[Buddhapālita]] and [[Candrakīrti]]. Within prasangika, a further division can be made:
:::* Intellectual emptiness, which is realized by absolute denial. This is the view of Tsong Khapa and the Gelugpa school, which rejects any statements on an absolute reality beyond mere emptiness.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145}} 
:::* Experiential emptiness, which is realized when the understanding of intellectual emptiness gives way to the recognition of the true [[nature of mind]], c.q. [[rigpa]]. This is the view of Nyingma (Dzogchen) and Sakya.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145}}
:* [[Shentong]], systematised by Dolpopa, and based on [[Buddha-nature]] teachings and influenced by Śāntarakṣita's Yogacara-Madhyamaka. It states that the [[nature of mind]] shines through when emptiness has been realized. This approach is dominant in the Jonang school, and can also be found in the Kagyu (Mahamudra) tradition.{{sfn|Hookam|1991}}{{sfn|Brunnhölzl|2004}}{{sfn|Cornu|2001}}

The tenet systems are being used in the monasteries and colleges to teach Buddhist philosophy in a systematic and progressive fashion, each philosophical view being more subtle than its predecessor. Therefore, the four schools can be seen as a gradual path from a rather easy-to-grasp, "realistic" philosophical point of view, to more and more complex and subtle views on the ultimate nature of reality, that is on emptiness and [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent arising]], culminating in the philosophy of the Mādhyamikas, which is widely believed to present the most sophisticated point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Sopa &amp; Hopkins (1977), 67-69; Hopkins (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Tibetan scholars point out that historically, Madhyamaka predates Cittamātra, however.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Conze (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reincarnated lamas===
Significant genuine innovations in Tibetan Buddhism have been few.&lt;ref&gt;Conze (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the system of [[tulku|incarnate lamas]]{{refn|group=note|Tib.: ''tulku'', Wylie: ''sprul-ku''}} is popularly held to be an innovation, it is disputable that this is a distinctly Tibetan development. Two centuries before Buddhism was introduced to Tibet, in the fifth century CE, the ''Abhidharma'' teacher [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]] was declared by Sri Lankan elders to be a reincarnation of the bodhisattva Maitreya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/hinayana-and-mahayana-comparison: Berzin, Alexander (2002). ''Hinayana and Mahayana: Comparison'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts and study==
[[File:Konchog-wangdu.jpeg|thumb|upright|Buddhist monk Geshe Konchog Wangdu reads [[Mahayana sutra]]s from an old woodblock copy of the Tibetan [[Kangyur]]]]
{{Main|Tibetan Buddhist canon}}
Study of major Buddhist Indian texts is central to the monastic curriculum in all four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Memorization of classic texts as well as other ritual texts is expected as part of traditional monastic education.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The main liturgical language is [[classical Tibetan]]. Another important part of higher religious education was the practice of formalized debate. 

===Sutra traditions===
Since the late 11th century, traditional Tibetan monastic colleges generally organized the exoteric study of Buddhism into "five great textual traditions" (''zhungchen-nga'').&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tantras===
{{Main|Tantras (Buddhism)}}

Tantric texts are divided into our or six categories, with several sub-categories for the highest Tantras. In the Nyingma, the division is into ''Outer Tantras'' ([[Kriyayoga]], [[Charyayoga]], [[Yogatantra]]); and ''Inner Tantras'' ([[Mahayoga]], [[Anuyoga]], [[Atiyoga]] (Tib. [[Dzogchen]])), which correspond to the Anuttarayogatantra. In the Gelug, Sakya, and Kagyu, the division is into Kriyayoga, Charyayoga, Yogatantra, [[Anuttarayoga Tantra|Anuttarayogatantra]] (mother tantras, father tantras, non-dual tantras).

Important tantric texts are the [[Hevajra Tantra]] (8th century) and the [[Kalachakra Tantra]] (mid-11th century).

===Other texts===
Also of great importance are the "[[Maitreya-nātha#Attributed_works|Five Treatises of Maitreya]]" including the influential ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga (text)|Ratnagotravibhāga]]'', a compendium of the [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|tathāgatagarbha literature]], and the ''[[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|Mahayanasutralankara]]'', a text on the Mahayana path from the [[Yogacara]] perspective, which are often attributed to [[Asanga]]. Practiced focused texts such as the [[Yogacarabhumi]] and [[Kamalaśīla]]'s [[Bhāvanākrama]] are the major sources for meditation. The [[Buddhist Tantras]] are another class of texts which form a whole other corpus of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition focusing on [[Tantra]] practices.

While the Indian texts are often central, newer Tibetan material is also widely studied. The commentaries and interpretations that are used to shed light on these texts differ according to tradition. The Gelug school for example, use the works of [[Tsongkhapa]], while other schools may use the more recent work of [[Rimé movement]] scholars like [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]]. 

A corpus of extra-canonical scripture, the [[terma (religion)|treasure texts]] (''terma'') literature is acknowledged by [[Nyingma]] practitioners, but the bulk of the canon that is not commentary was translated from Indian sources. True to its roots in the ''Pāla'' system of North India, however, Tibetan Buddhism carries on a tradition of eclectic accumulation and systematisation of diverse Buddhist elements, and pursues their synthesis. Prominent among these achievements have been the [[lamrim|Stages of the Path]] and [[lojong|mind training]], both stemming from teachings by the Indian pandit, [[Atiśa]].

===Transmission and realization===
There is a long history of [[Oral tradition|oral transmission]] of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. Oral transmissions by [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] holders traditionally can take place in small groups or mass gatherings of listeners and may last for seconds (in the case of a [[Mantra#Mantra in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism|mantra]], for example) or months (as in the case of a section of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]]). It is held that a transmission can even occur without actually hearing, as in [[Asanga]]'s visions of [[Maitreya]].

An emphasis on oral transmission as more important than the printed word derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them.&lt;ref&gt;Conze (1993): 26&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing a teaching (transmission) readies the hearer for realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should have heard it as one link in a succession of listeners going back to the original speaker: the Buddha in the case of a ''[[Sūtra|sutra]]'' or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.

===Rites and rituals===
[[File:Chenrezig empowerment seattle sakya.jpg|thumb|right|The reading of the text - the 'lung' - during an empowerment for [[Chenrezig]].]]
There has been a "close association" between the religious and the secular, the spiritual and the temporal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cueppers|first=Christoph|title=The Relationship Between Religion and State (chos srid zung &amp;#39;brel) In Traditional Tibet|url=https://www.academia.edu/2262393/The_Relationship_Between_Religion_and_State_chos_srid_zung_brel_In_Traditional_Tibet|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tibet. The term for this relationship is ''chos srid zung 'brel.'' Traditionally Tibetan lamas have tended to the lay populace by helping them with issues such as protection and prosperity. Common traditions have been the various rites and rituals for mundane ends, such as purifying one's karma, avoiding harm from demonic forces and enemies, and promoting a successful harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Divination]] and [[exorcism]] are examples of practices a lama might use for this.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual is generally more elaborate than in other forms of Buddhism, with complex altar arrangements and works of art, many ritual objects, hand gestures ([[mudra]]), chants, and musical instruments.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 82"/&gt;

A special kind of ritual called [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|an initiation or empowerment]] (Sanskrit: ''Abhiseka'', Tibetan: ''Wangkur'') is central to Tantric practice. These rituals consecrate a practitioner into a particular Tantric practice associated with individual mandalas of deities and mantras. Without having gone through initiation, one is generally not allowed to practice the higher Tantras.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important ritual occasion in Tibetan Buddhism is that of mortuary rituals which are supposed to assure that one has a positive rebirth and a good spiritual path in the future.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 94"&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Of central importance to Tibetan Buddhist ''[[Ars moriendi]]'' is the idea of the [[Bardo]] (Sanskrit: ''antarābhava''), the intermediate or liminal state between life and death.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 94"/&gt; Rituals and the readings of texts such as the [[Bardo Thodol]] are done to ensure that the dying person can navigate this intermediate state skillfully. [[Cremation]] and [[sky burial]] are traditionally the main [[funeral]] rites used to dispose of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preliminary practices and approach to Vajrayāna===
{{see also|Ngöndro}}
[[File:IMG_1016_Lhasa_Barkhor.jpg|thumb|Buddhists performing prostrations in front of [[Jokhang Monastery]].]]

[[Vajrayāna]] is believed by Tibetan Buddhists to be the fastest method for attaining Buddhahood but for unqualified practitioners it can be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Pabonka, p.649&lt;/ref&gt; To engage in it one must receive an appropriate initiation (also known as an "empowerment") from a lama who is fully qualified to give it.  From the time one has resolved to accept such an initiation, the utmost sustained effort in guru devotion is essential.

The aim of [[ngöndro|preliminary practices]] (''ngöndro'') is to start the student on the correct path for such higher teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Kalu Rinpoche (1986), ''The Gem Ornament of Manifold Instructions''. Snow Lion, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as Sutrayāna preceded Vajrayāna historically in India, so sutra practices constitute those that are preliminary to tantric ones. Preliminary practices include all ''Sutrayāna'' activities that yield merit like hearing teachings, prostrations, offerings, prayers and acts of kindness and compassion, but chief among the preliminary practices are realizations through meditation on the three principle stages of the path: renunciation, the altruistic [[bodhicitta]] wish to attain enlightenment and the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a person without the basis of these three in particular to practice Vajrayāna can be like a small child trying to ride an unbroken horse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]], 649&lt;/ref&gt;

While the practices of Vajrayāna are not known in Sutrayāna, all Sutrayāna practices are common to Vajrayāna. Without training in the preliminary practices, the ubiquity of allusions to them in Vajrayāna is meaningless and even successful Vajrayāna initiation becomes impossible.

The merit acquired in the preliminary practices facilitates progress in Vajrayāna. While many Buddhists may spend a lifetime exclusively on sutra practices, however, an amalgam of the two to some degree is common. For example, in order to train in [[calm abiding]], one might use a tantric visualisation as the meditation object.

===Paramita and Compassion===
{{Main|Paramitas}}
The [[paramitas]] (perfections) is a key set of virtues practiced in this tradition. 

# ''[[Dāna]] pāramitā'': generosity, giving of oneself (Tibetan, སབྱིན་པ ''sbyin-pa'')
# ''[[Śīla]] pāramitā'' : virtue, morality, discipline, proper conduct (ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས ''tshul-khrims'')
# ''[[Kshanti|{{IAST|Kṣānti}}]] pāramitā'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance (བཟོད་པ ''bzod-pa'')
# ''[[Vīrya]] pāramitā'' : energy, diligence, vigor, effort (བརྩོན་འགྲུས ''brtson-’grus'')
# ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyāna]] pāramitā'' : one-pointed concentration, contemplation (བསམ་གཏན ''bsam-gtan'')
# ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]] pāramitā'' : wisdom, insight (ཤེས་རབ ''shes-rab'')

The practice of ''Dāna'' (giving) while traditionally referring to offerings of food to the monastics can also refer to the ritual offering of bowls of water, incense, butter lamps and flowers to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas on an shrine or household altar.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar offerings are also given to other beings such as hungry ghosts, [[dakinis]], protector deities, local divinities etc.

Like other forms of Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of the [[five precepts]] and [[Bodhisattva vow]]s is part of Tibetan Buddhist moral (''sila'') practice. In addition to these, there are also numerous sets of Tantric vows, termed [[Samaya]], which are given as part of Tantric initiations.

Compassion ([[Karuṇā]]) practices are also particularly important in Tibetan Buddhism. One of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the ''[[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra]]'' by Shantideva. In the eighth section entitled ''Meditative Concentration'', Shantideva describes meditation on Karunā as thus:

{{quote|Strive at first to meditate upon the sameness of yourself and others. In joy and sorrow all are equal; Thus be guardian of all, as of yourself. The hand and other limbs are many and distinct, But all are one--the body to kept and guarded. Likewise, different beings, in their joys and sorrows, are, like me, all one in wanting happiness. This pain of mine does not afflict or cause discomfort to another's body, and yet this pain is hard for me to bear because I cling and take it for my own. And other beings' pain I do not feel, and yet, because I take them for myself, their suffering is mine and therefore hard to bear. And therefore I'll dispel the pain of others, for it is simply pain, just like my own.  And others I will aid and benefit, for they are living beings, like my body. Since I and other beings both, in wanting happiness, are equal and alike, what difference is there to distinguish us, that I should strive to have my bliss alone?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of the Bodhisattva'' by Shantideva.  Shambhala Publications.  Page 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A popular compassion meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is [[Tonglen]] (sending and taking love and suffering respectively).

===Samatha and Vipaśyanā===
[[File:Young monk in meditation cell, Yerpa, Tibet. 1993.jpg|thumb|Young monk in meditation retreat, [[Yerpa]], [[Tibet]] in 1993]]
Traditionally, Tibetan Buddhism follows the two main approaches to [[meditation]] as taught in all forms of Buddhism, [[śamatha]] (Tib. ''Shine'') and [[vipaśyanā]] (Tib. ''lhaktong''). 

The practice of [[śamatha]] (calm abiding) is one of focusing one's mind on a single object such as a Buddha figure or the breath. Through repeated practice one's mind gradually becomes more stable, calm and happy. The [[Samatha#Nine_mental_abidings|nine stages of training the mind]] is the main progressive framework used for śamatha in Tibetan Buddhism.

The other form of Buddhist meditation is [[vipaśyanā]] (clear seeing, insight). This is generally seen as having two aspects, one of which is [[Vipassanā#Inductive and deductive analysis in the Indo-Tibetan tradition|analytic meditation]], thinking rationally about ideas and concepts in a scholarly or philosophical manner. As part of this process, entertaining doubts and engaging in internal debate over them is encouraged in some traditions.{{sfn|khri byang blo bzang ye shes bstan ʼdzin rgya mtsho|2006|p=66, 212f}} The other type of [[vipaśyanā]]  is a non-analytical, "simple" yogic style called ''trömeh'' in Tibetan, which means "without complication".&lt;ref&gt;''The Practice of Tranquillity &amp; Insight: A Guide to Tibetan Buddhist Meditation'' by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. Shambhala Publications: 1994. {{ISBN|0-87773-943-9}} pg 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;

A meditation routine may involve alternating sessions of vipaśyanā to achieve deeper levels of realization, and samatha to consolidate them.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 1996"/&gt;

===Guru yoga===
{{see also|Guru#In_Buddhism|label 1=Guru in Buddhism}}

As in other Buddhist traditions, an attitude of reverence for the teacher, or guru, is also highly prized.&lt;ref&gt;''Lama'' is the literal Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit ''guru''. For a traditional perspective on devotion to the guru, see Tsong-ka-pa I, 77-87. For a current perspective on the guru-disciple relationship in Tibetan Buddhism, see [http://studybuddhism.com/web/x/nav/group.html_1305527811.html Berzin, Alexander. ''Relating to a Spiritual Teacher: Building a Healthy Relationship'']&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of a public teaching, a ''[[lama]]'' will do [[prostration]]s to the throne on which he will teach due to its symbolism, or to an image of the Buddha behind that throne, then students will do prostrations to the lama after he is seated. Merit accrues when one's interactions with the teacher are imbued with such reverence in the form of guru devotion, a code of practices governing them that derives from Indian sources.&lt;ref&gt;notably, ''Gurupancasika'', Tib.: ''Lama Ngachupa'', Wylie: ''bla-ma lnga-bcu-pa'', "Fifty Verses of Guru-Devotion" by [[Aśvaghoṣa]]&lt;/ref&gt; By such things as avoiding disturbance to the peace of mind of one's teacher, and wholeheartedly following his prescriptions, much merit accrues and this can significantly help improve one's practice.

There is a general sense in which any Tibetan Buddhist teacher is called a ''lama''. A student may have taken teachings from many authorities and revere them all as ''lamas'' in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru.&lt;ref&gt;Indian tradition (Cf. ''Saddharmapundarika Sutra'' II, 124) encourages the student to view the guru as representative of the Buddha himself.&lt;/ref&gt; One particular feature of the Tantric view of teacher student relationship is that in Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, one is instructed to regard one's guru as an awakened Buddha.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 80"/&gt;

===Esotericism===
[[File:Sand mandala. Drongste Gompa 1993.JPG|thumb|A [[sand mandala]]]]
In Vajrayāna particularly, Tibetan Buddhists subscribe to a voluntary code of self-censorship, whereby the uninitiated do not seek and are not provided with information about it. This self-censorship may be applied more or less strictly depending on circumstances such as the material involved. A depiction of a [[Mandalas|mandala]] may be less public than that of a deity. That of a higher tantric deity may be less public than that of a lower. The degree to which information on Vajrayāna is now public in western languages is controversial among Tibetan Buddhists.

Buddhism has always had a taste for [[esotericism]] since its earliest period in India.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Conze (1993), 26 and 52f.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetans today maintain greater or lesser degrees of confidentiality also with information on the ''[[vinaya]]'' and [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] specifically. In Buddhist teachings generally, too, there is caution about revealing information to people who may be unready for it.

===Mantra===
[[File:IMG 0996 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|An elderly [[Tibet]]an woman with a [[prayer wheel]] inscribed with mantras]]
The use of (mainly [[Sanskrit]]) prayer formulas, incantations or phrases called [[mantras]] (Tibetan: ''sngags'') is another widespread feature of Tibetan Buddhist practice.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 80"&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; So common is the use of mantras that [[Vajrayana]] is also sometimes called "Mantrayana" (the mantra vehicle). Mantras are widely recited, chanted, written or inscribed, and visualized as part of different forms of meditation. Each mantra has symbolic meaning and will often have a connection to a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Each deity's mantra is seen as symbolizing the function, speech and power of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Geoffrey. Introducing Tibetan Buddhism (World Religions), 2012, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhist practitioners repeat mantras in order to train the mind, and transform their thoughts in line with the divine qualities of the mantra's deity and special power.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 265&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tibetan Buddhists see the etymology of the term mantra as meaning "mind protector", and mantras is seen as a way to guard the mind against negativity.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Buswell Jr., Donald S. Lopez Jr. The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lama Zopa Rinpoche]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mantras are effective because they help keep your mind quiet and peaceful,  automatically  integrating  it  into  one-pointedness.  They make  your  mind  receptive  to  very  subtle  vibrations  and  thereby heighten your perception. Their recitation eradicates gross negativities and the true nature of things can then be reflected in your mind’s resulting clarity. By practising a transcendental mantra, you can in fact purify all the defiled energy of your body, speech, and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 266-67&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mantras also serve to focus the mind as a [[samatha]] (calming) practice as well as a way to transform the mind through the symbolic meaning of the mantra. In Buddhism, it is important to have the proper intention, focus and faith when practicing mantras, if one does not, they will not work. Unlike in Hinduism, mantras are not believed to have inherent power of their own, and thus without the proper faith, intention and mental focus, they are just mere sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 267&lt;/ref&gt; Thus according to the Tibetan philosopher [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Jamgon Ju Mipham]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;if a mantra is thought to be something ordinary and not seen for what it is, it will not be able to perform its intended function. Mantras are like non-conceptual wish-fulfilling jewels. Infusing one's being with the blessings of mantra, like the form of a moon reflected on a body of water, necessitates the presence of faith and other conditions that set the stage for the spiritual attainments of mantra. Just as the moon's reflection cannot appear without water, mantras cannot function without the presence of faith and other such factors in one's being.&lt;ref&gt;Jamgon Mipham, Luminous Essence: A Guide to the Guhyagarbha Tantra, page 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mantras are part of the highest tantric practices in Tibetan Buddhism, such as [[Deity Yoga]] and are recited and visualized during tantric [[sadhana]]s. Thus, [[Tsongkhapa]] says that mantra "protects the mind from ordinary appearances and conceptions".&lt;ref&gt;Tsoṅ-kha-pa Blo-bzaṅ-grags-pa. Tantra in Tibet: The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1987, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in Tibetan Buddhist Tantric praxis, one must develop a sense that everything is divine (divine pride).

===Tantric Yoga===
{{See also|Deity yoga}}
[[File:Chöd practitioners at Boudhanath stupa.jpg|thumb|[[Chöd]] ritual, note the use of [[Damaru]] drum and hand-bell, as well as the [[Kangling]] (thighbone trumpet).]]
In what is called ''[[Anuttarayoga tantra|higher yoga tantra]]'' the emphasis is on various yoga practices which allow the practitioner to realize the true nature of reality.&lt;ref name="Kapstein 83"/&gt;

''[[Deity Yoga]]'' (Tibetan: ''lha'i rnal 'byor''; Sanskrit: ''Devata-yoga'') is the fundamental, defining practice of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] involving [[mental image|visualization of mental image]]s. According to the Tibetan scholar [[Tsongkhapa]], deity yoga is what separates Buddhist [[Tantra]] practice from the practice of other Buddhist schools.&lt;ref&gt;Power, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Deity yoga involves two stages, the '''generation stage''' and the '''completion stage'''. In the generation stage, one dissolves the mundane world and visualizes one's chosen deity ([[yidam]]), its [[mandala]] and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality.&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization of [[sunyata]] or emptiness. Completion stage practices can also include [[subtle body]] energy practices,&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other practices such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].

The views and practices associated with [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]] are often seen as the culmination of the tantric path.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; These practices focus on the very nature of reality and experience, termed [[dharmakaya]].

==Schools==
[[File:Genealogical Tree of Tibetan Buddhist Schools.png|thumb|(Adapted, with modifications, from yogi [[Milarepa]], by W. Y. Evans-Wentz (1928), p. 14)]]

The diagram to the right shows the historical development of Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The four main ones overlap markedly, such that "about eighty percent or more of the features of the Tibetan schools are the same".&lt;ref name="IntroComparison"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/how-do-the-tibetan-buddhist-traditions-differ How Do the Tibetan Buddhist Traditions Differ?], Retrieved 04.06.2016&lt;/ref&gt; Differences include the use of apparently, but not actually, contradictory terminology, opening dedications of texts to different deities and whether phenomena are described from the viewpoint of an unenlightened practitioner or of a Buddha.&lt;ref name="IntroComparison" /&gt; On questions of philosophy the inclusion (Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Kagyu) or exclusion (Gelugpa) of Yogacara and Buddha-nature teachings has been a historical divide between schools, which still colours the approaches to ''sunyata'' and ultimate reality.{{sfn|Hookham|1991}}{{sfn|Brunnhölzl|2004}}{{sfn|Cornu|2001}} The 19th century [[Rimé movement]] downplayed these differences, as still reflected in the stance of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who states that there are no fundamental differences between these schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=The_four_main_schools_of_Tibetan_Buddhism, retrieved 31.07.2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan adjectival suffix ''-pa'' meaning "man" or "person" is translatable as English "-ist", ''e.g.'', "Nyingmapa" is "person who practises Nyingma".

===Nyingma===
{{Main|Nyingma}}

"The Ancient Ones" is the oldest school of Tibetan Buddhism and the original order founded by [[Padmasambhava]] (8th century) and [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788).&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"/&gt; Whereas other schools categorize their teachings into the three [[Yana (Buddhism)|yāna]]s or "vehicles", [[Hīnayāna]], [[Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayāna]], the Nyingma tradition classifies its teachings into [[Nyingma#Nine_Yānas|Nine Yānas]], among the highest of which is [[Dzogchen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kagyuoffice.org/buddhism.nyingma.html Kagyuoffice.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511061419/http://www.kagyuoffice.org/buddhism.nyingma.html |date=2013-05-11 }} See section: ''The Nine Yana Journey''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terma (religion)|Terma]] "treasures" (revealed texts) are of particular significance to the Nyingma school.

===Kadampa===
{{Main|Kadampa}}

The '''Kadam school''' ({{bo|t=བཀའ་གདམས་པ་|w=bka' gdams pa}}) of Tibetan Buddhism was founded by [[Dromtön]] (1005–1064), a Tibetan lay master and the foremost disciple of the great [[Bengalis|Bengali]] master [[Atiśa]] (982-1054). The Kadampa were quite famous and respected for their proper and earnest [[Dharma]] practice. The most evident teachings of that tradition were the teachings on [[bodhicitta]]. Later, these special presentations became known as [[lojong]] and [[lamrim]] by Atiśa. Kadam instructional influence lingered long after the school disappeared.

===Sakya===
{{Main|Sakya}}
[[File:Sakya Pandita.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sakya Pandita]]]]

The "Grey Earth" school represents the scholarly tradition. Headed by the [[Sakya Trizin]], this tradition was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo ({{bo|w='khon dkon mchog rgyal po}}, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great [[Lotsawa]], Drogmi Shākya ({{bo|w=brog mi lo tsā wa ye shes}}) and traces its lineage to the [[mahasiddha]] Virūpa.&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"/&gt; A renowned exponent, [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251CE), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.

====Jonang====
{{Main|Jonang}}

The Jonang is a minor school that branched off from Sakya traditions; it was suppressed in 1650 in Gelug-controlled regions and subsequently banned and its monks and nuns converted to the Gelug school in 1658.

The Jonang re-established their religio-political center in [[Golok people|Golok]], [[Nakhi people|Nakhi]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] areas in [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] centered at [[Dzamthang Monastery]] and have continued practicing uninterrupted to this day. An estimated 5,000 monks and nuns of the Jonang tradition practice today in these areas and at the edges of historic Gelug influence.

However, their teachings were limited to these regions until the [[Rimé movement]] of the 19th century encouraged the study of non-Gelug schools of thought and practice.&lt;ref name=Gruschke&gt;Gruschke 2001, p.72; and A. Gruschke, "Der Jonang-Orden: Gründe für seinen Niedergang, Voraussetzungen für das Überdauern und aktuelle Lage", in: Henk Blezer (ed.), ''Tibet, Past and Present. Tibetan Studies I'' (Proceedings of the Ninth Seminar of The IATS, 2000), Brill Academic Publishers, Leiden 2002, pp. 183-214&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times it has been encouraged to grow by the [[14th Dalai Lama]], who installed the [[9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]] as its head.

===Kagyu===
{{Main|Kagyu}}
[[File:Kalou Rimpoche &amp; Lama Denys.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kalu Rinpoche]] (right) and Lama Denys at Karma Ling Institute, [[Savoy]]]]

"Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word". This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was [[Milarepa]], an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master [[Naropa]] via [[Marpa Lotsawa]], Milarepa and [[Gampopa]]&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"/&gt; and consists of four major sub-sects: the [[Karma Kagyu]], headed by a [[Karmapa]], the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. There are a further eight minor sub-sects, all of which trace their root to Pagtru Kagyu and the most notable of which are the [[Drikung Kagyu|Drikung]] and [[Drukpa Lineage]]s. The once-obscure [[Shangpa Kagyu]], which was famously represented by the 20th century teacher [[Kalu Rinpoche]], traces its history back to the Indian master [[Naropa]] via [[Niguma]], [[Sukhasiddhi]] and [[Khyungpo Naljor]].&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"/&gt;

===Gelug===
{{Main|Gelug}}

The "Way of Virtue" school was originally a reformist movement and is known for its emphasis on logic and debate. The order was founded in the 14th to 15th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa]], renowned for both his scholarship and virtue. He was a prominent supporter of the [[Madhyamika]] philosophy and formalized the [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction]]. Its spiritual head is the [[Ganden Tripa]] and its temporal one the [[Dalai Lama]]. The Dalai Lama is regarded as the embodiment of [[Avalokiteśvara]]. After the civil war in the 17th century and the Mongol intervention, the Gelugpa school dominated Tibetan Buddhism, and successive Dalai Lamas ruled [[Tibet]] from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.

====New Kadampa Tradition====
{{Main|New Kadampa Tradition|Kelsang Gyatso}}

The ''New Kadampa Tradition'' is a Buddhist [[new religious movement]] founded by [[Kelsang Gyatso]] in England in 1991, which branched-off from the Gelugpa school.

===Rimé movement===
In the 19th century the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools of Tibetan Buddhism, along with some [[Bon]] scholars, cooperated the [[Rimé movement]] to prevent the loss of many of their teachings and revive their traditions, in response to the dominance of the Gelugpa school.&lt;ref name="Lopez, Donald S. 1998 p. 190"/&gt;

===Old Translation, New Translation===
The four major schools are sometimes said to constitute the Nyingma "Old Translation," and [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] "New Translation" traditions, the latter following from the historical Kadam lineage of translations and tantric lineages. Another common but trivial differentiation is into the Yellow Hat (Gelug) and [[Red Hat sect|Red Hat]] (non-Gelug) sects, a division that mirrors the distinction between the schools involved in the [[Rimé movement]] versus the one that did not, the Gelug.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Women in Tibetan Buddhism==
{{further|Women in Buddhism|Ordination of women in Buddhism}}

===Ordination in Tibet===
When Buddhism traveled from India to Tibet, apparently the quorum of [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇīs]] required for bestowing full ordination never reached Tibet.{{sfn|Tsomo|1999|p=22}}{{refn|group=note|Under the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya, as with the two other extant Vinaya lineages today ([[Theravada]] and [[Dharmaguptaka]]), in order to ordain bhikṣuṇīs, there must be quorums of both bhikṣuṇīs ''and'' bhikṣus; without both, a woman cannot be ordained as a nun ({{bo|t=དགེ་སློང་མ་|s=gélongma}}).}} Despite an absence of ordination there, bhikṣuṇīs did travel to Tibet. A notable example was the Sri Lankan nun Candramāla, whose work with Śrījñāna ({{bo|w=dpal ye shes}}) resulted in the tantric text ''Śrīcandramāla Tantrarāja''.{{refn|group=note|{{bo|t=དཔལ་ཟླ་བའི་ཕྲེང་བའི་རྒྱུད་ཀྱི་རྒྱལ་པོ}}, {{zh|c=吉祥月鬘本續王}}}}{{sfn|Tsomo|1999|p=76}}

There are singular accounts of fully ordained Tibetan women, such as the [[Samding Dorje Phagmo]] (1422-1455), who was once ranked the highest female master in Tibet, but very little is known about the exact circumstances of their ordination.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Michaela. "Dakini Power: Twelve Extraordinary Women Shaping the Transmission of Tibetan Buddhism in the West." Shambhala Publications, 2013. {{ISBN|1559394072}}, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist author Michaela Haas notes that Tibetan Buddhism is undergoing a sea change in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Female Dalai Lama? Why It Matters|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michaela-haas/female-dalai-lama-why-it-matters_b_2982005.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=May 4, 2013|quote= "Of all these changes that we are watching Buddhism undergo in the West, the most momentous may be that women are playing an equal role."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Thubten Chodron]], the current [[Dalai Lama]] has said on this issue:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=30 A New Possibility: Introducing Full Ordination for Women into the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt;
#In 2005, the Dalai Lama repeatedly spoke about the bhikṣuṇī ordination in public gatherings. In Dharamsala, he encouraged, "We need to bring this to a conclusion. We Tibetans alone can't decide this. Rather, it should be decided in collaboration with Buddhists from all over the world. Speaking in general terms, were the Buddha to come to this 21st century world, I feel that most likely, seeing the actual situation in the world now, he might change the rules somewhat...."
#Later, in [[Zürich]] during a 2005 conference of Tibetan Buddhist Centers, he said, "Now I think the time has come; we should start a working group or committee" to meet with monks from other Buddhist traditions. Looking at the German bhikṣuṇī [[Jampa Tsedroen]], he instructed, "I prefer that Western Buddhist nuns carry out this work… Go to different places for further research and discuss with senior monks (from various Buddhist countries). I think, first, senior bhikshunis need to correct the monks' way of thinking.
#"This is the 21st century. Everywhere we are talking about equality….Basically Buddhism needs equality. There are some really minor things to remember as a Buddhist--a bhikshu always goes first, then a bhikshuni….The key thing is the restoration of the bhikshuni vow."

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] referred to the Dalai Lama having said on occasion of the 2007 Hamburg congress:
{{quote|Sometimes in religion there has been an emphasis on male importance. In Buddhism, however, the highest vows, namely the bhikshu and bhikshuni ones, are equal and entail the same rights. This is the case despite the fact that in some ritual areas, due to social custom, bhikshus go first. But Buddha gave the basic rights equally to both sangha groups. There is no point in discussing whether or not to revive the bhikshuni ordination; the question is merely how to do so properly within the context of the Vinaya.&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com 2"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_4.html#n063b0e55a12ff6f34 Human Rights and the Status of Women in Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

In [[Australia]], '''Trust money''' is held by a law firm on a client's behalf in a trust account with a [[Authorised_Deposit-Taking_Institution|bank]].  Trust money is held in connection with the provision of legal services and is highly regulated. A lawyer or law firm should not appropriate a client's trust money until certain regulations are met, which are different for each State in [[Australia]].  The Australian system regulating lawyers and their trust accounts has been labeled by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] as an "unwieldy monster".&lt;ref name="Rudd Comment"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berkovic|first=Nicola|title=Kevin Rudd to create new regulations for the legal profession|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/rudd-vows-to-slay-monster/story-e6frg97x-1111118768981|newspaper=The Australian|date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of trust money==
Trust money is held to cover the practitioner’s [[Costs_(English_law)|fees and disbursements]] over a period of time and may be required to be topped up as a matter progresses. 

==Regulations for handling trust money in Australia==
The accounting of trust money is highly regulated and even though the money is controlled by the law practice the money still belongs to the client until such time as it is applied to an invoice or disbursement. The exact regulations in [[Australia]] are different for each State, in everything from cost disclosure to trust accounting, which lawyers say cause inefficiencies and cost clients millions of dollars every year.&lt;ref name="Rudd Comment"/&gt; 

Prior to 1976 it was not uncommon for [[solicitors]] to pay their [[Costs_(English_law)|costs and disbursements]] from trust money without obtaining the clients instructions to do so. The profession at large now accepts that this practice is [[Crime|unlawful]] and that prior instructions must be obtained.&lt;ref name="Issues"/&gt;

After a 1976 [[New South Wales]] Supreme Court Decision&lt;ref&gt;Stewart v. Strevens[1976] 2 N.S.W.L.R. 321 (Helsham C.J in Eq)&lt;/ref&gt; it appeared that withdrawals by a lawyer from a trust account could only be made in two situations:
*the client has given clear instructions to that effect; or

In 1978 the [[law societies]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]] advised their members that they should "issue a bill of costs to the client wherever costs are taken from the trust account and not take such costs until the client has had proper opportunity to object".&lt;ref&gt;See Law Society Bulletin (S.A.) (Nov.1978), Supplement and Law Society of S.A., ''Legal Practitioners Trust Accounts Manual'', p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The national legal profession model bill, which was supposed to eliminate the differences, took about ten years to develop and was finally signed off by the Standing Committee of Attorneys General, (SCAG), in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standing Committee of Attorneys General|url=http://www.sclj.gov.au/sclj/standing_council_index.html|publisher=Standing Committee of Attorneys General|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Australian States and Territories except South Australia have during 2004 to 2008 adopted the national legal profession model.&lt;ref name="Law Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Model Legal Profession Bill Status of implementation|url=http://www1.lawcouncil.asn.au/lawcouncil/index.php/divisions/national-profession-project/the-model-legal-profession-bill|publisher=Law Council of Australia|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stateline&gt;{{cite news|last=MacLennan|first=Leah|title=$4.5-million dollars discovered missing from the trust account of a local law firm|url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2302792.htm|newspaper=ABC Stateline|date=11 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SA is yet to push the national legal profession model bill through parliament, because of a political deadlock over compensation for victims of trust account fraud.&lt;ref name=Stateline/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudd Comment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Law Council"/&gt;

A legal practitioner or law firm cannot appropriate money from a clients trust account in or towards satisfaction of a claim for legal costs unless a bill specifying the total amount of those costs, and describing the legal work to which the costs relate, has been delivered to the person liable to the costs either personally, or by post addressed to the person at the person's last known place of business or residence. The person liable to legal costs may at any time within six months after delivery of a bill of costs request the person claiming to be entitled to the costs to provide a statement showing in detail how the amount of the costs to which the bill relates is made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disposition of trust money|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/lpa1981207/s31.html|publisher=SA Parliament|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = SA41&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of costs to be delivered|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/lpa1981207/s41.html|publisher=SA Parliament|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law Society recommends that 3 business days be allowed to pass after posting the bill before appropriation of trust money towards that bill.

==Disputes over trust money==
In Australia if a dispute arises over the accounting or application of the trust money the client should notify the appropriate Law Society.

One high-profile South Australian case was with Brenton Willoughby, a law clerk at Magarey Farlam Lawyers, and involved $4.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James|first=Colin|title=Law clerk in $4.5m fraud|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/law-clerk-in-45m-fraud/story-e6frea83-1111112859407|newspaper=The Advertiser|date=19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Australia]] in the 1960s a Guarantee Fund was set up from a percentage of the interest made on clients' money while in legal trust accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merritt|first=Chris|title=Drop in trust fund deposits to hit services|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/drop-in-trust-fund-deposits-to-hit-services/story-e6frg97x-1225766917271|newspaper=The Australian|date=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guarantee Fund is administered by the [[Law Society]]&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt; and is used to fund consumer protection services such as the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board and to make hardship payments when people have lost money from legal trust accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guarantee fund|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/lpa1981207/s57.html|publisher=SA Parliament|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stateline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Practitioner's Act funding|url=http://www.lsc.sa.gov.au/cb_pages/funding.php|publisher=Legal Services Commission of SA|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Solicitors Guarantee Fund, Victoria==

Until the mid-1990s there was a Solicitors Guarantee Fund in Victoria (SGF). From the mid-1990s, after the relevant Victorian legislation was changed, a new Solicitors Fidelity Fund (SFF) came into being in place of the SGF. The legal interpretation of the two words effected by the change from SGF to SFF is significant. "Guarantee" and "Fidelity" do not mean the same thing. By implication the new fidelity fund did not provide a guarantee, the financial considerations are different with on the one hand liability of the fund vis-a-vis fidelity being limited to a finite amount, and on the other hand, in earlier times - the "Guarantee era" - liability of the fund being unlimited.

During the early to mid-1990s the amount of clients' money being lost at the hands of some Victorian solicitors became so large that the Solicitors Guarantee Fund began running year in year out in deficit, since it did not have sufficient income to meet the gross admitted claims against the fund. One of several major contributors to the ongoing deficit situation was Dudley Tregent &amp; Co, which involved defalcations of between $10 million and $14 million of clients' funds. The core amount of $10 million to $14 million was topped up by a further $3 million or so in interest payable on claims because of the time it took to settle admitted claims, a period of 6 years from 1992 to 1998, while interest was accruing on the pending payouts at a statutory rate of 5% per annum.

Two other significant cases of solicitors losing clients' funds took place in the 1990s.

One of these was the small legal firm Tietyens' practice on the border with NSW. Tietyens ran a contributory mortgage scheme backed by about 1,100 investors that furnished an investment of about $42 million in the Tally Ho Retirement Village in Burwood East in Melbourne. 

A further Melbourne case was the murder of Max Green in Phnom Penh. Max Green was a partner in the law firm Aroni Colman. In the Max Green case the amount lost was estimated at $38 million, ostensibly the $38 million was for the purchase of plant and equipment to be then leased to Transurban. Transurban denied any knowledge of this leasing arrangement. Some of the clients of Mr Green who lost their money in this case were other solicitors.

In general, the fidelity funds or guarantee funds do not admit claims involving criminal conduct or dishonest conduct on the part of the lawyers. Fidelity funds ironically are not designed to rectify infidelities, rather they cater for losses arising from honest mistakes by lawyers and/or their lack of investment acumen.

==Positive dormant balance at end of matter==
If there remains a positive dormant balance in a clients trust account at the end of a matter, the client is entitled to the return of that trust money as soon as practicable. In 2012 South Australian Law Society director of Professional Standards, Ros Burke, advised practitioners that they could use the ''Unclaimed Money Act'' to clear the balance.  By charging a fee to try to locate the client that the trust money belongs to, as long as the fee is generated in accordance with the appropriate ''Legal Practitioners Act'', the practitioner can appropriate that sum out of the dormant trust money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Ros|title=Dormant balances in the trust account|url=http://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/PDF/Prof_Dormant_Balances.pdf|publisher=The Law Society of SA|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
