On 15 September 2012, a protest by [[Salafi]] Muslims against an alleged "anti-Islam" film ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'' was held in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]. While the protest started peacefully, violent confrontations between [[police]] and protesters began when protesters reached the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States#Oceania|United States Consulate General]].&lt;ref name=qt&gt;{{cite news|title=Violent Sydney protest erupts|url=http://www.qt.com.au/story/2012/09/17/violent-sydney-protest-erupts-muslim-prophet/|publisher=[[The Queensland Times]]|date=2012-09-17|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In resulting clashes, six police officers and 19 protesters were injured. The violence was condemned by Australian political leaders, including Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]. Police arrested nine protesters in connection with the violence.&lt;ref name=qt/&gt;

The protest, through Pitt Street pedestrian mall and Martin Place, temporarily shut down parts of the city, instilling fear in members of the public (interviewed by live television crews), and was later brought under control by police.

==Protest==
[[File:Islamic Protest in Hyde Park, Sydney 01.JPG|thumb|A protester carries a sign reading "behead all those who insult the prophet".]]
The protest started at about midday when approximately 100 people gathered at the [[Sydney Town Hall]] before marching along [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] to [[Martin Place, Sydney|Martin Place]] where the US Consulate is located. Conflict between the protesters and the police started when the former tried to enter the US Consulate.&lt;ref name="ninemsn1"/&gt; The police used capsicum spray to push the protesters back from the consulate. According to one protester this aggravated the crowd, as many had brought their children.&lt;ref name=CNAsia&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Islam film protests spread to Sydney|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1226257/1/.html|publisher=[[Channel News Asia]]|date=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2012 Sydney protest.jpg|thumb|right|Signs carried at the protest]]
The crowd then moved to [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]], where around 300 people had gathered.&lt;ref name=CNAsia/&gt; Further clashes erupted as police used capsicum spray on protesters who at times threw bottles at police.&lt;ref name=smh1&gt;{{cite news|last=Gridneff|first=Ilya|title=Police gas Sydney protesters|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/police-gas-sydney-protesters-20120915-25yrb.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters chanted "Down, down USA"&lt;ref name="ninemsn1"/&gt; and carried Sunni Islamist flags and signs saying, "Behead all those who insult the prophet",  "Our dead are in paradise, your dead are in hell", "Shariah will dominate the world", and "[[Barack Obama|Obama]] Obama, we love [[Osama bin Laden|Osama]]" and threw bottles and objects retrieved from construction sites at police officers.

As the crowd started to leave Hyde Park near [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James]], [[Public Order and Riot Squad]] officers equipped with [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]] and [[riot shield]]s had already been stationed at the park exit.&lt;ref name="skynews2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/national/article.aspx?id=795250|title=Islam video protest in Syd CBD|date=2012-09-15|publisher=[[Sky News Australia]]|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestors continued to throw stones, sticks and bottles at the police. Riot and mounted police pursued protesters down [[William Street, Sydney|William Street]] towards [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]. The already splintered crowd then broke up further, running through the back streets of [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]]&lt;ref name=skynews2012/&gt; with police chasing after them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Australian Associated Press |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1692871/Tear-gas-fired-at-anti-Islam-film-protest-in-Sydney |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121230200846/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1692871/Tear-gas-fired-at-anti-Islam-film-protest-in-Sydney |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-30 |title=Protest erupts in Sydney over anti-Islam film |date=2012-09-15 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |accessdate=2012-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police blocked several [[Sydney central business district|CBD]] streets, including the intersection of Martin Place and Castlereagh Street, parts of George Street and Market Street  while protestors attempted to move through the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12525">Dr. '''Abraham Josevich Kaufman''' (Абрам Иосифович Кауфман,  b. November 22, 1885 – d. March 25, 1971) was a Russian-born medical doctor, community organizer and [[Zionism|Zionist]] who helped protect some tens of thousands of Jews seeking safe-haven in East Asia from [[Holocaust|Nazi atrocities]] during World War II.&lt;ref name="JCoC" /&gt;

As a consequence of his contacts with Japanese authorities during World War II and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], he was kidnapped, arrested and imprisoned by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities immediately after the war, and was interned in a Soviet [[Gulag|Gulag penal labor camp]] from 1945 to 1956. [[Israel]]i authorities subsequently worked to expedite his [[Law of Return|immigration to Israel]], where he was able to resume his medical practice.

== Early life ==

Abraham Kaufman was born to Yosef Zalmonovich Kaufman in 1885 in Megilne (Мглине), a tiny Jewish village near [[Chernigov]] (ex-Chernihovsky Region –– бывшей Черниговской губернии) in the [[Ukraine]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]).  He was a great grandson of Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], who founded the [[Chabad]] movement. Kaufman graduated from a traditional [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium Institute]] (secondary school) in [[Perm]], Russia, in 1903, where he became interested in Zionism. He then studied medicine from 1904 at the [[University of Bern]], Switzerland, graduating and returning to Russia in 1908 or 1909.&lt;ref name="JCoC"&gt;[http://www.jewsofchina.org/JewsOfChina08/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=302&amp;FID=622&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=1017 Dr. A. J. Kaufman]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Jewish Communities of China website, January 12, 2002. Retrieved October 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vladimirsky" /&gt;

Kaufman became an ardent Zionist, and while working in Perm after completing his medical degree he devoted all his spare time to supporting the movement, working under Dr. E. V. Chlenov (Е.В.Членов) in the Moscow region. He toured a number of cities lecturing on [[Zionism]], and supervised the Hovavei Zion (хавевей-цион) organization, which was headed by his father Yosef.&lt;ref name="JCoC" /&gt;

== Move to China ==

Kaufman emigrated to [[Harbin]], China in 1912, and quickly became the community ''shtadlan'' (organizer), active in many Jewish organizations.&lt;ref name ="B-H"&gt;Bickers, Robert &amp; Henriot, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OmW7AAAAIAAJ New Frontiers: Imperialism's New Communities in East Asia, 1842-1953: Studies in Imperialism], Manchester University Press ND, 2000, pp.99-101, {{ISBN|0-7190-5604-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-5604-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 he helped organize the EKOPO society (Jewish Committee for the Help of War Victims) to assist some 200,000 World War I refugees with shelter, food and medical care.&lt;ref name="Vladimirsky"&gt;Vladimirsky, Irena. [https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/harbin The Jewish Community of Harbin], Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot website. Retrieved 27 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he became a Zionist leader in the [[Harbin]] Jewish community,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08403.html Harbin], Jewish Virtual Library online.&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Manchuria]] (called [[Manchukuo]] when it was occupied by [[Imperial Japan]]) more widely, in the 1930s.  He became an integral part of the cultural organizations of Harbin Jewry. Between 1919–1945 he was variously:&lt;ref name="JCoC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vladimirsky" /&gt;
* medical director of the Jewish hospital of Harbin
* chairman of the Harbin's Jewish community
* chairman of the [[Jewish National Fund]] and [[Keren Hayesod]] Zionist fundraising organizations
* board member of the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]
* chairman of the Jewish Zionist organization of China
* president of the Hebrew Association of Harbin
* chief editor of the ''Evreiskaya Zhizn'' ("Jewish Life" – Еврейская жизнь) weekly Jewish magazine in Russian (1921–1943)
* chairman of the National Council of the Jews of Eastern Asia (Far East) in 1937

He was also the head of the Far Eastern Jewish Council (FEJ – Национального Совета) which he helped found, and also the ''Vaad Haleumi'' (Ваад-Галеуми), both founded in 1937 with the encouragement of Japanese officials such as [[Norihiro Yasue]].&lt;ref name="JCoC" /&gt;&lt;ref Name=Tokayer55&gt;Tokayer. pp.55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities during the Holocaust ==

Befriended by [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Colonel Yasue and General Kiichirō Higuchi, the engineers of the later-named "[[Fugu Plan]]", Kaufman organized three large conferences of the Far Eastern Jewish Council, which brought together Jews from across East Asia, and successfully appealed for his organization to be accepted under the umbrella of the [[World Jewish Congress]]. Through these conferences, he worked to encourage Jews from other parts of the region, and the world, to think of [[Manchukuo]] as a safe-haven for Jews, reassuring them, as his Japanese friends had assured him, that the Japanese were not [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]], nor inclined to be racially discriminatory against Jews.&lt;ref name=Tokayer55 /&gt;

In May 1939, Kaufman was invited on an official visit to Tokyo, where he visited many of the [[Ministries of Japan#Former ministries|ministries of the Japanese government]], met with a number of officials, and became one of the few foreigners to be honored with an imperial award. He used this opportunity to express to the government officials with whom he met the desires, needs and attitudes of the Jews of Manchukuo, and was reassured of the non-discriminatory attitude of the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;Tokayer. pp.66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; He formally thanked [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Nobuyuki Abe]] for the prejudice-free protection offered Jews in East Asia by the Japanese authorities, and suggested that the global Jewish community would be grateful should Japan create a safe haven in East Asia, and that in return the Jewish communities of East Asia would support Imperial [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Japan's vision for a new order in East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynders Ristaino, Marcia. ''Port of Last Resort: The Diaspora Communities of Shanghai''. Stanford: Stanford University press, 2003. pp.148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1942, a great number of Jews had sought refuge in Japan from Eastern Europe, settling in [[Kobe]] before being moved to the [[Shanghai Ghetto]] in China. As early as 1941, the local [[Gestapo]] chief [[Josef Meisinger]] (''The Butcher of Warsaw'') visited the ghetto, and proposed plans to [[The Holocaust|exterminate its Jewish population]]. Kaufman, through his influence and contacts in the Japanese government, prevailed upon Tokyo to prevent Meisinger's plans being carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Tokayer. pp226, 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Kaufman succeeded and Meisinger's schemes were rejected by Tokyo, but not before the doctor along with seven other Jewish community leaders were arrested, imprisoned, and maltreated by the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' (Japanese military police) as traitors for accusing Japan of plotting [[genocide]]. All but one of the community leaders were released days or weeks after their arrests.&lt;ref&gt;Tokayer. pp231-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his release, Kaufman returned to Harbin, and to his activities with the Far Eastern Jewish Council, which included raising substantial donations to the severely impoverished Jewish community in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Tokayer. p252.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post–war arrest by the Soviets ==

In 1945, just days before the end of World War II, the [[Soviet Union]] declared war on Japan and invaded [[Manchuria]], overrunning Harbin. To celebrate the end of the war a short time later on August 21, the Soviets held a formal reception to which they invited the many minority leaders of the city, including Dr. Kaufman. The Soviets then kidnapped him along with two of his colleagues, Anatoly Grigorievich Orlovsky (Анатолий Григорьевич Орловский), and Moses Gdalievich Zimin (Моисей Гдальевич Зимин)). They were subsequently arrested by the [[Soviet Red Army]] on charges of collaboration with foreign forces.  Kaufman's former college roommate had been another notable Zionist, [[Chaim Weizmann]], and a passport to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] was immediately issued for the doctor, but the Soviets refused to release him.&lt;ref name="Ossin" /&gt;

The Jewish community organizers were taken to the Soviet Union, where Kaufman was imprisoned in a [[Gulag|Gulag labor camp]] for 11 years.&lt;ref name="Vladimirsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ossin"&gt;Ossin, Archie. [http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/harbin/Jews-in-China-5-28-2007.pdf Jews in China], January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu Xin, Ember, Melvin; Ember, Carol R.; Skoggard, Ian (Eds.).

== Emigration to Israel ==

After Kaufman's release from the Gulag system in 1956, he moved to [[Karaganda]], [[Kazakhstan]], and on March 25, 1961, emigrated to [[Israel]]. He was joined by his son Theodore (Teddy) Kaufman, who would later hold a high position in the Israeli government. Dr. Kaufman spent the remainder of his life practicing medicine, specializing in [[pediatrics]] under the [[Histadrut]] in Israel, and was buried there after he died in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Vladimirsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ossin" /&gt;

== Family ==

Kaufman's wife also matriculated in medicine at the University of Bern.&lt;ref name="SJI"&gt;[http://www.sino-judaic.org/index.php?page=harbin_history Detailed History of Harbin], retrieved October 29, 2010, from the Sino-Judaic Institute website, which in turn cites:

Hardy served as [[zoologist]] on the [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']]'s [[Discovery Investigations|voyage to explore the Antarctic]] between 1925 and 1927. On the voyage he invented the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]]; it enabled any ship to collect plankton samples during an ordinary voyage.

After retiring from his academic work, Hardy founded the [[Religious Experience Research Centre]] in 1969.

==''Camoufleur'' and artist==

Hardy was born in [[Nottingham]], the son of [[Richard Hardy (architect)|Richard Hardy]], an architect, and his wife, Elizabeth Hannah Clavering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated not far away at [[Oundle School]]. He had intended to go to [[Oxford University]] in 1914, but on the outbreak of war he instead volunteered for the army, and was made a ''[[List of camoufleurs|camoufleur]]'', a [[camouflage]] officer. Hardy wrote that he had been&lt;ref name=Behrens&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1516/497.full | title=Revisiting Abbott Thayer: non-scientific reflections about camouflage in art, war and zoology | author=Behrens, Roy R | journal=Phil.

{{quote|equally drawn to science and art, and if the truth be known, I must confess that it is the latter that has the greater appeal. I am lucky in not having been torn between the two; I have managed to combine them.&lt;ref name=Behrens/&gt;}}

He was selected for camouflage work by the artist [[Solomon J. Solomon]], who apparently mistook him for a different Hardy who was a professional artist.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Forbes, Peter. ''[[Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage]]''. Yale, 2009. Page 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy however did have sufficient artistic skill to serve his military and scientific work. He illustrated his [[New Naturalist]] books with his own line drawings, maps, diagrams, photographs, and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, The Open Sea, 1956 and 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, plate 2 of ''Fish and Fisheries'' illustrates the depicted "''Rare and Unusual Fish in British Waters''" both accurately and vividly. Hardy described the camoufleurs as including artists and "scientists with artistic inclinations", himself perhaps among them.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

In later life, Hardy travelled in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[China]] and [[Japan]], recording his visits to temples in all those countries in watercolour paintings. Many of these are in the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://studyspiritualexperiences.weebly.com/hardys-art.html | title=Sir Alister Hardy's Art | publisher=The Alister Hardy Society | year=2012 | accessdate=16 October 2012 | author=Schmidt, Bettina | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522064218/http://studyspiritualexperiences.weebly.com/hardys-art.html | archive-date=22 May 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zoology ==

[[File:Discoveryboat.jpg|thumb|left|[[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']] in the Antarctic]]

Hardy was the [[zoologist]] on the [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']] voyage to explore the [[Antarctic]] between 1925 and 1927, as part of the [[Discovery Investigations]]. Through his studies of zooplankton and its relationship with predators, he became expert in marine mammals such as whales. Whilst on board the ''Discovery'' he designed and later built a mechanism called the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] or CPR.  The CPR collects [[plankton]] samples and stores them on a moving band of silk, preserving them in formalin.  His pioneering research into plankton distribution and abundance is continued by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS).

Hardy was the first Professor of Zoology at the [[University of Hull]] from 1928 - 1942.  In 1942, he was then appointed Professor of Natural History at the [[University of Aberdeen]], where he remained until 1946, when he became [[Linacre Professor of Zoology]] in the [[University of Oxford]] and Fellow of [[Merton College]], a position he held until 1961. In 1940, Hardy was made a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; He was knighted in 1957.

===Evolution===

Hardy identified as a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]], he denied the Lamarckian [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]. He was a proponent of organic selection (also known as the [[Baldwin effect]]). He held the view that behavioral changes can be important for evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Wyles J. S., Kunkel J. G., Wilson A. C., (1983). ''Birds, Behavior and Anatomical Evolution''. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 4394-4397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burkhardt, Richard W. (2013). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730912/ ''Lamarck, Evolution, and the Inheritance of Acquired Characters'']. Genetics 194: 793-805.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy discussed his evolutionary ideas in his book ''The Living Stream'' (1965). He had written a chapter titled "Biology and Telepathy" where he explained that "something akin to [[telepathy]] might possibly influence the process of evolution". Evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] described his views on evolution as a form of [[vitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. (1988). ''Toward a New Philosophy of Biology: Observations of an Evolutionist''. Harvard University Press. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy also suggested that certain animals share a "group mind" which he described as "a sort of psychic blueprint between members of a species." He also speculated that all species might be linked in a "cosmic mind" capable of carrying evolutionary information through space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Sylvia. (1993). ''A Book of Strange''. Doubleday. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquatic ape hypothesis===
{{main|Aquatic ape hypothesis}}

In 1930, while reading [[Wood Jones]]' ''Man's Place among the Mammals'', which included the question of why humans, unlike all other land mammals, had fat attached to their skin, Hardy realized that this trait sounded like the blubber of marine mammals, and began to suspect that humans had ancestors that were more aquatic than previously imagined.  Fearing a backlash against such a radical idea, he kept this hypothesis secret until 1960, when he spoke, and later wrote, on the subject, which subsequently became known as the [[aquatic ape hypothesis]] in academic circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=1977 | title=Was there a ''Homo aquaticus''? | journal=Zenith | first=Alister Clavering | last=Hardy | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study of religion==
Dating from his boyhood at [[Oundle School]], Hardy had a lifelong interest in spiritual phenomena, but aware that his interests were likely to be considered unorthodox in the scientific community, apart from occasional lectures he kept his opinions to himself until his retirement from his Oxford Chair. During the academic sessions of 1963-4 and 1964-5, he gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[Aberdeen University]] on the evolution of religion, later published as ''The Living Stream'' and ''The Divine Flame''. These lectures signalled his wholehearted return to his religious interests. In 1969 he founded the Religious Experience Research Unit in [[Manchester College, Oxford]]. The Unit began its work by compiling a database of [[religious experience]]s and continues to investigate the nature and function of spiritual and religious experience at the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]]. In 1973 he met with [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] and other devotees of the [[Hare Krishna movement]] and discussed [[Vedic literature]], the divine flame and [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prabhupada|first=A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami|title=Discussion with Alister Hardy|url=http://www.prabhupadavani.org/main/Conversations/092.html|work=www.prabhupadavani.org|publisher=[[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] International|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy's biological approach to the roots of religion is currently shared by a number of other researchers (cf. [[Scott Atran]], [[Pascal Boyer]]) but unlike them Hardy did not wish to be [[Reductionism|reductionist]], seeing religious awareness as having evolved in response to a genuine dimension of reality. For his work in founding the [[Religious Experience Research Centre]], Hardy received the [[Templeton Prize]] shortly before his death in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy's contribution to the scientific study of religion is reviewed in David Hay's book ''Something There: The Biology of the Human Spirit'' published in London in July 2006 by Darton, Longman &amp; Todd and in the United States by [[Templeton Press]] in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

He was married to Sylvia Garstang in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Hardy wrote numerous scientific papers on plankton, fish and whales. He wrote two popular books in the ''New Naturalist'' series, and in later life he also wrote on religion.

'''Greek temples''' ({{lang-grc|ναός|naós|dwelling}}, semantically distinct from [[Latin language|Latin]] {{lang|la|templum}}, "[[temple]]")  were structures built to house deity statues within Greek sanctuaries in [[ancient Greek religion]]. The temple interiors did not serve as meeting places, since the [[ritual sacrifice|sacrifice]]s and rituals dedicated to the respective deity took place outside them, within the wider precinct of the sanctuary, which might be large. Temples were frequently used to store [[votive]] offerings. They are the most important and most widespread building type in [[Greek architecture]]. In the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] kingdoms of [[Southwest Asia]] and of [[North Africa]], buildings erected to fulfill the functions of a temple often continued to  follow the local traditions. Even where a Greek influence is visible, such structures are not normally considered as Greek temples. This applies, for example, to the [[Parthia|Graeco-Parthian]] and [[Bactria]]n temples, or to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] examples, which follow [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian tradition]]. Most Greek temples were oriented astronomically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Penrose|Penrose, F.C.]], (communicated by [[Joseph Norman Lockyer]]), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EpkZtUGY5y8C&amp;pg=PA43 ''The Orientation of Greek Temples''], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], v. 48, n. 1228, May 11, 1893, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 9th century BC and the 6th century BC, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] temples developed from the small [[mudbrick]] structures into double [[portico|porched]] monumental buildings with colonnade on all sides, often reaching more than 20 metres in height (not including the roof). Stylistically, they were governed by the regionally specific [[Classical orders|architectural orders]]. Whereas the distinction was originally between the [[Doric order|Doric]] and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] orders, a third alternative arose in late 3rd century BC with the [[Corinthian order]]. A multitude of different ground plans were developed, each of which could be combined with the superstructure in the different orders. From the 3rd century BC onwards, the construction of large temples became less common; after a short 2nd century BC flourish, it ceased nearly entirely in the 1st century BC. Thereafter, only smaller structures were newly begun, while older temples continued to be renovated or brought to completion if in an unfinished state.

Greek temples were designed and constructed according to set proportions, mostly determined by the lower diameter of the [[column]]s or by the dimensions of the foundation levels. The nearly mathematical strictness of the basic designs thus reached was lightened by optical refinements. In spite of the still widespread idealised image, Greek temples were painted, so that bright reds and blues contrasted with the white of the building stones or of [[stucco]]. The more elaborate temples were equipped with very rich figural decoration in the form of [[relief]]s and [[pediment|pedimental sculpture]]. The construction of temples was usually organised and financed by [[polis|cities]] or by the administrations of sanctuaries. Private individuals, especially Hellenistic rulers, could also sponsor such buildings. In the late [[Hellenistic period]], their decreasing financial wealth, along with the progressive [[Roman Greece|incorporation of the Greek world within the Roman state]], whose officials and rulers took over as sponsors, led to the end of Greek temple construction. New temples now belonged to the tradition of the [[Roman temple]], which, in spite of the very strong Greek influence on it, aimed for different goals and followed different aesthetic principles (for a comparison, see [[Roman_temple#Architecture|the other article]]).

The main temple building sat within a larger precinct or [[temenos]], usually surrounded by a [[peribolos]] fence or wall; the whole is usually called a "sanctuary". The [[Acropolis of Athens]] is the most famous example, though this was apparently walled as a citadel before a temple was ever built there.  This might include many subsidiary buildings, [[sacred grove]]s or springs, animals dedicated to the deity, and sometimes people who had taken sanctuary from the law, which some temples offered, for example to runaway slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Miles,  219-220&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The earliest Greek sanctuaries probably lacked temple buildings, though our knowledge of these is limited, and the subject is controversial.  A typical early sanctuary seems to have consisted of a tenemos, often around a sacred grove, cave or spring, and perhaps defined only by marker stones at intervals, with an altar for offerings.  Many rural sanctuaries probably stayed in this style, but the more popular were gradually able to afford a building to house a cult image, especially in cities.  This process was certainly under way by the 9th century, and probably started earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Theories are discussed in chapter 1 of ''Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches'', Eds. Robin Hagg and Nanno Marinatos, 2002, Routledge, {{ISBN|113480167X}}, 9781134801671, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WvSHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Megaron]] (15th to the 13th century BCE) was the precursor for later [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and Classical Greek temples, but during the Greek dark age the buildings became smaller and less monumental.&lt;ref&gt;https://myportal.bsd405.org/personal/beckere/art910/Shared%20Documents/Art%20History.pptx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114553/https://myportal.bsd405.org/personal/beckere/art910/Shared%20Documents/Art%20History.pptx |date=2015-04-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://muellercain.weebly.com/uploads/1/6/2/0/16208714/minoan_and_mycenaean_civilization_comparison_lesson.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The basic principles for the development of Greek temple architecture have their roots between the 10th century BC and the 7th century BC. In its simplest form as a ''[[Shrine|naos]]'', the temple was a simple rectangular shrine with protruding side walls ([[Anta (architecture)|antae]]), forming a small porch. Until the 8th century BC, there were also [[apse|apsidal structures]] with more or less semi-circular back walls, but the rectangular type prevailed. By adding columns to this small basic structure, the Greeks triggered the development and variety of their temple architecture.

The [[Temple of Isthmia]], built in 690 - 650 BC was perhaps the first true [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] temple with its monumental size, sturdy [[colonnade]] and tile roof set the Isthmian temple apart from contemporary buildings &lt;ref&gt;http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/isthmia/publications/archaic-temple/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wooden architecture: Early Archaic===
The first temples were mostly [[mud]], [[brick]], and [[marble]] structures on stone foundations. The columns and superstructure ([[entablature]]) were wooden, door openings and antae were protected with wooden planks. The mud brick walls were often reinforced by wooden posts, in a type of [[half-timbered]] technique. The elements of this simple and clearly structured wooden architecture produced all the important design principles that were to determine the development of Greek temples for centuries.

Near the end of the 7th century BC, the dimensions of these simple structures were increased considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Drerup: ''Griechische Baukunst in geometrischer Zeit''. Göttingen 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Temple C at [[Thermos (Aetolia)|Thermos]] is the first of the ''hekatompedoi'', temples with a length of {{convert|100|ft}}. Since it was not technically possible to roof broad spaces at that time, these temples remained very narrow, at 6 to 10 metres in width.

To stress the importance of the cult statue and the building holding it, the naos was equipped with a [[canopy (building)|canopy]], supported by columns. The resulting set of porticos surrounding the temple on all sides (the [[peristasis (architecture)|peristasis]]) was exclusively used for temples in Greek architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Drerup: ''Zur Entstehung der griechischen Ringhalle''. In: Nikolaus Himmelmann-Wildschütz &amp; Hagen Biesantz (eds.): ''Festschrift für Friedrich Matz''. Mainz 1962, p. 32-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the temple with porticos (''[[pteron|ptera]]'') on all sides posed a new aesthetic challenge for the architects and patrons: the structures had to be built to be viewed from all directions. This led to the development of the ''[[peripteros]]'', with a frontal ''[[pronaos]]'' (porch), mirrored by a similar arrangement at the back of the building, the ''[[opisthodomos]]'', which became necessary for entirely aesthetic reasons.  
[[File:CorintheApollo.jpg|thumb|The Temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Corinth]], one of the earliest stone-built Doric temples. Note the [[monolithic column]]s.]]

===Introduction of stone architecture: Archaic and Classical===
After the reintroduction of stone architecture, the essential elements and forms of each temple, such as the number of columns and of column rows, underwent constant change throughout [[Ancient Greece|Greek antiquity]].

In the 6th century BC, [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Samos]] developed the double-colonnaded ''[[Architectural glossary#dipteral|dipteros]]'' as an alternative to the single ''peripteros''. This idea was later copied in [[Didyma]], [[Ephesos]] and [[Athens]]. Between the 6th and the late 4th century BC, innumerable temples were built; nearly every [[polis]], every [[Greek colony|colony]] contained one or several. There were also temples at extra-urban sites and at major sanctuaries like [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and [[Delphi]].

The observable change of form indicates the search for a harmonious form of all architectural elements: the development led from simpler early forms which often appear coarse and bulky up to the aesthetic perfection and refinement of the later structures; from simple experimentation to the strict mathematical complexity of ground plans and superstructures.

===Decline of Greek temple building: Hellenistic period===
[[File:Segesta - Tempio di Hera.JPG|thumb|Temple of Hera in [[Segesta]]]]
From the early [[Hellenistic period]] onwards, the Greek peripteral temple lost much of its importance. With very few exceptions, Classical temple construction ceased both in [[Hellenistic Greece]] and in the [[Greek colonies]] of [[Magna Graecia]]. Only the west of [[Asia Minor]] maintained a low level of temple construction during the 3rd century BC. The construction of large projects, such as the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Didyma]] near [[Miletus]] and the Artemision at [[Sardis]] did not make much progress.

The 2nd century BC saw a revival of temple architecture, including peripteral temples. This is partially due to the influence of the architect [[Hermogenes of Priene]], who redefined the principles of Ionic temple construction both practically and through theoretical work.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Schenk: ''Der korinthische Tempel bis zum Ende des Prinzipats des Augustus''. Internationale Archäologie Vol. 45, 1997, p. 41-47.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the rulers of the various Hellenistic kingdoms provided copious financial resources. Their self-aggrandisation, rivalry, desires to stabilise their spheres of influence, as well as the increasing conflict with [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (partially played out in the field of culture), combined to release much energy into the revival of complex Greek temple architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bringmann &amp; Barbara Schmidt-Dounas: ''Schenkungen hellenistischer Herrscher an griechische Städte und Heiligtümer. Historische und archäologische Auswertung''. Ed. by Hans von Steuben &amp; Klaus Bringman. Akademie Verlag Berlin, Berlin 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase, Greek temples became widespread in southern [[Asia Minor]], [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Cyrenaica#Greek colonization|Northern Africa]].

But in spite of such examples and of the positive conditions produced by the economic upturn and the high degree of technical innovation in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC,&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Schürman: ''Griechische Mechanik und antike Gesellschaft''. Stuttgart 1991, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Hellenistic religious architecture is mostly represented by a multitude of small temples ''[[anta (architecture)|in antis]]'' and [[Prostyle|''prostyle'' temples]], as well as tiny shrines (''[[Naiskos|naiskoi]]''). The latter had been erected in important places, on market squares, near springs and by roads, since the Archaic period, but reached their main flourish now. This limitation to smaller structures led to the development of a special form, the ''[[pseudoperipteros]]'', which uses [[engaged column]]s along the [[cella]] walls to produce the illusion of a peripteral temple. An early case of this is temple L at [[Epidauros]], followed by many prominent Roman examples, such as the [[Maison Carrée]] at [[Nîmes]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans Lauter: ''Die Architektur des Hellenismus''. Wiss. Buchges., Darmstadt 1986, p. 180-194; Gottfried Gruben: : ''Die Tempel der Griechen''. Hirmer, München 2001 (5th edn.), p. 33-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of Greek temple construction: Roman Greece===
In the early 1st century BC, the [[Mithridatic Wars]] led to changes of architectural practice. The role of sponsor was increasingly taken by Roman [[Magistratus|magistrates]] of the [[Roman province|Eastern provinces]],&lt;ref&gt;Friedemann Quaß: ''Die Honoratiorenschicht in den Städten des griechischen Ostens. Untersuchungen zur politischen und sozialen Entwicklung in hellenistischer und römischer Zeit''. Stuttgart 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; who rarely demonstrated their generosity by building temples.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Tuchelt: ''Frühe Denkmäler Roms in Kleinasien''. 23. Beiheft Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts Abteilung Istanbul. 1979, p. 119-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some temples were erected at this time, e.g. the [[Aphrodisias#Temple of Aphrodite|Temple of Aphrodite]] at [[Aphrodisias]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlotte Roueché]] &amp; Kenan T. Erim (Hrsg.): ''Aphrodisias Papers: Recent Work on Architecture and Sculpture''. In: ''Journal of Roman Archaeology''. Supplementary series Vol. 1. 1990, p. 37 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the [[principate]] lead to few new buildings, mostly temples for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]]&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Hänlein-Schäfer: ''Veneratio Augusti. Eine Studie zu den Tempeln des ersten römischen Kaisers''. Rome 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Roman mythology|Roman deities]], e.g. the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] at [[Baalbek]].&lt;ref&gt;Margarete van Ess &amp; Thomas Weber (Hrsg.): ''Baalbek.

Deutung und Funktion des sogenannten Bacchus-Tempels im Heiligtum des Jupiter Heliopolitanus in Baalbek''. In: ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts Abteilung Damaskus''. Vol. 12. 2000, p. 95-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Although new temples to Greek deities still continued to be constructed, e.g. the [[Tyche|Tychaion]] at [[Selge]]&lt;ref&gt;Alois Machatschek - Mario Schwarz: ''Bauforschungen in Selge''. Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften Philosophisch – Historische Klasse Denkschriften. 152. Band. Ergänzungsbände zu den Tituli Asiae Minoris. Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 1981, p. 96 Taf. 4 Fig. 70; J. Nollé &amp; F. Schindler: ''Die Inschriften von Selge''. 1991, p. 89 No. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; they tend to follow the canonical forms of the developing Roman imperial style of architecture&lt;ref&gt;John B. Ward-Perkins: ''Roman Imperial Architecture''. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; or to maintain local non-Greek idiosyncrasies, like the temples in [[Petra]]&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Stefan Freyberger &amp; Martha Sharp Joukowsky: ''Blattranken, Greifen und Elefanten. Sakrale Architektur in Petra''. In: Thomas Weber &amp; Robert Wenning (eds.): ''Petra: antike Felsstadt zwischen arabischer Tradition und griechischer Norm''. Sonderheft Antike Welt. Zabern, Mainz 1997, p. 71 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Collart: ''Le sanctuaire de Baalshamin à Palmyre''. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing [[romanisation (cultural)|romanisation]] of the east&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Fentress (Ed.): ''Romanization and the City.

Journal of Roman Archaeology''. Supplementary series Vol. 38. Portsmouth 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; entailed the end of Greek temple architecture, although work continued on the completion of unfinished large structures like the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Didyma]] or the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Olympieion]] at [[Athens]] into the later 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding Roman period and financing, using the province of Asia as an example, see Stefan Cramme: ''Die Bedeutung des Euergetismus für die Finanzierung städtischer Aufgaben in der Provinz Asia''.

[[File:Syracuse Duomo Ext.jpg|thumb|The 5th-century BC Doric temple of Athena, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]], transformed into a Christian church during the Middle Ages.]]

===Abandonment and conversion of temples: Late Antiquity===
The edicts of [[Theodosius I]] and his successors on the throne of the [[Roman Empire]], banning [[Paganism|pagan cults]], led to the gradual closure of Greek temples, or their conversion into [[Christian]] [[Church (building)|churches]].

Thus ends the history of the Greek temple, although many of them remained in use for a long time afterwards. For example, the Athenian [[Parthenon]], first reconsecrated as a church was turned into a [[mosque]] after the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman]] conquest and remained structurally unharmed until the 17th century AD. Only the unfortunate impact of a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] cannonball into the building, then used to store gunpowder, led to the destruction of much of this important temple, more than 2,000 years after it was built.

== Structure ==
Canonical Greek temples maintained the same basic structure throughout many centuries. The Greeks used a limited number of spatial components, influencing the [[Floor plan|plan]], and of architectural members, determining the [[elevation (view)|elevation]].

=== Floor plan ===

====Naos====
The central cult structure of the temple is the ''[[Cella|naos]]'' or [[Cella]], which usually contained a [[cult image|cult statue]] of the deity. In [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] temples, a separate room, the so-called ''[[adyton]]'' was sometimes included after the cella for this purpose. In [[Sicily]], this habit continued into the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] period.

====Pronaos and opisthodomos====
In front of the ''cella'', there is a porch, the ''[[pronaos]]'', created by the protruding side walls of the ''cella'' (the ''[[Anta (architecture)|antae]])'', and two columns placed between them. A door allows the cella to be accessed from the ''pronaos''. A similar room at the back of the cella is called the ''[[opisthodomos]]''. There is no door connecting the ''opisthodomos'' with the ''cella''; its existence is necessitated entirely by aesthetic considerations: to maintain the consistency of the peripteral temple and to ensure its viewability from all sides, the execution of the front has to be repeated at the rear. A restricted space, the ''[[adyton]]'', may be included at the far end of the ''cella'', backing up on the ''opisthodomos''.

====Peristasis====
The complex formed by the ''naos'', ''pronaos'', ''opisthodomos'' and possibly the ''adyton'' is enclosed on all four sides by the ''[[peristasis (architecture)|peristasis]]'', usually a single row, rarely a double one, of columns. This produces a surrounding portico, the ''[[pteron]]'', which offered shelter to visitors of the sanctuary and room for cult processions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Plan types====
[[File:Athenian Treasury antae.jpg|thumb|The [[Athenian Treasury]] in [[Delphi]] with two [[anta (architecture)|antae]] framing two columns.]]
These components allowed the realisation of a variety of different plan types in Greek temple architecture. The simplest example of a Greek temple is the ''templum in antis'', a small rectangular structure sheltering the cult statue. In front of the ''cella'', a small porch or ''pronaos'' was formed by the protruding cella walls, the ''[[anta (architecture)|antae]]''. The ''pronaos'' was linked to the ''cella'' by a door. To support the superstructure, two columns were placed between the ''antae'' (''[[distyle in antis]]''). When equipped with an ''[[opisthodomos]]'' with a similar ''distyle in antis'' design, this is called a double anta temple. A variant of that type has the ''opisthodomos'' at the back of the ''cella'' indicated merely by half-columns and shortened ''antae'', so that it can be described as a ''pseudo-opisthodomos''. 
[[File:Temple types.gif|thumb|350px|Different temple plans]]
If the porch of a temple ''in antis'' has a row of usually four or six columns in front of its whole breadth, the temple is described as a ''prostylos'' or ''[[prostyle|prostyle temple]]''. The whole ''pronaos'' may be omitted in this case or just leave the ''antae'' without columns. An [[amphiprostyle|''amphiprostylos'']] or ''amphiprostyle'' repeats the same column setting at the back.

In contrast, the term ''[[peripteros]]'' or [[peripteral]] designates a temple surrounded by ''[[pteron|ptera]]'' (colonnades) on all four sides, each usually formed by a single row of columns. This produces an unobstructed surrounding portico, the ''[[peristasis (architecture)|peristasis]]'', on all four sides of the temple. A Hellenistic and Roman form of this shape is the ''[[pseudoperipteros]]'', where the side columns of the peristasis are indicated only by [[engaged column]]s or [[pilaster]]s directly attached to the external cella walls.

A ''[[Architectural glossary#Dipteral|dipteros]]'' or ''[[dipteral]]'' is equipped with a double colonnade on all four sides, sometimes with further rows of columns at the front and back. A ''pseudodipteros'' has engaged columns in the inner row of columns at the sides.

Circular temples form a special type. If they are surrounded by a colonnade, they are known as peripteral [[Tholos (Ancient Rome)|tholoi]]. Although of sacred character, their function as a temple can often not be asserted. A comparable structure is the ''monopteros'', or ''[[cyclostyle]]'' which, however, lacks a ''cella''.

To clarify ground plan types, the defining terms can be combined, producing terms such as: peripteral double anta temple, prostyle ''in antis'', peripteral amphiprostyle, etc.

====Column number terminology====
An additional definition, already used by [[Vitruvius]] (IV, 3, 3) is determined by the number of columns at the front. Modern scholarship uses the following terms:

{| class="wikitable"
! technical term
! number of columns at front
|-
| distyle || 2 columns
|-
| tetrastyle || 4 columns, term used by Vitruvius
|-
| hexastyle || 6 columns, term used by Vitruvius
|-
| octastyle || 8 columns
|-
| decastyle || 10 columns
|}

The term ''dodekastylos'' is only used for the 12-column hall at the [[Didyma]]ion. No temples with facades of that width are known.

Very few temples had an uneven number of columns at the front. Examples are Temple of [[Hera]] I at [[Paestum]], Temple of [[Apollo]] A at [[Metapontum]], both of which have a width of nine columns (enneastyle), and the Archaic temple at [[Thermos (Aetolia)|Thermos]] with a width of five columns (pentastyle).

=== Elevation ===
[[File:Temple features.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Elevation of the [[Temple of Concordia, Agrigento|Temple of Concord]], [[Agrigentum]]]]
The elevation of Greek temples is always subdivided in three zones: the ''[[crepidoma]]'', the [[column]]s and the [[entablature]].

====Foundations and crepidoma====
Stereobate, ''euthynteria'' and ''crepidoma'' form the substructure of the temple.  The underground foundation of a Greek temple is known as the [[stereobate]]. It consists of several layers of squared stone blocks. The uppermost layer, the ''[[euthynteria]]'', partially protrudes above the ground level. Its surface is carefully smoothed and levelled. It supports a further foundation of three steps, the ''[[crepidoma]]''. The uppermost level of the ''crepidoma'' provides the surface on which the columns and walls are placed; it is called [[stylobate]].

[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Illustration of [[Doric column|Doric]] (first three), [[Ionic column|Ionic]] (next three) and [[Corinthian column|Corinthian]] (final two) columns.]]

====Columns====
Placed on the stylobate are the vertical column shafts, tapering towards the top. They are normally made of several separately cut column drums. Depending on the architectural order, a different number of [[Fluting (architecture)|flutings]] are cut into the column shaft: Doric columns have 18 to 20 flutings, Ionic and Corinthian ones normally have 24. Early Ionic columns had up to 48 flutings. While Doric columns stand directly on the stylobate, Ionic and Corinthian ones possess a base, sometimes additionally placed atop a [[plinth]].

In [[Doric column]]s, the top is formed by a concavely curved neck, the ''[[hypotrachelion]]'', and the [[capital (architecture)|capital]], in Ionic columns, the capital sits directly on the shaft. In the Doric order, the capital consists of a circular [[torus]] bulge, originally very flat, the so-called ''[[molding (decorative)|echinus]]'', and a square slab, the ''[[abacus (architecture)|abacus]]''. In the course of their development, the ''echinus'' expands more and more, culminating in a linear diagonal, at 45° to the vertical. The ''echinus'' of [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] is decorated with an [[egg-and-dart]] band followed by a sculpted pillow forming two [[volute]]s, supporting a thin ''abacus''. The eponymous Corinthian capital of the [[Corinthian order]] is crowned by rings of stylised [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, forming tendrils and volutes that reach to the corners of the ''abacus''.

[[File:AtenePartenoneTrabeazioneOvest.jpg|thumb|[[Entablature]] on the west side of the [[Parthenon]].]]

====Entablature====
The capitals support the [[entablature]]. In the Doric order, the entablature always consists of two parts, the [[architrave]] and the Doric [[frieze]] (or [[triglyph]] frieze). The Ionic order of Athens and the [[Cyclades]] also used a frieze above an architrave, whereas the frieze remained unknown in the Ionic architecture of [[Asia Minor]] until the 4th century BC. There, the architrave was directly followed by the ''[[dentil]]''. The frieze was originally placed in front of the roof beams, which were externally visible only in the earlier temples of Asia Minor. The Doric [[frieze]] was structured by [[triglyph]]s. These were placed above the axis of each column, and above the centre of each [[intercolumniation]]. The spaces between the triglyphs contained [[metope (architecture)|metope]]s, sometimes painted or decorated with relief sculpture. In the Ionic or Corinthian orders, the frieze possesses no triglyphs and is simply left flat, sometimes decorated with paintings or reliefs. With the introduction of stone architecture, the protection of the porticos and the support of the roof construction was moved upwards to the level of the ''[[geison]]'', depriving the frieze of its structural function and turning it into an entirely decorative feature. Frequently, the ''cella'' is also decorated with architrave and frieze, especially at the front of the ''[[pronaos]]''.

[[File:Lycosoura-3.jpg|thumb|''[[Geison]]'' block from the temple at [[Lycosura|Lykosoura]].]]

====Cornice and geison====
Above the frieze, or an intermediate member, e.g. the [[dentil]] of the Ionic or Corinthian orders, the [[cornice]] protrudes notably. It consists of the ''[[geison]]'' (on the sloped sides or [[pediment]]s of the narrow walls a sloped ''geison''), and the ''[[sima (architecture)|sima]]''. On the long side, the ''sima'', often elaborately decorated, was equipped with water spouts, often in the shape of lions' heads. The pedimental triangle or ''[[tympanum (architecture)|tympanon]]'' on the narrow sides of the temple was created by the Doric introduction of the [[gabled roof]], earlier temples often had [[Hip roof|hipped roofs]]. The ''tympanon'' was usually richly decorated with sculptures of mythical scenes or battles. The corners and ridges of the roof were decorated with ''[[acroteria]]'', originally geometric, later floral or figural decorations.

===Aspect===
As far as topographically possible, the temples were freestanding and designed to be viewed from all sides. They were not normally designed with consideration for their surroundings, but formed autonomous structures. This is a major difference from [[Roman temple]]s which were often designed as part of a planned urban area or square and had a strong emphasis on being viewed frontally.

== Design and measurements ==

===Proportions===
The foundations of Greek temples could reach dimensions of up to 115 by 55 m, i.e. the size of an average soccer field. Columns could reach a height of 20 m. To design such large architectural bodies harmoniously, a number of basic aesthetic principles were developed and tested already on the smaller temples. The main measurement was the foot, varying between 29 and 34&amp;nbsp;cm from region to region. This initial measurement was the basis for all the units that determined the shape of the temple. Important factors include the lower diameter of the columns and the width of their plinths. The distance between the column axes ([[intercolumniation]] or [[bay (architecture)|bay]]) could also be used as a basic unit. These measurements were in set proportions to other elements of design, such as column height and column distance. In conjunction with the number of columns per side, they also determined the dimensions of [[stylobate]] and ''[[peristasis (architecture)|peristasis]]'', as well as of the ''[[Cella|naos]]'' proper. The rules regarding vertical proportions, especially in the Doric order, also allow for a deduction of the basic design options for the entablature from the same principles. Alternatives to this very rational system were sought in the temples of the late 7th and early 6th centuries BC, when it was attempted to develop the basic measurements from the planned dimensions of ''cella'' or stylobate, i.e. to reverse the system described above and deduce the smaller units from the bigger ones. Thus, for example, the ''cella'' length was sometimes set at {{convert|100|ft}} (100 is a sacred number, also known from the ''[[hecatomb]]'', a sacrifice of 100 animals), and all further measurements had to be in relation to this number, leading to aesthetically quite unsatisfactory solutions.

===Naos-peristasis relationship===
Another determining design feature was the relationship linking ''naos'' and ''peristasis''. In the original temples, this would have been subject entirely to practical necessities, and always based on axial links between ''cella'' walls and columns, but the introduction of stone architecture broke that connection. Nevertheless, it did survive throughout Ionic architecture. In Doric temples, however, the wooden roof construction, originally placed behind the frieze, now started at a higher level, behind the ''geison''. This ended the structural link between frieze and roof; the structural elements of the latter could now be placed independent of axial relationships. As a result, the ''cella'' walls lost their fixed connection with the columns for a long time and could be freely placed within the ''peristasis''. Only after a long phase of developments did the architects choose the alignment of the outer wall face with the adjacent column axis as the obligatory principle for Doric temples. Doric temples in [[Greater Greece]] rarely follow this system.

===Column number formula===
The basic proportions of the building were determined by the numeric relationship of columns on the front and back to those on the sides. The classic solution chosen by Greek architects is the formula "frontal columns : side columns = n : (2n+1)", which can also be used for the number of intercolumniations. As a result, numerous temples of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] in Greece ({{circa|500}} to 336 BC) had 6 × 13 columns or 5 × 11 intercolumnitions. The same proportions, in a more abstract form, determine most of the [[Parthenon]], not only in its 8 × 17 column ''peristasis'', but also, reduced to 4:9, in all other basic measurements, including the intercolumniations, the stylobate, the width-height proportion of the entire building, and the ''geison'' (here reversed to 9:4).&lt;ref&gt;The same basic proportion occurs, less purely, in the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] of Athens. Wolfgang Müller-Wiener: ''Griechisches Bauwesen in der Antike''. C. H. Beck, München 1988, p. 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Interkolumnium.png|right|thumb|Proportion of column diameter to intercolumnium.]]

===Column spacing===
Since the turn of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the proportion of column width to the space between columns, the intercolumnium, played an increasingly important role in architectural theory, reflected, for example, in the works of [[Vitruvius]]. According to this proportion, Vitruvius (3, 3, 1 ff) distinguished between  five different design concepts and temple types:
* Pyknostyle, tight-columned: intercolumnium = 1 ½ lower column diameters
* Systyle, close-columned: intercolumnium = 2 lower column diameters
* Eustyle, well-columned: intercolumnium = 2 ¼ lower column diameters
* Diastyle, board-columned: interkolumnium = 3 lower column diameters
* Araeostyle, light-columned: intercolumnium = 3 ½ lower column diameters
The determination and discussion of these basic principles went back to [[Hermogenes of Priene|Hermogenes]], whom Vitruvius credits with the invention of the ''eustylos''. The Temple of [[Dionysos]] at [[Teos]], normally ascribed to Hermogenes, does indeed have intercolumnia measuring 2 &amp;frac16; of the lower column diameters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfram Hoepfner]] in: Wolfram Hoepfner &amp; Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner (eds.): ''Hermogenes und die hochhellenistische Architektur.''

== Optical refinements ==
[[File:Opticorr.JPG|thumb|Exaggerated sketch of the curvature of a Doric temple.]]
To loosen up the mathematical strictness and to counteract distortions of human visual perception, a slight [[curvature]] of the whole building, hardly visible with the naked eye, was introduced. The ancient architects had realised that long horizontal lines tend to make the optical impression  of sagging towards their centre. To prevent this effect, the horizontal lines of stylobate and/or entablature were raised by a few centimetres towards the middle of a building. This avoidance of mathematically straight lines also included the columns, which did not taper in a linear fashion, but were refined by a pronounced "swelling" (''[[entasis]]'') of the shaft. Additionally, columns were placed with a slight [[inclination]] towards the centre of the building. Curvature and entasis occur from the mid 6th century BC onwards. 

The most consistent use of these principles is seen in the Classical [[Parthenon]] on the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis]]. Its curvature affects all horizontal elements up to the sima, even the cella walls reflect it throughout their height. The inclination of its columns (which also have a clear entasis), is continued by architrave and triglyph frieze, the external walls of the cella also reflect it. Not one block of the building, not a single architrave or frieze element could be hewn as a simple rectilinear block. All architectural elements display slight variations from the right angle, individually calculated for each block. As a side effect, each preserved building block from the Parthenon, its columns, cella walls or entablature, can be assigned its exact position today. In spite of the immense extra effort entailed in this perfection, the Parthenon, including its sculptural decoration, was completed in the record time of sixteen years (447 to 431 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Haselberg: ''Old Issues, New Research, Latest Discoveries: Curvature and Other Classical Refinements''.

==Decoration==

=== Colouring ===
Only three basic colours were used: white, blue and red, occasionally also black. The crepidoma, columns, and architrave were mostly white. Only details, like the horizontally cut grooves at the bottom of Doric capitals (''annuli''), or decorative elements of Doric architraves (e.g. ''[[Taenia (architecture)|taenia]]'' and ''[[guttae]]'') might be painted in different colours. The frieze was clearly structured by use of colours. In a Doric triglyph frieze, blue triglyphs alternated with red metopes, the latter often serving as a background for individually painted sculptures. Reliefs, ornaments, and pedimental sculptures were executed with a wider variety of colours and nuances. Recessed or otherwise shaded elements, like [[Architectural glossary#mutule|mutules]] or triglyph slits could be painted black. The paint was mostly applied to parts that were not load-bearing, whereas structural parts like columns or the horizontal elements of architrave and ''geison'' were left unpainted (if made of high-quality limestone or marble) or covered with a white [[stucco]].

=== Architectural sculpture ===
[[File:AC marbles.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[centaur]] struggling with a [[Lapith]] on a [[Metope (architecture)|metope]], the [[Parthenon]]]]
Greek temples were often enhanced with figural decorations. especially the [[frieze]] areas offered space for [[relief]]s and relief slabs; the [[pediment]]al triangles often contained scenes of free-standing [[sculpture]]. In Archaic times, even the architrave could be relief-decorated on Ionic temples, as demonstrated by the earlier temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Didyma]]. Here, the architrave corners bore [[gorgon]]s, surrounded by lions and perhaps other animals. On the other hand, the Ionic temples of Asia Minor did not possess a separate frieze to allow space for relief decoration. The most common area for relief decoration remained the frieze, either as a typical Doric triglyph frieze, with sculpted metopes, or as a continuous frieze on [[Cycladic]] and later on Eastern Ionic temples.

====Metopes====
The [[metope (architecture)|metope]]s, separate individual tableaux that could usually not contain more than three figures each, usually depicted individual scenes belonging to a broader context. It is rare for scenes to be distributed over several metopes; instead, a general narrative context, usually a battle, is created by the combination of multiple isolated scenes. Other thematical contexts could be depicted in this fashion. For example, the metopes at the front and back of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] depicted the [[Labours of Heracles|Twelve Labours]] of [[Heracles]]. Individual mythological scenes, like the abduction of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] or a cattle raid by the [[Dioscuri]] could be thus depicted, as could scenes from the voyage of the [[Argonauts]] or the [[Trojan War]]. The battles against the [[centaurs]] and [[Amazons]], as well as the [[gigantomachy]], all three depicted on the [[Parthenon]], were recurring themes on many temples. 
[[File:Parthenon frieze w facade in situ.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the [[Parthenon Frieze]], ''[[in situ]]'' on the west side of the ''naos''.]]

====Friezes====
Battle scenes of all kinds were also a common theme of Ionic friezes, e.g. the [[Gigantomachy]] on the temple of [[Hekate]] at [[Lagina]], or the [[Amazonomachy]] on the temple of [[Artemis]] at [[Magnesia on the Maeander]], both from the late 2nd century BC. Complex compositions visualised the back and forth of fighting for the viewer. Such scenes were contrasted by more quiet or peaceful ones: The Assembly of the gods and a procession dominate the [[Parthenon Frieze|160 m long frieze]] that is placed on top of the ''naos'' walls of the [[Parthenon]]. 
[[File:Athina Akropolis relief back 2005-04.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Reconstruction of the west [[pediment]] on the [[Parthenon]], [[Athens]], [[Acropolis Museum]].]]

====Pediments====
Special attention was paid to the decoration of the [[pediment]]al triangles, not least because of their size and frontal position. Originally, the pediments were filled with massive reliefs, e.g. shortly after 600 BC on the temple of [[Artemis]] at [[Kerkyra]], where the west pediment is taken up by the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]] and her children at the centre, flanked by panthers. Smaller scenes are displayed in the low corners of the pediments, e.g. [[Zeus]] with a thunderbolt, fighting a [[Gigantes|Giant]]. The pedimental sculpture of the first peripteral temple on the [[Athenian Acropolis]], from {{circa|570}} BC, is nearly free-standing sculpture, but remains dominated by a central scene of fighting lions. [[File:Zeus' temple in Olimpia, frontone west, Apollo.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Apollo]] from the west pediment of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].]]Again, the corners contain separate scenes, including [[Heracles]] fighting [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]. After the mid-6th century BC, the compositional scheme changes: animal scenes are now placed in the corners, soon they disappear entirely. The central composition is now taken over by mythological fights or by rows of human figures. The high regard in which the Greeks held pedimental sculptures in demonstrated by the discovery of the sculptures from the Late Archaic temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]], which had received a veritable burial after the temple's destruction in 373 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Picard – [[Pierre de La Coste-Messelière]]: ''Fouilles de Delphes''. Bd. IV 3, 1931, S. 15 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The themes of the individual pedimental scenes are increasingly dominated by myths connected with the locality. Thus, the east pediment at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] depicts the preparations for a [[chariot race]] between [[Pelops]] and [[Oinomaos]], the mythical king of nearby [[Pisa]]. It is the foundation myth of the sanctuary itself, displayed here in its most prominent position. A similarly direct association is provided by the birth of [[Athena]] on the east pediment of the [[Parthenon]], or the struggle for [[Attica]] between her and [[Poseidon]] on its west pediment. The pediment of the later temple of the [[Kabeiroi]] at [[Samothrace]], late 3rd century BC, depicted a probably purely local legend, of no major interest to Greece as a whole. 
[[File:NAMA-Aura Asklepios temple.jpg|thumb|right|Mounted [[nereid]]; corner [[acroterion]] from the temple of [[Asklepios]] at [[Epidauros]].]]

====Roofs====
{{Further|List of Greco-Roman roofs}}
The roofs were crowned by ''[[acroteria]]'', originally in the form of elaborately painted clay disks, from the 6th century BC onwards as fully sculpted figures placed on the corners and ridges of the pediments. They could depict bowls and [[tripod]]s, [[griffin]]s, [[sphinx|spinx]]es, and especially mythical figures and deities. For example, depictions of the running [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] crowned the [[Alcmaeonidae|Alcmaeonid]] temple of Apollo at Delphi, and mounted amazons formed the corner akroteria of the temple of [[Asklepios]] in [[Epidauros]]. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (5, 10, 8) describes bronze tripods forming the corner akroteria and statues of Nike by [[Paeonios]] forming the ridge ones on the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].

====Columns====
For the sake of completeness, a further potential bearer of sculptural decoration should be mentioned here: the ''columnae celetae'' of the Ionic temples at [[Temple of Artemis|Ephesos]] and [[Didyma]]. Here, already on the Archaic temples, the lower parts of the column shafts were decorated by protruding relief decorations, originally depicting rows of figures, replaced on their late Classical and Hellenistic successors with mythological scenes and battles.&lt;ref&gt;About architectural sculpture: M. Oppermann: ''Vom Medusabild zur Athenageburt. Bildprogramme griechischer Tempelgiebel archaischer und klassischer Zeit''. 1990; Heiner Knell: ''Mythos und Polis. Bildprogramme griechischer Bauskulptur''. The column was constructed of drums, the round core, and finished with flutes, making the outer area look rippled. Slight swelling of the column is known as entasis.  1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function and design ==
[[File:Athena Parthenos LeQuire.jpg|thumb|right|Reproduction of the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' cult image at the original size in the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon in Nashville]], Tennessee.]]
===Cult statue and cella===
The functions of the temple mainly concentrated on the ''[[cella]]'', the "dwelling" of the cult statue. The elaboration of the temple's external aspects served to stress the dignity of the ''cella''. In contrast, the ''cella'' itself was often finished with some moderation, although by the Roman period some had clearly become rather cluttered with other statues, military trophies and other gifts.  Often, the only source of light for ''cella'' and cult statue was the ''cella'''s frontal door, and oil lamps within. Thus, the interior only received a limited amount of light. Exceptions are found in the temples of Apollo at [[Bassae]] and of Athena at [[Tegea]], where the southern ''cella'' wall had a door, potentially allowing more light into the interior. A special situation applies to the temples of the [[Cyclades]], where the roof was usually of [[marble]] tiles. Marble roofs also covered the temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and the [[Parthenon]] at [[Athens]]. As marble is not entirely opaque, those ''cellas'' may have been permeated with a distinctive diffused light. 

For cultic reasons, but also to use the light of the rising sun, virtually all Greek temples were oriented to the east. Some exceptions existed, e.g. the west-facing temples of [[Artemis]] at [[Temple of Artemis|Ephesos]] and at [[Magnesia on the Maeander]], or the north-south oriented temples of [[Arcadia]]. Such exceptions are probably connected with cult practice. Study of the soils around temple sites, is evidence that temple sites were chosen with regard to particular deities: for example, amid arable soils for the agricultural deities Dionysos and Demeter, and near rocky soils for the hunter gatherer deities Apollo and Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;Retallack, G.J., 2008, "Rocks, views, soils and plants at the temples of ancient Greece". ''Antiquity'' 82, 640–657&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size, in early days in wood, marble or [[terracotta]], or in the specially prestigious form of a [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine statue]] using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework.  The most famous Greek cult imges were of this type, including the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]], and [[Phidias]]'s [[Athena Parthenos]] in the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, both colossal statues now completely lost.  Fragments of two chryselephantine stutues from [[Delphi]] have been excavated.  Bronze cult images were less frequent, at least until Hellenistic times.&lt;ref name = miles213&gt;Miles, 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[acrolith]] was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body.  A [[xoanon]] was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu [[lingam]]; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity.  Many of the Greek statues well-known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the [[Apollo Barberini]], can be credibly identified.  A very few actual originals survive, for example the bronze [[Piraeus Athena]] (2.35 metres high, including a helmet).  The image stood on a base, from the 5th century often carved with reliefs.

====Refinements====
[[File:Templo de Afaia3.JPG|thumb|left|Temple of [[Aphaia]], [[Aegina]]: The interior of the [[cella]] was embellished with two tiers of Doric columns.]]
The cult statue was often oriented towards an [[altar]], placed axially in front of the temple. To preserve this connection, the single row of columns often found along the central axis of the ''cella'' in early temples was replaced by two separate rows towards the sides. The central one of the three aisles thereby created was often emphasised as the main one. The dignity of the central aisle of the ''cella'' could be underlined by the use of special elements of design. For example, the oldest known [[Corinthian capital]]s are from the ''[[Classical architecture|naoi]]'' of Doric temples. The impressiveness of the internal aisle could be emphasised further by having a third row of columns along the back, as is the case at the [[Parthenon]] and at the temple of [[Zeus]] in [[Nemea]]. The Parthenon ''cella'', also had another impressive feature, namely two tiers of columns atop each other, as did the temple of [[Aphaia]] on [[Aegina]].  The temple of Athena at [[Tegea]] shows another variation, where the two column rows are indicated by half-columns protruding from the side walls and crowned with Corinthian capitals. An early form of this solution can be seen at Bassae, where the central column of the back portico remains free-standing, while the columns along the sides are in fact semi-columns connected with the walls by curved protrusions.

Some famous temples, notably the Parthenon, the [[Temple of Zeus at Olympia]], and the [[Temple of Asclepius, Epidaurus]], had much of the cella floor occupied by a very shallow pool filled with water (Parthenon) or [[olive oil]] at Olympia. All these had chryselephantine images, and Pausanias was perhaps correct to link the Parthenon on with the maintenance of the proper humidity, but they probably increased the light, and perhaps gave it attractive effects of reflections.&lt;ref name = miles213/&gt;

====Access====
[[File:Bassae.jpg|thumb|Plan and interior reconstruction of the Temple of [[Apollo]] Epikourios at [[Bassae]]. Note the side entrance to the ''[[cella]]'' and the single Corinthian column.]]
It used to be thought that access to the cella of a Greek temple was limited to the priests, and it was entered only rarely and by other visitors, except perhaps during important festivals or other special occasions.  In recent decades this picture has changed, and scholars now stress the variety of local access rules.  [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was a gentlemanly traveller of the 2nd-century AD who declares that the special intention of his travels around Greece was to see cult images, and usually managed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 212-213, 220&lt;/ref&gt;

It was typically necessary to make a sacrifice or gift, and some temples restricted access either to certain days of the year, or by class, race, gender (with either men or women forbidden), or even more tightly. Garlic-eaters were forbidden in one temple, in another women unless they were virgins; restrictions typically arose from local ideas of ritual purity or a perceived whim of the deity. In some places visitors were asked to show they spoke Greek; elsewhere [[Dorians]] were not allowed entry.  Some temples could only be viewed from the threshold.  Some temples are said never to be opened at all.  But generally Greeks, including slaves, had a reasonable expectation of being allowed into the cella.  Once inside the cella it was possible to pray to or before the cult image, and sometimes to touch it; Cicero saw a bronze image of Heracles with its foot largely worn away by the touch of devotees.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Gregory, ''Power and Place: Temple and Identity in the Book of Revelation'', pp. 48-50, 2012, Walter de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3110880393}}, 9783110880397, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9dcfAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 google books]; Miles, 212-213, 220&lt;/ref&gt;  Famous cult images such as the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]] functioned as significant visitor attractions.    

Sometimes, the divine character of the cult image was stressed even more by removing it further into a separate space within the ''cella'', the ''[[adyton]]''. Especially in [[Magna Graecia]], this tradition continued for a long time. Over the decades and centuries, numerous [[votive]] offerings could be placed in the ''cella'', giving it a museum-like character (Pausanias 5, 17).

===Opisthodomos===
The back room of the temple, the ''opisthodomos'', usually served as a storage space for cult equipment. It could also hold the temple treasury. For some time, the opisthodomus of the Athenian [[Parthenon]] contained the treasury of the [[Delian League]], thus directly protected by the deity. ''Pronaos'' and ''opisthodomos'' were often closed off from the peristasis by wooden barriers or fences.

===Peristasis===
Like the cella, the ''peristasis'' could serve the display and storage of votives, often placed between the columns. In some cases, votive offerings could also be directly affixed to the columns, as is visible e.g. on the [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera at Olympia]]. The ''peristasis'' could also be used for cult [[procession]]s, or simply as shelter from the elements, a function emphasised by Vitruvius (III 3, 8f).

== Sponsors, construction and costs ==

===Public and private sponsors===
[[File:Templo of Apollo Delfi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In the late 6th century BC, the [[Alcmaeonidae]] family strongly supported the rebuilding of the [[Delphi#Buildings and structures#Temple of Apollo|Temple of Apollo at Delphi]], so as to improve their standing in [[Athens]] and [[Greece]].]] 
The sponsors of Greek temples usually belonged to one of two groups: on the one hand public sponsors, including the bodies and institutions that administrated important sanctuaries; on the other hand influential and affluent private sponsors, especially Hellenistic [[king]]s. The financial needs were covered by income from taxes or special levies, or by the sale of raw materials like silver. The collection of donations also occurred, especially for supra-regional sanctuaries like [[Delphi]] or [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Hellenistic monarchs could appear as private donors in cities outside their immediate sphere of influence and sponsor public buildings, as exemplified by [[Antiochus IV|Antiochos IV]], who ordered the rebuilding of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Olympieion]] at [[Athens]]. In such cases, the money came from the private treasury of the donor.&lt;ref&gt;K. Bringmann &amp; H. von Steuben, ''Schenkungen hellenistischer Herrscher an griechische Städte und Heiligtümer''. 1995; Hildegard Schaaf: ''Untersuchungen zu Gebäudestiftungen hellenistischer Zeit''. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
Building contracts were advertised after a popular or elected assembly had passed the relevant motion. An appointed committee would choose the winner among the submitted plans. Afterwards, another committee would supervise the building process. Its responsibilities included the advertising and awarding of individual contracts, the practical supervision of the construction, the inspection and acceptance of completed parts, and the paying of wages. The original advert contained all the information necessary to enable a contractor to make a realistic offer for completing the task. Contracts were normally awarded to the competitor offering the most complete service for the cheapest price. In the case of public buildings, the materials were normally provided by the public sponsor, exceptions were clarified in the contract. Contractors were usually only responsible for specific parts of the overall construction, as most businesses were small. Originally, payment was by person and day, but from the 5th century BC onwards, payment by piece or construction stage became common.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Lauter: ''Die Architektur des Hellenismus''. Wiss. Buchges., Darmstadt 1986, p. 12-27; Wolfgang Müller-Wiener: ''Griechisches Bauwesen in der Antike''. C. H. Beck, München 1988, p. 15-25, 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
The costs could be immense. For example, surviving receipts show that in the rebuilding of the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemision]] of [[Ephesos]], a single column cost 40,000 [[ancient Greek drachma|drachmas]]. Considering that a worker was paid about two drachmas, that equals nearly 2 million [[euro]] (on a modern west European wage scale). Since the overall number of columns required for the design was 120, even this aspect of the building would have caused costs equivalent to those of major projects today (circa 360 million euro).&lt;ref&gt;Albert Rehm: "''Die Inschriften''{{-"}}. In: Theodor Wiegand: ''Didyma''. 2. Teil (ed. by Richard Harder). Berlin 1958. pp. 13–103. The calculation is based on a low-skilled craftsman's daily pay of 150 euro in modern Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temples of the different architectural orders ==
One of the criteria by which Greek temples are classified is the [[Classical order]] chosen as their basic aesthetic principle. This choice, which was rarely entirely free, but normally determined by tradition and local habit, would lead to widely differing rules of design. According to the three major orders, a basic distinction can be made between the [[#Doric temples|Doric]], the [[#Ionic temples|Ionic]] and the [[#Corinthian temples|Corinthian]] Temple.

=== Doric temples ===
[[File:Hephaistos temple 2006.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Hephaistos]] in [[Athens]], the best-preserved Doric temple in [[Greece]].]]
The modern image of Greek temple architecture is strongly influenced by the numerous reasonably well-preserved temples of the [[Doric order]]. Especially the ruins of [[Magna Graecia|Southern Italy]] and [[History of Sicily#Classical age#Greek period|Sicily]] were accessible to western travellers quite early in the development of Classical studies, e.g. the temples at [[Paestum]], [[Akragas]] or [[Segesta]],&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Mertens: ''Der Tempel von Segesta und die dorische Tempelbaukunst des griechischen Westens in klassischer Zeit''. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Hephaisteion]] and the [[Parthenon]] of [[Athens]] also influenced scholarship and [[Neoclassical architecture]] from an early point onwards.

====Beginnings====
The beginnings of Greek temple construction in the Doric order can be traced to early in the 7th century BC. With the transition to stone architecture around 600 BC, the order was fully developed; from then on, only details were changed, developed and refined, mostly in the context of solving the challenges posed by the design and construction of monumental temples.

====First monumental temples====
Apart from early forms, occasionally still with apsidal backs and hipped roofs, the first {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} peripteral temples occur quite soon, before 600 BC. An example is Temple C at [[Thermos (Aetolia)|Thermos]], {{circa|625}} BC,&lt;ref&gt;Georg Kawerau &amp; Georgios Soteriades: ''Der Apollotempel zu Thermos''. In: ''Antike Denkmäler''. Bd. 2, 1902/08. ([http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/ad1908/ Online]).&lt;/ref&gt; a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ''hekatompedos'', surrounded by a ''peristasis'' of 5 × 15 columns, its cella divided in two aisles by a central row of columns. Its entirely Doric entablature is indicated by painted clay plaques, probably early example of metopes, and clay triglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;H. Koch: ''Zu den Metopen von Thermos''. In: ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts Abteilung Athen''. Bd. 39, 1914, S. 237 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to be the case that all temples erected within the spheres of influence of [[Corinth]] and [[Argos]] in the 7th century BC were Doric ''peripteroi''. The earliest stone columns did not display the simple squatness of the high and late Archaic specimens, but rather mirror the slenderness of their wooden predecessors. Already around 600 BC, the demand of viewability from all sides was applied to the Doric temple, leading to the mirroring of the frontal ''pronaos'' by an ''opisthodomos'' at the back. This early demand continued to affect Doric temples especially in the Greek motherland. Neither the Ionic temples, nor the Doric specimens in [[Magna Graecia]] followed this principle.&lt;ref name="Dieter Mertens 1993"&gt;Dieter Mertens: ''Der alte Heratempel in Paestum und die archaische Baukunst in Unteritalien''. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing monumentalisation of stone buildings, and the transfer of the wooden roof construction to the level of the ''geison'' removed the fixed relationship between the ''naos'' and the ''peristasis''. This relationship between the axes of walls and columns, almost a matter of course in smaller structures, remained undefined and without fixed rules for nearly a century: the position of the ''naos'' "floated" within the ''peristasis''.
[[File:Hera-tempel - Dorisch kapiteel.jpg|thumb|Doric capital in the [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Heraion of Olympia]].]]

====Stone-built temples====

=====The Heraion at Olympia (c. 600 BC)=====
The [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Heraion of Olympia]]&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Mallwitz: ''Das Heraion von Olympia und seine Vorgänger''. In: ''Jahrbuch des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts''. Bd. 81, 1966, p. 310-376.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{circa|600}} BC) exemplifies the transition from wood to stone construction. This building, initially constructed entirely of wood and mudbrick, had its wooden columns gradually replaced with stone ones over time. Like a museum of Doric columns and Doric capitals, it contains examples of all chronological phases, up to the Roman period. One of the columns in the ''opisthodomos'' remained wooden at least until the 2nd century AD, when [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] described it. This 6 by 16 columns temple already called for a solution to the [[Doric order|Doric]] corner conflict. It was achieved through a reduction of the corner intercolumniations the so-called corner contraction. The Heraion is most advanced in regards to the relationship between ''naos'' and ''peristasis'', as it uses the solution that became canonical decades later, a linear axis running along the external faces of the outer ''naos'' walls and through the central axis of the associated columns. Its differentiation between wider intercolumnia on the narrow sides and narrower ones on the long sides was also an influential feature, as was the positioning of the columns within the ''cella'', corresponding with those on the outside, a feature not repeated until the construction of the temple at [[Bassae]] 150 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick A. Cooper: ''The Temple of Apollo Bassitas''. Vol. 1-4. 1992-1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Temple of Artemis, Kerkyra (early 6th century BC)=====
The oldest Doric temple entirely built of stone is represented by the early 6th century BC [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Artemis Temple]] in [[Kerkyra]] (modern [[Corfu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Rodenwaldt: ''Korkyra. Bd. 1 - Der Artemistempel''. 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; All parts of this building are bulky and heavy, its columns reach a height of barely five times their bottom diameter and were very closely spaced with an intercolumniation of a single column width. The individual members of its Doric orders all differ considerably from the later canon, although all essential Doric features are present. Its ground plan of 8 by 17 columns, probably pseudoperipteral, is unusual.

=====Archaic Olympieion, Athens=====
Among the Doric temples, the [[Peisistratid]] [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Olympieion]] at [[Athens]] has a special position.&lt;ref&gt;Renate Tölle-Kastenbein: ''Das Olympieion in Athen''. Böhlau, Köln 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this building was never completed, its architect apparently attempted to adapt the Ionic ''dipteros''. Column drums built into the later foundations indicate that it was originally planned as a Doric temple. Nonetheless, its ground plan follows the Ionic examples of [[Samos]] so closely that it would be hard to reconcile such a solution with a Doric triglyph frieze. After the expulsion of [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] in 510 BC, work on this structure was stopped: [[Athenian democracy|Democratic Athens]] had no desire to continue a monument of [[tyrant|tyrannical]] self-aggrandisation.

====Classical period: canonisation====
Apart from this exception and some examples in the more experimental [[polis|poleis]] of [[Magna Graecia|Greater Greece]], the Classical Doric temple type remained the ''peripteros''. Its perfection was a priority of artistic endeavour throughout the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]].

=====Temple of Zeus, Olympia (460 BC)=====
[[File:Olympia - ruïne Zeustempel.jpg|thumb|Ruin of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].]]

The canonical solution was found fairly soon by the architect [[Libon (architect)|Libon]] of [[Elis]], who erected the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] around 460 BC. With its 6 × 13 columns or 5 × 12 intercolumniations, this temple was designed entirely rationally. Its column bays (axis to axis) measured {{convert|16|ft}}, a triglyph + metope {{convert|8|ft}}, a ''mutulus'' plus the adjacent space (''via'') {{convert|4|ft}}, the tile width of the marble roof was {{convert|2|ft}}. Its columns are powerful, with only a slight ''entasis''; the [[Molding (decorative)|echinus]] of the capitals is already nearly linear at 45°. All of the superstructure is affected by curvature. The ''cella'' measures exactly 3 × 9 column distances (axis to axis), its external wall faces are aligned with the axes of the adjacent columns.

=====Other canonical Classical temples=====
The Classical proportion, 6 × 13 columns, is taken up by numerous temples, e.g. the Temple of [[Apollo]] on [[Delos]] ({{circa|470 BC}}), the [[Temple of Hephaistos]] at [[Athens]] and the [[Sounion#Temple of Poseidon|temple of Poseidon]] on [[Cape Sounion]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Gruben: ''Die Tempel der Griechen''. Hirmer, München 2001 (5. edn.), p. 212-216.&lt;/ref&gt; A slight variation, with 6 × 12 columns or 5 × 11 intercolumniations occurs as frequently.

=====The Parthenon (450 BC)=====
[[File:Parthenon-top-view.svg|thumb|100px|right|Plan of the [[Parthenon]], note triple colonnade in the ''cella'' and pillared room at back.]] 
The [[Parthenon]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Cosmopoulos (ed.): ''The Parthenon and its sculptures''.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; maintains the same proportion at a larger scale of 8 × 17 columns, but follows the same principles. In spite of the eight columns on its front, the temple is a pure ''peripteros'', its external ''cella'' walls align with the axes of the 2nd and 7th columns. In other regards, the Parthenon is distinguished as an exceptional example among the mass of Greek ''peripteroi'' by many distinctive aesthetic solutions in detail. For example, the ''antae'' of ''pronaos'' [[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 35 Parthenon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]].]]and ''opisthodomos'' are shortened so as to form simple pillars. Instead of longer ''antae'', there are ''prostyle'' colonnades inside the ''peristasis'' on the front and back, reflecting Ionic habits. The execution of the ''naos'', with a western room containing four columns, is also exceptional. The Parthenon's [[Older Parthenon|Archaic predecessor]] already contained such a room. All measurements in the Parthenon are determined by the proportion 4:9. It determines column width to column distance, width to length of the stylobate, and of the ''naos'' without ''antae''. The temple's width to height up to the ''geison'' is determined by the reverse proportion 9:4, the same proportion squared, 81:16, determines temple length to height. All of this mathematical rigour is relaxed and loosened by the [[#Optical refinements|optical refinements]] mentioned above, which affect the whole building, from layer to layer, and element to element. 92 sculpted metopes decorate its triglyph frieze: [[centauromachy]], [[amazonomachy]] and [[gigantomachy]] are its themes. The external walls of the ''naos'' are crowned with a [[Parthenon Frieze|figural frieze]] surrounding the entire ''cella'' and depicting the [[Panathenaia|Panathenaic procession]] as well as the Assembly of the Gods. Large format figures decorate the pediments on the narrow sides. This conjunction of strict principles and elaborate refinements makes the [[Parthenon]] the paradigmatic [[Classical architecture|Classical]] temple. The [[Temple of Hephaistos]] at [[Athens]], erected shortly after the Parthenon, uses the same aesthetic and proportional principles, without adhering as closely to the 4:9 proportion.&lt;ref&gt;Homer A. Thompson &amp; Richard E. Wycherley : ''The Agora of Athens. The History, Shape and Uses of an ancient City Center''. The Athenian Agora. Vol 14, 1972, p. 140 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NemeaTemple.jpg|thumb|left|The temple of Zeus at [[Nemea]].]]

====Late Classical and Hellenistic: changing proportions====
In the 4th century BC, a few Doric temples were erected with 6 × 15 or 6 × 14 columns, probably referring to local Archaic predecessors, e.g. the Temple of Zeus in [[Nemea]]&lt;ref&gt;Frederick A. Cooper et al.: ''The Temple of Zeus at Nemea. Perspectives and Prospects''. Catalogue Benaki Museum Athens 1983. Athens 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Athena in [[Tegea]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Dugas; J. Berchamans &amp; M. Clemmensen: ''Le sanctuaire d'Aléa Athéna à Tégée au IVe siècle''. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Doric temples followed a tendency to become lighter in their superstructures. Columns became narrower, intercolumniations wider. This shows a growing adjustment to the proportion and weight of Ionic temples, mirrored by a progressive tendency among Ionic temples to become somewhat heavier. In the light of this mutual influence it is not surprising that in the late 4th century BC temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Nemea]], the front is emphasised by a ''pronaos'' two intercolumniations deep, while the ''opisthodomos'' is suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick A. Cooper e.a.: ''The Temple of Zeus at Nemea. Perspectives and Prospects''. Ausstellungskatalog Benaki Museum Athen 1983. Athen 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frontality is a key feature of Ionic temples. The emphasis on the ''pronaos'' already occurred in the slightly older temple of [[Athena]] at [[Tegea]], but there it was repeated in the ''opisthodomos''. Both temples continued the tendency towards more richly equipped interiors, in both cases with engaged or full columns of the Corinthian order.

The increasing reduction of the number of columns along the long sides, clearly visible on Ionic temples, is mirrored in Doric constructions. A small temple at Kournó has a peristasis of merely 6 × 7 columns, a stylobate of only 8 × 10 m and corners executed as pilasters towards the front.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Lauter: ''Die Architektur des Hellenismus''. Wiss. Buchges., Darmstadt 1986, S. 187. 195 Abb. 65. 66a.&lt;/ref&gt; The peristasis of monumental Doric temples is merely hinted at here; the function as a simple canopy for the shrine of the cult statue is clear.

====Doric temples in Magna Graecia====
[[File:Paestum BW 2013-05-17 15-01-57.jpg|thumb|Temple of Hera II at [[Paestum]].]]
Sicily and Southern Italy hardly participated in these developments. Here, most temple construction took place during the 6th and 5th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Mertens: ''Städte und Bauten der Westgriechen. Von der Kolonisationszeit bis zur Krise um 400 vor Christus''. Hirmer Verlag, München 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Western Greeks showed a pronounced tendency to develop unusual architectural solutions, more or less unthinkable in the mother poleis of their colonies. For example, there are two examples of temples with uneven column numbers at the front, Temple of Hera I at [[Paestum]]&lt;ref name="Dieter Mertens 1993"/&gt; and Temple of Apollo A at [[Metapontum]].&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Mertens: ''Städte und Bauten der Westgriechen. Von der Kolonisationszeit bis zur Krise um 400 vor Christus''. Hirmer Verlag, München 2006, p. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Both temples had fronts of nine columns. 
[[File:Selinunte-TempleG-Plan-bjs.png|thumb|left|Temple G, [[Selinus]], with well-defined ''adyton''.]]
The technical possibilities of the western Greeks, which had progressed beyond those in the motherland, permitted many deviations. For example, innovations regarding the construction of the entablature developed in the west allowed the spanning of much wider spaces than before, leading to some very deep ''peristaseis'' and broad ''naoi''. The ''peristasis'' often had a depth of two column distances, e.g. at Temple of Hera I, [[Paestum]], and temples C, F and G at [[Selinus]],&lt;ref&gt;Luca Giuliani: ''Die archaischen Metopen von Selinunt.'' Zabern, Mainz 1979; Dieter Mertens: ''Selinus I. Die Stadt und ihre Mauern''. Zabern, Mainz 2003; Dieter Mertens: ''Städte und Bauten der Westgriechen. Von der Kolonisationszeit bis zur Krise um 400 vor Christus''. Hirmer Verlag, München 2006, p. 117-124, 227-228, 231-235.&lt;/ref&gt; classifying them as ''pseudodipteroi''. The ''opisthodomos'' only played a subsidiary role, but did occur sometimes, e.g. at the temple of [[Poseidon]] in [[Paestum]]. Much more frequently, the temples included a separate room at the back end of the cella, entrance to which was usually forbidden, the ''[[adyton]]''. In some cases, the ''adyton'' was a free-standing structure within the cella, e.g. temple G in [[Selinus]]. If possible, columns inside the cella were avoided, allowing for open roof constructions of up to 13 m width.

[[File:Agrigent Model Zeus-Tempel.jpg|thumb|Model of the Olympieion at [[Akragas]].]]
The largest such structure was the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Agrigento)|Olympieion]] of [[Akragas]], an 8 × 17 columns ''peripteros'', but in many regards an absolutely "un-Greek" structure, equipped with details such as engaged, figural pillars ([[Telamon]]s), and a ''peristasis'' partially closed off by walls.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Mertens: ''Städte und Bauten der Westgriechen. Von der Kolonisationszeit bis zur Krise um 400 vor Christus''. Hirmer Verlag, München 2006, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; With external dimensions of 56 × 113 m, it was the largest Doric building ever to be completed. If the colonies showed remarkable independence and will to experiment in basic terms, they did so even more in terms of detail. For example, the lower surfaces of Doric ''geisa'' could be decorated with [[coffer]]s instead of ''[[Architectural glossary#mutule|mutuli]]''.

Although a strong tendency to emphasize the front, e.g. through the addition of ramps or stairs with up to eight steps (at [[Temple C (Selinus)|Temple C]] in [[Selinus]]), or a ''pronaos'' depth of 3.5 column distances (temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]])&lt;ref&gt;see Dieter Mertens: ''Städte und Bauten der Westgriechen. Von der Kolonisationszeit bis zur Krise um 400 vor Christus''. Hirmer Verlag, München 2006, p. 104-110.&lt;/ref&gt; had been become a key principle of design, this was relativised by the broadening of column distances on the long sides, e.g. Temple of Hera I at [[Paestum]]. Only in the colonies could the Doric corner conflict be ignored. If South Italian architects tried to solve it, they used a variety of solutions: broadening of the corner metopes or triglyphs, variation of column distance or metopes. In some cases, different solutions were used on the broad and narrow sides of the same building.

=== Ionic temples ===
[[File:Ionic order.svg|thumb|190px|Typical proportions of the [[Ionic order]].]]

====Origins====
For the early period, before the 6th century BC, the term Ionic temple can, at best, designate a temple in the [[Ionia|Ionian areas of settlement]]. No fragments of architecture belonging to the [[Ionic order]] have been found from this time. Nonetheless, some early temples in the area already indicate the rational system that was to characterise the Ionic system later on, e.g. the Heraion II of [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermann J. Kienast: ''Die rechteckigen Peristasenstützen am samischen Hekatompedos''. In: Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner (ed.): ''Säule und Gebälk. Zu Struktur und Wandlungsprozeß griechisch-römischer Architektur''. Bauforschungskolloquium in Berlin vom 16.-18. Juni 1994. Diskussionen zur Archäologischen Bauforschung. Bd. 6, 1996, p. 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even at an early point, the axes of the ''cella'' walls aligned with the column axes, whereas in Doric architecture, the external wall faces do so. The early temples also show no concern for the typical Doric feature of viewability from all sides, they regularly lack an ''opisthodomos''; the ''peripteros'' only became widespread in the area in the 4th century BC. In contrast, from an early point, Ionic temples stress the front by using double porticos. Elongated ''peristaseis'' became a determining element. At the same time, the Ionic temples were characterised by their tendency to use varied and richly decorated surfaces, as well as the widespread use of light-shade contrasts.

====Monumental Ionic temples====

=====The Heraion of Samos=====
As soon as the Ionic order becomes recognisable in temple architecture, it is increased to monumental sizes. The temple in the [[Heraion of Samos]], erected by [[Rhoecus|Rhoikos]] around 560 BC, is the first known ''dipteros'', with outside dimensions of 52 × 105 m.&lt;ref&gt;Christof Hendrich: ''Die Säulenordnung des ersten Dipteros von Samos''. Habelt, Bonn 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A double portico of 8 × 21 columns enclosed the ''naos'', the back even had ten columns. The front used differing column distances, with a wider central opening. In proportion to the bottom diameter, the columns reached three times the height of a Doric counterpart. 40 flutings enriched the complex surface structure of the column shafts. Samian column bases were decorated with a sequence of horizontal flutings, but in spite of this playfulness they weighed 1,500&amp;nbsp;kg a piece. The capitals of this structure were probably still entirely of wood, as was the entablature. Ionic volute capitals survive from the outer ''peristasis'' of the later rebuilding by [[Polycrates]]. The columns of the inner ''peristasis'' had leaf decoration and no volutes.

=====Cycladic Ionic=====
In the [[Cyclades]], there were early temples entirely built of marble. Volute capitals have not been found associated with these, but their marble entablatures belonged to the Ionic order.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Gruben: ''Naxos und Delos. Studien zur archaischen Architektur der Kykladen'': In: ''Jahrbuch des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts''. Vol. 112, 1997, p. 261–416.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Artemision of Ephesos=====
[[File:Plan Artemision Ephesus.PNG|thumb|right|190px|Plan of the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemision]] at [[Ephesos]].]]
Roughly beginning with the erection of the older [[Temple of Artemis|Artemision]] of [[Ephesos]] around 550 BC&lt;ref&gt;Anton Bammer: ''Das Heiligtum der Artemis von Ephesos''. 1984; Anton Bammer - Ulrike Muss: ''Das Artemision von Ephesos''. Sonderheft Antike Welt. Vol. 20, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; the quantity of archaeological remains of Ionic temples increases. The Artemision was planned as a ''dipteros'', its architect [[Theodorus of Samos|Theodoros]] had been one of the builders of the Samian Heraion. With a substructure of 55 × 115 m, the Artemision outscaled all precedents. Its ''cella'' was executed as unroofed internal [[peristyle]] courtyard, the so-called ''sekos''. The building was entirely of marble. The temple was considered as one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]], which may be justified, considering the efforts involved in its construction. [[File:Pelare från Artemision Efesos, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|75px|left|''Columna caelata'' from the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemision]].]] The columns stood on ephesian bases, 36 of them were decorated with life-sized friezes of human figures at the bottom of the shaft, the so-called ''columnae caelatae''.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Muss: ''Die Bauplastik des archaischen Artemisions von Ephesos.'' Sonderschriften des Österreichischen Archäologischen Institutes. Vol. 25. Wien 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The columns had between 40 and 48 flutings, some of them cut to alternate between a wider and a narrower fluting. The oldest marble architraves of Greek architecture, found at the Artemision, also spanned the widest distances ever achieved in pure stone. The middle architrave block was 8.74 m long and weighed 24 metric tons; it had to be lifted to its final position, 20 m above ground, with a system of pulleys. Like its precedents, the temple used differentiated column widths in the front, and had a higher number of columns at the back. According to ancient sources, [[Croesus|Kroisos]] was one of the sponsors. An inscription referring to his sponsorship was indeed found on one of the columns. The temple was burnt down by [[Herostratos]] in 356 BC and reerected soon thereafter. For the replacement, a ''[[crepidoma]]'' of ten or more steps was erected. Older Ionic temples normally lacked a specific visible substructure. This emphasised basis had to be balanced out be a heightened entablature, producing not only a visual contrast to, but also a major weight upon the slender columns.

=====Temple of Apollo at Didyma=====
[[File:Didyma.JPG|thumb|right|Remains of the temple of Apollo at [[Didyma]].]]
The temple of Apollo at [[Didyma]] near [[Miletus]], begun around 540 BC, was another ''dipteros'' with open internal courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schneider: ''Neue Funde vom archaischen Apollontempel in Didyma''. In: Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner (Hrsg.): ''Säule und Gebälk. Zu Struktur und Wandlungsprozeß griechisch-römischer Architektur''. Bauforschungskolloquium in Berlin vom 16.-18. Juni 1994. Diskussionen zur Archäologischen Bauforschung. Vol. 6, 1996, p. 78-83.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior was structured with powerful pilasters, their rhythm reflecting that of the external ''peristasis''. The columns, with 36 flutings, were executed as ''columnae caelatae'' with figural decoration, like those at Ephesos. Construction ceased around 500 BC, but was restarted in 331 BC and finally completed in the 2nd century BC. The enormous costs involved may have been one of the reasons for the long period of construction. The building was the first Ionic temple to follow the Attic tradition of uniform column distances, the frontal diffentiation was not practised any more.

=====Temple of Athena Polias, Priene=====
[[File:Priene.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of the temple of [[Athena]] at [[Priene]]]]
Ionic ''peripteroi'' were usually somewhat smaller and shorter in their dimensions than Doric ones. E.g., the temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Labraunda]] had only 6 × 8 columns,&lt;ref&gt;Pontus Hellström - Thomas Thieme: ''The temple of Zeus''. In: ''Labraunda - Swedish excavations and researches''. Vol 1, 3. Lund 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; the temple of [[Aphrodite]] in [[Samothrace]] only 6 × 9.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim Hakan Mert: ''Untersuchungen zur hellenistischen und kaiserzeitlichen Bauornamentik von Stratonikeia''. Köln 1999, p 261-301 ([http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=959749713&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=959749713.pdf Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409055617/http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=959749713&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=959749713.pdf |date=April 9, 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; The temple of [[Athena Polias]] at [[Priene]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank Rumscheid: ''Untersuchungen zur kleinasiatischen Bauornamentik des Hellenismus''. 1994, p 42–47.&lt;/ref&gt; already considered in antiquity as the classical example of an Ionic temple, has partially survived. It was the first monumental peripteros of Ionia, erected between 350 and 330 BC by [[Pythius of Priene|Pytheos]]. It is based on a {{convert|6|x|6|ft|m|adj=on}} grid (the exact dimensions of its plinths). The temple had 6 × 11 columns, i.e. a proportion of 5:10 or 1:2 intercolumnia. Walls and columns were aligned axially, according to Ionic tradition. The ''peristasis'' was of equal depth on all sides, eliminating the usual emphasis on the front, an ''opisthodomos'', integrated into the back of the cella, is the first proper example in Ionic architecture. The evident rational-mathematical aspect to the design suits Ionic Greek culture, with its strong tradition of [[natural philosophy]]. Pytheos was to be of major influence far beyond his lifetime. [[Hermogenes of Priene|Hermogenes]], who probably came from Priene, was a deserving successor{{According to whom|date=July 2012}} and achieved the final flourish of Ionic architecture around 200 BC.

=====The Artemision of Magnesia=====
[[File:Pergamonmuseum - Antikensammlung - Architektur 17.JPG|thumb|right|Capital from the Artemision of [[Magnesia on the Maeander]] ([[Berlin]], [[Pergamonmuseum]]).]]

One of the projects led by Hermogenes was the Artemision of [[Magnesia on the Maeander]], one of the first ''pseudodipteroi''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Humann: ''Magnesia am Mäander''. 1904, p 55; also see in: Wolfram Hoepfner &amp; Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner (Eds.): ''Hermogenes und die hochhellenistische Architektur.''

Juli 1988 im Rahmen des XIII. Internationalen Kongresses für Klassische Archäologie. Mainz 1990, p. 2 ff. 30 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; other early ''pseudodipteroi'' include the temple of Aphrodite at Messa on [[Lesbos]], belonging to the age of Hermogenes or earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Hakan Mert: ''Untersuchungen zur hellenistischen und kaiserzeitlichen Bauornamentik von Stratonikeia''. Köln 1999, p. 26 ([http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=959749713&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=959749713.pdf Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409055617/http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=959749713&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=959749713.pdf |date=April 9, 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; the temple of [[Apollo#Graeco–Roman epithets and cult titles|Apollo Sminthaios]] on [[Chryse Island|Chryse]]&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim Hakan Mert: ''Untersuchungen zur hellenistischen und kaiserzeitlichen Bauornamentik von Stratonikeia''.

Bd. I. Zabern, Mainz 1994, p. 141-143.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement of the ''pseudodipteros'', omitting the interior row of columns while maintaining a ''peristasis'' with the width of two column distances, produces a massively broadened portico, comparable to the contemporaneous hall architecture. The grid of the temple of Magnesia was based on a {{convert|12|x|12|ft|m|adj=on}} square. The ''peristasis'' was surrounded by 8 × 15 columns or 7 × 14 intercolumnia, i.e. a 1:2 proportion. The ''naos'' consisted of a ''pronaos'' of four column depths, a four columns ''cella'', and a 2 column ''opisthodomos''. Above the architrave of the ''peristasis'', there was a figural frieze of 137 m length, depicting the [[amazonomachy]]. Above it lay the [[dentil]], the Ionic ''geison'' and the ''sima''.

=====Attic Ionic=====
[[File:Erechtheum1.JPG|thumb|The [[Erechtheion]] at [[Athens]].]]

Although Athens and Attica were also ethnically Ionian, the Ionic order was of minor importance in this area. The [[Temple of Athena Nike|Temple of Nike Aptera]] on the Acropolis, a small amphiprostyle temple completed around 420 BC, with Ionic columns on plinthless Attic bases, a triple-layered architrave and a figural frieze, but without the typical Ionic [[dentil]], is notable. The east and north halls of the [[Erechtheion]], completed in 406 BC, follow the same succession of elements.

=====Epidauros=====
An innovative Ionic temple was that of [[Asklepios]] in [[Epidaurus]], one of the first of the ''pseudoperipteros'' type. This small ionic prostyle temple had engaged columns along the sides and back, the ''peristasis'' was thus reduced to a mere hint of a full portico facade.&lt;ref&gt;Temple L in Epidauros; see Hans Lauter: ''Die Architektur des Hellenismus''. Wiss. Buchges., Darmstadt 1986, pp. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Magna Graecia=====
There is very little evidence of Ionic temples in [[Magna Graecia]]. One of the few exceptions is the early Classical Temple D, an 8 × 20 columns peripteros, at [[Metapontum]]. Its architect combined the dentil, typical of Asia Minor, with an Attic frieze, thus proving that the colonies were quite capable of partaking in the developments of the motherland.&lt;ref&gt;See Dieter Mertens: ''Der ionische Tempel von Metapont''. In: ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts. Römische Abteilung''. Bd. 86, 1979, p. 103 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A small Ionic Hellenistic prostyle temple was found on the Poggetto San Nicola at [[Agrigento]].

=====Hellenistic India=====
[[File:A picture Texila by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|The Hellenistic temple with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns at [[Jandial]], [[Taxila]], [[Pakistan]].]]
{{Main|Jandial}}
A Ionic temple with a design very similar with that of a Greek Temple is known from [[Jandial]] in the northwestern [[Indian subcontinent]], today [[Pakistan]].  The Temple is considered as a semi-[[Classical Greece|Classical]] temple. Its design is essentially that of a [[Greek Temple]], with a [[Cella|naos]], [[pronaos]] and an [[opisthodomos]] at the back.&lt;ref&gt;"The Hellenistic Settlements in the East from Armenia and Mesopotamia to Bactria and India" Getzel M. Cohen, Univ of California Press, 2013, p.327 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=GtEkDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA327]&lt;/ref&gt; Two Ionic columns at the front are framed by two [[anta (architecture)|anta]] walls as in a Greek [[distyle in antis]] layout. It seems that the temple had an outside wall with windows or doorways, in a layout similar to that of a Greek encircling row of columns ([[peripteros|peripteral]] design).&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, p.492&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "the most [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] structure yet found on Indian soil".&lt;ref&gt;"The Dynastic Arts of the Kushans", John M. Rosenfield, University of California Press, 1 janv. 1967 p.129 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=udnBkQhzHH4C&amp;pg=PA129]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corinthian temples ===
[[File:Temple of Olympian Zeus - Olympieion.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Olympieion]] at [[Athens]].]]

====Beginnings====
The youngest of the three Classical Greek orders, the [[Corinthian order]] came to be used for the external design of Greek temples quite late. After it had proved its adequacy, e.g. on a [[mausoleum]] of at modern-day [[Belevi Mausoleum|Belevi]] (near [[Ephesos]]), it appears to have found increasing popularity in the 2nd half of the 3rd century BC. Early examples probably include the [[Serapeum]] of [[Alexandria]] and a temple at [[Hermopolis Magna]], both erected by [[Ptolemy III|Ptolemaios III]]. A small temple of Athena Limnastis at [[Messene]], definitely Corinthian, is only attested through drawings by early travellers and very scarce fragments. It probably dates to the late 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Schenk: ''Der korinthische Tempel bis zum Ende des Prinzipats des Augustus''. Internationale Archäologie 45, 1997, p. 16-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====

=====Hellenistic Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens=====
The first dateable and well-preserved presence of the Corinthian temple is the Hellenistic rebuilding of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Olympieion of Athens]], planned and started between 175 and 146 BC. This mighty ''dipteros'' with its 110 × 44 m substructure and 8 × 20 columns was to be one of the largest Corinthian temples ever. Donated by [[Antiochus IV]] Epiphanes, it combined all elements of the [[Ionic order|Asian/Ionic]] order with the Corinthian capital. Its Asian elements and its conception as a ''dipteros'' made the temple an exception in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;See Renate Tölle-Kastenbein: ''Das Olympieion in Athen''. Böhlau, Köln 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Olba=====
Around the middle of the 2nd century BC, a 6 × 12 columns Corinthian peripteros was built in [[Olba (ancient city)|Olba]]-Diokaisarea in [[Cilicia#Geography|Rugged Cilicia]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodora S. MacKay: ''Olba in Rough Cilicia''. 1968; Detlev Wannagat: ''Neue Forschungen in Diokaisareia / Uzuncaburç, Bericht über die Arbeiten 2001-2004''. In: ''Archäologischer Anzeiger''. 2005, p. 117-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Its columns, mostly still upright, stand on Attic bases without plinths, exceptional for the period. The 24 flutings of the columns are only indicated by facets in the lower third. Each of the Corinthian capitals is made of three separate parts, an exceptional form. The entablature of the temple was probably in the Doric order, as is suggested by fragments of ''mutuli'' scattered among the ruins. All of these details suggest an Alexandrian workshop, since [[Alexandria]] showed the greatest tendency to combine Doric entablatures with Corinthian capitals and to do without the plinth under Attic bases.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard Schaaf: ''Untersuchungen zu Gebäudestiftungen hellenistischer Zeit''. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Ralf Schenk: ''Der korinthische Tempel bis zum Ende des Prinzipats des Augustus''. Internationale Archäologie 45, 1997, p. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Detlev Wannagat: ''Zur Säulenordnung des Zeustempels von Olba-Diokaisareia''. In: ''Olba II''. First International Symposium on Cilician Archaeology, Mersin 1.-4.6. 1998, Mersin 1999, p. 355-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Temple of Hekate at Lagina=====
A further plan option is shown by the temple of [[Hekate]] at [[Lagina]], a small ''pseudoperipteros'' of 8 × 11 columns.&lt;ref&gt;See Ulrich Junghölter: ''Zur Komposition der Laginafriese und zur Deutung des Nordfrieses''. 1989; Frank Rumscheid: ''Untersuchungen zur kleinasiatischen Bauornamentik''. Bd. I, 1994,  p. 132 ff.; Ralf Schenk: ''Der korinthische Tempel bis zum Ende des Prinzipats des Augustus''. Internationale Archäologie 45, 1997, p. 28 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Its architectural members are entirely in keeping with the Asian/Ionic canon. Its distinctive feature, a rich figural frieze, makes this building, erected around 100 BC, an architectural gem. Further late Greek temples in the Corinthian order are known e.g. at [[Mylasa]]&lt;ref&gt;Walter Voigtländer in: Adolf Hoffmann; Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner; [[Wolfram Höpfner]] &amp; [[Gunnar Brands]] (eds.): ''Bautechnik der Antike''. Kolloquium Berlin 1990. Diskussionen zur Archäologischen Bauforschung. Bd. 5. 1991, p. 247-248; Ralf Schenk: ''Der korinthische Tempel bis zum Ende des Prinzipats des Augustus''. Internationale Archäologie 45, 1997, p. 37-39 (late 2nd century BC).&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the middle gymnasium terrace at [[Pergamon]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Schazmann: ''Das Gymnasium''. In: ''Altertümer von Pergamon''. Bd. VI. 1923, p. 40 ff.; Ralf Schenk: ''Der korinthische Tempel bis zum Ende des Prinzipats des Augustus''. Internationale Archäologie 45, 1997, p. 39-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Distinctive uses of Corinthian temples, influence====

[[File:Temple between hill symbols and elephant coin of the Pandyas Sri Lanka 1st century CE.jpg|thumb|[[Pandyan Kingdom]] coin depicting a temple between hill symbols and elephant, Pandyas, [[Sri Lanka]], 1st century CE.]]

The few Greek temples in the Corinthian order are almost always exceptional in form or ground plan and are initially usually an expression of royal patronage. The Corinthian order permitted a considerable increase of the material and technical effort invested in a building, which made its use attractive for the purposes of royals self-aggrandisement. The demise of the Hellenistic monarchies and the increasing power of Rome and her allies placed mercantile elites and sanctuary administrations in the positions of building sponsors. The construction of Corinthian temples became a typical expression of self-confidence and independence.&lt;ref&gt;See Ralf Schenk: ''Der korinthische Tempel bis zum Ende des Prinzipats des Augustus''. Internationale Archäologie 45, 1997, pp. 41–47.&lt;/ref&gt; As an element of [[Roman architecture]], the Corinthian temple came to be widely distributed in all of the Graeco-Roman world, especially in Asia Minor, until the late Imperial period.

==Surviving remains==
[[File:The temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae by Edward Dodwell.jpg|thumb|The [[Bassae#Temple_of_Apollo_Epikourios|temple of Apollo Epicurius]] at [[Bassae]] by [[Edward Dodwell]], 1821]]
{{main|List of Ancient Greek temples}}
Though extremely solidly built, apart from the roof, relatively few Greek temples have left very significant remains; these are often those which were converted to other uses such as churches or mosques. There are many where the platforms are reasonably complete, and some round drum elements of the columns, which were harder for later builders to re-use. The somewhat controversial practice of [[anastylosis]], or re-erecting fallen materials, has sometimes been used. The rectangular wall blocks have usually been carried off for re-use, and some buildings have been destroyed or weakened merely to get the bronze pins linking blocks.  Marble sculpture has often been removed to make [[Lime (material)|lime]] for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], and any that has survived has usually been removed to a museum, not always a local one. 

The most complete remains are concentrated in Athens and southern Italy; several are described in more detail above, under their orders. Athens has the Parthenon and the even better preserved Doric [[Temple of Hephaestus]], both once churches, as well two small temples on the Acropolis and a corner of the large Corinthian [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]].  The small [[Bassae#Temple_of_Apollo_Epikourios|temple of Apollo Epicurius]] at [[Bassae]] survived in a rural location with most of its columns and main architrave blocks in place, amid a jumble of fallen stone.  From this British antiquaries extracted the [[Bassae Frieze]] in 1812, which was soon in the [[British Museum]]. 

In Italy [[Paestum]], some way south of Naples near what was once the northern limit of [[Magna Graecia]] (Greek Italy), has three early Doric temples in a row, amid the mostly Roman ruins of the city.  In [[Sicily]] the [[Valle dei Templi]] near [[Agrigento]] has an even larger group, with the main structure of the [[Temple of Concordia, Agrigento|Temple of Concordia]] especially well-preserved.  Along the coast [[Selinunte]] was destroyed about 250 BC by the [[Carthaginians]] and has the tumbled ruins of five temples, of which [[Temple E (Selinus)|one has been rebuilt]] from the original material.  Not far away, [[Segesta]] has a single Doric temple whose main structure is largely intact.

The '''antidoron''' ({{Lang-el|Ἀντίδωρον}}, ''{{Transl|el|Antídōron}}'') is ordinary leavened bread which is blessed but not [[consecrated]] and distributed in [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] that use the [[Byzantine Rite]]. It comes from the remains of the [[loaf|loaves]] of bread ([[prosphora]]) from which portions are cut for [[consecration]] as the [[Eucharist]] during the [[Divine Liturgy]]. The word Ἀντίδωρον means "instead of gifts".

==Practice==

===Eastern Orthodox Christianity===
[[File:Dues5Sept21 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The faithful preparing to receive [[Holy Communion]]. In the foreground are wine and antidoron which the communicants will partake of after receiving the [[Eucharist|Body and Blood of Christ]].]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], blessed antidoron is distributed after every Divine Liturgy. During the [[Prothesis (liturgy)|Prothesis]] (Liturgy of Preparation, at which the wine and bread are prepared on the [[Table of Oblation]]), the priest will bless each prosphoron as he takes it up to remove particles and place them on the [[diskos]] (paten). The remainder of the prosphora is cut into fragments and kept aside in a bowl or [[salver]]. In some jurisdictions it is the custom at the end of the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] for the [[altar server]] to hand the bowl of antidoron to the [[priest]] who will make the [[Sign of the Cross]] with it over the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] and diskos during the hymn, ''[[It is Truly Meet]]''.

Since the Eucharist is essentially a meal, in the [[Russian Orthodox]] tradition some of the antidoron is placed on a tray together with ordinary wine and is consumed by the communicants immediately after they receive Holy Communion.

At the conclusion of the liturgy, the antidoron is distributed to the faithful as they come up to kiss the [[blessing cross]]. Antidoron is not considered a sacrament and is explicitly not consecrated during the Eucharist. Therefore, non-Orthodox present at the liturgy, who are not admitted to partake of the consecrated bread and wine, are often encouraged to receive the antidoron as an expression of Christian fellowship and love.

Because the antidoron is blessed, some jurisdictions and customs mandate that it be consumed only after fasting. The canonical regulations of the Eastern Orthodox Church state that the antidoron should be consumed before leaving the church, and that it should not be distributed to unbelievers or to persons undergoing [[penance]] before absolution, but variances are allowed. For instance, it is the custom in many Orthodox parishes to distribute the antidoron to visitors and catechumens as a sign of fellowship, or to bring a few pieces home to a relative who could not attend the liturgy.

On [[Bright Saturday]] in place of (or in addition to) the normal antidoron, the [[Paschal Artos]] is cut up and distributed at the end of the liturgy.

===Eastern Catholicism===
In the [[Greek Catholic|Greek Catholic (Byzantine)]] churches of [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]], the antidoron is presently given only on rare occasions during the year, chiefly on the [[Bright Saturday]] (Saturday in [[Easter week]]); while among the [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church|Greek (Roman) Catholics]] of [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]] it is usually given only on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], the [[Feast of the Assumption]], that of Saint Nicolas of Myra, and at certain week-day services in [[Lent]]; although according to some local customs it is given on other days. In other Eastern Catholic churches of the Byzantine Rite it is distributed as in the Orthodox churches.

==History==
The earliest historical reference to this custom are in fact found in the Western Church. It is mentioned in the 118th letter of St. Augustine to Januarius (now known as the 54th letter in the new order), and in the canons of a local council in [[Gaul]] in the seventh century. Originally it was a substitute, or [[solatium]] for such of the faithful as were not properly prepared to receive Holy Communion or were unable to get to the eucharistic sacrifice. If they could not partake of the sacrament, for instance because of not having fulfilled the obligatory fast or for being in a state of [[mortal sin]], they had the consolation of partaking of the non-consecrated liturgical bread which had been blessed and from which the portions for the consecration had been taken.

In the Eastern Church, mention of the antidoron began to appear about the ninth and tenth centuries. Germanus of Constantinople is the earliest Eastern author to mention it{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} in his treatise, "The Explanation of the Liturgy", about the ninth century. Subsequent to him many writers of the Eastern Church ([[Theodore Balsamon|Balsamon]], Colina, Pachemeros) have written on the custom of giving the antidoron.

While the practice of blessing and distributing antidoron still continues in the East, the practice was largely abandoned by the Western Church, and now only survives in the Roman Rite in the ''{{Lang|fr|pain bénit}}'' given in French churches and cathedrals after High Mass, as well as in certain churches of Québec, and occasionally in Italy, on certain feasts (e.g. of [[Saint Hubert]], [[Saint Anthony of Padua]]). A similar custom also survives among the [[Syria]]n Christians ([[Christians of Saint Thomas]]) of the Malabar coast in India.

Baptists do not have a central governing authority, and '''Baptist beliefs''' are not completely consistent from one [[Baptists|Baptist]] church to another. However, Baptists do hold some common beliefs among almost all Baptist churches.

These would include beliefs about [[God in Christianity|one God]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], the [[impeccability]], [[miracles of Jesus|miracles]], [[substitutionary atonement|vicarious atoning]] [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]], burial and bodily [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection of Christ]], the need for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] (although the understanding of means for achieving it may differ at times), [[Grace in Christianity|divine grace]], the [[Christian Church|Church]], the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Kingdom of God]], [[Christian eschatology|last things]] ([[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth; the dead will be raised; and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness), [[evangelism]] and [[Christian mission|mission]]s.

== Practices ==
Baptists practice ''[[believer's baptism]]'' and the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] (communion) as the two acts of faith-obedience to the example and commands given by Christ for Christians (Matthew 28:19; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26). Most Baptists call them "[[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinances]]" (meaning "obedience to a command that Christ has given us")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=DsxBo9jtAE8C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=A Disparity in Doctrine and Theology: Baptist Versus Mormon Doctrine and Theology | publisher=[[WestBow Press]] | author=Roberts, Dr. E.

== Varying views ==
Most Baptists hold their services and worship on [[Sabbatarianism|Sunday]]. However, there is a group known as the [[Seventh Day Baptists]] whose origins are derived from [[Anabaptism]] and the pre-Reformation. Seventh Day Baptists gather and worship on the seventh day of the week on Saturday. A large portion of Seventh Day Baptists adopted the teachings of the Sabbath, which led to the formation of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/223853668|title=Baptist theology : a four-century study|last=Leo.|first=Garrett, James|date=2009|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=9780881461299|edition= 1st|location=Macon, Ga.|oclc=223853668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baptists are also viewed as the descendants of the [[Puritans]] who were shaped by the Anabaptists, thus the Baptist religion were considered an outcome of the [[Reformation]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In the early 17th century, those individuals who called themselves Baptists broke apart from the Church of England.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Some notable Puritan separatists included [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] and [[Thomas Helwys]] who were acknowledged as key founders of the Baptist denomination.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Furthermore, some Baptists (notably Landmarkians) hold to a belief in perpetuity, which embraces the notion that the Baptist belief existed since the time of Christ until today as the Church of Christ founded in Jerusalem was Baptist. Those who believe in perpetuity view the Baptist belief as not being a critical aspect of the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Behistun Inscription''' (also '''Bisotun''', '''Bistun''' or '''Bisutun'''; {{lang-fa|بیستون}}, [[Old Persian]]: '''Bagastana''', meaning "the place of god") is a multilingual inscription and large [[rock relief]] on a cliff at [[Mount Behistun]] in the [[Kermanshah Province]] of [[Iran]], near the city of [[Kermanshah]] in western [[Iran]]. It was crucial to the decipherment of [[cuneiform script]].

Authored by [[Darius the Great]] sometime between his coronation as king of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in the summer of 522 BC and his death in autumn of 486 BC, the inscription begins with a brief autobiography of Darius, including his ancestry and lineage. Later in the inscription, Darius provides a lengthy sequence of events following the deaths of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cambyses II]] in which he fought nineteen battles in a period of one year (ending in December 521 BC) to put down multiple rebellions throughout the Persian Empire.  The inscription states in detail that the rebellions, which had resulted from the deaths of Cyrus the Great and his son Cambyses II, were orchestrated by several impostors and their co-conspirators in various cities throughout the empire, each of whom falsely proclaimed kinghood during the upheaval following Cyrus's death.

Darius the Great proclaimed himself victorious in all battles during the period of upheaval, attributing his success to the "grace of [[Ahura Mazda]]". The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different [[cuneiform script]] languages: [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] (a variety of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]). The inscription is to [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] what the [[Rosetta Stone]] is to [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s: the document most crucial in the [[decipherment]] of a previously lost [[writing system|script]].

The inscription is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;metres high by 25&amp;nbsp;metres wide and 100&amp;nbsp;metres up a [[limestone]] cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of [[Babylonia]] and [[Medes|Media]] ([[Babylon]] and [[Ecbatana]], respectively). The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns, and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of [[Darius the Great|Darius I, the Great]], holding a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him.  The supine figure is reputed to be the pretender [[Gaumata]].  Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and nine one-meter figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples. A  [[Faravahar]] floats above, giving its blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was Darius's beard, which is a separate block of stone attached with [[iron]] pins and [[lead]].

==History==
[[File:BehistunRoute.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The route up to the inscription]]

After the fall of the Persian Empire's [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] and its successors, and the lapse of Old Persian cuneiform writing into disuse, the nature of the inscription was forgotten, and fanciful explanations became the norm. For centuries, instead of being attributed to Darius I, the Great, it was believed to be from the reign of [[Khosrau II]] of [[Persia]]—one of the last [[Sassanid]] kings, who lived over 1000 years after the time of Darius I.

The inscription is mentioned by [[Ctesias|Ctesias of Cnidus]], who noted its existence some time around 400 BC and mentioned a well and a garden beneath the inscription. He incorrectly concluded that the inscription had been dedicated "by Queen [[Semiramis of Babylon]] to [[Zeus]]". [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] also mentions it and includes a description of some of the long-lost ancillary monuments at the base of the cliff, including an altar to "[[Herakles]]". What has been recovered of them, including a statue dedicated in 148 BC, is consistent with Tacitus's description. [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] also writes of "Bagistanon" and claims it was inscribed by Semiramis.

A legend began around [[Mount Behistun]] (Bisotun), as written about by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet and writer]] [[Ferdowsi]] in his ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (''Book of Kings'') {{c.|lk=no|1000}}, about a man named [[Farhad]], who was a lover of King Khosrow's wife, [[Shirin]]. The legend states that, exiled for his transgression, Farhad was given the task of cutting away the mountain to find water; if he succeeded, he would be given permission to marry Shirin. After many years and the removal of half the mountain, he did find water, but was informed by Khosrow that Shirin had died. He went mad, threw his axe down the hill, kissed the ground and died. It is told in the book of [[Khosrow and Shirin]] that his axe was made out of a pomegranate tree, and, where he threw the axe, a pomegranate tree grew with fruit that would cure the ill. Shirin was not dead, according to the story, and mourned upon hearing the news.

In 1598, the [[England|Englishman]] [[Robert Sherley]] saw the inscription during a diplomatic mission to [[Iran|Persia]] on behalf of [[Austria]], and brought it to the attention of Western European scholars. His party incorrectly came to the conclusion that it was Christian in origin.&lt;ref&gt;E. Denison Ross, The Broadway Travellers: Sir Anthony Sherley and his Persian Adventure, Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-34486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; French General Gardanne thought it showed "Christ and his [[twelve apostles]]", and [[Robert Ker Porter|Sir Robert Ker Porter]] thought it represented the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] and [[Shalmaneser I|Shalmaneser of Assyria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/travelsingeorgia02port/travelsingeorgia02port.pdf] Robert Ker Porter, Travels in Georgia, Persia, Armenia, ancient Babylonia, &amp;c. &amp;c. : during the years 1817, 1818, 1819, and 1820, volume 2, Longman, 1821&lt;/ref&gt; Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]] visited the inscription in the course of a pilgrimage in around 1621.

[[File:Aramaic translation of the behistun inscripton.png|thumb|330px|[[Papyrus]] with an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] translation of the Behistun inscription's text.]]

German surveyor [[Carsten Niebuhr]] visited in around 1764 for [[Frederick V of Denmark]], publishing a copy of the inscription in the account of his journeys in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Niebuhr, Reisebeschreibung von Arabien und anderen umliegenden Ländern, 2 volumes, 1774 and 1778&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr's transcriptions were used by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] and others in their efforts to decipher the [[Old Persian cuneiform]] script. Grotefend had deciphered ten of the 37 symbols of Old Persian by 1802, after realizing that unlike the Semitic cuneiform scripts, Old Persian text is alphabetic and each word is separated by a vertical slanted symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html |title=Old Persian |publisher=Ancient Scripts |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418053701/http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html| archivedate= 18 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Persian text was copied and deciphered before recovery and copying of the Elamite and Babylonian inscriptions had even been attempted, which proved to be a good deciphering strategy, since Old Persian script was easier to study due to its alphabetic nature and because the language it represents had naturally evolved via [[Middle Persian]] to the living modern [[Persian language]] dialects, and was also related to the [[Avestan]] language, used in the [[Zoroastrian]] book the ''[[Avesta]]''.

In 1835, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]], an officer of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] army assigned to the forces of the [[Shah]] of Iran, began studying the inscription in earnest. As the town of Bisotun's name was anglicized as "Behistun" at this time, the monument became known as the "Behistun Inscription". Despite its relative inaccessibility, Rawlinson was able to scale the cliff with the help of a local boy and copy the Old Persian inscription. The Elamite was across a chasm, and the Babylonian four meters above; both were beyond easy reach and were left for later.

With the Persian text, and with about a third of the [[syllabary]] made available to him by the work of [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]], Rawlinson set to work on deciphering the text. The first section of this text contained a list of the same Persian kings found in [[Herodotus]] but in their original Persian forms as opposed to Herodotus's Greek [[transliteration]]s; for example Darius is given as the original ''Dâryavuš'' instead of the Hellenized ''Δαρειος''. By matching the names and the characters, Rawlinson deciphered the type of cuneiform used for Old Persian by 1838 and presented his results to the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in [[London]] and the [[Société Asiatique]] in [[Paris]].

In the interim, Rawlinson spent a brief tour of duty in [[Afghanistan]], returning to the site in 1843. He first crossed a chasm between the Persian and Elamite scripts by bridging the gap with planks, subsequently copying the Elamite inscription. He found an enterprising local boy to climb up a crack in the cliff and suspend ropes across the Babylonian writing, so that [[papier-mâché]] casts of the inscriptions could be taken. Rawlinson, along with several other scholars, most notably [[Edward Hincks]], [[Julius Oppert]], [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], and [[Edwin Norris]], either working separately or in collaboration, eventually deciphered these inscriptions, leading eventually to the ability to read them completely.

The translation of the Old Persian sections of the Behistun Inscription paved the way to the subsequent ability to decipher the Elamite and Babylonian parts of the text, which greatly promoted the development of modern [[Assyriology]].

==Later research and activity==
[[File:BehistunInscriptiondetail.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Close-up of the inscription showing damage]]

The site was visited by the American linguist [[A. V. Williams Jackson]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Williams Jackson, "The Great Behistun Rock and Some Results of a Re-Examination of the Old Persian Inscriptions on It", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', vol. 24, pp. 77–95, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Later expeditions, in 1904 sponsored by the [[British Museum]] and led by [[Leonard William King]] and [[Reginald Campbell Thompson]] and in 1948 by George G. Cameron of the [[University of Michigan]], obtained photographs, casts and more accurate transcriptions of the texts, including passages that were not copied by Rawlinson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/sculpturesinscri00brituoft/sculpturesinscri00brituoft.pdf] W. King and R. C. Thompson, The sculptures and inscription of Darius the Great on the Rock of Behistûn in Persia: a new collation of the Persian, Susian and Babylonian texts, Longmans, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George G. Cameron, The Old Persian Text of the Bisitun Inscription, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 47–54, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George G. Cameron, The Elamite Version of the Bisitun Inscriptions, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 59–68, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Benedict and Elizabeth von Voigtlander, Darius' Bisitun Inscription, Babylonian Version, Lines 1–29, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 1–10, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;
It also became apparent that rainwater had dissolved some areas of the limestone in which the text was inscribed, while leaving new deposits of limestone over other areas, covering the text.

In 1938, the inscription became of interest to the [[Nazi German]] [[think tank]] [[Ahnenerbe]], although research plans were cancelled due to the onset of World War II.

The monument later suffered some damage from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers using it for target practice in [[World War II]], and during the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ancientstandard.com/2011/03/30/the-behistun-inscription-the-iranian-rosetta-stone/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://atlantisonline.smfforfree2.com/index.php?topic=2799.5;wap2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Iranian archeologists began the documentation and assessment of damages to the site incurred during the 20th century. Malieh Mehdiabadi, who was [[project manager]] for the effort, described a [[Photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] process by which two-dimensional photos were taken of the inscriptions using two cameras and later transmuted into 3-D images.&lt;ref name="chnpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=2589 |title=Documentation of Behistun Inscription Nearly Complete |publisher=Chnpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918093441/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=2589 |archivedate=2011-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Iranian archaeologists have been undertaking conservation works.  The site became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jul/1130.html |title=Iran's Bisotoon Historical Site Registered in World Heritage List |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-07-13 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Bisotun Cultural Heritage Center organized an international effort to re-examine the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/98233-intl-experts-to-reread-bisotun-inscriptions |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529044243/http://www.tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/98233-intl-experts-to-reread-bisotun-inscriptions |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }} Intl. experts to reread Bisotun inscriptions, Tehran Times, May 27, 2012{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is led Elias Ng, the Spiritual Leader and Head Administrator of the Bell Church.

==History==
The Bell Church was founded on August 4, 1960 in [[Benguet]]&lt;ref name="pdikeeper"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malanes|first1=Maurice|title=Keeper of Chinese tradition|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer/20101013/282999691193658|accessdate=22 May 2018|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a Chinese immigrants from [[Guangzhou|Canton, China]] (now [[Guangzhou]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banos|first1=Mike|title=Bell Church, Oro LGU pray for peace and prosperity of all|url=https://issuu.com/sudaria_publications/docs/mdn_february_19_5f1c5597399e6c|accessdate=22 May 2018|work=Mindanao Daily|date=19 February 2018|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by Ng Pee.&lt;ref name="belltolls"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caluza|first1=Desiree|title=Benguet bell tolls for peace seekers|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/570753/benguet-bell-tolls-for-peace-seekers|accessdate=22 May 2018|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were devotees of the Buddhist monk [[Ji Gong]].&lt;ref name="tancb"/&gt;

In 1954, he first preached in a dining hall of a restaurant but eventually transferred the place of worship to his residence along the Kilometer 6 mark in [[La Trinidad, Benguet|La Trinidad]], [[Benguet]] due to increasing number of devotees. Then known as the "Chinese Buddhist Temple", the temple's membership is composed of primarily ethnic Chinese farmers. Membership continued to grow that the temple had to moved again to its present site along the Kilometer 3 mark in the 1960s and has since then became known as the "Bell Church". With support from the local Chinese community, the house in the current site was converted to a temple.&lt;ref name="belltolls"/&gt;

==Belief==
The Bell Church considers itself as a religion with [[Religious pluralism|ecumenical]] and [[interfaith]] in [[Religious orientation|orientation]].&lt;ref name="pdikeeper"/&gt;

===Patron saints===
The Bell Church has five patron saints which represents the religions of Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Confucianism. Its members pray to these saints. According to the group the patron saints are an acknowledgement that the Bell Church temples are open to prayers made by anyone.&lt;ref name=beyondprosperity&gt;{{cite news|last1=Viguella|first1=Abigail|title=Beyond prosperity and good luck|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/sunstar-cagayan-de-oro/20170129/281496456005768|accessdate=22 May 2018|work=Sun Star Cagayan de Oro|date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These faiths are major religions in [[Greater China|China]].&lt;ref name="pdikeeper"/&gt;

===Philosophy and practice===
The philosophy of the group revolves around the bell which it says represents unity. The group believes that religions are "only differences in beliefs" and advocates people regardless of religion to live in harmony by disregarding these difference.&lt;ref name=beyondprosperity/&gt;

One of the basic principles of the Bell Church is the [[karma|law of karma]] and members and devotees are urged to "live morally upright, always help others in need, attend Mass, practice other virtues" which is said to bring good karma.&lt;ref name="pdikeeper"/&gt;

==Chapters==
The Bell Church organization designated its temple in Benguet as its headquarters. It later established other temples or chapters in other parts of the Philippines and abroad. They maintain chapters in [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[Dagupan]], [[La Loma, Quezon City|La Loma (Quezon City)]], [[Manila]], [[Dumaguete]], [[Davao City]], [[Cotabato City]], and [[Zamboanga City]].

'''Bhalki''' is a City and [[Taluka]] in [[Bidar district]] in the state of [[Karnataka]], [[India]].

==History==
First mention of the town was made as "Bhallunke" in the vachanas of 12th century sharanas{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The sharana Kumbara Gundaiah was from Bhalki who was part of Bhakthi movement{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

===The 1857 War of Independence===

&lt;ref name="jung_bahadur_the_hindu"&gt;{{cite news
  | title = Bidar's forgotten hero
  | publisher = The Hindu
  | date = 2006-08-17
  | url =http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/17/stories/2006011705170200.htm
  | accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bhalki's importance in the 1857 war is played out at the very end of the war, when one of [[Tatya Tope]]'s followers is arrested and tried by the [[Nizam]], in 1867.  This person was Madho Rao, alias Rama Rao, the nephew of Shrimant [[Chattrapati Shahu|Shahu]] [[Chatrapati]], the Maharaja of [[Satara State|Satara]]. He was also known as ''Jung Bahadur'', as referred by Sir Richard Temple in his diaries.  During a search, officials discovered that Jung Bahadur carried several papers in English and Marathi, translation of a deed of agreement and a seal saying he was the `Chatrapati of Satara'.

Jung Bahadur raised an army of over 1500 people in and around the forests of Bhalki, spending up to 20,000 [[Rupee]]s. and gave 200 Rupees to his follower Deva Rao to recruit 500 soldiers. A [[jamadar]] got a monthly salary of 40 Rupees, a [[sepoy]] 30 Rupees and a [[sowar|sawar]] 10 Rupees.  He recruited soldiers in the villages issuing them ''[[Kaulnama]]s'' or appointment letters, in which he asked young men to join him in the task of ''"murdering the British and regaining the lost glory of the Royal family of Satara"''. Jung Bahadur and his followers moved on foot from village to village, disguised as [[mendicants]].

He caused great damage to the British government, and captured a [[cantonment]] area called Ashti in [[Bidar district]]. He and his main followers were eventually arrested by two officers of the British resident in [[Hyderabad state]]. Their trial however, was conducted by the Nizam’s courts. The [[Magistrate]] of the criminal court, Moulvi Nasrullah Khan, completed the trial in less than a month, charging them with ''"trying to bring about [[insurrection]] against the empire"''.

Jung Bahadur, Bheem Rao, Balakishtayya and Vithoba were sentenced to [[Penal transportation|transportation to life]]. Jung Bahadur is said to have spent his last days in the [[Hyderabad prison]], where he died. His followers Yeshwanta and Jehangir Ali were sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment. Others like Eshwanna Naikwadi and Vir Peddappa were given minor punishments.

: Located at the edge the old Bhalki town, it hosts a variety of buildings, including the Satyaniketan School, residences, Kumbheshwar ([[Ganesh]]) Temple, etc.  This fort is locally known as the 'Gadi' (from ''gad'', meaning a fort in [[Kannada]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]]). Believed to be built between 1820-1850 by Ramachandra Jadhav and Dhanaji Jadhav, satraps of Jang Bahadur, the black [[basalt]] stone and [[lime mortar]] seven metre tall fort covers around 18,000 square metres (five acres). The Kumbheshwar ([[Ganesh]]) temple is inside the fort. There are open wells inside the fort and a small pond outside it, though all of them have dried up.  The Bidar district administration has proposed a plan to preserve and develop the fort, at a proposed cost of Rs.1.25 crores.

[[File:NIN-beltu Cuneiform.svg|thumb|Cuneiform character ''beltu'' / ''belit'']]
'''Bêlit''' is a form of the [[Akkadian language]] word ''beltu'' or ''beltum'' (meaning "lady", "mistress") as used in noun compounds; it appears in titles of goddesses, such as ''bêlit-ili'' "lady of the gods", an Akkadian title of [[Ninhursag]]. The word ''bêlit'' appears in Greek form as '''Beltis''' (Βελτις), considered to be the name of the wife of the god [[Bel (mythology)|Bêl]].

'''''Calea ternifolia''''' ([[synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]] ''Calea zacatechichi'')&lt;ref name=grin&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a species of flowering plant in the aster family, [[Asteraceae]]. It is native to [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=grin/&gt; Its [[English language]] common names include '''bitter-grass''', '''Mexican calea''',&lt;ref name=grin/&gt; and '''dream herb'''.&lt;ref name=poland&gt;Simonienko, K., et al. (2013). [http://www.psychiatriapolska.pl/uploads/images/PP_3_2013/Eng_ver_Simonienko.pdf Psychoactive plant species &amp;ndash; actual list of plants prohibited in Poland.] ''Psychiatria Polska'' XLVII(3), 499–508.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in [[traditional medicine]] and ritual in its native range.&lt;ref name=fer&gt;Ferraz, A., et al. (2009). [http://www.latamjpharm.org/trabajos/28/6/LAJOP_28_6_1_8_O9FZ3D7A29.pdf Pharmacological and genotoxic evaluation of ''Calea clematidea'' and ''Calea uniflora''.] ''Latin American Journal of Pharmacy'' 28(6), 858-62.[http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/7846]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
In Mexico the plant is used as an [[herbalism|herbal remedy]] for [[dysentery]] and [[fever]].&lt;ref name=fer/&gt; The [[Zoque people|Zoque Popoluca people]] call the plant ''tam huñi'' ("bitter gum") and use it to treat [[diarrhea]] and [[asthma]], and the [[Mixe people]] know it as ''poop taam ujts'' ("white bitter herb") and use it for stomachache and fever.&lt;ref&gt;Leonti, M., et al. (2003). [http://www.wlbcenter.org/drawer/journalclub/leonti%20sticher%20and%20heinrich%202003%20(2).pdf Antiquity of medicinal plant usage in two Macro-Mayan ethnic groups (Mexico).] ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' 88(2), 119-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oaxaca Chontal people|Chontal people]] of [[Oaxaca]] reportedly use the plant, known locally as ''thle-pela-kano'', during [[divination]]. Isolated reports describe rituals that involve smoking a plant believed to be this species, drinking it as a [[tea]], and placing it under a [[pillow]] to induce divinatory dreams due to its properties as an [[oneirogen]]. ''Zacatechichi'', the former [[Botanical name|species name]], is a [[Nahuatl]] word meaning "bitter grass".&lt;ref&gt;Díaz, J. L. (1979). [https://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&amp;ID=7724&amp;DocPartID=6837 Ethnopharmacology and taxonomy of Mexican psychodysleptic plants.] ''J Psychedelic Drugs'' 11(1-2), 71–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Users take the plant to help them remember their dreams;&lt;ref name=poland/&gt; known [[side effect]]s include nausea and vomiting related to the taste and mild-to-severe allergic reaction.

While quite bitter if brewed in hot water, the bitterness can be considerably masked by brewing with [[Osmanthus fragrans|Osmanthus flowers]], which have a compatible scent profile.

==Chemical composition==
[[Image:Calea ternifolia.jpg|thumb|right|Cultivated specimen]]
Chemical compounds isolated from this species include [[flavones]]&lt;ref&gt;Mariano, M. V., et al. (1987). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942200838819 Thymol derivatives from ''Calea nelsonii''.] ''Phytochemistry'' 26(9), 2577-79.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[acacetin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mayagoitia, L., et al.

==Legal status==
While it is not a controlled substance under federal law in the [[United States]], some states have considered it individually. [[Louisiana State Act 159]] specifies that it is illegal to possess if it is intended for human consumption, but not if they are intended for [[ornamental plant|ornamental]] or landscaping use. [[Tennessee]] proposed a bill that would have made this and many other plants classified as hallucinogenic illegal, but when the bill was passed only ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' was banned.&lt;ref name=ero&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/plants/calea_zacatechichi/calea_zacatechichi_law.shtml ''Calea zacatechichi'' Legal Status] Erowid.org.

It offers a Certificate in [[Swedenborg]]ian Studies and a Certificate in Swedenborgian Ministry Studies.  It also functions as a think-tank for Swedenborgian studies globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://css.gtu.edu/|title=Center for Swedenborgian Studies - Center for Swedenborgian Studies|website=css.gtu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Swedenborgian Studies or CSS (formerly called New Church Theological School or NCTS and also previously known as Swedenborgian House of Studies) is the theological training institution for the [[Swedenborgian Church of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gtu.edu/centers/css|title=Center for Swedenborgian Studies (CSS)|last=T324Admin|date=2017-08-11|work=Graduate Theological Union|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the School==
The New Church Theological School (NCTS) was located on the northern edge of Harvard College's campus in Cambridge, MA.  In the mid 1960s it sold its building to Harvard University (for the Graduate School of Design) and relocated to 48 Sargent Street in Newton, MA.  While it was housed in Newton, the school was known as the "Swedenborg School of Religion".  After 35 years, the school relocated to the campus of [[Pacific School of Religion]] (PSR).  From 2001-2015, the NCTS (formerly dba Swedenborg School of Religion) partnered with PSR.

In 2015 the school was renamed the Center for Swedenborgian Studies and it affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union (GTU).  It continues to be physically located at and share faculty with PSR and PSR itself is one of the long-time member schools of the GTU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gtu.edu/50/timeline-history|title=A Timeline of the GTU's First 50 Years|last=T324Admin|date=2012-07-11|work=Graduate Theological Union|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CSS also offers studies in New Religious Movements, Western esotericism, and mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gtu.edu/centers/css|title=Center for Swedenborgian Studies (CSS)|last=T324Admin|date=2017-08-11|work=Graduate Theological Union|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certifications and Programs==
One of the reasons the school physically moved to PSR/GTU was that it could then partner locally with the well-established schools of the [[Graduate Theological Union|GTU]] that offered myriad courses and degrees especially including MDiv (Masters of Divinity) degrees.  However the CSS also offers distance learning options allowing students to attend accredited schools throughout North America for academic and professional certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://css.gtu.edu/distance-learning/|title=Learning Options - Center for Swedenborgian Studies|website=css.gtu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CSS can then focus its energy on Swedenborgian Studies scholarship and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://css.gtu.edu/historical-overview/|title=Historical Overview - Center for Swedenborgian Studies|website=css.gtu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Certificate of Swedenborgian Studies (Academic):''' The CSS is a 6-course certificate program for current GTU M.A. and PhD students. It is also available to M.Div. students currently at one of the GTU member schools or non-GTU scholars who are not preparing for a vocation in the Swedenborgian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://css.gtu.edu/certificate-of-swedenborgian-studies-academic/|title=Certificate of Swedenborgian Studies (Academic) - Center for Swedenborgian Studies|website=css.gtu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Certificate of Swedenborgian Ministries Studies (Vocational):'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://css.gtu.edu/certificate-of-swedenborgian-ministry-studies-vocational/|title=Certificate of Swedenborgian Ministry Studies (Vocational) - Center for Swedenborgian Studies|website=css.gtu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSMS comprises 21 units of coursework (or 7 3-unit courses), of which:

* 6 units must be Swedenborgian Exegesis,
* 3 units must be Introduction to Swedenborgian Thought, and
* 3 units must be Swedenborgian History.
* The other nine units may be drawn from any other courses offered in Swedenborgian Studies.

==About the Faculty==
The regular faculty are responsible for the Swedenborgian course offerings, but also partner with the faculty of the Graduate Theological Union and Pacific School of Religion to teach core curriculum classes to the larger student body.

{{Distinguish|Achziv}} 
'''Chezib''', also known as '''Achziv''' of Judah ({{Lang-he-n|אכזיב; כזיב}}), is a biblical place-name associated with the birth of [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]]'s son, [[Shelah (son of Judah)|Shelah]] &lt;small&gt;(Genesis 38:5)&lt;/small&gt;, corresponding to the ''Achziv'' of the [[Book of Joshua]] (15:44), a town located in the low lying hills of the plain of Judah, known as the [[Shefela]]. In ''I Chronicles 4:22'', the town is rendered as ''Chozeba''. The place is now a ruin.

Historical geographers identify the site as ''Khirbet a-Sheikh Ghazi'',&lt;ref&gt;At grid reference 15125 / 12170&lt;/ref&gt; the old name preserved in the name of a nearby spring ''ʻAin el-Kezbeh'',&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Peter Thomsen]], ''Loca Sancta'', Hildesheim 1966, p. 115 (Leipzig 1907); E.H. Palmer, ''Survey of Western Palestine - Arabic and English Name Lists'', London 1881, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp00conduoft#page/280/mode/2up 280]; {{Citation |contribution=Achzib / Chezib |title=A Topographical-Historical Encyclopaedia of Palestine |editor-last1=Press |editor-first1=I. |editor-last2= |editor-first2= |editor-link=Isaiah Press |volume=1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Rubin Mass |place=Jerusalem|page=18 |year=1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a place in the [[Elah Valley]] near [[Aviezer|Moshav Aviezer]], directly south of [[Bayt Nattif]].&lt;ref name="eusebius2005"&gt;Eusebius, ''Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture'', (ed.) R. Steven Notley &amp; [[Ze'ev Safrai]], Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 161 (§945), note 945 {{ISBN|0-391-04217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is allegedly derived from Shelah’s son, Cozeba, who is mentioned in [[I Chronicles]] (4:22).&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron Demsky]], ''The Houses of Achzib'', [[Israel Exploration Journal]] 16 (1966), pp. 211-215&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, the site had tentatively been identified with ''Tell el-Beide'', a site now known as ''Tell Libnin'',&lt;ref&gt;Avraham Negev &amp; Shimon Gibson (ed.), ''Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land'', New York 2001, p. 16 (s.v. ''Achzib'' [a]) {{ISBN|0-8264-1316-1}}; A. F. Rainey, "The Biblical Shephelah of Judah", in: ''[[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]]'', No. 251 (Summer, 1983), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; while others placed its location at one of the unidentified ruins near ''[[Keilah|Khirbet Qila]]'' and ''Khirbet Beit Nesib''.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Bible : A Treasure of Information related to the Bible and its period - Additions and Emendations'' (vol. 1), [[Bialik Institute]]: Jerusalem 1956, p. 278 (Hebrew); Aapeli Saarisalo, "Topographical Researches in the Shephelah", in ''The Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society'', XI (1930), pp. 98-104; Elliger, in: ''Zeitschrift des deutschen Palästina-Vereins'' (ZDPV – Journal of the German Society for Exploration of Palestine), 57 (1934), pp. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of the ruins of ancient cities in Israel, the site has no very well-defined characteristics, but appears to be spread over a considerable area.

==Etymology==

The name ''Chezib'', etymologically, is derived from the word "disappointment," "delusion,"&lt;ref&gt;Yoel Elitzur, ''Ancient Place Names in the Holy Land - Preservation and History'', Winona Lake 2004, p. 350 {{ISBN|1-57506-071-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; "failing" or "lying." In the [[Aramaic Targum]] of [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan|Pseudo-Yonathan ben Uzziel]] on Gen. 38:5, as well as in [[Genesis Rabba]] (§85), Chezib is rendered as ''Paskath'', said to be the Aramaic equivalent of Chezib ("failing").

==History==
The [[Lachish Letters]] makes mention of a certain "Beit Achzi[b]" in the Shefelah, the lower stratum of the Judean range, believed to be the Chezib of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Aḥituv, ''Collection of Hebrew Inscriptions'', [[Bialik Institute]]: Jerusalem 1992, p. 52; [[André Lemaire]], ''Inscriptions Hébraïques'', I. ''Les Ostraca'', Paris 1977, pp. 143–183&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]], in his ''[[Onomasticon (Eusebius)|Onomasticon]]'', notes of the place that "there the sons of Judah were born; now a desolate place, shown in the territory of [[Bayt Jibrin|Eleutheropolis]] near [[Adullam]]."&lt;ref name="eusebius2005" /&gt; 

In classical Hebrew literature, the town is mentioned as being confederate with [[Pekah|Pekah the son of Remaliah]], the king of the northern tribes of Israel, for which it incurs the divine wrath of the prophet [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]], who uses a play on words to denounce the towns of [[Maresha]], Achzib, and [[Adullam]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[David Kimchi]]'s commentary with [[Rashi]]'s commentary on Micah ([https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1801.htm#14 1:14–15]).&lt;/ref&gt; Israelite potters are said to have occupied the site during the preëxilic, late First Temple period.&lt;ref&gt;See p.  III in: {{cite journal |last=Yeivin |first=Shmuel |title=The late Professor Rabbi Samuel Klein |journal=Bulletin of the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society |accessdate=28 August 2018 |volume=|issue= |pages=I-IV |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23724427 |date=1940|registration=yes|via=[[JSTOR]]}} Yeivin's reference here to Klein's recognition of potters having been associated with Chozeba may simply be due to the fact that broken pottery with Hebrew insignia was found in ''Tell Beit Mirsim'', a ruin near the ancient biblical site of [[Keilah]] and in whose surroundings Klein thought that the Chezib of Judah was to be located. Achziv (Chezib), after all, is grouped with the towns of Nesib, Keilah and Maresha - all further south of the [[Elah Valley]] (Josh. 15:43–44).&lt;/ref&gt; The site is shown in the 1880 map published by [[C. R. Conder|Conder]] &amp; [[HH Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s ''[[Survey of Western Palestine]]''. Today, the site has mostly been planted over with pine trees by the [[Jewish National Fund]] (''Keren Kayemet'').

===Site's distinguishing features===
The site is strewn with the remains of razed buildings, and thick walls that are partially standing and which were constructed of [[fieldstone]]s. Within the environs of the site is a burial chamber built in the face of a cliff, containing six ''[[Rock-cut_tomb#Kokh|kokîm]]'' (niches) and which, according to [[Claude R. Conder|C.R. Conder]], signifies a Jewish burial place,&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Conder &amp; H.H. Kitchener, ''The Survey of Western Palestine - Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology'', vol. 3 - Judæa, [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]: London 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/448/mode/2up 449] (Appendix - ''Notes on the Architecture in Palestine'')&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to a period before the nation became subject to the Western powers of Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Conder &amp; H.H. Kitchener, ''The Survey of Western Palestine - Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology'', vol. 3 - Judæa, [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]: London 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/440/mode/2up 441] (Appendix - ''Notes on the Architecture in Palestine'')&lt;/ref&gt; The site has revealed archaeological relics dating back to the [[Iron Age]], until as late as the [[Byzantine period]].

'''Crinisus''' or '''Crimisus''' was a Sicilian river god in [[Roman mythology]]. According to [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (5.38) and [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae'' (273), Crinisus was the father of [[Acestes]] by a [[Dardanus (city)|Dardania]]n woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DGRG|title=Segesta}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is much more information for the life of Acestes than for his 'father', Crinisus.  Note that the spelling varies between the original Greek and subsequent Roman renderings.

The [[Battle of the Crimissus]], fought at a crossing of this river, was an important turning point in the ancient world between [[Carthage]] and the Greek City State of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] in 339 BC.

The Apatanis,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us3-w5TN9O8&lt;/ref&gt; who inhabit a tranquil pine clad valley called [[Ziro]] at the core of [[Lower Subansiri]] District of Arunachal Pradesh, are famous for their unique practice of wet rice cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;http://lowersubansiri.nic.in/html/apatanis.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lowersubansiri.nic.in/html/forestpractice.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lowersubansiri.nic.in/html/paddyfish_culture.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known for their sustainable agricultural practices and the agricultural cycles govern their everyday lives. The agricultural festival of Dree is the highlight in this cycle.&lt;ref&gt;https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/file/Dree%20Mythology_English.pdf?token=AWw45U72TxVfYI-KA8IBOWupKef48EUILJH7p_10kfSyIjo3Pnrm5gTnmdKugo3ebIAFo4sHK4pyo8x0xT9_sipYanPmsDiAg9jbY4Z1dWI4ywFpb0E0MF4LGCdgVwXVsDQTjzN1RTN8t_6jDoRgWAXFW-uA29zLLhM2ECELIC0t-KB2FKz4fkGOVRhXd62lTvlg9fcCKtfsR--dCMD0u3H4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythological aspects ==
In the beginning, humans wandered around foraging for food. It was Anẁ̀ Donw and Abba Lwbo who began cultivation in the fertile lands of Wpyo supuñ. Thus Anẁ̀̀ Donw was the first human to start a settled life while Abba Lwbo was the first to start cultivation.

With the first batch of spades – Turú dipe and the first batch of machetes – Twgyó ilyo’, bushes and vegetations were cleared from large tracts of land. Invoking the winds from the north and the south, the leavings were burnt. Next, the soil was prepared for sowing.

Plots of agriculture were ready, but no paddy seeds were available. So, the search for the seeds begun. In the process, Anẁ̀ Donw and Abba Lwbo reached Murtú Lembyañ from where they obtained the seeds of pyapiñ and pyare varieties of paddy along with the seeds of cucumber and corns from Murtú Yariñ. Something was still lacking and the search continued. When Anẁ̀ Donw and Abba Lwbo looked into the stomach of the wild rats it was full of grasses and herbs while that of the wild boar was full of salyó and sankhe’. However, it was in the stomach of the dilyañ kubu – the field rat that they found the seeds of empu and elañ varieties of paddy. They trailed the field rat with the help of a dog and finally located the source of the seeds. At a place called Hirẃ Lyandiñ, the paddy seeds were found stuck high above on the branches of Hirẃ Tanguñ tree, along with tayú and tagyá – varieties of bees. Thus, the empú and elañ were obtained from Hirẃ Anẁ.

All the varieties of paddy – pyapiñ and pyare, obtained from Murtu as well as empu and elañ, obtained from Hirẃ were originally obtained from Hintẁ Anẁ.

When Anẁ Donw and Abba Lwbo set out to sow the seeds in Wpyo Supuñ, rains and storms came to disturb them. They overcame them, equipped with baskets of tasvr and rain guards of tarpì. Then, Anẁ Donw and Abba Lwbo were constantly disturbed in their cultivation works and their life made miserable by a demon named Pyokuñ Pembò Pyoyi Tadù. This demon was finally eliminated with great efforts but their struggle was far from over. From the stomach of Pyokuñ Pembò Pyoyi Tadù emerged swarms of insects, pests and rice eating birds. They attacked the crops in the fields which led to poor harvest, and subsequent hunger and famines.

It was in order to counter the menace of insects, pests and diseases, and to alleviate the impending hunger and famines that a series of rituals were observed in the month of Dree. Achí Kharw or Dulu Talañ Myama Pwkha was the first priest, who was assisted by a committee called the Dree Pontañ. This committee consisted of Huli Gorì Hula Gora – the village committee, Huní Mitur Huna Mikiñ - the learned and wise village elders, Kharw Khatw - the high priests and Gwtú Gwra - the general public. They collected voluntary donations from every household to meet the requirements of the Dree rituals.

Pyodu Au and Dree Yarw are believed to be the forces that cause scarcity of food and bring hunger and sufferings to humanity. The damage caused to crops by insects and pests, together with hunger brought by Pyodu Au and Dree Yarw lead to famine. Thus, the Dree rituals are observed to ward off these forces during June–July, corresponding to Dree Pwlo of the Apatanis. During the taboo period that follows, celebration of victory over evil forces takes place. This is how Dree festival came to be celebrated.

Dree rituals are the Tamù, Metẁ, Medvr and Mepiñ. The Tamù is propitiated to ward off the insects and pests. The Metẁ is propitiated to ward off epidemics and other ailments of the human beings. The purification ritual of Medvr is performed to cleanse the agricultural fields of unfavorable elements. This series of rituals is concluded with Mepiñ, which is performed to seek blessings for healthy crops and well being of mankind. In the modern Dree, the Danyi is also propitiated for fertility of the soil, abundance of aquatic lives in the rice fields, healthy cattle and for prosperity of all human beings.

In the olden days, each village performed Dree rites separately at their respective villages on different dates as per the convenience of the village level organizing committees. It was in the year 1967 that the senior students of Apatani society led by Shri Lod Kojee organised the Dree centrally at a common ground at Swlañ Ditiñ for the first time. Since then, celebration during taboo period takes place centrally with fun and gaiety. Competitions of wsañ - high jump and gwbw – traditional wrestling for youths are organised, while the ladies engaged themselves in damiñda - folk dance competition. The elders exhibit their knowledge with ayú and bwsi competitions.

While the modes of celebration have changed with time, the original rituals started by the ancestors in Wpyó Supuñ are meticulously followed till this day and the objective of the festival remains the same – for a healthy crop, a bumper harvest and overall prosperity of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/file/Dree%20Mythology_English.pdf?token=AWxtlKUb2E-9gKuE65lwdeT4gWZcdxNC-7fy1mW9U42cUOKl57HFljCn3og55la7ptwO9r6oOm224zXx2J2rNz7fp4LPn9n_YduCuPW_98HK804iThro_CgOPRkLtJJInSE1zjenpWgl9TgMEwAhASpKGSFu-EURgVj1Inow0zpCb2CJnFb_F3v0VkOiLhyHCY-tb5X9eLfMwDh5R7jtxltU&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ritual ==

During the Dree festival, five main deities&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP9hi7yxutg&lt;/ref&gt; are appeased, these are; Tamù, Metẁ, Medvr, Mepiñ and Danyi.

# Tamu -  It is propitiated to ward off the insects and pests..
# Metii - It is propitiated to ward off epidemics and other ailments of the human beings.
# Medvr - It is a purification ritual performed to cleanse the agricultural fields of unfavorable elements. 
# Mepiñ - It is performed to seek blessings for healthy crops and well being of mankind.
# Danyi – Danyi is also propitiated for fertility of the soil, abundance of aquatic lives in the rice fields, healthy cattle and for prosperity of all human beings. Earlier, the Danyi was not performed during  the Dree rituals, it was for first time introduced in 1967 a to sacrifice a Mithun donated by Late Millo Kacho.

== Modification ==
It was in the later part of April 1967. After attending the Mopin festival at Pasighat town that the then students, Shri Lod Kojee and his friends studying in [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] College Pasighat, in course of an informal chat felt the need for having a festival centrally organised for the Apatanis.&lt;ref&gt;http://arunachalipr.gov.in/StateFestival_Dree.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Apatani society has half a dozen of pujas and festivals performed individually and collectively throughout the year but not a single puja or festival was performed at a central location on a fixed date participated by the entire community like those of Bihu of Assamese community, the Diwali of Hindus, the Solung and Mopin of Adi and Galo community, and so on. Accordingly, the possibilities of modification of few pujas and festivals of the Apatani at a centralised place on a uniformly fixed date was discussed. Due to the mythological rigidities, the modification of the pujas and festivals were not possible, but after long and hard persuasions the Dree was selected for modified celebration at a centralised location without affecting its traditional identity. Earlier, each village had its own choice of dates for commencement of the Dree. As per the modified programme, the date of centralised celebration was fixed on 5 to 7 July every year. Therefore, the village level traditional ritual performance takes place on the eve of the general celebration, i.e., on 4 July so that on the following day all the priest representatives from each village of the valley can participate in the centrally installed festival altar at general Dree ground. Since then the Dree festival is being centrally celebrated by the entire people of Apatani on 5 July every year at Nenchalya near Old Ziro.

== Financial sources ==
It was the middle part of May 1967. The summer vacation of J N College Pasighat had already started. Before leaving for home the students of [[ziro]] divided amongst themselves into two groups. One group would go to Ziro and collect contributions or donations in kinds like mithun,&lt;ref&gt;http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/wildlife.htm&lt;/ref&gt; goat, fowl, eggs, rice and other necessary materials for the celebration. The second group led by shri Lod Kojee was to proceed to Shillong for approaching the then NEFA Administration for financial assistance. At Shillong they apprised their proposal to Shri Jikom Riba the then special Social and Cultural Officer of North East Frontier Agency Administration. He led them to Shri P.N. Luthra&lt;ref&gt;http://lowersubansiri.nic.in/html/events.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the then Adviser to the Governor of Assam who granted them a sum of Rs 1000/= (Rupees one thousand) being the financial help towards the proposed Dree festival celebration and also he had consented to grace the occasion as chief guest.

== Selection of Dree venue ==
One sunny day in the early part of June 1967, a public meeting was convened at Old Ziro which was chaired by late R.S. Nag the then [[Deputy Commissioner]] of Subansiri District. All Gaon Buras, public leaders and senior students of the valley attended the meeting. The meeting was a crucial one as it was regarding the selection of Dree venue, no decision could arrive at easily until afternoon.

The people of Reru, Tajang and Kalung Villages proposed that the Dree venue should be at Lajbogya(Place), near Bulla School.  The people of Hari Village suggested that the Dree venue be at Byara(Place), near Hari school. The people of Hong Village demanded that the Dree venue should be at Hanoko(Place) near Hong school. The people of Mudang Tage and Michi- Bamin Village suggested that let the venue be at Biirii (Place), between Hong school and Mudang-Tage villages, while the people from Dutta and Hija VIllage suggested that the venue be at Nenchanglya, near Hija School. Finally, a decision was taken that the Dree venue should be selected at such a place that fulfills the following conditions;
#The Venue must be a centrally located in the valley.
#It must have easy access of conveyance.
#It must have a good play ground with sufficient areas for construction of sheds for huge gathering.
These conditions were agreed by all and decided that all representatives should visit the spots physically in the next day to ascertain as to which place fulfils the above-mentioned conditions. In the next day, it was reported that Nenchanglya, near Hija schools fulfills all the conditions and was finally selected as central Dree ground.

== Ritual performance turns to a festival ==

In olden days the Dree was observed on different days according to the convenience of the concerned 'Dree Goras' or 'Pantangs'
(an organising committee at village level). It could not be called as festival in true sense, rather it was a ritual performed by the Apatanis. However, Dree Biisi (traditional [[Folk music|folk song]]) amongst the girls, and games and sports like wrestling, high jumps etc. amongst the boys took place in the village level though they were not in a large scale as it is today. Now it is the biggest festival in Apatani valley, which is celebrated at other places as well where ever the Apatanis live.

== The Dree as it is celebrated today ==
On 4 July in the evening the Dree priest traditionally inaugurates the Dree festival in their respected villages. Next day on the 5th  July, Dree is officially solemnized and celebrated at common ground with traditional gaiety after it is inaugurated by a Chief Guest unfurling the Dree flag followed by Dree Anthem sung by group of artistes. Everybody present are served with Dree Taku (cucumber), Dree 'O' (rice or millet beer) followed by community feast. To add colour to the celebration the Pri-Dances, Daminda and other folk dances are displayed. The modern dance/song, literary competition, games and sports competitions are other high light of the days. During the taboo period women folks visits the home of their elderly relatives and present them with wine as a token of love and respect, and to strengthen their relationship.

'''Fenxiang''' (分香), literally the '''incense division''',{{efn-lg|Otherwise known as '''fenling''' 分灵, "efficacy division". Note that ''xiang'' 香 not only refers to incense and its fragrance, ash and smoke, but also metaphorically to the "suchness", "thusness" or "spiritual essence" of things.}} is a term that defines both hierarchical networks of [[Chinese temple|temples]] dedicated to a god in [[Chinese folk religion]], and the ritual process by which these networks form.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}}

==Networks==
Networks of affiliated temples dedicated to the cult of a specific god or deity can proliferate extensively. These networks are economic and social bodies, and in certain moments of history have even taken military functions.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} They also represent routes of [[pilgrimage]], with communities of devotees from the affiliated temples going up in the hierarchy to the senior temple.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}}

==Ritual of creation of a new temple==
When a new temple dedicated to the same god is founded, it enters the sacred network through the ritual of division of incense. This consists in filling the incense burner of the new temple with ashes brought from the incense burner of an existing temple.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} The new temple is therefore spiritually affiliated to the older existing temple, and back in the hierarchy to the very first temple dedicated to the god.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}}

{{nihongo|'''Inoue Hisashi'''|井上 ひさし|Inoue Hisashi|extra= 16 November 1934 &amp;ndash; 9 April 2010}} was a leading [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[playwright]] and writer of comic fiction. From 1961 to 1986, he used the [[pen name]] of Uchiyama Hisashi.

== Early life ==
Inoue was born in what is now part of [[Kawanishi, Yamagata|Kawanishi]] in [[Yamagata Prefecture]], where his father was a pharmacist. His father was  involved in an agrarian reform movement and also managed a local drama troupe. A novel his father had written won a prize and he was offered a job as a scriptwriter in a film company. But when he was preparing to move to Tokyo, he became ill with spinal [[Osteolytic bone lesions|caries]] and, soon after, when Hisashi Inoue was 5 years old, he died at age 34. His father's sudden death influenced Hisashi to be a writer.&lt;ref&gt;
Nobuko, Tanaka, "Crusader with a Pen: The Japan Times." Japan Times RSS. Ed, 30 Sept. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  After suffering from [[child abuse]] at the hands of his stepfather, he was subsequently sent off to a [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Lasallian orphanage]] in [[Sendai]], where he received a [[Roman Catholic|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He graduated from [[Sophia University]]’s Facility of Letters, continuing on to graduate school in [[French literature]], with a two-year hiatus in between to raise more money for his studies by working at a sanatorium in [[Kamaishi, Iwate]].

[[World War II]] ended when Inoue was just 11 years old. The experience of war helped shape Inoue’s own writing style, and fostered an anti-war perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, Robins, Japanese Language and Literature, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Apr., 2006), pp. 37-5, American Association of Teachers of Japanese
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==

Even before graduation, Inoue began his literary career by working as a stage manager and writing scripts for the ''Furansu-za'' [[striptease]] theater in [[Asakusa]], Tokyo. It was common to have a one-hour [[vaudeville]] performance before and between strip acts, and many famous actors, including [[Kiyoshi Atsumi]] started their careers in such an environment.  He wrote a semi-fictional account of his life during this period in ''Mokkinpotto Shi no Atoshimatsu'' ("The Fortunes of Father Mockinpott").
After graduation, he obtained a position as a script writer for a [[puppet drama]] ''Hyokkori Hyotanjima'', which aired from April 1964 for a five-year period.

After an initial career in radio, he wrote his first [[stage play]] ''Nihonjin no Heso'' in 1969 for Theatre Echo. He first gained literary recognition for his [[satire|satirical]] comic plays in the tradition of the [[Edo period]] ''[[gesaku]]'' genre. Inoue has won a very large number of literary awards in the course of his career, including the 67th [[Naoki Prize]] in 1972 for his novel ''Tegusari Shinju'' ("Handcuffed Double Suicide"). He followed on this success in 1981 with ''[[Kirikirijin]]'' ("The People of Kirikiri"), which was awarded both the [[Yomiuri Literary Prize]] and the 2nd [[Nihon SF Taisho Award|Japan Science Fiction Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sfwj.or.jp/list.e.html |title= Nihon SF Taisho Award Winners List|accessdate= 2010-01-28|publisher= Science Fiction Writers of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Inoue established his own theatre troupe, called ''Komatsuza'', to perform his own plays. These include biographical works on [[Meiji period]] writers [[Ishikawa Takuboku]] and [[Ichiyō Higuchi|Higuchi Ichiyō]], whom he had long admired. In 1988, he completed a comic trilogy: ''Kirameku seiza, Yami ni saku hana, Yuki ya kon kon'', depicting the lives of ordinary people in the [[Shōwa period]].  Despite his activity with the theatre, Inoue continued to write novels, winning the 1982 [[Seiun Award]] for Best Novel for ''Kirikirijin'', the [[Yoshikawa Eiji Literary Prize]] for ''Treasury of Disloyal Retainers'' in 1986, the 27th [[Tanizaki Prize]] for ''Shanghai Moon'' in 1991, and the [[Kikuchi Kan Prize]] for ''Tokyo Seven Roses'' in 1999.  In 1984, the Writer's Block Library was opened in [[Kawanishi, Yamagata]], thanks to Inoue's donation of his 100,000 volume book collection.  Inoue was awarded the [[Asahi Prize]] in the year 2000 and the Yomiuri Literary Prize again in 2010. In 2004, he was designated a [[Person of Cultural Merit]] by the Japanese government.

His career delves into the genre of science fiction. He started radio broadcasting with the play ''X-Man'' (1960). He also wrote for the daily children's television show Hyokkori Hōtanjima ["Madcap Island"] (1964), which was a puppet show in which a volcanic eruption destroyed a whole community adrift. There were hints of adult and dark humor in the children's show.&lt;ref&gt;"Nihon SF Taisho Award Winners List". Science Fiction Writers of Japan. Retrieved 2010-01-28.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Inoue’s career was long and distinguished. He didn’t only work as a writer, he also produced and wrote [[anime]] as a writer and lyricist. He made the theme songs for  Himitsu no Akko-chan "Secret Akko-chan" (1969) which is the animated version of The Tales of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. The Moomins (1969). He's known also for doing the lyrics and screenplay not just for intros but, also for a (1969) show called "The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots." 

''Chichi to kuraseba'', has been translated into the English by Roger Pulvers under the title ''The Face of Jizo''.

==Style==
Inoue had shown a self-reflective attitude about the war. His perspectives came from his early life. When he was young, he thought that he would die due to the war. However, the war was ended with the use of the atomic bomb, and it offered him a new chance to see the world. His experience during the war also made him see himself as just one man who alone who didn't have the power to create change.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, Robins, Japanese Language and Literature, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Apr., 2006), pp. 37-5, American Association of Teachers of Japanese&lt;/ref&gt;

In reflecting on Japan's experience during the war, he has written, ''"When I bring up the subject of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, an increasing number of people say, ‘It is wrong to dwell on having being victimized, because the Japanese of those days also victimized Asia.’ The second part of this view is certainly accurate. The Japanese did victimize all of Asia. However, I will never accept this first statement because I believe that the two atomic bombs were not merely dropped on the Japanese; they were dropped on the entire human existence . …modern world who cannot escape from the existence of nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, Robins, Japanese Language and Literature, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Apr., 2006), pp. 37-5, American Association of Teachers of Japanese&lt;/ref&gt;''

When compared with other modern Japanese writers, he shows a stronger influence of Japanese culture, particularly popular culture. His writing is for Japanese people, and his plays were usually have strong influenced from Japanese culture. In turn, he has influenced Japanese broadcast systems and his influence could be easily found in the Japanese modern theatre culture, other drama, and Japanese shows.&lt;ref&gt;"Magician Of Language." Time 122.5 (1983): 88. Academic Search Complete. Web. 28 Apr. 2015.’ {{ISSN|0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also famous for using high quality Japanese words in his writing. As a result, translators find it hard to translate his plays and other writing. However, because of his play was influenced by Japanese culture a lot, it would be hard to translate it into different cultures, but his writing is considered to be helpful to understand a Japanese perspective. Inoue's novel ''Kirikirijin'' (''Kirikiri People'',1981) shows Inoue's sharp humor and word play.&lt;ref&gt;
J'Lit., Hisashi Inoue, http://www.booksfromjapan.jp/authors/cjw/item/319-hisashi-inoue&lt;/ref&gt;

Inoue became famous as comedy writer. In his early literary career, he worked as broadcast writer and comedy writer in strip show. These early literary career influence him to be comedy writer. His suffered young life from the death of his father and [[World War II]] also influenced him to have interest about the life of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;"Crusader with a Pen | The Japan Times." Japan Times RSS. Ed. Tanaka Nobuko. 30 Sept. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inoue had warm and kind perspectives about poor or weak people, and it is shown in his plays. His play tries to give hope and show the kind side of society. His writing was based on [[Humanism]], and this likely accounts for his popularity with the public. He also usually focused on showing how ordinary people's lives were destroyed by war or calamity and how they cured themselves.

==Personal life==
Inoue lived in [[Ichikawa, Chiba]] in the 1970s, and moved to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa]] from 1989, where he lived until his death. He had three daughters by his first wife, Yoshiko Nishidate, who was a stage actress and political activist. His second wife, Lily, was the sister of essayist and translator [[Mari Yonehara]], and the daughter of Arika Yonehara, a senior member of the [[Japan Communist Party]]. Together they had a son.

Inoue hated air travel, but was fascinated by the city of [[Bologna]] in Italy, which he visited in 2004. He had previously visited Australia in 1976, and had also visited [[New York City]] in the 1980s for discussion about a possible [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] version of a story of [[Miyamoto Musashi]] he was planning to write.

Inoue served as president of the Japan [[P.E.N. Club]] from 2003 to 2007. He was also director of the Japan Association of Playwrights, and director of the Institute of Japanese Literature. An outspoken [[pacifism|pacifist]], Inoue established a political group in support of the [[Constitution of Japan]] with [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] in 2004.

A heavy smoker, Inoue was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in October 2009 and died at his home on 9 April 2010 at the age of 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Playwright, pacifist Hisashi Inoue dies at 75|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=12 April 2010|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100412a2.html|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of the [[Jews]] in [[Vancouver]]''' (also: [[Greater Vancouver]] and [[Metro Vancouver]]) in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] has been noted since the mid-19th century.

Early [[Jews|Jewish]] settlers were isolated from established Jewish institutions and communities in eastern Canada and the United States. They were also often isolated from each other, scattered across the Greater Vancouver area. As the local cities developed, the Jewish community also grew and expanded beyond the original business districts to spread throughout the area. While some early Jewish settlers ran farms, poultry operations, and sawmills, most tended to work in merchant industries. Many started as street [[peddler]]s and worked their way up to running small stores, a few of which grew into retail empires. 

Most of the early Jewish immigrants came from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. By the end of [[World War I]] immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] formed the majority of the Vancouver-area Jewish community due to discrimination in their homelands, notably the ''[[pogrom]]s'' in [[Russia]], and changes in Canadian immigration policy.

==Early Jewish life in Vancouver==

Early Jewish settlers in [[Vancouver]] were concentrated in the stores of the [[Gastown]] area and the homes of the [[Strathcona, Vancouver|Strathcona]] neighbourhood: the East End of Vancouver. The first Jewish businessman in [[Vancouver]] was Louis Gold, who opened a general store on the waterfront in 1872. His wife and son were also prominent businesspeople, and his son Edward willed valuable land to the Jewish community for charities and building projects. Edward was also elected Councilor in South Vancouver in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Citation Needed&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable early settler was [[David Oppenheimer]], who moved to Vancouver in 1885. As the city's second Mayor (1888–91), he was responsible for starting much civic infrastructure and industry. Oppenheimer also secured a Jewish burial area in the city-owned [[Mountain View Cemetery (Vancouver)|Mountain View Cemetery]] and offered land to the community for a synagogue. He and his brothers were prominent in real estate, groceries, and transportation; their grocery business is still operating as The Oppenheimer Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oppyproduce.com/ oppyproduce.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent settler was Zebulon Franks, who arrived in 1887 and opened a hardware store by 1896. Parts of his business still survive as Y. Franks Appliances&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yfranks.ca/yfranks.html Edmonds The Appliance Store | Edmonds &amp; Y. Franks The Appliance Stores&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Y. Franks Parts &amp; Service. Franks was also involved in development of Vancouver Jewish religious and community institutions, hosting the first Orthodox prayer services and serving as a founding member of B'nai B'rith. Along with Henry Sigler, he also negotiated purchase of the land for the first synagogue in Vancouver.

==Development of synagogues==

In the city's early years, its nearest synagogue was [[Congregation Emanu-El (Victoria, British Columbia)|Temple Emanu-El]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]. Agudace Achim (Orthodox) was the first congregation in Vancouver, active from 1891 to 1906. A semi-[[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregation soon followed, as Temple Emanu-El started in 1894 and was active through 1917. In 1907 a new Orthodox congregation appeared, named B'nai Yehudah (also known as Sons of Israel). However, the first Vancouver synagogue did not appear until 1911, when B'nai Yehudah was built at the corner of East Pender and Heatley Streets. Though it seated 200, larger halls had to be rented for [[High Holidays|High Holy Days]]. The building also housed several community organizations. Children's Judaic classes began shortly after the opening in nearby homes. In 1914, during an [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]], the synagogue was saved from [[foreclosure]] by an emergency fundraising campaign. In 1917 B'nai Yehudah was incorporated as a society by the name of Schara Tzedeck. The Vancouver Hebrew School/Talmud Torah&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;[http://sites.google.com/a/vttschool.ca/vtt1/Home Vancouver Talmud Torah&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; started at the synagogue in 1918. After thirty years as a boys' club and vocational school, the synagogue was developed into residences, and was honoured with a Vancouver Centennial plaque in 1986.

==Formation of community organizations==

Local Jewish community organizations founded in the early 20th century included the Young Mens Hebrew Association (1909), the Ladies Aid Society (1907; later Schara Tzedeck Ladies' Auxiliary and the Sisterhood), [[B'nai B'rith]] (1910), the Hebrew Aid and Immigrant Society (1910), the Zionist and Social Society (1913), and the Hebrew Free Loan Association (1915). Samuel Davies Schultz was appointed to Vancouver County Court in 1914, making him Canada's first Jewish judge. Max Grossman was the first Vancouver Jew to be appointed [[Queen's Counsel|King's Counsel]], as a lawyer, in 1917. Grossman was involved in many community organizations and was a major force in the first Schara Tzedeck Synagoge, the Vancouver Hebrew School, and the first Jewish Community Centre.

==Increase in affluence==

More affluent Jewish families began to settle in the [[West End, Vancouver|West End]] area in the early 20th century, centered around Congregation Temple Emanu-El. The congregation started raising funds for a semi-Reform synagogue in 1911, but [[World War I]] and economic depression interrupted their efforts. The congregation stopped services in 1917. Shortly afterwards, the rearrangement of European boundaries following  the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] led to a wave of Eastern European Orthodox Jewish immigrants. The Jewish population of Vancouver was still too small to support multiple synagogues; therefore in 1919–1921 the remnants of the Reform congregation joined with the larger Orthodox congregation, Schara Tzedeck, to build a new synagogue in the East End for all Vancouver Jews. However the Temple Emanu-El Ladies Auxiliary continued to hold separate social and charitable events in the West End, as well as a children's Sabbath school, until the congregation dissolved entirely in 1932.

==Growth during the 1920s==

The 1920s were a time of further growth for the Jewish community. [[Congregation Schara Tzedeck|Schara Tzedeck Synagogue]] (Orthodox) was built in 1920 on the site of the old B'nai Yehudah synagogue in the East End. The old synagogue building remained for use by the Hebrew school and as a community hall. A [[Hadassah]] chapter was founded in 1920, Jewish Community Chest and Vancouver Council of Jewish Women in 1924, the Hebrew Athletic Club and early meetings for [[Congregation Beth Israel (Vancouver)|Congregation Beth Israel]] (Conservative) in 1925. The first Jewish regular newspaper, called the ''Vancouver Jewish Community Centre'', started in 1923. It later became the ''Jewish Western Bulletin'', which published from 1930 to 2001. The Schara Tzedeck congregation, which had hosted and subsidized the Talmud Torah Hebrew school, took over the school's governance from 1928 to 1943. 

A significant event was the 6–7 July 1921 visit by the Very Reverend Dr. [[Joseph H. Hertz]], Chief Rabbi of the United Congregation of the British Empire. In 1922 visiting [[vaudeville]] performer [[Jack Benny]] met [[Mary Livingstone|Sadye Marks]] at a [[Passover Seder]] in the West End. They married in 1927 and she went on to vaudeville, radio, and movie stardom as his partner [[Mary Livingstone]].

Two prominent Jewish businesses were established during this period. First, in 1919, Sam Cohen opened the [[Army &amp; Navy Stores (Canada)|Army &amp; Navy]] surplus and liquidation store. He built it into a mail-order and retail chain operating throughout western Canada; it is now run by his granddaughter Jacqui.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armyandnavy.ca/ armyandnavy.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Ben and Morris Wosk started Wosk's in 1923 as an appliance store. It grew into a major publicly traded chain of furniture and appliance stores in western Canada, but is now defunct.  The Wosks were also real estate moguls and philanthropists.

==Into the 1930s==

In the 1920s and 1930s, many Jewish families moved to new neighbourhoods south of [[False Creek]], especially [[Fairview, Vancouver|Fairview]]. The Talmud Torah Hebrew school opened an annex here, near Broadway and Cambie Street, in 1923. After a long period of fundraising, the first Jewish Community Centre was built in 1928 at Oak Street and 11th Avenue. The Talmud Torah school annex moved into the Centre that same year. The Congregation Beth Israel was formally founded in 1932 and held services in the Centre. In 1937 the [[Congregation Schara Tzedeck|Schara Tzedeck]] congregation decided to move to the Fairview area but was hampered by economic depression and war. Following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], many upper-class families left the West End for the new neighbourhoods of [[Shaughnessy, Vancouver|Shaughnessy]] and [[West Point Grey|Point Grey]]. 

The Jewish Administrative Council was established in 1932 to coordinate the Free Loan Association, Community Chest, and Community Centre.

==1940s==

By the 1940s, Jewish population and community life began to centre on [[Oak Street (Vancouver)|Oak Street]] in central Vancouver, south of the first Jewish Community Centre. The Talmud Torah school established its first independent facility in 1943 on West 14th Avenue between Oak and Cambie Streets. The Orthodox congregation Beth Hamidrash B'nai Ya'acov began in 1943, so its members could be within walking distance of their Fairview homes. The [[Peretz Centre for Secular Jewish Culture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peretz-centre.org/index.html Peretz Centre for Secular Jewish Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; previously known as the Vancouver Peretz Institute or Shule, was established in 1945 near Oak Street as a secular-humanist educational and cultural centre. A home for elderly Jews was founded nearby in 1946, partly funded by American comedian [[Eddie Cantor]]. The [[Congregation Schara Tzedeck|Schara Tzedeck]] congregation finally dedicated its new synagogue here in 1948, as well as the [[Congregation Beth Israel (Vancouver)|Beth Israel]] synagogue in 1949. The Talmud Torah school moved to a new Oak Street campus in 1948 and became a day school for elementary grades.

A Vancouver branch of the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] was established in 1941. In 1944, the first Jewish funeral chapel was opened by Schara Tzedeck.

==Post World War II==

The post-[[World War II]] period saw a greater influx of central and eastern Canadian Jews, as well as the first wave of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish]] immigration to British Columbia. The Council of Jewish Women was key in assisting and aiding the various refugees that came post-war, including forty-seven children orphaned by the Holocaust who came in 1948.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Vancouver |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/vancouver |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Holocaust survivors, the next decades brough Jewish immigrants from Iraq, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il" /&gt; The first Sephardic High Holy Day services were held in 1966 at the Jewish Community Centre. A Sephardic congregation soon formed and used the Beth Hamidrash synagogue, whose membership had been shrinking. In 1979 the Sephardic congregation merged with the Beth Hamidrash [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] congregation.

==1960s and 1970s==

The Jewish population continued to shift south and west to the [[Oakridge, Vancouver|Oakridge]] area through the 1960s and 1970s. At Oak and 41st a new Jewish Community Centre was built in 1962 as well as the Louis Brier Home and Hospital &lt;ref name="louisbrier.com"&gt;[http://www.louisbrier.com/ louisbrier.com]&lt;/ref&gt; for the aged in 1968.  It is the only Jewish seniors' facility west of [[Winnipeg]].&lt;ref&gt;The Louis Brier Home and Hospital (n.d.). Retrieved November 30, 2008 from http://www.louisbrier.com/index_louis.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Temple Sholom (Reform) was founded in 1965. Its first home was on West 10th Avenue. This building was destroyed by a fire bomb in January 1985; the Congregation built a new synagogue on Oak Street, which was dedicated in 1988. [http://www.templesholom.ca/]

Wealthy families also moved to the [[West Point Grey|Point Grey]] and [[West Vancouver]] neighbourhoods. Leonoff's study of the ''Vancouver Jewish Community Telephone Directory'' suggests that only 10% of the local Jewish community lived outside Vancouver in 1960, though many families began moving to the suburbs as housing costs rose.&lt;ref&gt;Leonoff, Cyril (2001). Vancouver and its Outlying Jewish Communities. ''The Scribe: The Journal of the Jewish Historical Society of B.C., vol. XXI'' (No. 1&amp;2), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the development of community services and congregations has often been a cooperative process, with help from organizations in neighbouring cities, there are some accounts of suburban communities feeling ignored by central organizations. The Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver &lt;ref name="jfgv.com"&gt;[http://www.jfgv.com/ jfgv.com]&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1987 to develop a wider community across the area. It was born from the merger of the United Jewish Appeal and the Jewish Community Fund and Council. 

The Jewish Community Centre of Greater Vancouver&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccgv.com/index.htm Jewish Community Centre of Greater Vancouver&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; also offers services intended for the entire community.

In 1974 Rabbi Yitzchak and Henia Wineberg moved from Brooklyn, NY to open the first Chabad House centre in Western Canada. {{Advert inline|date=November 2015}}Chabad has been credited with spearheading the resurgence in Jewish identity, and practice. Chabad Lubavitch BC now operates 7 centres in BC including, [http://www.chabadvi.org Chabad of Vancouver Island], [http://www.jewishokanagan.com Chabad of the Okanagan], [http://www.centreforjudaism.ca/ Centre for Judaism of the Lower Fraser Valley in White Rock], [http://www.chabadrichmond.com/ Chabad of Richmond], [http://www.chabadcitycentre.org/ Chabad of Downtown Vancouver], [http://www.chabadeastvan.com Chabad of East Vancouver], and the [http://www.lubavitchbc.com Chabad headquarters on 41st and Oak].

==21st century==

Beth Hamidrash dedicated a new synagogue building in 2004. [[Congregation Schara Tzedeck]] celebrated its centenary in 2007 as the first and largest Orthodox synagogue in British Columbia. Its membership counted 450 families, some of whom were fourth-generation members. Congregation Beth Israel celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary in 2007. Several notable members of the Jewish support movement were responsible for the building of banks and clinics in East Vancouver, most notable was Duffy Holeksa, who was quoted as saying "I'll build these banks with every penny I have!".
==New Westminster==
Jewish merchants have been part of [[New Westminster]] since its founding in 1859 when firms like Meyer, Reinhards &amp; Co. and Messrs. Levi and Boas arrived to supply prospectors for the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]]. There were a few Jewish families and businesses in the area by the late 1920s. The Schara Tzedeck congregation of Vancouver consecrated its cemetery here in 1929, despite neighbourhood opposition. One prominent family was that of Louis Zack, who started a drycleaning business in 1929 and became business and community leaders. In 1941 Sam and Paul Heller acquired and modernised the Pacific Pine Co. Ltd. sawmill. 

The Royal City [[Hadassah]] chapter was founded in 1947, and was active through at least 2001. The chapter was the focus of increased Jewish social activities. After years of parent car-pooling to Vancouver Jewish schools and hiring private tutors, the New Westminster branch of Vancouver's Talmud Torah school was established in 1949. Most families still tended to participate in Vancouver synagogues, partly due to family ties. Louis Leask was a prominent doctor and school trustee from 1952 to 1971. Muni Evers, a pharmacist, served six years as alderman and fourteen years as mayor of New Westminster. 

By 1960, the Jewish community directory listed 21 families in New Westminster. However, during the 1970s the local Jewish community was shrinking and spreading to cheaper housing eastwards.

==History by local areas==
[[Image:Greater Vancouver Area.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Greater Vancouver]]]]

===West Vancouver and North Vancouver===
Due to an early lack of bridges across [[Burrard Inlet]], and the distance from Jewish institutions, the Jewish population of [[West Vancouver]] and [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]] was small until after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. One of the notable Jewish businessmen who settled there was Samuel Gintzburger. He served on the first West Vancouver municipal council in 1912, founded the Vancouver Hebrew Free Loan Association, was a long-time president of Vancouver's Temple Emanu-El, and mentored Jewish children from the Juvenile Court. Another North Shore businessman was Louis Brier, who willed his [[Gold Rush]] fortune to fund a non-sectarian seniors' home, orphanage, and hospital. This became the Louis Brier Home in Vancouver.&lt;ref name="louisbrier.com"/&gt; A third notable resident was Harry Evans, who helped to establish Beth Israel Cemetery&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.bethisraelvan.ca/beth-israel-cemetary ]&lt;/ref&gt; in Burnaby in 1946. He also founded the B.C. Collateral Loan Co. Ltd., which is still operating, in Gastown in 1899.

In addition to business opportunities, Jewish families and community groups enjoyed the North Shore's beaches, hiking trails, picnic spots, fishing creeks, mountains, and ski runs.

A Jewish community began to develop on the North Shore in the 1950s.  In 1952 the Gleneagles Golf and Country Club was established in West Vancouver, since private golf clubs would not admit Jews at the time. It is now owned by the City of West Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westvancouver.ca/Residents/Level3.aspx?id=1286 Gleneagles Golf Course | Parks | District of West Vancouver&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The North Shore Jewish Community Association was founded in 1958, and began holding religious services in the West Vancouver Community Centre as Conservative congregation Shaar Harim in the early 1960s. At this time a Sunday Hebrew School started in a North Shore family home, later moving to the West Vancouver Community Centre.

The North Shore's first synagogue, Har-El (Conservative), was built in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harel.org/ harel.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It also features the North Shore Jewish Community Centre and an afternoon Hebrew School. A Traditional congregation, Torat Hayim, started in 1999.[http://www.hayim.com/]

===Burnaby and Coquitlam===
One of the first Jewish settlers in [[Burnaby]] was George Biely, who started a poultry farm in 1936. Early Jewish residents often socialized in neighbouring cities: residents of western Burnaby went to Vancouver, while those of eastern Burnaby went to New Westminster. In 1946 Vancouver's Beth Israel congregation consecrated a cemetery in northern Burnaby.

The establishment of [[Simon Fraser University]] in 1965 attracted many Jewish academics, especially from the [[United States]]. More families also began to settle in east Burnaby and neighbouring areas like [[New Westminster]], [[Port Moody]], [[Coquitlam]], and [[Port Coquitlam]]. The Burquest Jewish Community Association began in 1973, and was incorporated in 1976, to offer social and educational programs. A cooperative Sunday school, which met in members' homes and later at the Centennial Lodge of New Westminster, was also founded at that time. From 1976 until 1980, when services started in Burnaby, the Richmond/Delta Jewish Community Association offered seats at its High Holidays services to Burquest members. The Burquest Jewish Community Association and Sha'arai Mizrah congregation are now based in Coquitlam.

===Richmond and Delta===
The rich river delta soil of the area attracted many Jewish farmers. One was Jack Bell, the "Cranberry King", who started BC's first [[cranberry]] farm on [[Lulu Island]] in 1946.

Urban development in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] first started at [[Steveston, British Columbia|Steveston]] on the southwestern end of Lulu Island. As the town boomed around its fishing harbour and [[Canning|canneries]] in the 1890s, several stores were established by Jewish immigrants. When fire ravaged Steveston in 1918, development shifted to the northern side of the island. Twelve Jewish families were listed here in 1959, with four in more rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Leonoff, Cyril (2001). Vancouver and its Outlying Jewish Communities. ''The Scribe: The Journal of the Jewish Historical Society of B.C., vol. XXI'' (No. 1&amp;2).&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, the Richmond Country Club&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igolfsoftware.com/richmond/ Richmond Country Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded on Steveston Highway; though non-sectarian, it was largely Jewish and remains so. The Jewish population increased with the postwar boom as families searched for affordable land, and as bridges were built to Vancouver. 

In the 1960s, Jewish residents of Richmond were mostly young families. Residents met to organize a Hebrew school for these children, and formed the Richmond/Delta Jewish Community Association in 1971. Youth programs started in 1971 and High Holy Days services in 1972, both in borrowed facilities. The Conservative congregation Beth Tikvah &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btikvah.ca/ btikvah.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; started in 1977. Ten years later, the congregation established a cemetery in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] and a Hebrew high school. The synagogue was expanded in 1993.

In 1977, some families split from the community association to form the Orthodox Congregation of Richmond. Services and school were held in homes until the 1979 opening of Eitz Chaim synagogue. The congregation built a new synagogue and school in 1988.

The Richmond Jewish community grew quickly in the 1980s and 1990s, welcoming a large number of immigrants from abroad. The Kehila Society &lt;ref&gt;[http://kehilasociety.org/ kehilasociety.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2000 to manage such growth and coordinate Richmond Jewish community organizations. [[Chabad]] of Richmond &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabadrichmond.com/ chabadrichmond.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (Chabad-Lubavitch) was formed in 1997. Three years later the congregation first celebrated High Holy Days and formed a Community Kollel for pan-Jewish education. Richmond Jewish Day School&lt;ref&gt;[http://rjds.ca/index.php?section=1&amp;category=&amp;page=102 Richmond Jewish Day School - Location&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; started in 1992 and moved to a permanent facility in 1998.

In 2002, some of the congregation of Eitz Chaim split off to form a new orthodox community which known as Young Israel of Richmond (YIRBC), which closed in June 2015 .

===South Surrey and White Rock===
Some Jewish families settled in the area as pioneers, while others retired there after owning summer homes; still others arrived in the 1960s' search for affordable housing. One notable resident was Max Zack, who owned a hotel in [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]] and served as alderman (1958–1960).

A summer camp for Jewish youth was built at [[Crescent Beach (Surrey)|Crescent Beach]] in 1937 by the National Council of Jewish Women,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjw.org/ ncjw.org]&lt;/ref&gt; with help from the Vancouver Jewish community. The camp was transferred to the Zionist Organization of British Columbia in 1946 and renamed Camp [[Hatikvah]]. Local Jewish men trained here in 1948 to fight in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]]. Camp Hatikvah moved to the [[Okanagan]] region of British Columbia in 1956.

The area became home to several Jewish cemeteries, including those belonging to Temple Sholom, Vancouver, in 1977, and Beth Tikvah, Richmond, in 1987.

In 1986 the Centre for Judaism of the Lower Fraser Valley was founded,[http://www.centreforjudaism.ca/] and later opened its first synagogue in North Delta (Chabad Lubavitch). In 1995 it moved to White Rock, where it resides today. The school also runs the Gan Israel children's summer day camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganisraelbc.com/ ganisraelbc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A chapter of Jewish Women International,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwi.org/page.aspx?pid=248]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly B'nai B'rith Women of BC, formed here in 1989.

In the early 1990s a group of families hosted an open Passover dinner, inviting all South Surrey Jews to attend. The response to the event was so overwhelming that it grew into what became White Rock South Surrey Jewish Community Centre in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrssjcc.org/ wrssjcc.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In its present permanent location the community centre holds regular services and conducts Hebrew school for all ages, while hosting a multitude of programs from pre-school to senior ages. It has members from as far away as [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford, B.C.]], and [[Bellingham, Washington]].

===Fraser Valley===
A small number of Jewish families settled in the farmland of the [[Fraser Valley]], east of Vancouver. They were generally storekeepers, farmers and doctors. Early Jewish residents of [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] included John and William Hammond, who arrived in 1872 and established the town of Port Hammond. Thomas Haney arrived in 1876 and built a brick plant that started nearby [[Haney, British Columbia|Port Haney]]. These towns peaked in the early 1880s as supply points for [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] construction; they are now parts of Maple Ridge, retaining their names as neighbourhoods.

Jewish settlement in the Fraser Valley was scattered, and the nearest synagogues were a day's travel away in [[Vancouver]] and [[Bellingham, Washington]]. In the early 1950s, the Rabbi of [[Congregation Beth Israel (Bellingham, Washington)]] briefly provided classes for local Jewish children. He could not visit frequently enough, however, and families resumed commuting. Since the 1964 opening of the [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1 freeway]] and [[Port Mann Bridge]] made travel easier, Fraser Valley Jewish families have been able to participate more fully in the synagogues of Vancouver and its suburbs. Some families still prefer to commute to [[Bellingham, Washington]], which is closer but across the US border.

==Intermarriage rate==

[[Cyril Edel Leonoff]] claims that the [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|interfaith marriage]] rate for Vancouver Jews in 2001 was about 60%, with 40% of Jewish people formally involved with religious congregations. He also states that as of 2001 the largest congregations were [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], though the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregation has also been growing.&lt;ref&gt;Leonoff, Cyril (2001). Vancouver and its Outlying Jewish Communities. ''The Scribe: The Journal of the Jewish Historical Society of B.C., vol. XXI'' (No. 1&amp;2), p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2006 [[Census in Canada|Canadian census]] 21,465 people in Greater Vancouver identified their ethnic origin as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada (2008). Vancouver. ''Ethnic Origin (247), Single and Multiple Ethnic Origin Responses (3) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2006 Census - 20% Sample Data''.

Leonoff said in 2008 that the Jewish population of Greater Vancouver was 25,000, which was 80% of the Jewish population of British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Leonoff, C.E. (2008).

According to Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia), "Europe and the U.S are the enemy", Jews "are the most evil creatures", women should be segregated for "cultural reasons", and Muslim children should not be forced to sing the [[Australian national anthem]].

In Australia in 2005, the party survived a proposed ban after clearance from the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/08/11/1123353444844.html|title=Islamic group to fight on against banning moves|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party planned its first Khilafah conference in Sydney for 27 January 2007. The planned conference led to allegations in newspaper reports that the party was linked to the [[July 2005 London bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21132708-661,00.html news.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition politicians called on the local and federal governments not to grant visas to foreign speakers attending, and to re-consider proscribing Hizb ut-Tahrir. The demands for a ban were rejected by [[Attorney General]] [[Philip Ruddock]], on the grounds there was insufficient evidence to warrant banning the group. Radical clerics from the group demanded the establishment of a Muslim superstate, and warned Muslims they must be prepared to kill anyone who threatened its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw-act/nsw-can-ban-radicals-ruddock/story-e6freuzi-1111112902843 |title=NSW can ban radicals - Ruddock |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hizb ut-Tahrir members originally planned to hold the conference in the town hall of [[Bankstown, New South Wales]], a suburb of Sydney with adjacent Lakemba as Australia's biggest Muslim electorate, but the Sydney council cancelled it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Council-refuses-group-use-of-town-hall/2007/01/10/1168105040471.html|title=Council refuses group use of town hall|work=The Age|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hizb ut-Tahrir secured another location the next day on 28 January.

Conference spokesman Wassim Doureihi said the work of Hizb ut-Tahrir was not to change the political landscape in Australia. He added, "It is because of Islam and my allegiance to Islam that I am responsible for ensuring to do what I can to protect the safety and security of all peoples in this country and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiandefencereport.com.au/1-07/fight_for_global_islamic_state_c.htm |accessdate=14 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315192851/http://www.australiandefencereport.com.au/1-07/fight_for_global_islamic_state_c.htm |archivedate=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One opponent of a ban on Hizb ut-Tahrir, Irfan Yusuf, writing in the on-line publication [[Crikey]], stating in ''No need to be alarmed about Hizb ut-Tahrir'' that the opposition [[Australian Labor Party]] "clearly wants to look tougher than the government on national security.

==2010 - 2014==
On 15 September 2012, there were protests outside the American Embassy in Sydney urged on by the website of Hizb ut-Tahrir against non-Muslims. The visiting UK Spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, Taji Mustafa, denied demanding protests and uprisings, although all links on his website leading to Facebook groups substantiate these denials as untrue.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The protests preceded an organised gathering at Bankstown on 16 September. Although a video is blamed for the protests, Hizb ut-Tahrir's objectives, led by Taji Mustafa, tend to be for a Caliphate.  Placards carried during the protest on 15 September called for beheading, with one such placard being carried by a young child. Taji Mustafa brought further denials that his website has hate speech. There are calls for Hizb ut-Tahrir to be banned in Australia and Taji Mustafa not to re-enter Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/tablet/tony-abbott-wants-taji-out/story-fnehlez2-1226475116547| title=Tony Abbott wants Taji out|date=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Hizb ut-Tahrir conference held in Sydney in November 2013, speakers called on those present to resist any attempts to moderate Islam, with a Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman condemned any, "watering down of Islam". The audience was told that a war on Islam is being waged in this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/hizb-uttahrir-australia-conference-hears-this-country-at-war-with-radical-islam/story-fni0cx12-1226762077040|title=Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia conference hears 'this country at war' with radical Islam |author=Matthew Benns|date=18 November 2013|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on the conference, a commentator noted the paradox in which, "Hizb ut-Tahrir [has the] propensity for condemning the government, culture, values and democratic traditions of Australia, while its members seem happy to live here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/muslims-urged-to-turn-back-on-country/story-e6frg6z6-1226766344130|title=Muslims urged to turn back on country|author=Ean Higgins|date=23 November 2013|publisher=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisers of a cultural event hosted at the [[Sydney Opera House]], which was part of the [[Festival of Dangerous Ideas]], cancelled a speech by Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Uthman Badar in June 2014 titled ‘Honour Killings are Morally Justified’ after widespread outrage.&lt;ref&gt;‘Opera House cancels speech by Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Uthman Badar on why ‘honour killings are morally justified’’, [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opera-house-cancels-speech-by-hizb-uttahrir-spokesman-uthman-badar-on-why-honour-killings-are-morally-justified/story-fni0cx4q-1226965416737] Daily Telegraph, 25 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a demonstration in Sydney held on 25 July 2014, Ismail Al-Wahwah, who is the group's leader in Australia, stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]):

{{cquote|..It is a delusion to think that Palestine can contain the Jews as well as its people. Palestine cannot contain the Muslims and the Jews. It belongs to the local people. The Jews should not be in Palestine, and they will not remain there. Any Jew living in Palestine is an illegitimate occupier. He is a target of Jihad, and will end up in the garbage bin of history. This holds true for all the Jews in Palestine. It makes no difference whether a Jew is pro-peace or pro-war. Whether right-wing or left-wing, any Israeli living in Palestine is an occupier, and serves as a target for the Jihad of the Islamic nation. If you don't like it, take your passport and go back to where you came from...There is no place for you in Palestine.

At the same rally, [[Wassim Doureihi]] described the conflict against Israel as "a civilizational struggle between Islam and between [[Kafir|kufir]]," further stating that "This is an Islamic struggle to liberate Islamic lands, to re-institute Islamic rule over what is, and will always be, Islamic land." Regarding Jews who currently live in Israel, Doureihi offered the following advice: "our advice, very clearly, is to return to the lands from which you immigrated, to do so peacefully before you will do so forcefully."&lt;ref name=expelJews/&gt;

In an audio clip of a speech on Voice of Islam Radio (Australia), which was later posted online 16 October 2014, Ismail Al-Wahwah stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]) that "Our true conflict is with Europe and the U.S. They are the enemy. They are the ones that perpetrated crimes against the Islamic nation and its history." He further stated that "The Western standard of living is high because they stole our oil and resources, and prevented us from engaging in agriculture, industry, and trade. The famine in our country stems from Western policies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/4672.htm Australian Islamist Leader Ismail Al-Wahwah: Our Number One Enemy Is the U.S. and Europe], [[MEMRI]], Clip No. 4672, (transcript). 10 and 16 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, at a conference attended by more than 500 people, Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Uthman Badar said Muslim children should not be forced to sing the [[Australian national anthem]] as the, "anthem reflects a particular disputed view of history and celebrates particular ideological values.

In March 2016 the [[New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal]] determined that separate male and female seating arrangements at public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir contravened section 33 of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act.

Following the participation of [[Yassmin Abdel-Magied]] as a panellist on [[Q&amp;A (Australian talk show)|ABC Q&amp;A]] on 13 February 2017 where she started to explain part of her interpretation of [[Sharia law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackouts, Childcare, and Migration|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s4612398.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wassim Doureihi commented on his Facebook page about the episode. He said "The sister's arguments were indeed problematic, but the bigger problem was to accept to speak within such narrow confines in the first place. Was always set up for failure." A FB profile ''Yassmina be Chillin'' (authenticity unverified - not her official FB profile name) responded, saying she was willing to hear feedback and take advice. Doureihi responded that she, "ended up framing Islam through a secular lens, aimed at a secular people and conscious of the presence of a secular government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1790004221322668&amp;id=100009393229635%23|title=Archived web page capture of Wassim Doureihi FB post, 16 Feb 2017|accessdate=29 May 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170222061711/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1790004221322668&amp;id=100009393229635%23|archivedate=22 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/feminist-activist-yassmin-abdelmagied-sought-advice-from-hizb-uttahrir/news-story/8fb7d208cfac65646173cc3a4180c1a2|title=Feminist activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied sought advice from Hizb ut-Tahrir |author=Morton, Rick|date=20 February 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 Hizb ut-Tahrir produced a video in which two women discussed how to resolve marital conflicts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2516">'''Islam in [[Tonga]]''' is a small minority religion in the country. Muslims in Tonga belong to [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] denomination. The number of Muslims was estimated at less than 1000 in 2010 by the [[Pew Research Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/|title=Table: Muslim Population by Country|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[demographics of Tonga|population]] of about 108,000, while a report by the Fiji Muslim League estimated that in 2002 there were about 70 Muslim Tongan nationals out of a Muslim population of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/FijiMuslimLeagueSituationReportTongaSamoa/FmlSituationReport-tongaSamoa2002#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Fiji Muslim League situation report: Tonga and Samoa|date=5 July 2002|work=Fiji Muslim League|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muslim school==
[[Tonga]]’s [[Muslim]] community is planning to raise funds in the [[Middle East]] to build a new boarding school on Tongatapu.&lt;ref name="RNZI_31714"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=31714 |title=Plans for a Muslim school in Tonga |date=24 April 2007 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is to follow the Tongan school curriculum, but additionally offer the [[Arabic]] language and Islamic studies as options. Sheikh Imam Abdul Fader, a spiritual leader of the Tongan Muslim community and a mathematics teacher, said their project is to build a three-story boarding school that will serve [[Muslims]] and non-Muslims, especially orphans who are often deprived of [[education]]. The [[children]] in the school will not be forced to study or convert to [[Islam]]. He also said that a small delegation of Tongan Muslims will leave in June 2007 for [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Qatar]] to seek donations and funding for the new school, since these two countries are well known for their strong contributions to the Muslim community in Australia and New Zealand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2314">'''JESNA''' ('''Jewish Education Service of North America''') is the [[Jewish federation]] system’s educational coordinating, planning, and development agency. A national, non-profit agency, it was created in 1981.  It closed in 2013.

== Role ==

Over the past twenty-five years (until 2013), the agency provided service and created partnerships with a wide array of organizations and individuals, including Federations, the religious movements, national agencies, foundations, and many educational institutions.

JESNA‘s goal was to increase the availability of engaging, inspiring, high quality Jewish education. Operating as a national resource, a community partner, a catalyst and a consultant, an innovator and a guarantor of quality, JESNA helped to: recruit and prepare new generations of talented, committed Jewish educators; create and identify models of excellence in educational practice; and assist communities and front-line institutions in improving their programs and performance.

JESNA worked closely with the central agencies for Jewish education that operate in more than 60 communities and the Jewish federations in more than 150 communities throughout [[North America]].

== Structure ==

It was governed by a board of directors composed of lay and professional leaders in [[Jewish education]] from across North America, including individuals from the major Jewish religious movements.

The Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people&lt;ref&gt;[https://qz.com/459422/how-indian-families-took-over-the-antwerp-diamond-trade-from-orthodox-jews/ Around 400 families.

Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9rzvM0K48yMC&amp;pg=PA104 |title=Diaspora, Development, and Democracy: The Domestic Impact of International ... - Devesh Kapur - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2010-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have built building a major temple in [[Wilrijk]] (near Antwerp), with a cultural centre, which was consecrated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuleuven.be/icrid/religies/wr_eng_jainism.htm |title=Interdisciplinair Centrum Religiestudie &amp; Interlevensbeschouwelijke Dialoog – Faculteit Theologie en religiewetenschappen KU Leuven |language=nl |publisher=Kuleuven.be }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their spiritual leader, Ramesh Mehta, is a full-fledged member of the [[Belgian Council of Religious Leaders]] put up on 17 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aartsbisdom.be/Z-News/BCRL_opening.html|title=Presentation of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders|date=17 December 2009|publisher=Orthodox Archdiocese of Belgium and Exarchate of the Netherlands and Luxemburg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703214919/http://www.aartsbisdom.be/Z-News/BCRL_opening.html|archivedate=3 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain community in Europe, especially in Belgium, is mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/religion/jainism.html |title=An Introduction to Jainism: History, Religion, Gods, Scriptures and Beliefs |publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Jains starting arriving in Belgium in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geographical.co.uk/people/cultures/item/2679-antwerp-s-humble-diamantaires  Antwerp’s humble diamantaires, Estelle Hakner, Geographical, March 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; They initially traded low quality rough diamonds, with very small margins of profit, while the local Jewish merchants dealt in larger stones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/antwerp-s-diamond-business-jews-surrender-gem-trade-to-indians-a-416243.html  Jews Surrender Gem Trade to Indians,  Erich Wiedemann, DEM SPIEGEL, May 15, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; These were sent to India for cutting and polishing, where labour costs were much lower. Gradually they started dealing in larger diamonds.

In 1992, The Jain Cultural Centre of Antwerpen VZW was formed with 12 committee members and 52 founder members. Land for a [[Jain temple]] and a meditation centre ([[Upashray]]) was purchased. In 2001, construction of Antwerp Jain temple and meditation hall began. In 2007, Jain idol's Anjanshalaka took place on 31 January in India and was performed by Jain ascetics Acharya Shri Subodhsagarsuriswarji, Acharya Shri Manohar Kiritisagarsuriswarji, Acharya Udaykirtisagarsuriswarji and Shri Narendra Hiralal. It was necessary to do that in India because the orthodox jain monks still do not travel overseas. In 2008, on 25 August the idols were brought to Antwerp by air, this was followed by a huge procession. In 2010, on 27 August, the Idol's [[pratistha]] was performed.&lt;br /&gt;
Principal deity of this temple is [[Parshvanatha]], 23rd tirthankara of Jainism.

'''James P. Carroll''' (born January 22, 1943, [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=agfvVQnBu9MC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159 ''Ireland and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History : A Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia'' Volume 2, 2008, pg. 159, ed. James Patrick Byrne, Philip Coleman, and Jason Francis King]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American author, historian, and journalist. A [[Roman Catholic]] reformer, he has written extensively about his experiences in the seminary and as a priest, and has published, besides novels, books on religion and history.

==Youth, education, and service as a priest==
Carroll was born in Chicago, the second of five sons of late Air Force General [[Joseph Carroll (DIA)]], and his wife Mary. At the time, his father was a Special Agent of the [[FBI]], which he remained until being seconded to, and later commissioned by, the [[US Air Force]] as an Intelligence Officer in 1948. After this, Carroll was raised in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area and in [[Germany]]. He was educated at Washington's Priory School (now [[St. Anselm's Abbey School]]) and at an American high school, the [[Wiesbaden High School|H. H. Arnold]], in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''House of War'', p. 146 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Georgetown University]] before entering [[St. Paul's College, Washington, D.C.|St. Paul's College]], the [[Paulist Fathers]]' [[seminary]], where he received his B.A. and M.A. degrees.

He was ordained to the priesthood in 1969. Carroll served as Catholic chaplain at [[Boston University]] from 1969 to 1974. During that time, he studied poetry with [[George Starbuck]] and published books on religious subjects and a book of poems. He was also a columnist for the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' (1972–1975) and was named Best Columnist by the [[Catholic Press Association]]. For his writing on religion and politics he received the first Thomas Merton Award from [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[Thomas Merton Center (Pittsburgh)|Thomas Merton Center]] in 1972. Carroll left the priesthood and the Paulist Fathers in 1974 to become a writer, and, in the same year, was a playwright-in-residence at the [[Berkshire Theater Festival]]. On May 20, 2013 he received the honorary Doctor of Letters from [[Lehigh University]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

==Literary career==
Carroll's plays have been produced at the Berkshire Theater Festival and at [[Boston]]'s Next Move Theater. In 1976 he published his first novel, ''Madonna Red'', which was followed by nine others.  He has written for numerous publications, including ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and his op-ed column appears weekly in ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. He won the 1996 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]] for ''An American Requiem: God, My Father, and the War That Came Between Us'',&lt;ref name=nba1996&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1996|title=1996 National Book Awards Winners and Finalists, The National Book Foundation|publisher=Nationalbook.org|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a memoir about the Vietnam War and his relationships with his father, the American military, and the Catholic Church.  In an interview with the New York Times, Carroll explained why he wrote it: "I thought I would feel better.  One of the effects of telling the story as I experienced it was for it to be redeemed, made meaningful.  At the end, I found myself deeply in touch with the tragic aspect of the life we live.  It's a highfalutin word, but there's something tragic to the story I told."  Nevertheless, after completing it, he said, instead of feeling relief, "I put my head down, and I wept."&lt;ref&gt;John Tagliabue, "Exorcising Demons From a Long-Ago War," New York Times, November 14, 1996, p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of other books on religion and politics, including ''House of War'', which won the first [[PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award]] for non-fiction. Mr. Carroll's other works include the novels ''Secret Father'', ''The City Below'', ''Memorial Bridge'', ''Prince of Peace'', ''Mortal Friends'', and ''Madonna Red'', in addition to various plays and ''Forbidden Disappointments'', a book of poetry published in 1974. Carroll's work has received the Melcher Book Award, the [[Interfaith Center of New York|James Parks Morton Interfaith Award]], and [[National Jewish Book Award]] in History, and has been frequently been named among the Notable Books of the Year by ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Carroll has been a Shorenstein Fellow at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] and a Fellow at the Center for the Study of Values in Public Life at the [[Harvard Divinity School]]. He is a trustee of the [[Boston Public Library]], a member of the Advisory Board of the International Center for Ethics, Justice, and Public Life at [[Brandeis University]], and a member of the Dean's Council at the Harvard Divinity School. Carroll is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and is a member of the Academy's Committee on International Security Studies. He worked on his 2006 history of [[the Pentagon]], ''House of War'', as a Scholar-in-Residence at the Academy. Carroll is also a Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence at [[Suffolk University]] in Boston, where he wrote his latest book, ''Practicing Catholic'', published in 2009.

==''Constantine's Sword''==
Carroll wrote a history of Christianity, specifically [[Roman Catholicism]], [[anti-Semitism]] and treatment of Jews, titled ''[[Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews]]'' (2001). In this work, he connects many personal experiences, especially his boyhood trips to Catholic pilgrimage sites in the [[Rhineland]], and as a seminarian and priest, to the places and events that he analyzes. The book was a [[New York Times Best Seller]], although it got mixed reviews. The book also earned Carroll several accolades from national newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

Carroll co-wrote and presented the 2007 documentary ''[[Constantine's Sword (film)|Constantine's Sword]]'' with filmmaker [[Oren Jacoby]].

==''Practicing Catholic'' book==
In a 2009 book, he denounced [[Pope Benedict XVI]] as "the chief sponsor of the new Catholic fundamentalism, enforced with no regard for the real cost to human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/books/review/Miles-t.html?em |title=Book Reviews|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Carroll married the novelist Alexandra Marshall in 1977.  They have two grown children.

[[File:UnivUnitChurchHoustonTX.JPG|thumb|The LGBT flag at the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Houston indicates that the church welcomes LGBT-identifying persons]]

Many Christian denominations do not consider [[homosexuality]] or [[transgender]] identity to be [[sin]]s. These include entire [[religious denomination]]s, as well as individual [[church (building)|churches]] and congregations. Some are composed mainly of non-LGBT members and also have specific programs to welcome LGBT people, while others are composed mainly of LGBT members. 

Additionally, some denominations which are not LGBT-affirming have member-organized groups which are not officially sanctioned by the denomination. There are also [[ecumenical]] or para-church programmes that are explicitly outreaches to LGBT people, but do not identify with any particular faith tradition or denomination.

==History==

Today some Christian denominations are accepting of homosexuality and transgender identity and inclusive of homosexual and transgender people, such as the [[United Church of Christ]] and the [[Metropolitan Community Church]]. Formed in 1991, The Evangelical Network is a network of evangelical churches, ministries and Christian Workers that are a part of the LGBT community. The Evangelical Network holds an annual conference and provides education, ministerial support, and networking capabilities.

In 1946, Archbishop [[George Hyde (clergyman)|George Hyde]] of the Eucharistic Catholic Communion (a small denomination not in union with the Roman Catholic Church) celebrated [[mass]] for gay men in Atlanta. In 1956, the Church of ONE Brotherhood was founded in Los Angeles by a gay-rights activist.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ"/&gt; In 1962, a Congregationalist pastor began an overt pastoral ministry to gay people in New York City.  The first gay and transgender-specific denomination, as opposed to individual congregations, was the [[Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ"/&gt;

Some congregations are merely non-discriminatory and LGBT-affirming while others are specifically oriented toward gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ"/&gt; Some local congregations, especially those designated as "Welcoming churches" in the Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, United Church of Christ, Methodist, Episcopal, and Brethren/Mennonite denominations, may consist of a majority of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender members.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ"&gt;{{ cite web | url= http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/gay_lesbian_churches.html | title = Gay and Lesbian Churches and Synagogues | publisher = GLBTQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Unitarian Universalism]] is no longer explicitly a Christian religion, it does have [[Judeo-Christian]] roots. Both the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] have officially affirmed LGBT people and have openly advocated for [[gay rights]].

After World War II most of these hospitals were at least partially rehabilitated, and eventually passed to the control of the Government of the [[People's Republic of China]], but are still functioning as hospitals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14428">'''Matthew 5:32''' is the thirty-second verse of the fifth chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]] and is part of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]. This much scrutinized verse contains part of [[Jesus]]' teachings on the issue of [[divorce]].

==Text==
The original [[Koine Greek]], according to [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], reads:
:{{lang|grc|ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι πᾶς ὁ ἀπολύων τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ}}
:{{lang|grc|παρεκτὸς λόγου πορνείας ποιεῖ αὐτὴν μοιχευθῆναι}}
:{{lang|grc|[καὶ ὃς ἐὰν ἀπολελυμένην γαμήσῃ μοιχᾶται]}}

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, ''saving'' 
:''for the cause of fornication'', causeth her to commit adultery: and 
:whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.

The [[New International Version]] translates the passage as:
:But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, ''except for'' 
:''marital unfaithfulness'', causes her to become an adulteress, and 
:anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.

The [[New American Bible]] translates this passage as:
:But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (''unless the'' 
:''marriage is unlawful'') causes her to commit adultery, 
:and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=5:32&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 5:32]

Divorce is discussed in several other parts of the Bible. [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] 2:16 has God disapproving of divorce, but [[Deuteronomy]] 24:1–4 makes clear that it is acceptable under certain circumstances (see [[Christian views on divorce]]). A very similar pronouncement on divorce is made by Jesus at [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 16:18 and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 10:11, however neither of those two make an exception for {{lang|grc|πορνεία}}/''porneia''. [[Paul of Tarsus]] quotes Jesus ("not I but the Lord") in [[1 Corinthians]] 7:10–11 with no exceptions granted although he ("I and not the Lord") [[Pauline privilege|goes on to give exceptions]]. [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 19:9 discusses the same issue, and does include the same exception as this verse.

==Teaching of Christian Churches==
{{Main|Christian views on divorce}}
===Protestant views===
One of the most debated issues is over the exception to the ban on divorce, which the KJV translates as "saving for the cause of fornication." The [[Koine Greek]] word in the exception is ''{{lang|grc|πορνείας}}/porneia'', and it literally translates as ''sexual immorality'' (which some interpret to mean ''[[fornication]]'').  One view is that it should be more specifically translated as ''[[adultery]]'' or ''marital unfaithfulness''. Instone-Brewer rejects this translation arguing that contemporary sources make clear ''porneia'' meant more than just adultery, he does not agree with the most liberal translations that have the word also refer to things such as spousal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Instone-Brewer p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of first century [[Iudaea Province]], [[Pharisees|Pharisaic Judaism]] was divided between two major groups. The dominant teaching was that of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], who taught that divorce could be granted on a wide array of grounds, even because a wife burnt a dinner. [[Shammai]] took a more conservative opinion, arguing that only adultery was valid grounds for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Instone-Brewer p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

Current mainstream theories of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are that they are based upon a single writer whose original verse is that of Mark, with Matthew being the most intended to communicate with the Jewish community.  Some scholars feel that in Matthew 5:32 Jesus is endorsing the view of Shammai over Hillel, and arguing for the adultery only rule. [[Protestant]] churches have traditionally read ''{{lang|grc|πορνείας}}/porneia'' as adultery. The main argument against this translation is that Matthew has just been discussing adultery in the previous antithesis, and there used the specific term ''{{lang|grc|μοιχεύσεις}}/moicheia'', rejecting the vaguer ''{{lang|grc|πορνείας}}/porneia.''

Following their reading of the verse, Protestant churches give prominence to the Gospel of Matthew over Mark and Luke and accepted adultery as a valid grounds for divorce.  They also often believe that an innocent divorcee can freely remarry afterwards. 

According to [[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament'', commentary on the ''Apostolic Decree'' of the [[Council of Jerusalem]]: "it is possible ... (fornication means) marriage within the prohibited Levitical degrees (Lv 18.6-18), which the rabbis described as "forbidden for porneia," or mixed marriages with pagans (Nu 25.1; also compare 2 Cor 6.14), or participation in pagan worship which had long been described by Old Testament prophets as spiritual adultery and which, in fact, offered opportunity in many temples for religious prostitution". Another reading is that the exception refers to the rules surrounding the Jewish [[betrothal]] ritual, linking this to [[Matthew 1:19]], and has no relevance to the modern world. 

Other scholars take the opposite view, arguing that the exception was not mentioned in the other Gospels because it was so obvious as to be implicit to contemporary readers. [[Leviticus 20:10]] makes clear the punishment for adultery is death, so to Jesus's Jewish audience it would be assumed that adultery meant that the marriage would be over. While at the time of Jesus, and in modern societies, capital punishment is not imposed for adultery several scholars still feel the death sentence is important.&lt;ref name="France123"&gt;{{cite book |first1=R.T. |last1=France |title=The Gospel According to Matthew: an Introduction and Commentary |location=Leicester|publisher=Inter-Varsity |date=1985|page=123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] argued that since in the eyes of God an adulterer was dead, their spouse was free to remarry. More evidence for this view comes from [[Genesis 2:24]], which makes clear that the sexual act permanently joins two individuals, so adultery can be understood to have created a new bond erasing the old one. 

Another view is that the exception is not a part of Jesus's teaching, but rather a comment indicating that adultery automatically led to divorce under the law of the time, and that Jesus may very well have disagreed with this law. Instone-Brewer sees no evidence that this is how the law worked in that era, however.&lt;ref&gt;Instone-Brewer {{page number needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That adultery is a valid reason for divorce is the standard Protestant position, though some churches disagree. This interpretation was first advanced by [[Desiderius Erasmus]],&lt;ref&gt;Davies &amp; Dale p.80&lt;/ref&gt;  and received the backing of Martin Luther, [[John Calvin]], and most other major Protestant thinkers. Some Protestants took an even broader view. [[Reformation in Switzerland|Swiss reformers]] [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[Heinrich Bullinger]] both read ''porneia'' as referring to all manner of marital immorality, including [[spousal abuse]] and abandonment. Anglican Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]], who served under [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], listed a considerable number of valid reasons for divorce, but this never became standard [[Anglican doctrine]]. The [[Church of England]] instead took a far more restrictive view, and adultery was one of the only legal reasons for divorce in Britain up to the twentieth century. The same was true in many parts of the British Empire and the United States.

The [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22, 23). We deplore the evils of divorce and remarriage. We regard adultery as the only scripturally justifiable grounds for divorce; and the party guilty of adultery has by his or her act forfeited membership in the church. In the case of divorce for other cause, neither party shall be permitted to marry again during the lifetime of the other; and violation of this law shall be punished by expulsion from the church (Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:11, 12). In the carrying out of these principles, guilt shall be established in accordance with judicial procedures set forth in ''The Discipline''.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many mainline Protestants churches have accepted a broader translation of ''porneia'' than just adultery, and now support a wide array of valid reasons for divorce. One modern view is that, since throughout the Sermon on the Mount Jesus condemns the excessive [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]] of his day, delineating specific views of divorce from the exact wording of a piece of scripture should be rejected. Several major churches today believe that rules for divorce should be set to best advance Jesus's overarching goals of love and justice, rather than a legalistic interpretation of his words.

===Orthodox view===
The [[Orthodox Church]] has also recognized this verse as permitting divorce for adultery and other reasons, such as spousal abuse, abandonment, and apostasy. In Eastern Orthodox practice, churches are to allow  penitential remarriage up to two times after a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Davies &amp; Dale p.81&lt;/ref&gt; A first marriage is celebrated, a second performed, a third tolerated, and a fourth prohibited.

==Reasoning against divorce==
{{Original research section|date=July 2017}}
The verse is important in that it gives a clear argument against divorce as well as an exception that allows divorce, yet it is ambiguous due to mistranslation of the article "the/a," "which may refer to "the" woman who has been divorced because of her own adultery or "a" woman who is divorced for no reason. With the article "a" assumed, Jesus makes clear that while the divorce may not adversely affect the male, it is forbidden because it forces his wife into sin if she is innocent because women needed to be married to survive. However, if "the divorced woman" in the verse refers to the woman who has been divorced because of adultery, the passage means, "whoever marries an adulteress is an adulterer," a meaning that is implied in the King James Version and directly stated in the NIV. This second, more rational meaning is also suggested by the fact that no other version of this statement in the Gospels holds that marrying an unjustly divorced woman is adultery. All other versions of this statement make clear that the one who commits adultery and divorces is the one and only adulterer, which allows the abandoned spouse to remarry.

Some scholars believe that since in this era a woman had few legal rights, she was dependent on her husband for survival. It was thus assumed that a divorced woman would always remarry. Jesus makes clear, only if one accepts the grammatically unsupported interpretation that any remarriage is adultery, that the sin of divorce without cause is in the adulterous nature of a future remarriage, and thus in many jurisdictions where divorce was legal restrictions were still placed on remarriage. This verse does not say whether a second marriage for a divorced man would also be adulterous, but [[Matthew 19:9]] makes clear that the spouse who abandons the relationship for another, and only that spouse, is to be considered the adulterer. This reasoning also explains the logic of the exception for adultery. If the reason to stay married is to not force one's wife to engage in an adulterous second marriage, then if she has already engaged in adultery on her own this justification disappears. Basically, one shouldn't divorce a faithful spouse but may divorce an unfaithful spouse and remarry.

The reasons Jesus imposed these new rules have also been much discussed. Some scholars feel that under the liberal divorce policy of Hillel men had been marrying woman and then casually divorcing them after they lost interest, deeply injuring the women. As mentioned a divorce could endanger a woman's very survival. Thus some have read Jesus' teachings here as a defense of the rights of the downtrodden wives. Feminist scholar Levine rejects this view. She notes that in this era elaborate [[prenuptial agreement]]s were negotiated prior to every marriage, and that they invariably included steep financial penalties, known as [[ketubah]], paid by the husband in case of divorce, guaranteeing the wife financial well being even in the case of divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Amy-Jill |last1=Levine |editor-first1=Carol A.  |editor-last1=Newsom |editor-first2=Sharon H.  |editor-last2=Ringe |chapter=Matthew |title=Women's Bible Commentary |location=Louisville |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |date=1998 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view, if separated from the grammatically chauvinistic moniker of "feminist" research and merely considered research like any other written by any woman or man, supports the view that the main reason Jesus spoke in this way is that adultery is cruel and, hence, against God's nature; hence, a cheated-on spouse, as repeated throughout the New Testament in other more clear and concise verses, is free to remarry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">'''Meir ben Judah Leib Poppers''' or '''Meir ben Judah Loeb Ha-Kohen Ashkenazi Poppers''' ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 1624–1662) was a [[Bohemian]] rabbi and [[kabbalist]]. He was born in [[Prague]] and died in [[Jerusalem]] in February or March, 1662.

He studied the Kabbala under [[Israel Ashkenazi]] and [[Jacob Zemah]], and he wrote a great number of works, all in the spirit of [[Isaac Luria]]; thirty-nine of them have "Or" as the beginning of their titles, in reference to his name "Meir." His works which have been published are: ''Or Ẓaddiḳim'' ([[Hamburg]], 1690), a mystical methodology, or exhortation to asceticism, based upon Isaac Luria's writings, the Zohar, and other moral works (an enlarged edition of this work was published later under the title ''Or Ha-Yashar'' [Fürth, 1754]); ''Or Pene Melek'', a treatise on the mysteries of the prayers and commandments, condensed and published under the title ''Sefer Kavanot Tefillot u-Mizvot'' (Hamburg, 1690); ''Me'ore Or'', an alphabetical arrangement of the kabbalistic sacred names found in Isaac Luria's ''Sefer Ha-Kavanot,'' published by [[Elijah ben Azriel]], with the commentary ''Ya'ir Natib'' of [[Nathan Mannheimer]] and [[Jacob ben Benjamin Wolf]], under the title ''Me'orot Natan'' ([[Frankfort-on-the-Main]], 1709); ''Mesillot Ḥokmah'' ([[Shklov]], 1785), regulations and rules for the study of the Kabbala.

Among his unpublished works the following may be mentioned: ''Or Rab'', a commentary on the Zohar; ''Or ha-Abuḳah'', a treatise on the Kabbala; ''Or Zarua'', a commentary on [[Hayyim Vital]]'s ''Derek 'Eẓ ha-Ḥayyim''; ''Or Ner'', on the transmigration of souls; ''Or Ẓaḥ'', on the order in which souls are linked together; ''Derushim 'al ha-Torah'', homilies on the [[Pentateuch]]; ''Matoḳ ha-Or'', a cabalistic commentary on the [[Aggadah]] of the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash|Midrash Rabbah]].

He is buried on the [[Mount of Olives]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1773">'''Mu'adh ibn Muslim ibn Mu'adh''' was a general and governor for the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

He was a Persian from [[Khuttal]] or [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], who converted and became a ''[[mawla]]'' of the [[Banu Dhuhl]] tribe. He participated in the [[Abbasid Revolution]] in 737/738, and was a partisan of [[Abu Muslim]]. In 766, he was among the army of [[Marw al-Rudh]] which was defeated by the rebel [[al-Muqanna]]. He served as governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] in 778–780, and fought against the [[Alids]] in 785/786. He probably died shortly after.

He was closely connected to the Abbasid family, and his family continued to enjoy high office: one of his sons, Husayn, was a foster-brother of Caliph [[al-Hadi]], while another son, [[Yahya ibn Mu'adh ibn Muslim|Yahya]], served as governor of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] and [[Arminiya|Armenia]].

'''Phil Solomon''' is an American [[experimental film]]maker noted for his work with both film and video. Recently, Solomon has earned acclaim for a series of films that incorporate [[machinima]] made using games from the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academichack.net/solomon.htm Reprinted from Cinemascope #30: Phil Solomon Visits San Andreas and Escapes, Not Unscathed: Notes on Two Recent Works].

Solomon was an associate of the influential American experimental filmmaker [[Stan Brakhage]], with whom he taught film at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]. Solomon and Brakhage collaborated on three films. In a 1992 poll for the British film magazine [[Sight &amp; Sound]], Brakhage picked Solomon's ''Remains to Be Seen'' as one of the ten greatest films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/the7thart/directorlist.html&amp;date=October 25, 2009+22:49:13 Directors' Top Ten]. Webcitation.org. Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The film had previously been selected as one of the top ten films of 1989 by the ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canyoncinema.com/S/Solomon.html Canyon Cinema: The Films of Phil Solomon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907121547/http://www.canyoncinema.com/S/Solomon.html |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.creative-capital.org/grantee_182.html Creative Capital: Philip S. Solomon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808053141/http://channel.creative-capital.org/grantee_182.html |date=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was the recipient of the Thatcher Hoffman Smith Award from the University of Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cim.ou.edu/About.htm The Thatcher Hoffman Smith Award]. Cim.ou.edu. Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Solomon received the Knight Fellowship of the USA ([[United States Artists]]) Fellows program, alongside such luminaries as novelist Annie Proulx, sculptor Alison Saar, jazz musician Jack DeJohnette, dancer and choreographer Trisha Brown, and artist Theaster Gates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usafellows.org/fellow/phil_solomon&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2010, Solomon's ''American Falls'' opened at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. The six-projection video/sound installation received great acclaim before closing in July 2010.  In conjunction with the Corcoran exhibition, Solomon's career as a filmmaker was explored in "Rhapsodies in Silver,"  a three-program survey at Washington's [[National Gallery of Art]].

A re-edited, feature-length, single-projection version of ''American Falls'' was featured at the New York Film Festival's "Views from the Avant Garde" on October 1, 2010. The single projection version of the film condenses the original multi-projector format into a triptych, placing three independent (yet associative) images next to one another. In Fall 2012, Solomon screened a three-channel version of ''American Falls'' at the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in Astoria, New York, as part of the exhibition "Film After Film."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2012/09/15/detail/phil-solomon-american-falls-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the May/June 2010  [[Film Comment]] poll, The Top 50 Avant-Garde Filmmakers of the Decade, Phil Solomon placed at number 5, tied with his late colleague, Stan Brakhage.&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.filmlinc.com/film-comment/article/best-of-the-decade-avant-garde&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Originally from New York City, Solomon attended [[Binghamton University]]&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006"&gt;[http://www.cinemad.iblamesociety.com/2006/12/phil-solomon.html Cinemad: Interview with Phil Solomon]. Cinemad.iblamesociety.com (November 18, 2005). Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and received an MFA from the [[Massachusetts College of Art]]. One of Solomon's instructors was the experimental filmmaker [[Ken Jacobs]], who started his first class with a screening of [[Tony Conrad]]'s film ''[[The Flicker]]''. Solomon initially disliked the film, but the experience, followed by a screening of his future collaborator [[Stan Brakhage]]'s ''[[Blue Moses (film)|Blue Moses]]'', had a profound impact on his development as a filmmaker.&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt; Another formative experience came in the form of a lecture by critic [[Fred Camper]] on Brakhage's ''[[Anticipation of the Night]]''.&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt;

Solomon began making films in 1975. Solomon has since destroyed some of his early works,&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt; many of which were made in imitation of Brakhage.

Solomon has been teaching at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] since 1991.

The majority of the Greenlandic population is [[Christian]] and associates with the [[Church of Denmark]], which is [[Protestant]] in classification and [[Lutheran]] in orientation. The Church of Denmark is the [[State religion|established church]] through the [[Constitution of Denmark]]; this applies to all of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], except for the [[Faroe Islands]], as the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] became independent in 2007. But traditional Inuit spiritual beliefs remain strong in many of Greenland's remote communities.

==Christianity==
[[Lutheranism]], mostly represented by the Church of Denmark, is the predominant religious category within [[Christianity]], followed by small communities of [[Baptists]], [[Mormons]], [[Roman Catholics]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Seventh-day Adventists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/Greenland/Religion |title=Greenland Religion Stats |website=NationMaster.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[Christianity]] was first brought to Greenland in 1000 by Norse settlers. For reasons of climate and snowstorms, the Norse settlers left the island.

By the 18th century, the Norse returned. When Norway and [[Denmark]] separated in 1814, Greenland remained Danish, though with a certain degree of autonomy necessitated by its remoteness.

Ethnographically 80% of the population is divided between the [[Inuit]] population and population mixed with Inuit and [[Danes|Danish]]. It is said that the Inuit population is descended from Siberians who crossed from Asia to North America on that island. In Greenland although less than 1% of the residents practice Inuit spiritual beliefs, within the culture of Greenland, the presence of shamanism is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacred-texts.com/nam/inu/index.htm |title=Inuit Religion |website=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2006, the [[Indonesia]]n Ministers of [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Religious Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Indonesia)|Home Affairs]] issued a decree that is commonly referred to as the '''Joint Decree on Houses of Worship'''.  The decree issued as Ministry of Religious Affairs decree No. 9 of 2006 and Ministry of Home Affairs decree No. 8 of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Ropi | first=Ismatu | publication-date=1 January 2007 | title=Regulating worship | magazine=Inside Indonesia | issue=89 | pages=7–8 | url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-89/regulating-worship-1407013 | accessdate=3 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rrt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrt-rrt.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/88/idn31419.pdf.aspx |title= Research Response IDN31419 (Indonesia) |date=9 March 2007 |work=Country Advice |publisher=Refugee Review Tribunal |location=Sidney, NSW |pages=5- |format=PDF |accessdate=13 Oct 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A translation of the full title is "Regulation of Duties of Regional Head and Deputy in Maintaining Religious Harmony, Empowering the Forum of Religious Harmony, and Constructing Places of Worship".

== Background ==
The decree is a revision of a joint decree&lt;ref&gt;''Surat Keputusan Bersama Menag dan Mendagri Nomor 1/1969''.  Also referred to as "Joint Decree of the Minister of Religious Affairs and the Minister of Home Affairs No.1/BER/MDN-MAD/1969 concerning the Implementation of the Task of Government Officials to Ensure the Order and Undisturbed Implementation of the Religious Development and Practices by its Adherents".&lt;/ref&gt; issued in 1969 by the Indonesian Home Affairs Minister and Religious Affairs Minister and which covers building houses of prayer. In 1967-1969, churches were attacked, sometimes destroyed, on Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Java.  These violent episodes appeared to have been triggered by construction of buildings for religious minorities.  In response, on 13 September 1969, the Ministers of Religion and Home Affairs issued Joint Ministerial Decree 1/1969 to control construction of places of worship and to govern religious practices in general.&lt;ref name="crouch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crouch |first1=Melissa |editor1-first=Jackson |editor1-last=Peter A |title=Implementing the Regulation on Places of Worship in Indonesia: New Problems, Local Politics and Court Action |journal=Asian Studies Review |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10357823.2010.527921 |accessdate=5 Oct 2011 |volume=34 |year=2010 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= |oclc= |doi=10.1080/10357823.2010.527921 |issn=1467-8403 |pages=403–419 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date=1 May 2009 | title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 - The Commission's Watch List: Indonesia | work= | publisher=United States Commission on International Religious Freedom | url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIRF,,IDN,,4a4f272d8,0.html | accessdate=14 Oct 2011 | quote=Local government officials also have sought to mediate between militant groups and religious minorities in some cases, but sometimes acquiesce to pressure from militants and revoke permits for longstanding places of worship or allow the destruction of religious venues operating without permits. In response to persistent criticism from religious minorities and international observers over the number of religious venues closed or destroyed in Indonesia, the Ministry of Religion issued Joint Ministerial Decree 1/2006 to replace a previous, vaguely-worded decree that required religious groups to gain "community approval" before they could expand, renovate, or open new religious venues.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements ==
According to Article 14 of the 2006 decree, a permit for constructing a house of worship should issue when the applicant obtains: 
* a list of 90 members of the proto-congregation;
* signatures from 60 local households of a different faith;
* a written recommendation from the regency or municipal religious affairs office;
* a written recommendation from the local interfaith harmony forum (FKUB&lt;ref&gt;Joint Forum for Religious Tolerance or ''Forum Kerukunan Umat Beragama'' in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]&lt;/ref&gt;); and
* approval from the [[Districts of Indonesia|subdistrict]] head.

Article 14 requires local governments to find an alternative or temporary venue for services if the group cannot meet one of the requirements.  Article 21 requires that local governments fairly mediate disputes.&lt;ref name="Ridwan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Govt told to revoke decree on houses of worship |author=Ridwan Max Sijabat |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/09/15/govt-told-revoke-decree-houses-worship.html |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=15 Sep 2010 |accessdate= |quote= }} Includes translated portions of Articles 13, 14, and 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78774.htm |title=Indonesia |date=6 Mar 2007 |work=2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices |publisher=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |location=Washington, D.C. |at=Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including: c.

The petition must then be approved by both the local head of the Religious Affairs Department and the local office of the Communication Forum for Religious Harmony. The joint ministerial decree was in part a response to attacks on unregistered houses of worship. The decree was intended to make it easier to open houses of worship by reducing the number of other community members who must sign the petition. Some groups criticized the new rules for retaining the requirement that community members consent to establishment of houses of worship. These groups also noted that the high number of congregation members required to sign the petition limited the ability of small congregations to register and to exercise their constitutional right to freedom of worship.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date=1 May 2009 | title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 - The Commission's Watch List: Indonesia | work= | publisher=United States Commission on International Religious Freedom | url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIRF,,IDN,,4a4f272d8,0.html | accessdate=14 Oct 2011 | quote=Decree 1/2006 requires a religious group with a membership of more than 90 persons to obtain the support of 60 local residents for any plans to build or expand a religious venue. That petition must then be sent to the Joint Forum for Religious Tolerance (FKUB), a provincial panel of religious leaders chosen proportionally by the number of religious adherents in the province. If there remains strong community opposition to the religious venue, the FKUB can find an alternative location.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns ==
While the government of Indonesia asserted that the purpose of the 2006 decree was to [[Interfaith dialogue|reduce inter-faith conflict]], many persons and organizations assert that the decree is [[Constitution of Indonesia#Chapter XI: Religion|unconstitutional]],&lt;ref name="Ridwan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SETARA"&gt;{{Citation | title=Mengenali Lokus Diskriminasi dalam PBM Dua Menteri |trans-title=Recognizing Locus of Discrimination in the Joint Ministerial Regulation | publisher=SETARA Institute | place=Bendungan Hilir, Indonesia | date= 23 Sep 2010 | url=http://www.setara-institute.org/sites/setara-institute.org/files/reports/101124-100923-pbm-discriminate.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=13 Oct 2011 | page=6 | quote=The Joint Ministerial Decrees are flawed constitutionally since they are contrary to the guarantees of the freedom enshrined in the Indonesian Constitution.

Prominent Muslim religious leaders have stated publicly that the new decree might violate Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Overall, the number of church, temple, and mosque closures has declined slightly since Joint Ministerial Decree 1/2006 was issued. In addition, over the past year, the Ministry of Religion has made efforts to establish provincial FKUB panels. Former President Abdurrahman Wahid has commended the "sincere efforts" of FKUB panels to promote religious tolerance, but added that without sufficient "control, evaluation, monitoring ... and sanctions" the panels can be "used to promote the interests of the majority religion." Indeed, despite the existence of FKUB panels, Hindu and Christian groups report that they are sometimes refused building permits even though they have accumulated the necessary signatures. For example, five Protestant churches in North Bekasi, Jabotabek region, East Jakarta continue to face vandalism and sporadic protests from the group Musholla (Cooperating Bureau of Mosques and Praying Rooms) because they meet in private homes. Although police continue to protect the worship activities of these groups, local officials have refused to grant them permission to build permanent structures, despite their having met the criteria established in the 2006 decree. A similar situation occurred in South Rawa Badak, Koja region, North Jakarta in August 2008, when local officials pressured the pastor of a Protestant church to cease worship activities, despite his having received permission from the FKUB to operate the church.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group goes to court against places of worship decree |first=Muninggar Sri |last=Saraswati |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/03/29/group-goes-court-against-places-worship-decree.html |newspaper=The Jakarta Post | location=Jakarta, Indonesia |date=29 Mar 2006 |accessdate=22 Oct 2011 |quote=Minority groups of Christians and Muslims are seeking judicial review of the new decree on houses of worship that they say will obstruct them from practicing their faiths.

The decree is against the Constitution, the Human Rights Law and the principles of freedom to exercise one's religion and faith,' group leader Saor Siagian said after filing the appeal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others note that the decree's requirements create opportunities for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ministerial decree on houses of worship used for extortion |url=http://bataviase.co.id/node/385411 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=18 Sep 2010 |quote=Chairman of the Bekasi Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI Bekasi) Soaduon Napitupulu said 'everyone wants their share. The interfaith forum members, the city administration officials, not to mention thugs, and even some members of the community,' he told The Jakarta Post Friday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific concerns raised regarding the 2006 decree include:

# Aggressive religious organizations apply pressure on and pay locals to not sign or rescind signatures of petitions.
# The FKUB is not an elected body and is dominated by the local majority religion. Where such majority practitioners are intolerant of other religions, the FKUB effectively vetoes construction of minority religious buildings.&lt;ref name="SETARA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICG114"&gt;{{Citation | title=Indonesia: "Christianisation" and Intolerance -- Asia Briefing No.114 | work= | publisher=International Crisis Group | place=Brussels | date=4 Nov 2010 | pages=9–12 | url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/indonesia/B114%20Indonesia%20-%20Christianisation%20and%20Intolerance.ashx | accessdate=14 Oct 2011 | format=PDF | quote=The refusal of local residents to support the congregation led many in HKBP, rights groups and others to say that the 2006 joint ministerial regulation was discriminatory, violated the right to religious freedom and should be revoked.  Believers should be able to worship where they pleased, they argued, and proportional representation on the religious harmony forums ensured that the majority could always block minorities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Aggressive religious organizations apply pressure on regional entities to not provide recommendations or approve permits for which applicants have otherwise qualified.&lt;ref name="ICG114"/&gt;
# Even if all requirements are met, certain officials have stated that they will not issue permits if any local objections remain.
# Even if the permit is issued, vociferous responses from militant groups have caused local officials to rescind permits or to not protect the applicant's ability to construct or use the building.
# After using FKUB or political influence to prevent issuance of a permit, extremist groups use failure to obtain a permit as a pretext for attacking the applicant congregation when it attempts to meet at the site or elsewhere.

On the other hand, some (including minority religious organizations) have suggested that the 2006 decree is better than nothing.  Such organizations note that the decree provides a minority religious organization with at least a legal argument that it is entitled to a permit.&lt;ref name="ICG114" /&gt;  Such commentators suggest that the decree would be acceptable if implemented in a consistent and expedited manner, with charges of "disturbance of public order" applied to opposing vigilantes rather than applicants.  Further, certain regions appear to be encountering less inter-faith strife than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Papuans build interreligious harmony |url=http://www.regionalinterfaith.org.au/home/south-east-asia-news/245-papuans-build-interreligious-harmony.html | newspaper=Interfaith News |publisher=Regional Interfaith Network |date=14 Feb 2011 |quote=Minority religions in the Mimika district of Indonesian Papua say they have never encountered difficulties in building worship places in the predominantly Protestant province. Muhammad Amin, chairman of the local Indonesian Ulema Council, told ucanews.com that the local government in the district facilitated the building of places of worship including churches, mosques and temples. "We maintain interreligious relations and religious leaders have ensured that their followers have a good understanding of other religions," the Muslim scholar said. Although Protestants are the largest religious community in Papua, they have never discriminated against Muslim and other religious communities, he continued. "Even if there was a problem, they could resolve it through interreligious dialogue," he added. According to Amin, interreligious conflicts in other regions of Indonesia are the result of a lack of religious understanding. "Such conflicts only cause losses," he said, expressing the hope that tensions will not arise among people in the district. Referring to a 2006 joint ministerial decree on the building of worship venues, Amin noted that the decree helps to maintain good interreligious relations. It should not be revised, replaced or revoked, he stated. Piter Rada, who heads the district's office of religious affairs, agreed. "Thank God that there were no religious conflicts triggered by the building of worship venues," he said. Meanwhile, Sacred Heart of Jesus Father Bernardus Kedang of St. Peter's Church in Karang Senang lauded religious leaders who have encouraged their followers to maintain harmony and tolerance. However, he suggested that the joint ministerial decree should be reviewed to ensure that religious conflicts will not recur in other parts of the country.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ricoldo de montecroce &amp; nicolas IV.jpg|thumb|Riccoldo da Monte di Croce and [[Pope Nicolas IV]]]]
'''Riccoldo da Monte di Croce''' or '''Ricoldo of Monte Croce''' ('''Pennini''', that is "son of Pennino"; {{lang-la|Ricoldus de Monte Crucis}}), {{circa}} 1243 – 1320, was an Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monk, travel writer, missionary, and Christian [[apologist]].

==Life==
Riccoldo was born in [[Florence]], and his family name originated from a small castle just above [[Pontassieve]].  After studying in various major European schools, he became a Dominican in 1267, entering the house of [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella|Santa Maria Novella]]. He was a professor in several convents of [[Tuscany]], including St Catherine in [[Pisa]] (1272–99).  With a papal commission to preach he departed for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] (Antiochia Ptolemais) in 1286 or 1287 and made a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] (1288) and then travelled for many years as a missionary in western Asia. He arrived in [[Mossul]] in 1289, equipped with a [[Papal bull]]. He failed to convince the [[Nestorian Christian]] mayor of the city to convert to Catholicism.&lt;ref name="Roux, p.411"&gt;Roux, p.411&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a missionary to the court of the [[Mongol]] [[Il-Khan]] ruler [[Arghun]], of whom he wrote that he was "a man given to the worst of villainy, but for all that a friend of the Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving to [[Baghdad]], Riccoldo entered in conflict with the local Nestorian Christians, preaching against them in their own [[cathedral]]. He was allowed nonetheless by Mongol authorities to build his own church, with the interdiction to preach in public. Riccoldo brought the matter to the Nestorian patriarch [[Mar Yaballaha]], who agreed with him that the doctrine of [[Nestorius]], namely the duality of Christ (thus achieving a theoretical fusion of the [[Latin Church]] and the Church of the East) was heretical. Mar Yaballaha was however disavowed by his own followers.&lt;ref name="Roux, p.411"/&gt;

He returned to Florence before 1302, and was chosen to high offices in his order. He died in Florence on 31 October 1320.

==Works==

===Travels and ''Liber Peregrinacionis''===
His ''Liber Peregrinacionis'' or ''Itinerarius'' (written about 1288–91) was intended as a guide-book for missionaries, and is a description of the Oriental countries he visited.

In 1288 or 1289 he began to keep a record of his experiences in the [[Levant]]; this record he probably reduced to final book form in [[Baghdad]]. Entering [[Syria]] at Acre, he crossed [[Galilee]] to the [[Sea of Tiberias]]; thence returning to Acre he seems to have travelled down the coast to [[Jaffa]], and so up to [[Jerusalem]]. After visiting the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Dead Sea]] he left [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] by the coast road, retracing his steps to Acre and passing on by [[Tripoli]] and [[Tortosa]] into [[Cilicia]]. From the Cilician port of Lajazzo (now [[Yumurtalik]] in [[Turkey]]) he started on the great high road to [[Tabriz]] in north [[Persia]]. Crossing the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] he travelled on by [[Sivas]] of [[Cappadocia]] to [[Erzerum]], the neighborhood of [[Ararat plain|Ararat]] and Tabriz. In and near Tabriz he preached for several months, after which he proceeded to Baghdad via [[Mosul]] and [[Tikrit]]. In Baghdad he stayed several years.

As a traveller and observer his merits are conspicuous. His account of the [[Tatars]] and his sketch of Islamic religion and manners are especially noteworthy. In spite of strong prejudice, he shows remarkable breadth of view and appreciation of merit in systems the most hostile to his own.

===On the Fall of Acre===
The ''Epistolæ de Perditione Acconis'' are five letters in the form of lamentations over the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|fall of Acre]] (written about 1292, published in Paris, 1884).

{{cquote|And so it came to pass that I was in Baghdad, “among the captives by the river of Chebar” [Ezek. 1:1], the [[Tigris]]. This garden of delights in which I found myself enthralled me, for it was like a paradise in its abundance of trees, its fertility, its many fruits. This garden was watered by the rivers of Paradise, and the inhabitants built gilt houses all around it. Yet I was saddened by the massacre and capture of the Christian people. I wept over the loss of Acre, seeing the Saracens joyous and prospering, the Christians squalid and consternated: little children, young girls, old people, whimpering, threatened to be led as captives and slaves into the remotest countries of the East, among barbarous nations.
Suddenly, in this sadness, swept up into an unaccustomed astonishment, I began, stupefied, to ponder God's judgment concerning the government of the world, especially concerning the Saracens and the Christians. What could be the cause of such massacre and such degradation of the Christian people? Of so much worldly prosperity for the perfidious Saracen people? Since I could not simply be amazed, nor could I find a solution to this problem, I decided to write to God and his celestial court, to express the cause of my astonishment, to open my desire through prayer, so that God might confirm me in the truth and sincerity of the Faith, that he quickly put an end to the law, or rather the perfidy, of the Saracens, and more than anything else that he liberate the Christian captives from the hands of the enemies.
::''Epistolae V de perditione Acconis'' (1291), quoted in Tolan 2002, p. xiii}}

===Apologetic writings against Islam and Judaism===
[[File:BNF MS ar 384.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] MS ar. 384, the Arabic manuscript of the Qur'an read by Riccoldo while he was writing his book ''Contra legem Saracenorum'', with Riccoldo's annotations in Latin]]
During his stay in Baghdad, Riccoldo studied the ''[[Qur'an]]'' and other works of [[Islam]]ic theology, for controversial purposes, arguing with [[Nestorian Christian]]s, and writing. In 1300–1301 Riccoldo again appeared in Florence. About 1300 in Florence he wrote ''Contra legem Sarracenorum'' and ''Ad nationes orientales.''

Riccoldo's best known work of this kind was the ''Contra Legem Sarracenorum'', written in Baghdad, which has in previous centuries been very popular among Christians as a polemical source against Islam, and has been often edited (first published in Seville, 1500, under the title ''Confutatio Alcorani'', "Confutation of the Koran").  This work was translated into [[German language|German]] (''Verlegung des Alcoran'') by [[Martin Luther]] in 1542. There are translations into English by Thomas C. Pfotenhauer (''Islam in the Crucible: Can it pass the test?'', Lutheran News, Inc., 2002), and Londini Ensis, under the title, "Refutation of the Koran" (Createspace 2010).

Much of this work's contents derive from those sections of the ''Liber Peregrinacionis'' devoted to Muslim beliefs and related topics.  One of Riccoldo's major sources, extensively quoted in his own work, is the anonymous ''Liber denudationis siue ostensionis aut patefaciens''.&lt;ref&gt;Burman 1994, pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Riccoldo's hostility towards Islam, his work shows specific knowledge of the Qur'an and overcomes one important prejudicial error common to other Medieval [[criticisms of Islam]]: the [[Medieval Christian views on Muhammad|view of Muhammad]] as introducer of a [[Christological]] [[Christian heresy|heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Rizzardi, "Il ''Contra legel Saracenorum'' di Riccoldo di Montecroce: Dipendenza ed originalità nei confronti di san Tommaso," ''Teologia'' 9 (1984), pp. 59–68&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Christianæ Fidei Confessio facta Sarracenis'' (printed in [[Basle]], 1543) is attributed to Riccoldo, and was probably written about the same time as the above-mentioned works. Other works are: ''Contra errores Judæorum'' (Against the Errors of the Jews); ''Libellus contra nationes orientales'' (MSS. at Florence and Paris); ''Contra Sarracenos et Alcoranum'' (MS. at Paris); ''De variis religionibus'' (MS. at Turin; compare the final chapter of the ''Liber Peregrinacionis'', "De variis religionibus terre sancte").  Very probably the last three works were written after his return to Europe. Riccoldo is also known to have written two theological works—a defence of the doctrines of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (in collaboration with John of Pistoia, about 1285) and a commentary on the ''Libri sententiarum'' (before 1288). Riccoldo began a translation of the [[Quran]] about 1290, but it is not known whether this work was completed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1665">'''Saint Joseph's Church''' is situated in [[Frère Orban square]], in the [[Leopold Quarter]], in the center of [[Brussels]]. It is a national sanctuary dedicated to [[Saint Joseph]] who has been [[patron saint]] of Belgium since 1679.

== History and Architecture ==

Inspired by the church of [[Trinità dei Monti]] in Rome, Tilman-François Suys decided to created a church resembling one of Rome's many basilicas with a flat [[apse]] choir. The first stone of the building was laid by [[Cardinal Engelbert Sterckx]] on April 6, 1842. The Apostolic Nuncio, [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Giacomo Cattani]], consecrated the church on June 24, 1874 and also made it the National Shrine of Saint Joseph.

The church was occupied by the [[Redemptorists]] for many [[decade]]s until it was looked after by the [[Syriac Orthodox]] from 1989 to 2001. The church was then acquired by the [[Priory of Christ the King]] of the [[Society of St. Pius X]], offering a much needed place of worship for their growing number of parishioners.

The [[church Building|church]] has three [[nave]]s measuring a total of 66 meters long and 26 meters wide. Its [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] is 18 [[meter]]s high and is supported by two rows of [[Corinthian column]]s that separate the two [[aisle]]s of the main church.

It won Best Animation awards at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] and [[Gijón International Film Festival]], and was named the Best Korean Independent Film of 2013 by the Association of Korean Independent Film &amp; Video.

A blistering critique of organized religion set in a rural village where a manipulative church minister schemes to defraud his flock, ''The Fake'' is Yeon's sophomore feature after the acclaimed and divisive ''[[The King of Pigs]]'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sunwoo|first=Carla|title=''The Fake'' presents a raw look at Christianity, belief in Korea|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2980107|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2014-02-11|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Claire|title=A modern-day Cassandra in rural Korea|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20131107000805|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=2014-02-11|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
With their municipality scheduled to be flooded to make way for the construction of a new [[dam]], the devout denizens of a rural village have placed their faith in Choi Gyeong-seok, a church elder who promises to relocate the flock. Choi tells the villagers they will build a church and a new housing development where they will all be able to live together after the town is completely submerged. He also says that only 144,000 people can go to heaven, and that church offerings are mandatory if one wants to "secure their spot." Even the town's much-revered Reverend Sung, a young and good-looking minister who seemingly has the ability to heal the sick, approves of Choi's plans. Behind his guise of devotion, however, Choi is a practiced [[con man]] posing as a representative of a fake religion; his true aim is to defraud the villagers of their resettlement compensation. The only obstacle to the scheme is Kim Min-chul, a skeptical outcast who accidentally discovers evidence of Choi's past misdeeds and suddenly finds himself becoming the center of resistance against the church institution.

But Min-chul himself is hardly a saint. One of the village's most vile and untrustworthy characters, Min-chul is a low-life neighborhood thug who gambles and drinks too much. He regularly beats his wife and daughter Young-sun, a young factory worker who's been saving up for her lifelong dream of going to college in [[Seoul]].

No one in the village believes Min-chul and his attempts to expose Choi to the authorities fall on deaf ears. But after Young-sun is forced into [[prostitution]] by Choi, Min-chul becomes obsessed with revenge and makes a fateful decision to take matters into his own hands.

==Cast==
*[[Yang Ik-june]] as Kim Min-chul 
*[[Oh Jung-se]] as Sung Chul-woo
*[[Kwon Hae-hyo]] as Choi Gyeong-seok
*[[Park Hee-von]] as Kim Young-sun

==Release==
''The Fake'' went on limited release in South Korea on November 21, 2013. It received almost 22,000 admissions, which is a solid figure for a low-budget [[independent film]].&lt;ref name=akifv /&gt;

The film also had a one-week theatrical run from November 15–20, 2013 at the [[CJ CGV|CGV Cinema]] in [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]], [[Los Angeles]], in order to qualify for submission to the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conran|first=Pierce|title=THE FAKE Submitted for Academy Awards|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&amp;seq=2772|work=Korean Film Council|accessdate=2014-02-11|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not get [[86th Academy Awards|nominated]].

[[Volhv]] '''Veleslav''' (Cyrillic: Волхв Велеслав) (born Ilya Cherkasov (Cyrillic: Илья Черкасов), October 8, 1973), also known as Влх. Велеслав (Vlh. Veleslav)] and V.L.S.L.V., is a Russian [[Rodnover]] priest. He is also an author, artist, poet, teacher and lecturer. Veleslav is the founder of Rodolubie (Rodoljub) and the Veles Circle.&lt;ref name="velesovkrug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velesovkrug.ru/obnovleniya-na-sayte/information-in-english-the-veles-circle.html |title=Information In English - The Veles Circle - Велeсов круг |publisher=Velesovkrug.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early works form the basis of the [[Slavic neopaganism]] movement and its reconstruction. Veleslav is the author of several books on Russian and Slavic traditions, including ''The Doctrine/Teachings of the Magi: The White Book'' (2007, 2nd ed. 2010); ''The Black Book of Mary'' (2008); ''Living Vedas of Russ: Revelations of Native Gods'' (2008); the ''Book of Veles's Tales'' (2005), and "The Book of the Great Navi" (2011), amongst many others. He has also contributed to the first magazine for Rodnovers, "Родноверие".&lt;ref&gt;Issue 2, P. 24[http://rodnoverie.org/vypusk-2.html#/24/][http://www.rodnoverie.org/stati/avtorskie/76-o-rodnoverii.html]. Issue 5, p. 37[http://www.rodnoverie.org/vypusk-5.html#/37/].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Since childhood, Veleslav has been fond of history, and while still a child he enthusiastically read Russian folk tales and epics. He attended the "School of the young historian" at [[Moscow State University]]. Upon leaving for the summer holidays to visit the village of [[#Tver Oblast|Semenovskoe]], near [[Tver]], he listened with great enthusiasm to stories of old "former life" and gathered together local folklore, including songs, stories, plots, bylichki and legends. Seeking an answer to the question about the meaning of life soon led Veleslav to an independent spiritual quest.&lt;ref&gt;See 2012 book "Родные Боги в творчестве славянских художников" by Pavel Tulaev for biography. [http://ateney.ru/old/indexrus.htm Russian], [http://www.ateney.ru/old/indexeng.htm English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svarozhich.net/new/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=276:07-q-q-qq-&amp;catid=3:newsflash&amp;Itemid=55 |title=07 Ноября Встреча с Компетентным Человеком. "Славянская Родная Вера". Волхв Велеслав община "Родолюбие" Москва |publisher=Svarozhich.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Veleslav graduated from high school, but instead of going to the MSU faculty of history and philosophy as his family and friends expected, he announced that he was not interested in a career as a scientist, historian or philosopher, claiming that they  "speak of truth, without knowing her". After sewing together a Russian burlap shirt, he stopped eating meat, cut his hair, and began practicing yoga as well as other spiritual disciplines. At that time in Russia there were many different sects and spiritual teachings, and the ROC began to gain momentum. Veleslav communicated with the followers of these groups and was interested in the essence of their teachings, but he did not join any of them, considering that truth is "realised in the heart, and not by following any doctrine, church dogma, or the partial view of a religious leader."

==Author==
In 1992, Veleslav wrote his first book, "Samizdat", "The Doctrine of the Heart." Soon Veleslava gathered around him a small group of like-minded people who were united by a spiritual quest.

On February 24, 1998, together with like-minded people, Veleslav announced the creation of the Russian-Slavic Rodnovercheskoy Communities, "Rodoljub",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rodolubie.info/ |title=Родолюбие |publisher=Rodolubie.info |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a spiritual and educational society, "Satya Veda" (Sanskrit, "True Knowledge"), which during the first year operated as a single unit.

According to Veleslav, &lt;blockquote&gt;this date (February 24, 1998) marked the official date of his community. This was followed by a period of relatively short duration (one year), but which was nevertheless very significant in its results. It was at this time that the foundation was laid for the future community: developing and maintaining a ritual practice; and a worldview was formed... May 12, 1998, was the date of the first public ceremony for the reconstructed houses in the near Teply Stan. The ritual began with the worship of Veles, the Slavic God of Wisdom, Spiritual Patron of the community, and was aimed at the reunification of the participating forces with Native Gods. One year the community's pagan temple was desecrated by Christians: a ritual statue of Veles was thrown into the running water of a nearby stream; a stone Alatyrny svorochen was thrown from a mountain, and the remaining logs were cut with "Orthodox" crosses. This caused the community to equip a new temple in the more distant location where it still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velesovkrug.ru/press-tsentr/press-tsentr-4.html |title=Краткая биография волхва Велеслава - Велeсов круг |publisher=Velesovkrug.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1999, Veleslav, together with a group of Commonwealth Communities, created the "Veles Circle",&lt;ref name="velesovkrug" /&gt; which still exists today. The stated objectives of the Veles Circle are:

#Restoration, conservation and enhancement of the spiritual heritage of their ancestors.
#Practical development and implementation of the Volkhov Knowledge (Vedaniya).
#Research and spiritual outreach.

In the book "Gap" by Askr Svarte, he devotes to Veleslav gratitude for teachings on the Path.&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askrsvarte.org/blog/the-book-gap-english/|title=Preface to the English Edition|date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verginia''', or '''Virginia''' (ca. 465 BC{{ndash}}449 BC), was the subject of a story of [[ancient Rome]], related in [[Livy]]'s ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=44 Livy, History of Rome; book 3, chapter 44]-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/3601.html Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology &gt; v. 3, page 1267 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of [[Rome]] were already angry with the [[decemviri]] for not calling the proper elections, taking bribes, and other abuses. It seemed that they were returning to the rule of the [[Kings of Rome]] who had been overthrown only a few decades before. In 451 BC, [[Appius Claudius Crassus|Appius Claudius]] began to lust after Verginia, a beautiful [[plebeian]] girl and the daughter of Lucius Verginius, a respected centurion. Verginia was betrothed to [[Lucius Icilius]], a former [[tribune]] of the plebs, and when she rejected Claudius, Claudius had one of his [[plebs|client]]s, Marcus Claudius, claim that she was actually his slave. Marcus Claudius then abducted her while she was on her way to school. The crowd in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] objected to this, as both Verginius and Icilius were well-respected men, and they forced Marcus Claudius to bring the case before the decemvirs, led by Appius Claudius himself. Verginius was recalled from the field to defend his daughter, and Icilius, after threats of violence, succeeded in having Verginia returned to her house while the court waited for her father to appear. Claudius tried to have his own supporters intercept the messengers sent to summon Verginius, but they arrived too late to delay Verginius' arrival.

[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus096.png|thumb|300px|right|Death of Virginia.]]

When Verginius arrived two days later he gathered his supporters in the Forum. Claudius, however, would not let him speak, and declared that Verginia was indeed Marcus Claudius' slave. Appius Claudius had brought an armed escort with him and accused the citizens of [[sedition]]. The supporters of Verginius left the Forum rather than cause any violence, and Verginius begged to question his daughter himself. Claudius agreed to this, but Verginius grabbed a knife and, at the [[Shrine of Venus Cloacina]], he stabbed Verginia, the only way he felt he could uphold her freedom. Verginius and Icilius were arrested, and their supporters returned to attack the [[lictor]]s and destroy their [[fasces]]. This led to the overthrow of the decemviri and the re-establishment of the [[Roman Republic]].

Livy compared this story to the rape of [[Lucretia]] and the overthrow of the monarchy in 509 BC.

The tale is retold, with varying fidelity, in several works of Western literature, including [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Physician's Tale]]" in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', in [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]]'s ''[[Lays of Ancient Rome]]'', and in the play ''[[Appius and Virginia]]'' by [[John Webster]] and [[Thomas Heywood]], which includes the following lines:

:Two ladies fair, but most unfortunate
:Have in their ruins rais'd declining Rome,
:[[Lucretia]] and Virginia, both renowned
:For chastity.

Verginia is also mentioned in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and her story, with a twist, is also told in [[Steven Saylor]]'s ''[[Roma (2007 novel)|Roma]]''.

{{Chinese name|[[Wei (surname)|Wei]]}}

'''Wei Huacun''' (252–334), [[courtesy name]] ''' Xianan''' (賢安), was a founder of the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] sect of [[Daoism]].

==Overview==
Wei was born in 252 in [[Jining, Shandong]] in the former county of Rencheng (任城). Her father, Wei Shu (魏舒), was a government official. From an early age she displayed a propensity for studying the works of [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], and practising [[Daoism|Daoist]] methods of cultivation. 

At the age of 24, she was married to Liu Wen (劉文) against her will by her parents and had two sons. After they grew up, she resumed her Daoist practices. At some point she became a libationer in the priesthood of the [[Way of the Celestial Master|Celestial Masters]] sect of Daoism. 

According to her Shangqing [[hagiographer]]s, her devotion to Daoist cultivation so impressed a number of immortals that she received revelations from them 31 volumes of Daoist scriptures which would become the foundation of [[Shangqing School|Shangqing Daoism.]] Among these was the ''Yellow Court Classic'' (黃庭經), which detailed a form of [[Daoist meditation]] involving the visualizations of deities within the adept's body, a practice that would become a defining feature of Shangqing. Shangqing has sometimes been described as a "mystical" form of Daoism, emphasising the notion of the human body as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] containing universal energies, which could be actualised by ecstatic union with deities. With the emphasis on meditation, there would be much less attention paid to physiological cultivation by ingesting herbs and drugs, which had been important in earlier forms of Daoism.  

When Wei's disciple Yang Xi (楊羲) formally founded the Shangqing school, 30 years after her death, Wei was acknowledged as the first "patriarch" of Shangqing Daoism and, as an immortal, would be a source of continuing revelations. The sect would be centred on Mao Mountain (茅山), situated to the south of [[Nanjing]], and would thus be also known as the Maoshan sect. From the 6th to the 10th century, Shangqing would be the most prominent Daoist sect and would gain favour among aristocrats of the [[Tang dynasty]]. The Shangqing scriptures were regarded as possessing a high literary quality that previous Daoist scriptures did not, and their vivid esoteric imagery was an inspiration to artists and poets.

'''Yapaniya''' was a [[Jain]] order in western Karnataka which is now extinct. The first inscription that mentions them by Mrigesavarman (AD 475-490) a [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] king of Palasika who donated for a Jain temple, and made a grant to the sects of Yapaniyas, Nirgranthas (identifiable as [[Digambara]]s), and the Kurchakas (not identified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainworld.com/book/historyofjainism/ch10.asp |title=Yapaniyas |publisher=Jainworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The last inscription which mentioned the Yapaniyas was found in the [[Tuluva]] region southwest [[Karnataka]], dated Saka 1316 (AD 1394).&lt;ref&gt;Jainism in South India and Some Jaina Epigraphs By Pandurang Bhimarao Desai, 1957,
Published by [[Gulabchand Hirachand Doshi]], Jaina Saṁskṛti Saṁrakshaka Sangha&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Darshana-Sara, they were a branch of the [[Svetambara]] sect. However, they were regarded to be [[Digambara]] by Swetambar authors. The Yapaniya monks remained naked but followed some Svetamabar views. They also possessed their own versions of texts that have been preserved in the Svetambar tradition. The Yapaniya monks wore a piece of cloth while in public and remained naked while in secluded area like forests. 

The great grammarian Shakatayana,  who was a contemporary of the [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Amoghavarsha]] (c. 817-877), was a Yapaniya,  as mentioned by Malayagira in his commentary on the NandiSutra.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==Decline==
Yapanya rose to its dominance in second century CE and declined after their migration to [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] merging with [[Digambara]] or [[Svetambara]].{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=45}}
