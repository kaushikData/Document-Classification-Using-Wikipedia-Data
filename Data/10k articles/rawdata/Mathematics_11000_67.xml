'''235''' ('''two hundred [and] thirty-five''') is the integer following [[234 (number)|234]] and preceding [[236 (number)|236]].

==In mathematics==
'''235''' is:

*a [[semiprime]].
*a [[heptagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A000566|name=Heptagonal numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a [[centered triangular number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A005448|name=Centered triangular numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*therefore a [[figurate number]] in two ways.
*palindromic in bases 4 (3223&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), 7 (454&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), 8 (353&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), 13 (151&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;), 46 (55&lt;sub&gt;46&lt;/sub&gt;) and 234 (11&lt;sub&gt;234&lt;/sub&gt;)
*a [[Harshad number]] in bases 6, 47, 48, 95, 116, 189 and 231.
*a [[Smarandache–Wellin number]]

Also:
*There are 235 different [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]] with 11 unlabeled nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A000055|name=Number of trees with n unlabeled nodes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If an [[equilateral triangle]] is subdivided into smaller equilateral triangles whose side length is 1/9 as small, the resulting "matchstick arrangement" will have exactly 235 different equilateral triangles of varying sizes in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A002717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science==
*[[Uranium-235|U-235]]  is the [[fissile]] [[isotope]] of [[uranium]] used in the first [[atomic bombs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">In [[mathematics]], a '''5-manifold''' is a 5-dimensional [[topological manifold]], possibly with a [[piecewise linear structure|piecewise linear]] or [[differential structure|smooth structure]].

Non-[[simply connected space|simply connected]] 5-manifolds are impossible to classify, as this is harder than solving the [[word problem for groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Classical Topology and Combinatorial Group Theory|volume=72|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=John|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|publisher=Springer|year=1993|isbn=9780387979700|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=265lbM42REMC&amp;pg=PA247}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Simply connected compact 5-manifolds were first classified by [[Stephen Smale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stephen|last=Smale|authorlink=Stephen Smale| title=On the structure of 5-manifolds|journal=
[[Annals of Mathematics]]| series=2|volume=75|year= 1962|pages= 38–46|mr=0141133|doi=10.2307/1970417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in full generality by [[Dennis Barden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Barden|first=Dennis|authorlink=Dennis Barden|  jstor=1970702|title=Simply Connected Five-Manifolds|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|series= 2nd Ser.|volume=82|issue= 3|year= 1965|pages= 365–385|mr=0184241|doi=10.2307/1970702}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another proof was later given by Aleksey V. Zhubr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhubr|first=Aleksey Viktorovich|title=On a paper of Barden| journal=Journal of Mathematical Sciences (New York) |volume= 119 |year=2004|issue=1|pages=35–44 |mr=1846073| doi=10.1023/B:JOTH.0000008739.46142.89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather surprisingly, this turns out to be easier than the 3- or 4-dimensional case: the 3-dimensional case is the [[Thurston geometrisation conjecture]], and the [[4-manifold|4-dimensional case]] was solved by [[Michael Freedman]] (1982) in the topological case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Freedman | first=Michael Hartley|authorlink=Michael Freedman | title=The topology of four-dimensional manifolds | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214437136 | mr=679066 | year=1982 | journal=[[Journal of Differential Geometry]] | issn=0022-040X | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=357–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is a very hard unsolved problem in the smooth case.

In dimension 5, the smooth classification of manifolds is governed by classical algebraic topology. Namely, two simply connected, smooth 5-manifolds are diffeomorphic if and only if there exists an isomorphism of their second homology groups with integer coefficients, preserving the linking form and the second [[Stiefel–Whitney class]]. Moreover, any such isomorphism in second homology is induced by some diffeomorphism.

==Examples==
Here are some examples of smooth, closed, simply connected 5-manifolds:

* &lt;math&gt;S^5&lt;/math&gt;, the 5-sphere.
* &lt;math&gt;S^2\times S^3&lt;/math&gt;, the product of a 2-sphere with a 3-sphere.
* &lt;math&gt;S^2\widetilde{\times} S^3&lt;/math&gt;, the total space of the non-trivial &lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt;-bundle over &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SU}(3)/\operatorname{SO}(3)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[homogeneous space]] obtained as the quotient of the [[special unitary group]] SU(3) by the [[rotation group SO(3)|rotation subgroup SO(3)]].

'''ABC@Home''' was an educational and non-profit [[computer network|network computing]] project finding abc-triples related to the [[abc conjecture]] in number theory. 

Using the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) [[distributed computing]] platform. In March 2011, there were more than 7,300 active participants from 114 countries with a total [[BOINC Credit System|BOINC credit]] of more than 2.9 billion, reporting about 10 [[FLOPS|teraflops]] (10 trillion operations per second) of processing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=abc_main |title=Detailed user, host, team and country statistics with graphs for BOINC |accessdate=2011-03-11 |work=boincstats.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120150315/http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=abc_main |archivedate=2010-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the project met its goal of finding all abc-triples of at most 18 digits. By 2015, the project had found 23.8 million triples in total, and ceased operations soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~desmit/abc/index.php?set=1 |title=ABC Triples |last=de Smit |first=Bart |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[differential geometry]], an '''affine manifold''' is a [[differentiable manifold]] equipped with a [[flat connection|flat]], [[torsion tensor|torsion-free]] [[affine connection|connection]].

Equivalently, it is a manifold that is (if connected) [[covering space|covered]] by an open subset of &lt;math&gt;{\Bbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with [[Covering space#Monodromy action|monodromy]] acting by [[affine transformation]]s. This equivalence is an easy corollary of [[Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks theorem]].

Equivalently, it is a manifold equipped with an atlas—called '''the affine structure'''—such that all transition functions between [[Chart (topology)|charts]] are [[affine transformation]]s (that is, have constant jacobian matrix);&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, R.L.; Goldberg, S.I. (1968), pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; two atlases are equivalent if the manifold admits an atlas subjugated to both, with transitions from both atlases to a smaller atlas being affine. A manifold having a distinguished affine structure is called an '''affine manifold''' and the charts which are affinely related to those of the affine structure are called '''affine charts'''. In each affine coordinate domain the coordinate [[vector field]]s form a [[parallelization (mathematics)|parallelization]] of that domain, so there is an associated connection on each domain. These locally defined connections are the same on overlapping parts, so there is a unique connection associated with an affine structure. Note there is a link between [[linear]] [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] (also called [[affine connection]]) and a [[web (differential geometry)|web]].

==Formal definition==
An '''affine manifold''' &lt;math&gt;M\,&lt;/math&gt; is a real [[manifold]] with charts &lt;math&gt;\psi_i\colon U_i\to{\Bbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\psi_i\circ\psi_j^{-1}\in {\rm Aff}({\Bbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i, j\, ,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\rm Aff}({\Bbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Lie group]] of affine transformations. In fancier words it is a [[(G,X)-manifold]] where &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the group of affine transformations. 

An affine manifold is called '''complete''' if its [[universal covering]] is [[homeomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;{\Bbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case of a compact affine manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be the [[fundamental group]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde M&lt;/math&gt; be its [[universal cover]]. One can show that each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional affine manifold comes with a developing map &lt;math&gt;D\colon {\tilde M}\to{\Bbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and a [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon G\to {\rm Aff}({\Bbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is an [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] and equivariant with respect to &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[fundamental group]] of a compact complete flat affine manifold is called '''an affine [[crystallographic group]]'''. Classification of affine crystallographic groups is a difficult problem, far from being solved. The [[Space group|Riemannian crystallographic groups]] (also known as [[Bieberbach group]]s) were classified by [[Ludwig Bieberbach]], answering a question posed by [[David Hilbert]]. In his work on [[Hilbert's eighteenth problem|Hilbert's 18-th problem]], [[Space group#Bieberbach's theorems|Bieberbach proved]] that any Riemannian crystallographic group contains an abelian subgroup of finite index.

==Important longstanding conjectures==
Geometry of affine manifolds is essentially a network of longstanding conjectures; most of them proven in low dimension and some other special cases.

The most important of them are

*[[Markus conjecture]] (1961) stating that a compact affine manifold is complete if and only if it has constant volume.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch M. and Thurston W., ''Foliated bundles, invariant measures, and flat manifolds,'' Ann. Math. (2) 101, (1975) 369–390.&lt;/ref&gt; Known in dimension 3.
*[[Auslander conjecture]] (1964)&lt;ref&gt;Auslander L., ''The structure of locally complete affine manifolds,'' Topology 3 (1964), 131–139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fried D. and Goldman W., ''Three dimensional affine crystallographic groups'', Adv. Math. 47 (1983), 1–49.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that any affine crystallographic group contains a [[polycyclic group|polycyclic subgroup]] of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]]. Known in dimensions up to 6,&lt;ref&gt;H. Abels, G. A. Margulis and G. A. Soifer, ''On the Zariski closure of the linear part of a properly discontinuous group of affine transformations,'' J. Differential Geom., 60 (2002), 315344.&lt;/ref&gt; and when the holonomy of the flat connection preserves a [[Lorentz metric]].&lt;ref&gt;William M. Goldman and Yoshinobu Kamishima, ''The fundamental group of a compact flat Lorentz space form is virtually polycyclic'', J. Differential Geom. Volume 19, Number 1 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Since every virtually polycyclic crystallographic group preserves a volume form, Auslander conjecture implies the "only if" part of the Markus conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Abels, ''Properly Discontinuous Groups of Affine Transformations: A Survey'', Geom. Dedicata, 87,. 309–333 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chern conjecture (affine geometry)|Chern conjecture]] (1955) The [[Euler class]] of an affine manifold vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;Kostant B., Sullivan D., ''The Euler characteristic of an affine space form is zero,'' Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 81 (1975), no. 5, 937–938.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">In [[topology]], an '''Akbulut cork''' is a structure that is frequently used to show that in four dimensions, the smooth [[h-cobordism]] theorem fails. It was named after [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[mathematician]] [[Selman Akbulut]].&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Gompf and A.I. Stipsicz, 4-manifolds and Kirby calculus (p.357), AMS Pub. GSM v.20 {{isbn|0-8218-0994-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.Scorpan, The wild world of 4-manifolds (p.90), AMS Pub. {{isbn|0-8218-3749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compact contractible Stein 4-manifold C with involution F on its boundary is called an Akbulut cork, if F extends to a self-homeomorphism but cannot extend to a self-diffeomorphism inside (hence a cork is an exotic copy of itself relative to its boundary). A cork (C,F) is called a cork of a smooth 4-manifold X, if removing C from X and re-gluing it via F changes the smooth structure of X (this operation is called "cork twisting"). Any exotic copy X' of a closed simply connected 4-manifold X differs from X by a single cork twist.&lt;ref&gt;S. Akbulut, A Fake compact contractible 4-manifold, Journ. of Diff.

The basic idea of the Akbulut cork is that when attempting to use the h-corbodism theorem in four dimensions, the cork is the sub-cobordism that contains all the exotic properties of the spaces connected with the cobordism, and when removed the two spaces become trivially h-cobordant and smooth. This shows that in four dimensions, although the theorem does not tell us that two [[manifold]]s are [[diffeomorphic]] (only [[homeomorphic]]), they are "not far" from being diffeomorphic.&lt;ref name=AMB&gt;Asselmeyer-Maluga and Brans, 2007, ''Exotic Smoothness and Physics''&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate this (without proof), consider a smooth h-cobordism ''W''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; between two 4-manifolds ''M'' and ''N''. Then within ''W'' there is a sub-cobordism ''K''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; between ''A''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''M'' and ''B''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''N'' and there is a diffeomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;W \setminus \operatorname{int}\, K \cong \left(M \setminus \operatorname{int}\, A \right) \times \left[0,1\right],&lt;/math&gt;

which is the content of the h-cobordism theorem for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5 (here int&amp;nbsp;''X'' refers to the interior of a manifold ''X''). In addition, ''A'' and ''B'' are diffeomorphic with a diffeomorphism that is an [[involute|involution]] on the boundary ∂''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∂''B''.&lt;ref name=Scorpan&gt;Scorpan, A., 2005 ''The Wild World of 4-Manifolds''&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it can be seen that the h-corbordism ''K'' connects ''A'' with its "inverted" image ''B''. This submanifold ''A'' is the Akbulut cork.

'''Applied mathematics''' is the application of [[mathematical model|mathematical method]]s by different fields such as [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], [[computer science]], and [[industry]]. Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of [[mathematical science]] and specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[profession|professional specialty]]  in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models. In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in [[pure mathematics]] where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake. The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.

== History ==
[[File:Elmer-pump-heatequation.png|thumb|right|A numerical solution to the [[heat equation]] on a pump casing model using the [[finite element method]].]]

Historically, applied mathematics consisted principally of [[Mathematical analysis|applied analysis]], most notably [[differential equations]]; [[approximation theory]] (broadly construed, to include [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]]s, [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] methods, [[Calculus of variations|variational methods]], and [[numerical analysis]]); and applied [[probability]].  These areas of mathematics related directly to the development of [[Newtonian physics]], and in fact, the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid-19th century.  This history left a pedagogical legacy in the United States: until the early 20th century, subjects such as [[classical mechanics]] were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities rather than in [[physics]] departments, and [[fluid mechanics]] may still be taught in applied mathematics departments.&lt;ref name="Stolz2002"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantitative finance]] is now taught in mathematics departments across universities and [[mathematical finance]] is considered a full branch of applied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thefinancialengineer.net/rankings/ Ranking of programs shows]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Engineering]] and [[computer science]] departments have traditionally made use of applied mathematics.

== Divisions ==
[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|left|thumb|Fluid mechanics is often considered a branch of applied mathematics and mechanical engineering.]]

Today, the term "applied mathematics" is used in a broader sense. It includes the classical areas noted above as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications. Even fields such as [[number theory]] that are part of [[pure mathematics]] are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''. Sometimes, the term "[[applicable mathematics]]" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.

There is no consensus as to what the various branches of applied mathematics are. Such categorizations are made difficult by the way mathematics and science change over time, and also by the way universities organize departments, courses, and degrees.

Many mathematicians distinguish between "applied mathematics," which is concerned with mathematical methods, and the "applications of mathematics" within science and engineering. A [[biology|biologist]] using a [[Matrix population models|population model]] and applying known mathematics would not be ''doing'' applied mathematics, but rather ''using'' it; however, mathematical biologists have posed problems that have stimulated the growth of pure mathematics. Mathematicians such as [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Vladimir Arnold|Arnold]] deny the existence of "applied mathematics" and claim that there are only "applications of mathematics."  Similarly, non-mathematicians blend applied mathematics and applications of mathematics. The use and development of mathematics to solve industrial problems is also called "industrial mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=University of Strathclyde | title=Industrial Mathematics | url=http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=8 January 2009 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804104748/http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | archive-date=2012-08-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of modern numerical mathematical methods and software has led to the emergence of [[computational mathematics]], [[computational science]], and [[computational engineering]], which use [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]] for the [[simulation]] of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary.

== Utility ==
[[File:Market Data Index NYA on 20050726 202628 UTC.png|right|thumb|[[Mathematical finance]] is concerned with the modelling of financial markets.]]

Historically, mathematics was most important in the [[natural sciences]] and [[engineering]]. However, since [[World War II]], fields outside the physical sciences have spawned the creation of new areas of mathematics, such as [[game theory]] and [[social choice theory]], which grew out of economic considerations.

The advent of the computer has enabled new applications: studying and using the new computer technology itself ([[computer science]]) to study problems arising in other areas of science (computational science) as well as the mathematics of computation (for example, [[theoretical computer science]], [[computer algebra]], [[numerical analysis]]).  [[Statistics]] is probably the most widespread [[mathematical science]] used in the [[social sciences]], but other areas of mathematics, most notably [[economics]], are proving increasingly useful in these disciplines.

== Status in academic departments ==

Academic institutions are not consistent in the way they group and label courses, programs, and degrees in applied mathematics.  At some schools, there is a single mathematics department, whereas others have separate departments for Applied Mathematics and (Pure) Mathematics.  It is very common for Statistics departments to be separated at schools with graduate programs, but many undergraduate-only institutions include statistics under the mathematics department.

Many applied mathematics programs (as opposed to departments) consist of primarily cross-listed courses and jointly appointed faculty in departments representing applications.  Some Ph.D. programs in applied mathematics require little or no coursework outside mathematics, while others require substantial coursework in a specific area of application.  In some respects this difference reflects the distinction between "application of mathematics" and "applied mathematics".

Some universities in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] host departments of ''Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics'',&lt;ref&gt;For example see, [http://www.tait.ac.uk/History.html The Tait Institute: History (2nd par.)]. Accessed Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.am.qub.ac.uk Dept of Applied Mathematics &amp; Theoretical Physics.] [[Queen's University, Belfast]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Queens_University_Belfast/department/Department_of_Applied_Mathematics_Theoretical_Physics DAMTP Belfast ResearchGate page].&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now much less common to have separate departments of pure and applied mathematics. A notable exception to this is the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], housing the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] whose past holders include [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[James Lighthill]], [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Stephen Hawking]].

Schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from [[Brown University]], which has a large Division of Applied Mathematics that offers degrees through the [[doctorate]], to [[Santa Clara University]], which offers only the [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in applied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Santa Clara University Dept of Applied Mathematics |url=http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504005925/http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm |archivedate=2011-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include [[MIT]]. [[Brigham Young University]] also has an Applied and Computational Emphasis (ACME), a program that allows student to graduate with a Mathematics degree, with an emphasis in Applied Math. Students in this program also learn another skill (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Pure Math, etc.) to supplement their applied math skills.

== Associated mathematical sciences ==
[[File:Oldfaithful3.png|thumb|right|Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with statistics.]]

Applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences.

===Scientific computing===
[[Scientific computing]] includes applied mathematics (especially [[numerical analysis]]), [[computing science]] (especially [[high-performance computing]]), and mathematical modelling in a scientific discipline.

===Computer science===
[[Computer science]] relies on [[logic]], [[algebra]], [[graph theory]], and [[combinatorics]].

===Operations research and management science===
[[Operations research]] and [[management science]] are often taught in faculties of engineering, business, and public policy.

===Statistics===
Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with the discipline of statistics. [[Statisticians|Statistical theorists]] study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics, and statistical research often raises mathematical questions. Statistical theory relies on [[Probability theory|probability]] and [[optimal decision|decision theory]], and makes extensive use of scientific computing, analysis, and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]; for the [[design of experiments]], statisticians use [[algebraic statistics|algebra]] and [[combinatorial design]]. Applied mathematicians and [[statistician]]s often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities).

===Actuarial science===
[[Actuarial science]] applies probability, statistics, and economic theory to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries and professions.

===Mathematical economics===
[[Mathematical economics]] is the application of  mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics. The applied methods usually refer to nontrivial mathematical techniques or approaches. Mathematical economics is based on statistics, probability, mathematical programming (as well as other [[computational economics|computational methods]]), operations research, game theory, and some methods from mathematical analysis. In this regard, it resembles  (but is distinct from) [[financial mathematics]], another part of applied mathematics.

According to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC), mathematical economics falls into the [[Mathematics Subject Classification#Applied mathematics / other|Applied mathematics/other]] classification of category 91:
:Game theory, economics, social and behavioral sciences

with [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=MSC2010 MSC2010] classifications for '[[Game theory]]' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Axx 91Axx] and for 'Mathematical economics' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Bxx 91Bxx].

===Applicable mathematics===
'''Applicable mathematics''' is a subdiscipline of applied mathematics, although there is no consensus as to a precise definition.&lt;ref name=OtteEtAl/&gt; Sometimes the term "applicable mathematics" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.

Mathematicians often distinguish between "applied mathematics" on the one hand, and the "applications of mathematics" or "applicable mathematics" both within and outside of science and engineering, on the other.&lt;ref name=OtteEtAl&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=VgLZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=applicable+mathematics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CeBNJXuG36&amp;sig=Gu4z--WLgzqf9BThN5q4WteCea8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=applicable%20mathematics&amp;f=false Perspectives on Mathematics Education: Papers Submitted by Members of the Bacomet Group, pgs 82-3.] Editors: H. Christiansen, A.G. Howson, M. Otte. Volume 2 of Mathematics Education Library; Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012. {{ISBN|9400945043}}, 9789400945043.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mathematicians emphasize the term applicable mathematics to separate or delineate the traditional applied areas from new applications arising from fields that were previously seen as pure mathematics.&lt;ref name=rektorys/&gt; For example, from this viewpoint, an ecologist or geographer using population models and applying known mathematics would not be doing applied, but rather applicable, mathematics. Even fields such as number theory that are part of pure mathematics are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''.

Other authors prefer describing ''applicable mathematics'' as a union of "new" mathematical applications with the traditional fields of applied mathematics.&lt;ref name=rektorys&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-sztCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=survey+of+applicable+mathematics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=applicable%20mathematics&amp;f=false Survey of Applicable Mathematics, pg xvii (Foreword). ] K. Rektorys; 2nd edition, illustrated. Springer, 2013. {{ISBN|9401583080}}, 9789401583084.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ust.hk/~mahsieh/APMATH.htm  THOUGHTS ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stellamariscollege.org/documents/icaml.pdf  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLICABLE MATHEMATICS (ICAM-2016).] The  Department  of  Mathematics,  Stella  Maris College.&lt;/ref&gt; With this outlook, the terms applied mathematics and applicable mathematics are thus interchangeable.

===Other disciplines===
The line between applied mathematics and specific areas of application is often blurred.  Many universities teach mathematical and statistical courses outside the respective departments, in departments and areas including business, [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[scientific computation]], and [[mathematical physics]].

'''Arthur Cayley''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society#Fellows|F.R.S.]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|l|i}}; 16 August 1821 – 26 January 1895) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[mathematician]]. He helped found the modern British school of [[pure mathematics]].

As a child, Cayley enjoyed solving complex maths problems for amusement. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he excelled in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Italian language|Italian]], as well as [[mathematics]].  He worked as a [[lawyer]] for 14 years.

He postulated the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]]—that every [[square matrix]] is a root of its own [[characteristic polynomial]], and verified it for matrices of order 2 and 3.&lt;ref&gt;See Cayley (1858) "A Memoir on the Theory of Matrices", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''148''' :  24 : "I have verified the theorem, in the next simplest case, of a matrix of the order 3, … but I have not thought it necessary to undertake the labour of a formal proof of the theorem in the general case of a matrix of any degree."&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to define the concept of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in the modern way—as a set with a [[Binary function|binary]] operation satisfying certain laws.&lt;ref&gt;Cayley (1854) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LYConosISUC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', 4th series, '''7''' (42) : 40–47.  However, see also the criticism of this definition in:  [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Abstract_groups.html MacTutor:  The abstract group concept].&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, when mathematicians spoke of "groups", they had meant [[permutation group]]s. [[Cayley table]]s and [[Cayley graph]]s as well as [[Cayley's theorem]] are named in honour of Cayley.

==Early years==
Arthur Cayley was born in [[Richmond, London]], [[England]], on 16 August 1821. His father, Henry Cayley, was a distant cousin of [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]], the [[aeronautics]] engineer innovator, and descended from an ancient [[Yorkshire]] family. He settled in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], as a [[merchant]]. His [[mother]] was Maria Antonia Doughty, daughter of William Doughty. According to some writers she was Russian, but her father's name indicates an English origin. His brother was the linguist [[Charles Bagot Cayley]]. Arthur spent his first eight years in Saint Petersburg. In 1829 his parents were settled permanently at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], near London. Arthur was sent to a private school. At age 14 he was sent to [[King's College School]]. The school's master observed indications of mathematical genius and advised the father to educate his son not for his own business, as he had intended, but to enter the [[University of Cambridge]].

==Education==
At the unusually early age of 17 Cayley began residence at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. The cause of the [[Analytical Society]] had now triumphed, and the ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' had been instituted by Gregory and [[Robert Leslie Ellis]]. To this journal, at the age of twenty, Cayley contributed three papers, on subjects that had been suggested by reading the ''Mécanique analytique'' of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and some of the works of [[Laplace]].

Cayley's tutor at Cambridge was [[George Peacock]] and his private coach was [[William Hopkins]]. He finished his undergraduate course by winning the place of [[Senior Wrangler]], and the first [[Smith's prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CLY838A|name=Cayley, Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next step was to take the M.A. degree, and win a Fellowship by competitive examination. He continued to reside at Cambridge University for four years; during which time he took some pupils, but his main work was the preparation of 28 memoirs to the '' Mathematical Journal''.

==As a lawyer==
Because of the limited tenure of his fellowship it was necessary to choose a profession; like [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], Cayley chose law, and at age 25 entered at [[Lincoln's Inn, London]]. He made a specialty of [[conveyancing]]. It was while he was a pupil at the [[bar examination]] that he went to [[Dublin]] to hear [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s lectures on [[quaternion]]s.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Cayley, Arthur |first=Andrew Russell|last=Forsyth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His friend [[James Joseph Sylvester|J. J. Sylvester]], his senior by five years at Cambridge, was then an [[actuary]], resident in London; they used to walk together round the courts of [[Lincoln's Inn]], discussing the [[theory of invariants]] and covariants. During this period of his life, extending over fourteen years, Cayley produced between two and three hundred papers.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

==As a professor==
At Cambridge University the ancient professorship of pure mathematics is denominated by the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian]], and is the chair that had been occupied by [[Isaac Newton]]. Around 1860, certain funds bequeathed by Lady Sadleir to the University, having become useless for their original purpose, were employed to establish another professorship of pure mathematics, called the [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics|Sadleirian]]. The duties of the new professor were defined to be ''"to explain and teach the principles of pure mathematics and to apply himself to the advancement of that science."'' To this chair Cayley was elected when 42 years old. He gave up a lucrative practice for a modest salary; but he never regretted the exchange, for the chair at Cambridge enabled him to end the divided allegiance between law and mathematics, and to devote his energies to the pursuit that he liked best. He at once married and settled down in Cambridge. More fortunate than Hamilton in his choice, his home life was one of great happiness. His friend and fellow investigator, Sylvester, once remarked that Cayley had been much more fortunate than himself; that they both lived as bachelors in London, but that Cayley had married and settled down to a quiet and peaceful life at Cambridge; whereas he had never married, and had been fighting the world all his days.

At first the teaching duty of the Sadleirian professorship was limited to a course of lectures extending over one of the terms of the academic year; but when the University was reformed about 1886, and part of the college funds applied to the better endowment of the University [[professor]]s, the lectures were extended over two terms. For many years the attendance was small, and came almost entirely from those who had finished their career of preparation for competitive examinations; after the reform the attendance numbered about fifteen. The subject lectured on was generally that of the memoir on which the professor was for the time engaged.

The other duty of the chair — the advancement of mathematical science — was discharged in a handsome manner by the long series of memoirs that he published, ranging over every department of pure mathematics. But it was also discharged in a much less obtrusive way; he became the standing referee on the merits of mathematical papers to many societies both at home and abroad.

In 1872 he was made an honorary fellow of Trinity College, and three years later an ordinary fellow, which meant stipend as well as honour. About this time his friends subscribed for a presentation portrait. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] wrote an address to the committee of subscribers who had charge of the Cayley portrait fund. The verses refer to the subjects investigated in several of Cayley's most elaborate memoirs; such as, Chapters on the Analytical Geometry of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions; On the theory of [[Determinant]]s; Memoir on the theory of Matrices; Memoirs on skew surfaces, otherwise Scrolls; On the delineation of a Cubic Scroll, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:To the Committee of the Cayley Portrait Fund|"To the Committee of the Cayley Portrait Fund"]], 1874&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work on [[algebra]], Cayley made fundamental contributions to [[algebraic geometry]]. Cayley and [[George Salmon|Salmon]] discovered the 27 lines on a [[cubic surface]]. Cayley constructed the [[Chow variety]] of all curves in projective 3-space.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cayley, Collected Mathematical Papers, Cambridge (1891), v. 4, 446−455. W. V. D. Hodge and D. Pedoe, Methods of Algebraic Geometry, Cambridge (1952), v. 2, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the algebro-geometric theory of [[ruled surface]]s.

In 1876 he published a ''Treatise on [[elliptic function|Elliptic Functions]]''. He took great interest in the movement for the University education of women. At Cambridge the women's colleges are Girton and Newnham. In the early days of [[Girton College]] he gave direct help in teaching, and for some years he was chairman of the council of [[Newnham College]], in the progress of which he took the keenest interest to the last.

In 1881 he received from the [[Johns Hopkins University]], Baltimore, where Sylvester was then professor of mathematics, an invitation
to deliver a course of lectures. He accepted the invitation, and lectured at Baltimore during the first five months of 1882 on the
subject of the ''Abelian and Theta Functions''.

In 1893 Cayley became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00004572 |title=A. Cayley (1821 - 1895) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BAE==

In 1883 Cayley was President of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. The meeting was held at Southport, in the north of England. As the President's address is one of the great popular events of the meeting, and brings out an audience of general culture, it is usually made as little technical as possible. {{harvtxt|Cayley|1996}}  took for his subject the Progress of Pure Mathematics.

==The ''Collected Papers''==
In 1889 the [[Cambridge University Press]] requested him to prepare his mathematical papers for publication in a collected form—a request which he appreciated very much. They are printed in magnificent [[Bookbinding|quarto volume]]s, of which seven appeared under his own editorship. While editing these volumes, he was suffering from a painful internal malady, to which he succumbed on 26 January 1895, in the 74th year of his age. When the funeral took place, a great assemblage met in Trinity Chapel, comprising members of the University, official representatives of Russia and America, and many of the most illustrious philosophers of [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

The remainder of his papers were edited by [[Andrew Forsyth]], his successor in the Sadleirian Chair. The Collected Mathematical papers number thirteen quarto volumes, and contain 967 papers.  Cayley retained to the last his fondness for novel-reading and for travelling. He also took special pleasure in paintings and architecture, and he practiced [[Watercolor painting|water-colour painting]], which he found useful sometimes in making mathematical diagrams.

==Legacy==
Cayley is buried in the [[Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge|Mill Road cemetery]], Cambridge.

An 1874 portrait of Cayley by [[Lowes Cato Dickinson]] and an 1884 portrait by [[William Longmaid]] are in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity College, University of Cambridge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|publisher=BBC Your Paintings|access-date=12 February 2018|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140511164255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|archive-date=11 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In geometry, a '''bicentric polygon''' is a tangential [[polygon]] (a polygon all of whose sides are tangent to an inner [[incircle]]) which is also [[Cyclic polygon|cyclic]] — that is, [[inscribe]]d in an [[circumcircle|outer circle]] that passes through each vertex of the polygon. All [[triangle]]s and all [[regular polygon]]s are bicentric. On the other hand, a [[rectangle]] with unequal sides is not bicentric, because no circle can be tangent to all four sides.

Not all [[quadrilateral]]s are bicentric (having both an incircle and a circumcircle). Given two circles (one within the other) with radii ''R'' and ''r'' where &lt;math&gt;R&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a convex quadrilateral inscribed in one of them and tangent to the other [[if and only if]] their radii satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(R-x)^2}+\frac{1}{(R+x)^2}=\frac{1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' is the distance between their centers.&lt;ref name="imo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Subjects for mathematical essays|first=Charles|last=Davison|publisher=Macmillan and co., limited|year=1915|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz0_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This condition (and analogous conditions for higher order polygons) is known as [[Bicentric quadrilateral#Fuss' theorem|Fuss' theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics: Their History and Solution|first=Heinrich|last=Dörrie|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1965|isbn=9780486613482|page=192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4SJwNrYuAUC&amp;pg=PA192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polygons with n &gt; 4==

A complicated general formula is known for any number ''n''  of sides for the relation among the circumradius ''R'', the inradius ''r'', and the distance ''x'' between the circumcenter and the incenter.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Poncelet's Porism." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PonceletsPorism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these for specific ''n'' are:

:&lt;math&gt;n=5: \quad r(R-x)=(R+x)\sqrt{(R-r+x)(R-r-x)}+(R+x)\sqrt{2R(R-r-x)} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n=6: \quad 3(R^2-x^2)^4=4r^2(R^2+x^2)(R^2-x^2)^2+16r^4x^2R^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n=8: \quad 16p^4q^4(p^2-1)(q^2-1)=(p^2+q^2-p^2q^2)^4 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p=\tfrac{R+x}{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=\tfrac{R-x}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Regular polygons==
Every [[regular polygon]] is bicentric.&lt;ref name="imo"/&gt; In a regular polygon, the incircle and the circumcircle are [[concentric]]&amp;mdash;that is, they share a common center, which is also the center of the regular polygon, so the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is always zero. The radius of the inscribed circle is the [[apothem]] (the shortest distance from the center to the boundary of the regular polygon).

For any regular polygon, the relations between the common [[Edge (geometry)|edge]] length ''a'', the radius ''r'' of the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]], and the radius ''R'' of the [[circumcircle]] are:

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{a}{2\sin \frac{\pi}{n}}=\frac{r}{\cos \frac{\pi}{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For some regular polygons which can be [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructed with compass and ruler]], we have the following [[algebraic expression|algebraic formulas]] for these relations:

| &lt;math&gt; 2r= R \!\, &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Square (geometry)|4]]
| &lt;math&gt; R\sqrt{2} = a\!\, &lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt; 2r \left(\sqrt{2}-1\right) = R\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}} \!\, &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Decagon|10]]
| &lt;math&gt; (\sqrt{5}-1)R=2a \!\, &lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt; \frac{2r}{5} \sqrt{25-10\sqrt{5}} = \frac{R}{2} \left(\sqrt{5}-1\right) \!\, &lt;/math&gt;

==Poncelet's porism==
{{main|Poncelet's closure theorem}}
If two circles are the inscribed and circumscribed circles of a particular bicentric ''n''-gon, then the same two circles are the inscribed and circumscribed circles of infinitely many bicentric ''n''-gons. More precisely,
every [[tangent line]] to the inner of the two circles can be extended to a bicentric ''n''-gon by placing vertices on the line at the points where it crosses the outer circle, continuing from each vertex along another tangent line, and continuing in the same way until the resulting [[polygonal chain]] closes up to an ''n''-gon. The fact that it will always do so is implied by [[Poncelet's closure theorem]], which more generally applies for inscribed and circumscribed [[conic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Poncelet's Theorem|first=Leopold|last=Flatto|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2009|isbn=9780821886267}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, given a circumcircle and incircle, each diagonal of the variable polygon is tangent to a fixed circle. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Roger A. ''Advanced Euclidean Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007 (1929), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bit''' (a [[portmanteau]] of '''binary digit''')&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"&gt;{{cite book |title=Coded Character Sets, History and Development |work=The Systems Programming Series |author-last=Mackenzie |author-first=Charles E. |year=1980 |edition=1 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.]] |isbn=0-201-14460-3 |lccn=77-90165 |page=x |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-tQAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=2016-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118230039/https://books.google.com/books?id=6-tQAAAAMAAJ |archivedate=18 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20160526172151/https://textfiles.meulie.net/bitsaved/Books/Mackenzie_CodedCharSets.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Units of information|basic unit]] of [[information]] used in [[computing]] and digital [[communication]]s.  A [[Binary number|binary]] digit can have only one of two [[value (computer science)|values]], and may be physically represented with a two-state device. These state values are most commonly represented as either a {{gaps|0|or|1}}.

The two values of a binary digit can also be interpreted as [[Truth value|logical values]] (true/false, yes/no), algebraic [[signed number|signs]] (+/−), activation states (on/off), or any other two-valued attribute. The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying [[Data storage device|storage]] or [[computing device|device]] is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or [[computer program|program]]. The length of a binary number may be referred to as its [[bit-length]].

In [[information theory]], one bit is typically defined as the [[information entropy]] of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability,&lt;ref&gt;John B. Anderson, Rolf Johnnesson (2006) ''Understanding Information Transmission''.&lt;/ref&gt; or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Haykin (2006), ''Digital Communications''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[IEEE Std 260.1-2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion often arises because the words bit and binary digit are used interchangeably. But, within Shannon's [[information theory]], a bit and a binary digit are fundamentally different types of entities. A binary digit is a number that can adopt one of two possible values (0 or 1), whereas a bit is the maximum amount of [[Self-information|information]] that can be conveyed by a binary digit (when [[Expected value|averaged]] over both of its states). By analogy, just as a pint-sized bottle can contain between zero and one pint, so a binary digit can convey between zero and one bit of information. A less confusing terminology is to refer to bits as [[Shannon (unit)|shannons]] (see below).

In [[quantum computing]], a ''quantum bit'' or [[qubit]] is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum system]] that can exist in [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of two [[classical mechanics|classical]] (i.e., non-quantum) bit values; see also [[two-state quantum system]].

The symbol for binary digit is either simply ''bit'' (recommended by the [[IEC 80000-13]]:2008 standard) or lowercase ''b'' (recommended by the [[IEEE 1541-2002]] and [[IEEE Std 260.1-2004]] standards). A group of eight binary digits is commonly called one&amp;nbsp;[[byte]], but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined.

As a [[unit of information]] in [[information theory]], the bit has alternatively been called a ''[[shannon (unit)|shannon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictB.html#bit|title=Units: B|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504055432/http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictB.html#bit|archivedate=4 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Claude Shannon]], the founder of field of information theory. This usage distinguishes the quantity of information from the form of the state variables used to represent it. When the logical values are not equally probable or when a signal is not conveyed perfectly through a communication system, a binary digit in the representation of the information will convey less than one bit of information. However, the shannon unit terminology is uncommon in practice.

==History==
The encoding of data by discrete bits was used in the [[punched card]]s invented by [[Basile Bouchon]] and Jean-Baptiste Falcon (1732), developed by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] (1804), and later adopted by [[Semen Korsakov]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[Hermann Hollerith]], and early computer manufacturers like [[IBM]]. Another variant of that idea was the perforated [[paper tape]]. In all those systems, the medium (card or tape) conceptually carried an array of hole positions; each position could be either punched through or not, thus carrying one&amp;nbsp;bit of information. The encoding of text by bits was also used in [[Morse code]] (1844) and early digital communications machines such as [[teletype]]s and [[stock ticker machine]]s (1870).

[[Ralph Hartley]] suggested the use of a logarithmic measure of information in 1928.&lt;ref name="abramson"&gt;Norman Abramson (1963), ''Information theory and coding''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude E. Shannon]] first used the word '''''bit''''' in his seminal 1948 paper ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shannon |first=Claude |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |journal=Bell Labs Technical Journal |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s0Ome6c1?url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He attributed its origin to [[John W. Tukey]], who had written a Bell Labs memo on 9 January 1947 in which he contracted "binary information digit" to simply "bit". [[Vannevar Bush]] had written in 1936 of "bits of information" that could be stored on the [[punched card]]s used in the mechanical computers of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|title=Instrumental analysis|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|year=1936|volume=42|issue=10|pages=649–669|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183499313|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1936-06390-1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006153002/http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183499313|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first programmable computer, built by [[Konrad Zuse]], used binary notation for numbers.

==Physical representation{{anchor|representation}}==&lt;!-- Warning: this heading is the target of a link in [[Flip-flop (electronics)]] --&gt;
A bit can be stored by a digital device or other physical system that exists in either of two possible distinct [[state (computer science)|states]]. These may be the two stable states of a [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], two positions of an [[Switch|electrical switch]], two distinct [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] levels allowed by a [[electrical circuit|circuit]], two distinct levels of [[Irradiance|light intensity]], two directions of [[magnetism|magnetization]] or [[electrical polarity|polarization]], the orientation of reversible double stranded [[DNA]], etc.

Bits can be implemented in several forms. In most modern computing devices, a bit is usually represented by an [[Electricity|electrical]] [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] pulse, or by the electrical state of a [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop circuit]].

For devices using [[positive logic]], a digit value of 1 (or a logical value of true) is represented by a more positive voltage relative to the representation of 0. The specific voltages are different for different logic families and variations are permitted to allow for component aging and noise immunity. For example, in [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) and compatible circuits, digit values 0 and 1 at the output of a device are represented by no higher than 0.4 volts and no lower than 2.6 volts, respectively; while TTL inputs are specified to recognize 0.8 volts or below as 0 and 2.2 volts or above as 1.

===Transmission and processing===
Bits are transmitted one at a time in [[serial transmission]], and by a multiple number of bits in [[parallel transmission]]. A [[bitwise operation]] optionally processes bits one at a time. Data transfer rates are usually measured in decimal SI multiples of the unit [[bit per second]] (bit/s), such as kbit/s.

===Storage===
In the earliest non-electronic information processing devices, such as Jacquard's loom or Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]], a bit was often stored as the position of a mechanical lever or gear, or the presence or absence of a hole at a specific point of a [[Punched card|paper card]] or [[Punched tape|tape]]. The first electrical devices for discrete logic (such as [[elevator]] and [[traffic light]] control circuits, [[telephone switches]], and Konrad Zuse's computer) represented bits as the states of [[electrical relay]]s which could be either "open" or "closed". When relays were replaced by [[vacuum tube]]s, starting in the 1940s, computer builders experimented with a variety of storage methods, such as pressure pulses traveling down a [[mercury delay line]], charges stored on the inside surface of a [[cathode-ray tube]], or opaque spots printed on [[optical disc|glass discs]] by [[photolithographic]] techniques.

In the 1950s and 1960s, these methods were largely supplanted by [[magnetic storage]] devices such as [[magnetic core memory]], [[magnetic tape]]s, [[magnetic drum|drums]], and [[Disk storage|disks]], where a bit was represented by the polarity of [[magnetism|magnetization]] of a certain area of a [[ferromagnetic]] film, or by a change in polarity from one direction to the other. The same principle was later used in the [[magnetic bubble memory]] developed in the 1980s, and is still found in various [[magnetic strip]] items such as [[Rapid transit|metro]] tickets and some [[credit card]]s.

In modern [[semiconductor memory]], such as [[dynamic random-access memory]], the two values of a bit may be represented by two levels of [[electric charge]] stored in a [[capacitor]]. In certain types of [[programmable logic array]]s and [[read-only memory]], a bit may be represented by the presence or absence of a conducting path at a certain point of a circuit. In [[optical disc]]s, a bit is encoded as the presence or absence of a microscopic pit on a reflective surface. In one-dimensional [[bar code]]s, bits are encoded as the thickness of alternating black and white lines.

==Unit and symbol==
The bit is not defined in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). However, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] issued standard [[IEC 60027]], which specifies that the symbol for binary digit should be ''bit'', and this should be used in all multiples, such as ''kbit'', for kilobit.&lt;ref name="nist"&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology (2008), ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units''. [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Online version.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603203340/http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf |date=3 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lower-case letter b is widely used as well and was recommended by the [[IEEE 1541-2002|IEEE 1541 Standard (2002)]]. In contrast, the upper case letter B is the standard and customary symbol for byte.{{Quantities of bits}}

===Multiple bits===
Multiple bits may be expressed and represented in several ways. For convenience of representing commonly reoccurring groups of bits in information technology, several [[units of information]] have traditionally been used. The most common is the unit [[byte]], coined by [[Werner Buchholz]] in June 1956, which historically was used to represent the group of bits used to encode a single [[character (computing)|character]] of text (until [[UTF-8]] multibyte encoding took over) in a computer&lt;ref name="Bemer_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz_1956"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz_1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bemer_1959"/&gt; and for this reason it was used as the basic [[address space|addressable]] element in many [[computer architecture]]s. The trend in hardware design converged on the most common implementation of using eight&amp;nbsp;bits per byte, as it is widely used today. However, because of the ambiguity of relying on the underlying hardware design, the unit [[Octet (computing)|octet]] was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of eight&amp;nbsp;bits.

Computers usually manipulate bits in groups of a fixed size, conventionally named "[[Word (computer architecture)|words]]". Like the byte, the number of bits in a word also varies with the hardware design, and is typically between 8 and 80&amp;nbsp;bits, or even more in some specialized computers. In the 21st century, retail personal or server computers have a word size of 32 or 64&amp;nbsp;bits.

The [[International System of Units]] defines a series of decimal prefixes for multiples of standardized units which are commonly also used with the bit and the byte. The prefixes [[kilo-|kilo]] (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) through [[yotta-|yotta]] (10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;) increment by multiples of 1000, and the corresponding units are the [[kilobit]] (kbit) through the [[yottabit]] (Ybit).

==Information capacity and information compression==
{{Update|type=section|date=October 2018|reason=it cites a fact about global information content in computers from 2007}}
When the information capacity of a storage system or a communication channel is presented in ''bits'' or ''bits per second'', this often refers to binary digits, which is a [[computer hardware]] capacity to store binary data (0 or 1, up or down, current or not, etc.)&lt;ref name="Information in small bits" /&gt;. Information capacity of a storage system is only an upper bound to the quantity of information stored therein. If the two possible values of one&amp;nbsp;bit of storage are not equally likely, that bit of storage contains less than one&amp;nbsp;bit of information. Indeed, if the value is completely predictable, then the reading of that value provides no information at all (zero entropic bits, because no resolution of uncertainty occurs and therefore no information is available). If a computer file that uses ''n''&amp;nbsp;bits of storage contains only ''m'' &lt; ''n''&amp;nbsp;bits of information, then that information can in principle be encoded in about ''m''&amp;nbsp;bits, at least on the average. This principle is the basis of [[lossless data compression|data compression]] technology. Using an analogy, the hardware binary digits refer to the amount of storage space available (like the number of buckets available to store things), and the information content the filling, which comes in different levels of granularity (fine or coarse, that is, compressed or uncompressed information). When the granularity is finer—when information is more compressed—the same bucket can hold more.

For example, it is estimated that the combined technological capacity of the world to store information provides 1,300 [[exabytes]] of hardware digits in 2007.

==Bit-based computing==
Certain [[bitwise operation|bitwise]] computer [[central processing unit|processor]] instructions (such as ''bit set'') operate at the level of manipulating bits rather than manipulating data interpreted as an aggregate of bits.

In the 1980s, when [[bitmap]]ped computer displays became popular, some computers provided specialized [[bitblt|bit block transfer]] ("bitblt" or "blit") instructions to set or copy the bits that corresponded to a given rectangular area on the screen.

In most computers and programming languages, when a bit within a group of bits, such as a byte or word, is referred to, it is usually specified by a number from 0 upwards corresponding to its position within the byte or word. However, 0 can refer to either the [[most significant bit|most]] or [[least significant bit]] depending on the context.

==Other information units==
{{Main article|Units of information}}
Similar to [[angular momentum]] and [[energy]] in physics; [[Information#Information theory approach|information-theoretic information]] and data storage size have the same [[Dimensional analysis|dimensionality]] of [[Unit of measurement|units of measurement]], but there is in general no meaning to adding, subtracting or otherwise combining the units mathematically.

Other units of information, sometimes used in information theory, include the ''[[natural digit]]'' also called a ''[[nat (unit)|nat]]'' or ''[[nit (unit of information)|nit]]'' and defined as [[logarithm|log]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''e'' (≈ 1.443)&amp;nbsp;bits, where ''e'' is the [[e (mathematical constant)|base of the natural logarithms]]; and the ''[[dit (unit)|dit]]'', ''[[ban (unit)|ban]]'', or ''[[hartley (unit)|hartley]]'', defined as log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;10 (≈ 3.322)&amp;nbsp;bits.&lt;ref name="abramson" /&gt; This value, slightly less than 10/3, may be understood because 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1000 ≈ 1024 = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;: three decimal digits are slightly less information than ten binary digits, so one decimal digit is slightly less than 10/3 binary digits. Conversely, one&amp;nbsp;bit of information corresponds to about [[natural logarithm|ln]]&amp;nbsp;2 (≈ 0.693) nats, or log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 (≈ 0.301) hartleys. As with the inverse ratio, this value, approximately 3/10, but slightly more, corresponds to the fact that 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1024 ~ 1000 = 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: ten binary digits are slightly more information than three decimal digits, so one binary digit is slightly more than 3/10 decimal digits. Some authors also define a '''binit''' as an arbitrary information unit equivalent to some fixed but unspecified number of bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Amitabha |author-last=Bhattacharya |title=Digital Communication |publisher=[[Tata McGraw-Hill Education]] |date=2005 |isbn=0070591172 |id={{ISBN|9780070591172}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0CI8bd0upS4C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;lpg=PR20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327011019/https://books.google.com/books?id=0CI8bd0upS4C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;lpg=PR20 |archivedate=27 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[byte]] was described as consisting of any number of parallel bits from one to six. Thus a byte was assumed to have a length appropriate for the occasion. Its first use was in the context of the input-output equipment of the 1950s, which handled six bits at a time. The possibility of going to 8 bit bytes was considered in August 1956 and incorporated in the design of Stretch shortly thereafter. The first published reference to the term occurred in 1959 in a paper "Processing Data in Bits and Pieces" by [[Gerrit Anne Blaauw|G&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;Blaauw]], [[Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr.|F&amp;nbsp;P&amp;nbsp;Brooks&amp;nbsp;Jr]] and [[Werner Buchholz|W&amp;nbsp;Buchholz]] in the ''[[IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers]]'', June 1959, page 121. The notions of that paper were elaborated in Chapter 4 of ''[[#Buchholz-1962|Planning a Computer System (Project Stretch)]]'', edited by W&amp;nbsp;Buchholz, [[McGraw-Hill Book Company]] (1962). The rationale for coining the term was explained there on page 40 as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Byte ''denotes a group of bits used to encode a character, or the number of bits transmitted in parallel to and from input-output units. A term other than ''character'' is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code, and different codes may use different numbers of bits (ie, different byte sizes). In input-output transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters. (The term is coined from ''[[bite]]'', but respelled to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.)''&lt;br /&gt;[[System/360]] took over many of the Stretch concepts, including the basic byte and word sizes, which are powers of 2. For economy, however, the byte size was fixed at the 8 bit maximum, and addressing at the bit level was replaced by byte addressing. […]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29859">In [[mathematics]], a '''Caccioppoli set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] whose [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] is [[measurable set|measurable]] and has (at least [[Local property|locally]]) a ''finite [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]''. A synonym is '''set of (locally) finite perimeter'''. Basically, a set is a Caccioppoli set if its [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] is a [[function of bounded variation]].

== History ==
The basic concept of a Caccioppoli set was firstly introduced by the Italian mathematician [[Renato Caccioppoli]] in the paper {{Harv|Caccioppoli|1927}}: considering a plane set or a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] defined on an [[open set]] in the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]], he defined their [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] or [[Area (geometry)|area]] as the [[total variation]] in the sense of [[Leonida Tonelli|Tonelli]] of their defining [[function (mathematics)|functions]], i.e. of their [[Surface (topology)#Extrinsically defined surfaces and embeddings|parametric equation]]s, ''provided this quantity was [[bounded variation|bounded]]''. The ''measure of the [[boundary (topology)|boundary of a set]] was defined as a '''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]''''', precisely a [[set function]], for the first time: also, being defined on [[open set]]s, it can be defined on all [[Borel set]]s and its value can be approximated by the values it takes  on an increasing [[Net (mathematics)|net]] of [[subset]]s. Another clearly stated (and demonstrated) property of this functional was its ''[[semi-continuity|lower semi-continuity]]''.

In the paper {{Harv|Caccioppoli|1928}}, he precised  by using a ''[[Polygon mesh|triangular mesh]]'' as an increasing [[Net (mathematics)|net]] approximating the open domain, defining ''positive and negative variations'' whose sum is the total variation, i.e. the ''area functional''. His inspiring point of view, as he explicitly admitted, was those of [[Giuseppe Peano]], as expressed by the [[Jordan measure|Peano-Jordan Measure]]: ''to associate to every portion of a surface an [[Orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] plane area in a similar way as an [[Chord (geometry)|approximating chord]] is associated to a curve''. Also, another theme found in this theory was the ''extension of a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' from a [[Linear subspace|subspace]] to the whole [[linear space|ambient space]]: the use of theorems generalizing the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] is frequently encountered in Caccioppoli research. However, the restricted meaning of [[total variation]] in the sense of [[Leonida Tonelli|Tonelli]] added much complication to the formal development of the theory, and the use of a parametric description of the sets restricted its scope.

[[Lamberto Cesari]] introduced the "right" generalization of [[Bounded variation|functions of bounded variation]] to the case of several variables only in 1936:&lt;ref&gt;In the paper {{harv|Cesari|1936}}. See the entries "[[Bounded variation]]" and "[[Total variation]]" for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps, this was one of the reasons that induced Caccioppoli to present an improved version of his theory only nearly 24 years later, in the talk {{Harv|Caccioppoli|1953}} at the IV [[Italian Mathematical Union|UMI]] Congress in October 1951, followed by five notes published in the [http://www.lincei.it/pubblicazioni/rendicontiFMN/inizio_eng.html Rendiconti] of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]]. These notes were sharply criticized by [[Laurence Chisholm Young]] in the [[Mathematical Reviews]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{MR|56067}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 [[Ennio de Giorgi]] presented his first results, developing the ideas of Caccioppoli, on the definition of the measure of boundaries of sets at the [[Salzburg]] Congress of the Austrian Mathematical Society: he obtained this results by using a smoothing operator, analogous to a [[mollifier]], constructed from the [[Gaussian function]], independently proving some results of Caccioppoli. Probably he was led to study this theory by his teacher and friend [[Mauro Picone]], who had also been the teacher of Caccioppoli and was likewise his friend. De Giorgi met Caccioppoli in 1953 for the first time: during their meeting, Caccioppoli expressed a profound appreciation of his work, starting their lifelong friendship.&lt;ref&gt;It lasted up to the tragic death of Caccioppoli in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he published his first paper on the topic i.e. {{Harv|De Giorgi|1953}}: however, this paper and the closely following one did not attracted much interest from the mathematical community. It was only with the paper {{Harv|De Giorgi|1954}}, reviewed again by Laurence Chisholm Young in the Mathematical Reviews,&lt;ref&gt;See {{MR|0062214}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that his approach to sets of finite perimeter became widely known and appreciated: also, in the review, Young revised  his previous criticism on the work of Caccioppoli.

The last paper of De Giorgi on the theory of [[perimeter]]s was published in 1958: in 1959, after the death of Caccioppoli, he started to call sets of finite perimeter "Caccioppoli sets". Two years later [[Herbert Federer]] and [[Wendell Fleming]] published their paper {{Harv|Federer|Fleming|1960}}, changing the approach to the theory. Basically they introduced two new kind of [[current (mathematics)|currents]], respectively [[normal current]]s and [[integral current]]s: in a subsequent series of papers and in his famous treatise,&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Federer|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Federer showed that Caccioppoli sets are normal [[current (mathematics)|currents]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[euclidean space]]s. However, even if the theory of Caccioppoli sets can be studied within the framework of theory of [[current (mathematics)|currents]], it is customary to study it through the "traditional" approach using [[Bounded variation|functions of bounded variation]], as the various sections found in a lot of important [[monograph]]s in [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical physics]] testify.&lt;ref&gt;See the "[[Caccioppoli set#References|References]]" section.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==
In what follows, the definition and properties of [[Bounded variation|functions of bounded variation]] in the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional setting will be used.

=== Caccioppoli definition ===
'''Definition 1'''. Let ''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;'' be an [[open subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\R^n &lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Borel set]]. The ''[[perimeter]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;'' is defined as follows

:&lt;math&gt;P(E,\Omega) = V\left(\chi_E,\Omega\right):=\sup\left\{\int_\Omega \chi_E(x) \mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x : \boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\R^n),\ \|\boldsymbol{\phi}\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\le 1\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the perimeter of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in an open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the [[total variation]] of its [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] on that open set. If &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \R^n&lt;/math&gt;, then we write &lt;math&gt;P(E) = P(E,\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; for the (global) perimeter.

'''Definition 2'''. The [[Borel set]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a '''Caccioppoli set''' if and only if it has finite perimeter in every [[bounded set|bounded]] [[open subset]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\R ^n &lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;P(E,\Omega)&lt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \R^n&lt;/math&gt; is open and bounded.

Therefore, a Caccioppoli set has a [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] whose [[total variation]] is locally bounded. From the theory of [[Bounded variation|functions of bounded variation]] it is known that this implies the existence of a [[Euclidean vector|vector-valued]] [[Radon measure]] &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega\chi_E(x)\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x = \int_E\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = -\int_\Omega \langle\boldsymbol{\phi}, D\chi_E(x)\rangle \qquad \forall\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\R ^n)&lt;/math&gt;

As noted for the case of general [[Bounded variation|functions of bounded variation]], this vector [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Distribution (mathematics)#Formal definition|distributional]] or [[weak derivative|weak]] [[gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;\chi_E&lt;/math&gt;. The total variation measure associated with &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;|D\chi_E|&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. for every open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \R^n&lt;/math&gt; we write &lt;math&gt;|D\chi_E|(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;P(E, \Omega) = V(\chi_E, \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== De Giorgi definition ===
In his papers {{Harv|De Giorgi|1953}} and {{Harv|De Giorgi|1954}}, [[Ennio de Giorgi]] introduces the following [[smoothing operator]], analogous to the [[Weierstrass transform]] in the one-[[Dimension (mathematics)|dimensional]] case

:&lt;math&gt;W_\lambda\chi_E(x)=\int_{\R ^n}g_\lambda(x-y)\chi_E(y)\mathrm{d}y = (\pi\lambda)^{-\frac{n}{2}}\int_Ee^{-\frac{(x-y)^2}{\lambda}}\mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

As one can easily prove, &lt;math&gt;W_\lambda\chi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth function]] for all &lt;math&gt;x\in\R^n&lt;/math&gt;, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\lambda\to 0}W_\lambda\chi_E(x)=\chi_E(x)&lt;/math&gt;

also, its [[gradient]] is everywhere well defined, and so is its [[absolute value]]

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla W_\lambda\chi_E(x) = \mathrm{grad}W_\lambda\chi_E(x) = DW_\lambda\chi_E(x) = 
\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial W_\lambda\chi_E(x)}{\partial x_1}\\ \vdots\\ \frac{\partial W_\lambda\chi_E(x)}{\partial x_n}\\ \end{pmatrix} 
\Longleftrightarrow
\left | DW_\lambda\chi_E(x)\right | = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n\left|\frac{\partial W_\lambda\chi_E(x)}{\partial x_k}\right|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Having defined this function, De Giorgi gives the following definition of [[perimeter]]:

'''Definition 3'''. Let '''&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;''' be an [[open subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Borel set]]. The ''[[perimeter]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;'' is the value

:&lt;math&gt;P(E,\Omega) = \lim_{\lambda\to 0}\int_\Omega | DW_\lambda\chi_E(x) | \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;

Actually De Giorgi considered the case &lt;math&gt;\Omega=\R ^n&lt;/math&gt;: however, the extension to the general case is not difficult. It can be proved that the two definitions are exactly equivalent: for a proof see the already cited De Giorgi's papers or the book {{Harv|Giusti|1984}}. Now having defined what a perimeter is, De Giorgi gives the same definition 2 of what a set of [[Local property|(locally) finite]] perimeter is.

== Basic properties ==

The following properties are the ordinary properties which the general notion of a [[perimeter]] is supposed to have:

* If &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subseteq\Omega_1&lt;/math&gt; then&lt;math&gt;P(E,\Omega)\leq P(E,\Omega_1)&lt;/math&gt;, with equality holding if and only if the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a compact subset of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.
* For any two Cacciopoli sets &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;, the relation &lt;math&gt;P(E_1\cup E_2,\Omega)\leq P(E_1,\Omega) + P(E_2,\Omega_1)&lt;/math&gt; holds, with equality holding if and only if &lt;math&gt;d(E_1,E_2)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Distance#Distances between sets and between a point and a set|distance between sets]] in [[euclidean space]].
* If the [[Lebesgue measure]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P(E)=0&lt;/math&gt;: this implies that if the [[symmetric difference]] &lt;math&gt;E_1\triangle E_2&lt;/math&gt; of two sets has zero Lebesgue measure, the two sets have the same perimeter i.e. &lt;math&gt;P(E_1)=P(E_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Notions of boundary ==

For any given Caccioppoli set &lt;math&gt;E \subset \R ^n&lt;/math&gt; there exist two naturally associated analytic quantities: the vector-valued [[Radon measure]] &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; and its [[Total variation#Total variation in measure theory|total variation measure]] &lt;math&gt;|D\chi_E|&lt;/math&gt;. Given that

:&lt;math&gt; P(E, \Omega) = \int_{\Omega} |D\chi_E| &lt;/math&gt;

is the perimeter within any open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, one should expect that &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; alone should somehow account for the perimeter of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The topological boundary ===

It is natural to try to understand the relationship between the objects &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|D\chi_E|&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Boundary (topology)|topological boundary]] &lt;math&gt;\partial E&lt;/math&gt;. There is an elementary lemma that guarantees that the [[Distribution (mathematics)#Support of a distribution|support]] (in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]) of &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore also &lt;math&gt;|D\chi_E|&lt;/math&gt;, is always '''contained''' in &lt;math&gt;\partial E&lt;/math&gt;:

'''Lemma'''. The support of the vector-valued Radon measure &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] of the [[Boundary (topology)|topological boundary]] &lt;math&gt;\partial E&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof'''. To see this choose &lt;math&gt;x_0 \notin\partial E&lt;/math&gt;: then &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the [[open set]] &lt;math&gt;\R ^n\setminus\partial E&lt;/math&gt; and this implies that it belongs to an [[open neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; contained in the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; or in the interior of &lt;math&gt;\R^n\setminus E&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\phi \in C^1_c(A; \R ^n)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq(\R^n \setminus E)^\circ=\R^n\setminus E^-&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E^-&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\chi_E(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega \langle\boldsymbol{\phi}, D\chi_E(x)\rangle =- \int_A\chi_E(x) \, \operatorname{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\, \mathrm{d}x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, if &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq E^\circ &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\chi_E(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; so

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \langle\boldsymbol{\phi}, D\chi_E(x)\rangle = -\int_A\operatorname{div} \boldsymbol{\phi}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;\phi \in C^1_c(A, \R^n)&lt;/math&gt; arbitrary it follows that &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is outside the support of &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The reduced boundary ===

The topological boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial E&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be too crude for Caccioppoli sets because its [[Hausdorff measure]] overcompensates for the perimeter &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt; defined above. Indeed, the Caccioppoli set

:&lt;math&gt;E = \{ (x,y) : 0 \leq x, y \leq 1 \} \cup \{ (x, 0) : -1 \leq x \leq 1 \} \subset \R^2 &lt;/math&gt;

representing a square together with a line segment sticking out on the left has perimeter &lt;math&gt;P(E) = 4&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the extraneous line segment is ignored, while its topological boundary

:&lt;math&gt;\partial E = \{(x, 0) : -1 \leq x \leq 1 \} \cup \{(x, 1) : 0 \leq x \leq 1 \} \cup \{(x, y) : x \in \{0, 1\}, 0 \leq y \leq 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

has one-dimensional Hausdorff measure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^1(\partial E) = 5&lt;/math&gt;.

The "correct" boundary should therefore be a subset of &lt;math&gt;\partial E&lt;/math&gt;. We define:

'''Definition 4'''. The '''reduced boundary''' of a Caccioppoli set &lt;math&gt;E \subset \R ^n&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt; and is defined to be equal to be the collection of points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at which the limit:

:&lt;math&gt; \nu_E(x) := \lim_{\rho \downarrow 0} \frac{D\chi_E(B_\rho(x))}{|D\chi_E|(B_\rho(x))} \in \R^n&lt;/math&gt;

exists and has length equal to one, i.e. &lt;math&gt;|\nu_E(x)| = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

One can remark that by the [[Radon-Nikodym Theorem]] the reduced boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily contained in the support of &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn is contained in the topological boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial E&lt;/math&gt; as explained in the section above. That is:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^* E \subseteq \operatorname{support} D\chi_E \subseteq \partial E&lt;/math&gt;

The inclusions above are not necessarily equalities as the previous example shows. In that example, &lt;math&gt;\partial E&lt;/math&gt; is the square with the segment sticking out, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{support} D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; is the square, and &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt; is the square without its four corners.

=== De Giorgi's theorem ===

For convenience, in this section we treat only the case where &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \R ^n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; has (globally) finite perimeter. De Giorgi's theorem provides geometric intuition for the notion of reduced boundaries and confirms that it is the more natural definition for Caccioppoli sets by showing

:&lt;math&gt; P(E) \left( = \int |D\chi_E| \right) = \mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\partial^* E)&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. that its [[Hausdorff measure]] equals the perimeter of the set. The statement of the theorem is quite long because it interrelates various geometric notions in one fell swoop.

'''Theorem'''. Suppose &lt;math&gt;E \subset \R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a Caccioppoli set. Then at each point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the reduced boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt; there exists a multiplicity one [[approximate tangent space]] &lt;math&gt;T_x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;|D\chi_E|&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. a codimension-1 subspace &lt;math&gt;T_x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\R ^n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\lambda \downarrow 0} \int_{\R^n} f(\lambda^{-1}(z-x)) |D\chi_E|(z) = \int_{T_x} f(y) \, d\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt;

for every continuous, compactly supported &lt;math&gt;f : \R ^n \to \R &lt;/math&gt;. In fact the subspace &lt;math&gt;T_x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[orthogonal complement]] of the unit vector

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_E(x) = \lim_{\rho \downarrow 0} \frac{D\chi_E(B_\rho(x))}{|D\chi_E|(B_\rho(x))} \in \R ^n&lt;/math&gt;

defined previously. This unit vector also satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\lambda \downarrow 0} \left \{ \lambda^{-1}(z - x) : z \in E \right \} \to \left \{ y \in \R^n : y \cdot \nu_E(x) &gt; 0 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

locally in &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;, so it is interpreted as an approximate inward pointing [[Unit vector|unit]] [[Normal (geometry)|normal vector]] to the reduced boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt; is (n-1)-[[Rectifiable set|rectifiable]] and the restriction of (n-1)-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;|D\chi_E|&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;|D\chi_E|(A) = \mathcal{H}^{n-1}(A \cap \partial^* E)&lt;/math&gt; for all Borel sets &lt;math&gt;A \subset \R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, up to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;-measure zero the reduced boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest set on which &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; is supported.

== Applications ==

=== A Gauss–Green formula ===
From the definition of the vector [[Radon measure]] &lt;math&gt;D\chi_E&lt;/math&gt; and from the properties of the perimeter, the following formula holds true:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_E\operatorname{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = -\int_{\partial E} \langle\boldsymbol{\phi}, D\chi_E(x)\rangle 
\qquad \boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega, \R^n)&lt;/math&gt;

This is one version of the [[divergence theorem]] for [[Domain (mathematics)#Real and complex analysis|domains]] with non smooth [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]. De Giorgi's theorem can be used to formulate the same identity in terms of the reduced boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial^* E&lt;/math&gt; and the approximate inward pointing unit normal vector &lt;math&gt;\nu_E&lt;/math&gt;. Precisely, the following equality holds

:&lt;math&gt;\int_E \operatorname{div} \boldsymbol{\phi}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = - \int_{\partial^* E} \boldsymbol{\phi}(x) \cdot \nu_E(x) \, \mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) \qquad \boldsymbol{\phi} \in C^1_c(\Omega, \R^n)&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information''' (informally, '''NSQI''') is a research centre within the [[University of Bristol]]. The centre was initially built as an intra-university facility, but was absorbed into the portfolio of the School of Physics in 2016. The centre officially opened in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2009/6531.html| title = Official opening of the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre was designed to provide a unique ultra-low-vibration research space, making the labs some of the quietest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/news__events/news/quietest_building_in_the_world.aspx| title = 'Quietest building in the world' officially opens| accessdate = 8 November 2011| publisher = Capita Symonds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://physicsworld.com/blog/2009/09/visting_the_quietest_building.html| title = Visiting the quietest building in the world| accessdate = 10 November 2011 | publisher = Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The Building ==

=== Building layout ===
The building is split across four floors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/| title = Facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Basement: is entirely for the most sensitive experimental work, with seven low noise labs, two ultra-low noise labs, an [[anechoic chamber]] and a class 1000 [[cleanroom]], as well as three prep labs. 
* Ground Floor: has two Quantum Information labs (with less stringent noise requirements), staff offices (including an office dedicated for users of the [[NanoESCA]] facility contained in the NSQI basement) plus a seminar room and large, bright, open foyer and coffee area.
* First Floor: houses researchers, students and operations staff associated with [[QETLabs]], the [[QE-CDT]] and affiliated quantum technologies groups.
* Second Floor: contains another office and a large Quantum Engineering Technology lab; a main interdisciplinary communal lab containing a clean room area and several annex labs. 
* Third Floor: location of the main switch room and plant room for all the Centre services (water tanks, boilers, air handling units etc.).

=== Building design features ===
The building was designed by Percy Thomas of Capita Architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.capitaarchitecture.co.uk/capita.html| title = Capita Architecture| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Capita Architecturel}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 and built by Willmott Dixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.willmottdixongroup.co.uk/assets/h/i/highereducationbrochure.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110409174626/http://www.willmottdixongroup.co.uk/assets/h/i/highereducationbrochure.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 9 April 2011| title = Higher Education Profile| page = 11| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Willmott Dixon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary requirement for the building was that it be a low-[[noise]] research environment, stable enough to allow researchers to take measurements at subnanometre and subnanoNewton resolution, despite other activities going on around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jan/05/quietest-building-chemists-physicists-engineers| title = Delicate science| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = The Guardian| location=London| first=Louise| last=Tickle| date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria set for the research space exceeded any standard curve (VC curves) and required significant design and engineering solutions.

==== Low vibrations ====
The primary source of noise for researchers at the [[nanoscale]] is mechanical [[vibration]]. Activities within a building generate noise that can travel through the structure and vibrations created outside (such as from road traffic) can travel through the ground and enter the building. A variety of methods were employed to reduce vibration generation, travel and entry into the lab space:

* The main structure of the building is massive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.naturalarchitecture.co.uk/project_scientific_1.htm| title = New centre for Nano-science and Quantum Information, University of Bristol| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Natural Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.0 m-thick concrete foundations and 0.5 m-thick concrete floors.
* All plant machinery is removed to the third floor, as far from the lab space as possible.
* All services and plant machinery is suspended on springs, rubber pads or damper pads to reduce coupling between the mechanism and the building.
* All services are balanced to reduce turbulence within pipe and ductwork.
* All corridors are floating, separate from the main structure, stopping vibrations crossing the floor and major foot traffic from affecting the building.
* The lift shaft is decoupled from the building structure.
* The building is decoupled from the building next door.
* All services pass through a flexible hose coupling before entering the low noise labs.
* All Low noise labs have a seven tonne concrete isolation block set on damper pads, within the ground slab. This is the experimental space, with lower vibrations than the surrounding floor and allowing experiments to continue while the researcher walks around within the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/lownoise.html| title = Low noise lab facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both ultra-low noise labs have either a 23-tonne or 27-tonne concrete isolation block supported by [[pneumatic]] rams. The block is T-shaped in cross-section, to keep the centre of gravity lower (reducing wobble within the block). The block is surrounded by a floating floor, so that researchers can use the room while experiments are taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/ultra-lownoise.html| title = Ultra low noise lab facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To further reduce the noise in the ultra-low noise labs, control equipment can be removed from the room and installed in the neighbouring control room. The control room has its own isolation block and is heavily soundproofed. Conduits allow cables to run between the labs, allowing the experiment to be completely run from the control room.
*

==== Soundproofing ====
Acoustic noise within the building is countered through several measures. Most importantly, experimental rooms are far from the busy University precinct, underground and in an area that is not used for teaching, or as a thoroughfare. The thickness of the floor ensures that little sound penetrates across and the walls between labs and doors of the labs are soundproof. The plant machinery is removed as far from the labs as possible, on the top floor, and the services are tuned as precisely as possible to reduce any sounds from the water supply, chilled water system or air vents.

==== Low electrical noise ====
Many of the experiments planned for the Centre involve recording tiny electrical currents (as low as a few picoAmps) so electrical noise is seen as a serious problem. Each basement research lab is a full [[Faraday cage]], all service pipework changes to plastic before entering the lab and no [[Category 5 cable]] (cat5e) is used in data network, [[optical fibre]] is used instead. All labs are also supplied with an independent earth and 'clean' power supply, the mains having been filtered by a 1:1 [[transformer]].

==== Interdisciplinary space ====
In addition to providing state-of-the-art low noise spaces, the building is also designed to encourage collaboration and interdisciplinary research. This includes plenty of meeting spaces and a light &amp; spacious foyer/coffee area.

The '''centrolinead''' was invented by [[Peter Nicholson (architect)|Peter Nicholson]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] and [[architect]], in 1814.&lt;ref name="practical"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Thomas|title=Practical Geometry, Linear Perspective, and Projection: Including Isometrical Perspective, Projections of the Sphere, and the Projection of Shadows, with Descriptions of the Principal Instruments Used in Geometrical Drawing, &amp;c. ...

[[technical drawing|Draftsmen]] could use the instrument in pairs; one for each vanishing point on each side of the [[station point]].

Centrolineads were produced in various sizes. Typically a [[brass]] fitting clamped the [[wood]]en arms together. Fittings were produced in both right and left-handed configuration, and certain adjustable designs could be used on either side.

== Usage ==
Two short arms are set to form 90 degree angles against a third, longer drawing edge. [[Pin (device)|Pins]] are placed near the edges of the drawing surface and serve as pivots for the arms. Pin placement is equidistant and symmetric across the [[horizon|horizontal line]]. A third centrolinead could be used to construct [[Perspective (graphical)#Three-point perspective|3-point perspective]].

The diagram shown above does not represent the centrolinead designed by Nicholson.

In [[mathematics]], a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] may be '''continuous''' or '''discrete'''. If it can take on two particular [[real number|real]] values such that it can also take on all real values between them (even values that are arbitrarily close together), the variable is continuous in that [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]. If it can take on a value such that there is a non-[[infinitesimal]] gap on each side of it containing no values that the variable can take on, then it is discrete around that value.&lt;ref&gt;K.D. Joshi, ''Foundations of Discrete Mathematics'', 1989, New Age International Limited, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RM1D3mFw2u0C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=continuous+discrete+variable+math&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uGtCVeT-F-TjsAS4noGYDw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=continuous%20discrete%20variable%20math&amp;f=false], page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;   In some contexts a variable can be discrete in some ranges of the [[number line]] and continuous in others.

==Continuous variable==

A '''continuous variable'''  is one which can take on infinitely many, [[Uncountable set|uncountable]] values.

For example, a variable over a non-empty range of the [[real number]]s is continuous, if it can take on any value in that range. The reason is that any range of real numbers between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \mathbb{R}; a \neq b&lt;/math&gt; is infinite and uncountable.

Methods of [[calculus]] are often used in problems in which the variables are continuous, for example in continuous [[optimization]] problems.

In [[statistics|statistical theory]], the [[probability distribution]]s of continuous variables can be expressed in terms of [[probability density function]]s.

In [[continuous time|continuous-time]] [[dynamical system|dynamics]], the variable ''time'' is treated as continuous, and the equation describing the evolution of some variable over time is a [[differential equation]]. The [[instantaneous rate of change]] is a well-defined concept.

==Discrete variable==
In contrast, a '''discrete variable''' over a particular range of real values is one for which, for any value in the range that the variable is permitted to take on, there is a positive minimum distance to the nearest other permissible value. The number of permitted values is either finite or [[countably infinite]]. Common examples are variables that must be integers, non-negative integers, positive integers, or only the integers 0 and 1.

Methods of calculus do not readily lend themselves to problems involving discrete variables. Examples of problems involving discrete variables include [[integer programming]].

In statistics, the probability distributions of discrete variables can be expressed in terms of [[probability mass function]]s.

In [[discrete time]] dynamics, the variable ''time'' is treated as discrete, and the equation of evolution of some variable over time is called a [[difference equation]].

In [[econometrics]] and more generally in [[regression analysis]], sometimes some of the variables being [[empirical]]ly related to each other are 0-1 variables, being permitted to take on only those two values. A variable of this type is called a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. If the [[dependent variable]] is a dummy variable, then [[logistic regression]] or [[probit regression]] is commonly employed.

'''''Cryptographie indéchiffrable''''' (subtitle: ''basée sur de nouvelles combinaisons rationelles'') &lt;!-- a translation would be helpful here --&gt; is a French book on [[cryptography]] written by [[Émile Victor Théodore Myszkowski]] (a retired French colonel) and published in 1902.

His book described a [[cipher]] that the author had invented and claimed (incorrectly) was "undecipherable" (i.e. secure against unauthorised attempts to read it). It was based on a form of [[repeated-key transposition]].

'''Eliakim Hastings Moore''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|l|aɪ|ə|k|ɪ|m}}; January 26, 1862 – December 30, 1932), usually cited as '''E. H. Moore''' or '''E. Hastings Moore''', was an American [[mathematician]].

==Life==
Moore, the son of a Methodist minister and grandson of US Congressman [[Eliakim H. Moore]], discovered mathematics through a summer job at the [[Cincinnati Observatory]] while in high school. He learned mathematics at [[Yale University]], where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]]&lt;ref name="Yaleobit193233"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1925_1952/1932-33.pdf | title=Obituary Record of Graduates of Yale University Deceased during the Year 1932–1933 | publisher=Yale University | date=October 15, 1933 | accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47–8}} and obtained a [[B.A.]] in 1883 and the [[Ph.D.]] in 1885 with a thesis, supervised by [[Hubert Anson Newton]], on some work of [[William Kingdon Clifford]] and [[Arthur Cayley]]. Newton encouraged Moore to study in Germany, and thus he spent an academic year at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], attending lectures by [[Leopold Kronecker]] and [[Karl Weierstrass]].

On his return to the United States, Moore taught at Yale and at [[Northwestern University]]. When the [[University of Chicago]] opened its doors in 1892, Moore was the first head of its mathematics department, a position he retained until his death in 1931. His first two colleagues were [[Oskar Bolza]] and [[Heinrich Maschke]]. The resulting department was the second research-oriented mathematics department in American history, after [[Johns Hopkins University]]. &lt;!-- Until World War II, many  Americans took doctoral degrees from European universities, especially [[Göttingen University]]. --&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Moore first worked in [[abstract algebra]], proving in 1893 the classification of the structure of [[finite fields]] (also called [[Galois field]]s). Around 1900, he began working on the foundations of [[geometry]]. He reformulated [[Hilbert's axioms]] for geometry so that [[Point (geometry)|point]]s were the only [[primitive notion]], thus turning [[David Hilbert]]'s primitive lines and planes into defined notions. In 1902, he further showed that one of Hilbert's axioms for geometry was redundant. Independently,&lt;ref name="Wilder1976"&gt;{{cite web

Moore]] (no relation) also proved this, but in a more elegant fashion than E. H. Moore used.  When E. H. Moore heard of the feat, he arranged for a scholarship that would allow R.L. Moore to study for a doctorate at Chicago. E.H. Moore's work on axiom systems is considered one of the starting points for [[metamathematics]] and [[model theory]]. After 1906, he turned to the foundations of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. The concept of a [[closure operator]] first appeared in his 1910 ''Introduction to a form of general analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Blyth, ''Lattices and Ordered Algebraic Structures'', Springer, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85233-905-5}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote on [[algebraic geometry]], [[number theory]], and [[integral equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bliss, G.

At Chicago, Moore supervised 31 doctoral dissertations, including those of [[George Birkhoff]], [[Leonard Dickson]], [[Robert Lee Moore]] (no relation), and [[Oswald Veblen]]. Birkhoff and Veblen went on to lead departments at Harvard and Princeton, respectively. Dickson became the first great American algebraist and number theorist. Robert Moore founded American topology. According to the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]], as of December 2012, E. H. Moore had  over 18,900 known "descendants."

Moore convinced the [[New York Mathematical Society]] to change its name to the [[American Mathematical Society]], whose Chicago branch he led. He presided over the AMS, 1901–02, and edited the ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'', 1899–1907. He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]]. He was an Invited Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1908 in Rome and in 1912 in Cambridge, England.

The [[American Mathematical Society]] established a prize in his honor in 2002.

{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}

'''Eisenstein series''', named after German mathematician [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], are particular [[modular form]]s with [[infinite series]] expansions that may be written down directly. Originally defined for the [[modular group]], Eisenstein series can be generalized in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s.

== Eisenstein series for the modular group ==
[[Image:Gee_three_real.jpeg|thumb|The real part of {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a function of {{mvar|q}} on the [[unit disk]].]]
[[Image:Gee_three_imag.jpeg|thumb|The imaginary part of {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a function of {{mvar|q}} on the unit disk.]]

Let {{mvar|τ}} be a [[complex number]] with strictly positive [[imaginary part]]. Define the '''holomorphic Eisenstein series''' {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''τ'')}} of weight {{math|2''k''}}, where {{math|''k'' ≥ 2}} is an integer, by the following series:

:&lt;math&gt;G_{2k}(\tau) = \sum_{ (m,n)\in\Z^2\setminus(0,0)} \frac{1}{(m+n\tau )^{2k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This series [[absolute convergence|absolutely converges]] to a holomorphic function of {{mvar|τ}} in the [[upper half-plane]] and its Fourier expansion given below shows that it extends to a holomorphic function at {{math|''τ'' {{=}} ''i''∞}}. It is a remarkable fact that the Eisenstein series is a [[modular form]]. Indeed, the key property is its {{math|SL(2, '''ℤ''')}}-invariance. Explicitly if {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' ∈ '''ℤ'''}} and {{math|''ad'' − ''bc'' {{=}} 1}} then

:&lt;math&gt;G_{2k} \left( \frac{ a\tau +b}{ c\tau + d} \right) = (c\tau +d)^{2k} G_{2k}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

{{Hidden &lt;!--(omit for initial hidden state)--&gt;
| style = border:1px solid black; text-align:left;width: 70%;
| multiline=
| headerstyle = text-align:left;
| header = (Proof)
| contentstyle = text-align:left;
| content =
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G_{2k}\left(\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right) &amp;= \sum_{(m,n) \in \Z^2 \setminus (0,0)} \frac{1}{\left(m+n\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right)^{2k}} \\
&amp;= \sum_{(m,n) \in \Z^2 \setminus (0,0)} \frac{(c\tau+d)^{2k}}{(md+nb+(mc+na)\tau)^{2k}} \\
&amp;= \sum_{\left(m',n'\right) = (m,n)\begin{pmatrix}d \ \ c\\b \ \ a\end{pmatrix}\atop (m,n)\in \Z^2 \setminus (0,0)} \frac{(c\tau+d)^{2k}}{\left(m'+n'\tau\right)^{2k}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''ad'' − ''bc'' {{=}} 1}} then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}d &amp; c\\b &amp; a\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}\ a &amp; -c\\-b &amp; \ d\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;(m,n) \mapsto (m,n)\begin{pmatrix}d &amp; c\\b &amp; a\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
is a bijection {{math|'''ℤ'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → '''ℤ'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e.:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\left(m',n'\right) = (m,n)\begin{pmatrix}d \ \ c\\b \ \ a\end{pmatrix}\atop (m,n)\in \Z^2 \setminus (0,0)} \frac{1}{\left(m'+n'\tau\right)^{2k}} = \sum_{\left(m',n'\right)\in \mathbb{Z}^2 \setminus (0,0)} \frac{1}{(m'+n'\tau)^{2k}} = G_{2k}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

Overall, if {{math|''ad'' − ''bc'' {{=}} 1}} then
:&lt;math&gt;G_{2k}\left(\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right) = (c\tau+d)^{2k} G_{2k}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

and {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is therefore a modular form of weight {{math|2''k''}}. Note that it is important to assume that {{math|''k'' ≥ 2}}, otherwise it would be illegitimate to change the order of summation, and the {{math|SL(2, '''ℤ''')}}-invariance would not hold. In fact, there are no nontrivial modular forms of weight 2. Nevertheless, an analogue of the holomorphic Eisenstein series can be defined even for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1}}, although it would only be a [[quasimodular form]].

== Relation to modular invariants ==
The [[Elliptic modular function|modular invariants]] {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} of an [[elliptic curve]] are given by the first two Eisenstein series:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} g_2 &amp;= 60 G_4 \\ g_3 &amp;= 140 G_6 .\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The article on modular invariants provides expressions for these two functions in terms of [[theta function]]s.

== Recurrence relation ==
Any holomorphic modular form for the modular group can be written as a polynomial in {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Specifically, the higher order {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be written in terms of {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} through a [[recurrence relation]].  Let {{math|''d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} (2''k'' + 3)''k''! ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2''k'' + 4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, so for example, {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 3''G''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 5''G''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then the {{mvar|d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfy the relation

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} d_k d_{n-k} = \frac{2n+9}{3n+6}d_{n+2}&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}. Here, {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''k''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} is the [[binomial coefficient]].

The {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} occur in the series expansion for the [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\wp(z) &amp;=\frac{1}{z^2} + z^2 \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac {d_k z^{2k}}{k!} \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{z^2} + \sum_{k=1}^\infty (2k+1) G_{2k+2} z^{2k}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Fourier series ==
[[Image:Eisenstein_4.jpg|right|thumb|{{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]
[[Image:Eisenstein_6.jpg|right|thumb|{{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]
[[Image:Eisenstein_8.jpg|right|thumb|{{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]
[[Image:Eisenstein_10.jpg|right|thumb|{{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]
[[Image:Eisenstein_12.jpg|right|thumb|{{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]
[[Image:Eisenstein_14.jpg|right|thumb|{{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]

Define {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2π''iτ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. (Some older books define {{mvar|q}} to be the [[nome (mathematics)|nome]] {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;{{pi}}''iτ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2{{pi}}''iτ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is now standard in number theory.) Then the [[Fourier series]] of the Eisenstein series is

:&lt;math&gt;G_{2k}(\tau) = 2\zeta(2k) \left(1+c_{2k}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sigma_{2k-1}(n)q^n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c_{2k} &amp;= \frac{(2\pi i)^{2k}}{(2k-1)! \zeta(2k)} \\[4pt]
&amp;= \frac {-4k}{B_{2k}} = \frac 2 {\zeta(1-2k)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the [[Bernoulli number]]s, {{math|''ζ''(''z'')}} is [[Riemann's zeta function]] and {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}} is the [[divisor function|divisor sum function]], the sum of the {{mvar|p}}th powers of the divisors of {{mvar|n}}. In particular, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G_4(\tau)&amp;=\frac{\pi^4}{45} \left( 1+ 240\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sigma_3(n) q^{n} \right) \\[4pt]
G_6(\tau)&amp;=\frac{2\pi^6}{945} \left( 1- 504\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sigma_5(n) q^n \right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The summation over {{mvar|q}} can be resummed as a [[Lambert series]]; that is, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} q^n \sigma_a(n) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^a q^n}{1-q^n}&lt;/math&gt;

for arbitrary [[complex number|complex]] {{math|{{abs|''q''}} &lt; 1}} and {{mvar|a}}. When working with the [[q-expansion|{{mvar|q}}-expansion]] of the Eisenstein series, this alternate notation is frequently introduced:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_{2k}(\tau)&amp;=\frac{G_{2k}(\tau)}{2\zeta (2k)}\\
&amp;= 1+\frac {2}{\zeta(1-2k)}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^{2k-1} q^n}{1-q^n} \\
&amp;= 1- \frac{2\cdot 2k}{B_{2k}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sigma_{2k-1}(n)q^n \\
&amp;= 1 - \frac{4k}{B_{2k}} \sum_{d,n \geq 1} n^{2k-1} q^{nd}. \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

== Identities involving Eisenstein series ==

=== As theta functions ===

Given {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2{{pi}}''iτ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, let

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_4(\tau)&amp;=1+240\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {n^3q^n}{1-q^n} \\
E_6(\tau)&amp;=1-504\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {n^5q^n}{1-q^n} \\
E_8(\tau)&amp;=1+480\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {n^7q^n}{1-q^n}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and define

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a&amp;=\theta_2\left(0; e^{\pi i\tau}\right)=\vartheta_{10}(0; \tau) \\
b&amp;=\theta_3\left(0; e^{\pi i\tau}\right)=\vartheta_{00}(0; \tau) \\
c&amp;=\theta_4\left(0; e^{\pi i\tau}\right)=\vartheta_{01}(0; \tau)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''θ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''ϑ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are alternative notations for the [[Theta function#Auxiliary functions|Jacobi theta functions]]. Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_4(\tau)&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(a^8+b^8+c^8\right), \\[4pt]
E_6(\tau)&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2} \left(-3a^8 \left( b^4+c^4\right) + b^{12} + c^{12}\right) \\[4pt]
&amp; = \tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\left(a^8+b^8+c^8\right)^3-54(abc)^8}{2}},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

thus,

:&lt;math&gt;E_4^3-E_6^2 = \tfrac{27}{4}(abc)^8 &lt;/math&gt;

an expression related to the [[J-invariant#Expressions in terms of theta functions|modular discriminant]],

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = g_2^3-27g_3^2 = (2\pi)^{12} \left(\tfrac{1}{2}a b c\right)^8&lt;/math&gt;

Also, since {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''{{su|b=4|p=2}}}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}, this implies

:&lt;math&gt;E_8(\tau)=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(a^{16}+b^{16}+c^{16}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Products of Eisenstein series ===

Eisenstein series form the most explicit examples of [[modular form]]s for the full modular group {{math|SL(2, '''ℤ''')}}. Since the space of modular forms of weight {{math|2''k''}} has dimension 1 for {{math|2''k'' {{=}} 4, 6, 8, 10, 14}}, different products of Eisenstein series having those weights have to be equal up to a scalar multiple. In fact, we obtain the identities:

:&lt;math&gt;E_4^2 = E_8, \quad E_4 E_6 = E_{10}, \quad E_4 E_{10} = E_{14}, \quad E_6 E_8 = E_{14}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the {{mvar|q}}-expansions of the Eisenstein series given above, they may be restated as identities involving the sums of powers of divisors:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+240\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sigma_3(n) q^n\right)^2 = 1+480\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sigma_7(n) q^n,&lt;/math&gt;

hence

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_7(n)=\sigma_3(n)+120\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}\sigma_3(m)\sigma_3(n-m),&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the others. The [[theta function]] of an eight-dimensional even unimodular lattice {{math|Γ}} is a modular form of weight 4 for the full modular group, which gives the following identities:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta_\Gamma (\tau)=1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty r_{\Gamma}(2n) q^{n} = E_4(\tau), \qquad r_{\Gamma}(n) = 240\sigma_3(n) &lt;/math&gt;

for the number {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;Γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}} of vectors of the squared length {{math|2''n''}} in the  [[E8 lattice|root lattice of the type {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}}]].

Similar techniques involving holomorphic Eisenstein series twisted by a [[Dirichlet character]] produce formulas for the number of representations of a positive integer {{mvar|n}}' as a sum of two, four, or eight squares in terms of the divisors of {{mvar|n}}.

Using the above recurrence relation, all higher {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be expressed as polynomials in {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_{8} &amp;=   E_4^2 \\
E_{10} &amp;=  E_4\cdot E_6 \\
691 \cdot E_{12} &amp;=  441\cdot E_4^3+    250\cdot E_6^2 \\
E_{14} &amp;= E_4^2\cdot E_6 \\
3617\cdot E_{16} &amp;=  1617\cdot E_4^4+   2000\cdot E_4  \cdot E_6^2 \\
43867 \cdot E_{18} &amp;= 38367\cdot E_4^3\cdot E_6+5500\cdot E_6^3 \\
174611 \cdot E_{20} &amp;= 53361\cdot E_4^5+ 121250\cdot E_4^2\cdot E_6^2 \\
77683 \cdot E_{22} &amp;= 57183\cdot E_4^4\cdot E_6+20500\cdot E_4\cdot E_6^3 \\
236364091 \cdot E_{24} &amp;= 49679091\cdot E_4^6+ 176400000\cdot E_4^3\cdot E_6^2 + 10285000\cdot E_6^4
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Many relationships between products of Eisenstein series can be written in an elegant way using [[Hankel matrix|Hankel determinants]], e.g. Garvan's identity

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta^2=-\frac{691}{1728^2\cdot250}\det \begin{vmatrix}E_4&amp;E_6&amp;E_8\\ E_6&amp;E_8&amp;E_{10}\\ E_8&amp;E_{10}&amp;E_{12}\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta=\frac{E_4^3-E_6^2}{1728}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[modular discriminant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Milne|first=Steven C.|year=2000|arxiv=math/0009130v3|title=Hankel Determinants of Eisenstein Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ramanujan identities ===
[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] gave several interesting identities between the first few Eisenstein series involving differentiation. Let

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L(q)&amp;=1-24\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {nq^n}{1-q^n}&amp;&amp;=E_2(\tau) \\
M(q)&amp;=1+240\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {n^3q^n}{1-q^n}&amp;&amp;=E_4(\tau) \\
N(q)&amp;=1-504\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {n^5q^n}{1-q^n}&amp;&amp;=E_6(\tau),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
q\frac{dL}{dq} &amp;= \frac {L^2-M}{12} \\
q\frac{dM}{dq} &amp;= \frac {LM-N}{3} \\
q\frac{dN}{dq} &amp;= \frac {LN-M^2}{2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These identities, like the identities between the series, yield arithmetical [[convolution]] identities involving the [[divisor function|sum-of-divisor function]]. Following Ramanujan, to put these identities in the simplest form it is necessary to extend the domain of {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}} to include zero, by setting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\sigma_p(0) = \tfrac12\zeta(-p) \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\sigma(0) &amp;= -\tfrac{1}{24}\\
\sigma_3(0) &amp;= \tfrac{1}{240}\\
\sigma_5(0) &amp;= -\tfrac{1}{504}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for example

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n\sigma(k)\sigma(n-k)=\tfrac5{12}\sigma_3(n)-\tfrac12n\sigma(n).&lt;/math&gt;

Other identities of this type, but not directly related to the preceding relations between {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} functions, have been proved by Ramanujan and [[Giuseppe Melfi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Srinivasa Ramanujan|last=Ramanujan|first=Srinivasa|chapter=On certain arithmetical functions|pages=136–162|title=Collected Papers|date=1962|publisher=Chelsea|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giuseppe Melfi|first=Giuseppe|last=Melfi|contribution=On some modular identities|title=Number Theory, Diophantine, Computational and Algebraic Aspects: Proceedings of the International Conference held in Eger, Hungary|publisher=Walter de Grutyer &amp; Co.|date=1998|pages=371–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; as for example

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{k=0}^n\sigma_3(k)\sigma_3(n-k)&amp;=\tfrac1{120}\sigma_7(n) \\
\sum_{k=0}^n\sigma(2k+1)\sigma_3(n-k)&amp;=\tfrac1{240}\sigma_5(2n+1) \\
\sum_{k=0}^n\sigma(3k+1)\sigma(3n-3k+1)&amp;=\tfrac19\sigma_3(3n+2).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==
[[Automorphic form]]s generalize the idea of modular forms for general [[Lie group]]s; and Eisenstein series generalize in a similar fashion.

Defining {{math|''O&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to be the [[ring of integers]] of a [[totally real algebraic number field]] {{mvar|K}}, one then defines the [[Hilbert–Blumenthal modular group]] as {{math|PSL(2,''O&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}. One can then associate an Eisenstein series to every [[cusp form|cusp]] of the Hilbert–Blumenthal modular group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">'''Environment statistics''' is the application of [[statistics|statistical methods]] to [[environmental science]]. It covers procedures for dealing with questions concerning both the natural environment in its undisturbed state and the interaction of humanity with the environment. Thus weather, climate, air and water quality are included, as are studies of plant and animal populations.

The [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf United Nations Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics (FDES)] defines the scope of environment statistics as follows:
The scope of environment statistics covers biophysical aspects of the environment and those aspects of the socio-economic system that directly influence and interact with the environment.
The scope of environment, social and economic statistics overlap. It is not easy – or necessary – to draw a clear line dividing these areas. Social and economic statistics that describe processes or activities with a direct impact on, or direct interaction with, the environment are used widely in environment statistics. They are within the scope of the FDES.

Sources of data for environmental statistics are varied and include: surveys related to human populations and the environment, records from agencies managing environmental resources, maps and images, equipment used to examine the environment, and research studies around the world.  A primary component of the data is direct observation, although most environmental statistics use a variety of sources.&lt;ref name="Manly"/&gt;

Environmental statistics covers a number of types of study:&lt;ref name="Manly"/&gt;
*Baseline studies to document the present state of an environment to provide background in case of unknown changes in the future;
*Targeted studies to describe the likely impact of changes being planned or of accidental occurrences; 
*Regular monitoring to attempt to detect changes in the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13985">In [[mathematical analysis]], a family of functions is '''equicontinuous''' if all the functions are [[continuous function|continuous]] and they have equal variation over a given [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]], in a precise sense described herein.  In particular, the concept applies to [[countable set|countable]] families, and thus ''sequences'' of functions.

Equicontinuity appears in the formulation of [[Ascoli's theorem]], which states that a subset of ''C''(''X''), the space of [[continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space]] ''X'', is compact if and only if it is closed, pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. As a corollary, a sequence in ''C''(''X'') is uniformly convergent if and only if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise to a function (not necessarily continuous a-priori). In particular, the limit of an equicontinuous pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' on either metric space or locally compact space&lt;ref&gt;More generally, on any [[compactly generated space]]; e.g., a [[first-countable space]].&lt;/ref&gt; is continuous. If, in addition, ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[holomorphic]], then the limit is also holomorphic.

The uniform boundedness principle states that a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear operators between Banach spaces is equicontinuous.

==Definition==
Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be two [[metric space]]s, and ''F'' a family of functions from ''X'' to ''Y''. We shall denote by ''d'' the respective metrics of these spaces.

The family&amp;nbsp;''F'' is '''equicontinuous at a point''' ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' if for every ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists a &amp;nbsp;δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that ''d''(''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x''))&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;ε for all&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'' and all ''x'' such that ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;δ.  The family is '''pointwise equicontinuous''' if it is equicontinuous at each point of ''X''.&lt;ref name=RS29&gt;{{harvtxt|Reed|Simon|1980}}, p. 29; {{harvtxt|Rudin|1987}}, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

The family&amp;nbsp;''F'' is '''uniformly equicontinuous''' if for every ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists a&amp;nbsp;δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that  ''d''(''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;ε for all ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'' and all ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' such that ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;δ.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Reed|Simon|1980}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

For comparison, the statement 'all functions ''ƒ'' in ''F'' are continuous' means that for every ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, every&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'', and every ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'', there exists a&amp;nbsp;δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that ''d''(''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x''))&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;ε for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' such that ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;δ.

* For ''[[Continuous function|continuity]]'', δ&amp;nbsp;may depend on&amp;nbsp;ε, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''.
* For ''[[uniform continuity]]'', δ&amp;nbsp;may depend on&amp;nbsp;ε, and&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''.
* For ''pointwise equicontinuity'', δ&amp;nbsp;may depend on&amp;nbsp;ε, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* For ''uniform equicontinuity'', δ&amp;nbsp;may solely depend on&amp;nbsp;ε.

More generally, when ''X'' is a topological space, a set ''F'' of functions from ''X'' to ''Y'' is said to be equicontinuous at ''x'' if for every ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0,  ''x'' has a neighborhood ''U&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that
: &lt;math&gt;d_Y(f(y), f(x)) &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
for all {{nowrap|''y'' ∈ ''U&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F''. This definition usually appears in the context of [[topological vector space]]s.

When ''X'' is compact, a set is uniformly equicontinuous if and only if it is equicontinuous at every point, for essentially the same reason as that uniform continuity and continuity coincide on compact spaces.  Used on its own, the term "equiconituity" may refer to either the pointwise or uniform notion, depending on the context.  On a compact space, these notions coincide.

Some basic properties follow immediately from the definition. Every finite set of continuous functions is equicontinuous.  The closure of an equicontinuous set is again equicontinuous.  Every member of a uniformly equicontinuous set of functions is [[uniformly continuous]], and every finite set of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly equicontinuous.

=== Examples ===
*A set of functions with a common [[Lipschitz constant]] is (uniformly) equicontinuous. In particular, this is the case if the set consists of functions with derivatives bounded by the same constant.
*[[Uniform boundedness principle]] gives a sufficient condition for a set of continuous linear operators to be equicontinuous.
*A family of iterates of an [[analytic function]]  is  equicontinuous on the  [[Fatou set]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan F. Beardon, S. Axler, F.W. Gehring, K.A. Ribet : Iteration of Rational Functions: Complex Analytic Dynamical Systems. Springer, 2000; {{ISBN|0-387-95151-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-387-95151-5}}; page 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph H. Silverman : The arithmetic of dynamical systems. Springer, 2007. {{ISBN|0-387-69903-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-387-69903-5}}; page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counter Examples ===
*The sequence of functions f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(x) = arctan(nx), is not equicontinuous because the definition is violated at x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=0

==Equicontinuity and uniform convergence==
Let ''X'' be a compact Hausdorff space, and equip ''C''(''X'') with the [[uniform norm]], thus making ''C''(''X'') a [[Banach space]], hence a metric space.  Then [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] states that a subset of ''C''(''X'') is compact if and only if it is closed, uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. This is analogous to the [[Heine–Borel theorem]], which states that subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are compact if and only if they are closed and bounded. As a corollary, every uniformly bounded equicontinuous sequence in ''C''(''X'') contains a subsequence that converges uniformly to a continuous function on ''X''.

In view of Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, a sequence in ''C''(''X'') converges uniformly if and only if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise. The hypothesis of the statement can be weakened a bit: a sequence in ''C''(''X'') converges uniformly if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise on a dense subset to some function on ''X''  (not assumed continuous).&lt;ref&gt;Proof: Suppose ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is an equicontinuous sequence of continuous functions on a dense subset ''D'' of ''X''. Let ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 be given. By equicontinuity, for each {{nowrap|''z'' ∈ ''D''}}, there exists a neighborhood ''U''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; of ''z'' such that
: &lt;math&gt;|f_j(x) - f_j(z)| &lt; \epsilon / 3 &lt;/math&gt;
for all ''j'' and {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''U&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. By denseness and compactness, we can find a finite subset {{nowrap|''D′'' ⊂ ''D''}} such that ''X'' is the union of ''U&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' over {{nowrap|''z'' ∈ ''D′''}}. Since ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; converges pointwise on {{nowrap|''D′''}}, there exists ''N'' &gt; 0 such that
: &lt;math&gt;|f_j(z) - f_k(z)| &lt; \epsilon / 3 &lt;/math&gt;
whenever {{nowrap|''z'' ∈ ''D′''}} and ''j'', ''k'' &gt; ''N''. It follows that
: &lt;math&gt;\sup_X |f_j - f_k| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''j'', ''k'' &gt; ''N''. In fact, if {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}, then {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''U&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for some {{nowrap|''z'' ∈ ''D′''}} and so we get:
: &lt;math&gt;|f_j(x) - f_k(x)| \le |f_j(x) - f_j(z)| + |f_j(z) - f_k(z)| + |f_k(z) - f_k(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is Cauchy in ''C''(''X'') and thus converges by completeness.&lt;/ref&gt; This weaker version is typically used to prove Arzelà–Ascoli theorem for separable compact spaces. Another consequence is that the limit of an equicontinuous pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions on a metric space, or on a locally compact space, is continuous. (See below for an example.) In the above, the hypothesis of compactness of ''X''&amp;thinsp; cannot be relaxed. To see that, consider a compactly supported continuous function ''g'' on '''R''' with ''g''(0)&amp;nbsp;= 1, and consider the equicontinuous sequence of functions {{mset|''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on '''R''' defined by ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|''g''(''x'' − ''n'')}}.  Then, ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges pointwise to 0 but does not converge uniformly to 0.

This criterion for uniform convergence is often useful in real and complex analysis. Suppose we are given a sequence of continuous functions that converges pointwise on some open subset ''G'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. As noted above, it actually converges uniformly on a compact subset of ''G'' if it is equicontinuous on the compact set. In practice, showing the equicontinuity is often not so difficult. For example, if the sequence consists of differentiable functions or functions with some regularity (e.g., the functions are solutions of a differential equation), then the [[mean value theorem]] or some other kinds of estimates can be used to show the sequence is equicontinuous. It then follows that the limit of the sequence is continuous on every compact subset of ''G''; thus, continuous on ''G''. A similar argument can be made when the functions are holomorphic. One can use, for instance, [[Cauchy's estimate]] to show the equicontinuity (on a compact subset) and conclude that the limit is holomorphic. Note that the equicontinuity is essential here. For example, ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|arctan ''n''&amp;thinsp;''x''}} converges to a multiple of the discontinuous [[sign function]].

== Generalizations ==

=== Equicontinuity of families of linear operators ===
Let ''E'', ''F'' be Banach spaces, and Γ be a family of continuous linear operators from ''E'' into ''F''. Then Γ is equicontinuous if and only if
: &lt;math&gt;\sup \{ \|T\| : T \in \Gamma \} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
that is, Γ is uniformly bounded in operator norm. Also, by linearity, Γ is uniformly equicontinuous if and only if it is equicontinuous at 0.

The [[uniform boundedness principle]] (also known as the Banach–Steinhaus theorem) states that Γ is equicontinuous if it is pointwise bounded; i.e., {{nowrap|sup&amp;thinsp;{{mset|{{norm|''T''(''x'')}}:&amp;thinsp;''T'' ∈ Γ}} &lt; ∞}} for each {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''E''}}. The result can be generalized to a case when F is locally convex and E is a [[barreled space]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Theorem 4.2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alaoglu's theorem]] states that if ''E'' is a topological vector space, then every equicontinuous subset of ''E*'' is weak-* relatively compact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Corollary 4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equicontinuity in topological spaces ===

The most general scenario in which equicontinuity can be defined is for [[topological space]]s whereas ''uniform'' equicontinuity requires the [[Filter (mathematics)|filter]] of neighbourhoods of one point to be somehow comparable with the filter of neighbourhood of another point.  The latter is most generally done via a [[uniform structure]], giving a [[uniform space]].  Appropriate definitions in these cases are as follows:

:A set ''A'' of functions continuous between two topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is '''topologically equicontinuous at the points''' ''x'' ∈ ''X'' and ''y'' ∈ ''Y'' if for any open set ''O'' about ''y'', there are neighborhoods ''U'' of ''x'' and ''V'' of ''y'' such that for every ''f'' ∈ ''A'', if the intersection of ''f''[''U''] and ''V'' is nonempty,  ''f''[''U''] ⊆ ''O''. Then ''A'' is said to be '''topologically equicontinuous at''' ''x'' ∈ ''X'' if it is topologically equicontinuous at ''x'' and ''y'' for each ''y'' ∈ ''Y''. Finally, ''A'' is '''equicontinuous''' if it is equicontinuous at ''x'' for all points ''x'' ∈ ''X''.

:A set ''A'' of continuous functions between two uniform spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is '''uniformly equicontinuous''' if for every element ''W'' of the uniformity on ''Y'',  the set
::{{mset| (''u,v'') ∈ ''X × X'': for all ''f'' ∈ ''A''. (''f''(''u''),''f''(''v'')) ∈ ''W'' }}
:is a  member of the uniformity on ''X''

A weaker concept is that of even continuity:

:A set ''A'' of continuous functions between two topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is said to be '''evenly continuous at''' ''x'' ∈ ''X'' and ''y'' ∈ ''Y'' if given any open set ''O'' containing ''y'' there are neighborhoods ''U'' of ''x'' and ''V'' of ''y'' such that ''f''[''U''] ⊆ ''O'' whenever ''f''(''x'') ∈ ''V''. It is '''evenly continuous at''' ''x'' if it is evenly continuous at ''x'' and ''y'' for every ''y'' ∈ ''Y'', and '''evenly continuous''' if it is evenly continuous at ''x'' for every ''x'' ∈ ''X''.

For metric spaces, there are standard topologies and uniform structures derived from the metrics, and then these general definitions are equivalent to the metric-space definitions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Stochastic equicontinuity ===
{{Main|Stochastic equicontinuity}}
Stochastic equicontinuity is a version of equicontinuity used in the context of sequences of functions of [[random variables]], and their [[convergence of random variables|convergence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7203">[[File:Zigzag poset.svg|thumb|The [[Hasse diagram]] of a six-element fence.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''fence''', also called a '''zigzag poset''', is a [[partially ordered set]] in which the order relations form a [[path graph|path]] with alternating orientations:
:''a'' &amp;lt; ''b'' &amp;gt; ''c'' &amp;lt; ''d'' &amp;gt; ''e'' &amp;lt; ''f'' &amp;gt; ''h'' &amp;lt; ''i'' ...
or
:''a'' &amp;gt; ''b'' &amp;lt; ''c'' &amp;gt; ''d'' &amp;lt; ''e'' &amp;gt; ''f'' &amp;lt; ''h'' &amp;gt; ''i'' ...
A fence may be [[Finite set|finite]], or it may be formed by an infinite alternating sequence extending in both directions. The [[incidence poset]]s of [[path graph]]s form examples of fences.

A [[linear extension]] of a fence is called an [[alternating permutation]]; [[André's problem]] of counting the number of different linear extensions has been studied since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|André|1881}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The solutions to this counting problem, the so-called Euler zigzag numbers or up/down numbers, are
:1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 32, 122, 544, 2770, 15872, 101042 {{OEIS|A001250}}.

The number of [[antichain]]s in a fence is a [[Fibonacci number]]; the [[distributive lattice]] with this many elements, generated from a fence via [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]], has as its graph the [[Fibonacci cube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gansner|1982}} calls the fact that this lattice has a Fibonacci number of elements a “well known fact,” while {{harvtxt|Stanley|1986}} asks for a description of it in an exercise. See also {{harvtxt|Höft|Höft|1985}}, {{harvtxt|Beck|1990}}, and {{harvtxt|Salvi|Salvi|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A partially ordered set is [[series-parallel partial order|series-parallel]] if and only if it does not have four elements forming a fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Valdes|Tarjan|Lawler|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have also investigated the number of order-preserving maps from fences to themselves, or to fences of other sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Currie|Visentin|1991}}; {{harvtxt|Duffus|Rödl|Sands|Woodrow|1992}}; {{harvtxt|Rutkowski|1992a}}; {{harvtxt|Rutkowski|1992b}}; {{harvtxt|Farley|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''up-down poset''' ''Q''(''a'',''b'') is a generalization of a zigzag poset in which there are ''a'' downward orientations for every upward one and ''b'' total elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gansner|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ''Q''(2,9) has the elements and relations
:''a'' &amp;gt; ''b'' &amp;gt; ''c'' &amp;lt; ''d'' &amp;gt; ''e'' &amp;gt; ''f'' &amp;lt; ''g'' &amp;gt; ''h'' &amp;gt; ''i''.
In this notation, a fence is a partially ordered set of the form ''Q''(1,''n'').

==Equivalent conditions==
The following conditions are equivalent for a poset ''P'':{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}
#''P'' is a disjoint union of zigzag posets.
#If ''a'' ≤ ''b'' ≤ ''c'' in ''P'', either ''a'' = ''b'' or ''b'' = ''c''.
#&lt; &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; &lt; = &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. it is never the case that ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and ''b'' &lt; ''c'', so that &lt; is vacuously transitive.
#''P'' has dimension at most one (defined analogously to the [[Krull dimension]] of a [[commutative ring]]).
#Every element of ''P'' is either [[maximal element|maximal]] or [[minimal element|minimal]].
#The slice category '''Pos'''/''P'' is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].

The [[prime ideal]]s of a commutative ring ''R'', ordered by inclusion, satisfy the equivalent conditions above if and only if ''R'' has Krull dimension at most one.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

:''In [[mathematical physics]], ''Hilbert system'' is an infrequently used term for a physical system described by a [[C*-algebra]].''

In [[logic]], especially [[mathematical logic]], a '''Hilbert system''', sometimes called '''Hilbert calculus''', '''Hilbert-style deductive system''' or '''Hilbert&amp;ndash;Ackermann system''', is a type of system of [[Deductive reasoning|formal deduction]] attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]]&lt;ref name="Máté &amp; Ruzsa 1997"&gt;Máté &amp; Ruzsa 1997:129&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Hilbert]]. These [[deductive system]]s are most often studied for [[first-order logic]], but are of interest for other logics as well.

Most variants of Hilbert systems take a characteristic tack in the way they balance a [[trade-off]] between [[logical axiom]]s and [[Rule of inference|rules of inference]].&lt;ref name="Máté &amp; Ruzsa 1997"/&gt; Hilbert systems can be characterised by the choice of a large number of [[axiom schema|schemes]] of logical axioms and a small set of [[Rule of inference|rules of inference]]. Systems of [[natural deduction]] take the opposite tack, including many deduction rules but very few or no axiom schemes. The most commonly studied Hilbert systems have either just one rule of inference{{snd}} [[modus ponens]], for [[propositional logic]]s{{snd}} or two{{snd}} with [[Universal generalization|generalisation]], to handle [[predicate logic]]s, as well{{snd}} and several infinite axiom schemes.   Hilbert systems for propositional [[modal logic]]s, sometimes called [[Hilbert-Lewis system]]s, are generally axiomatised with two additional rules, the [[necessitation rule]] and the [[uniform substitution]] rule.

A characteristic feature of the many variants of Hilbert systems is that the ''context'' is not changed in any of their rules of inference, while both [[natural deduction]] and [[sequent calculus]] contain some context-changing rules. Thus, if we are interested only in the derivability of [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], no hypothetical judgments, then we can formalize the Hilbert system in such a way that its rules of inference contain only [[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgment]]s of a rather simple form. The same cannot be done with the other two deductions systems:{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} as context is changed in some of their rules of inferences, they cannot be formalized so that hypothetical judgments could be avoided{{snd}} not even if we want to use them just for proving derivability of tautologies.

== Formal deductions ==
[[File:Deduction architecture.png|right|300px|A graphic representation of the deduction system]]

In a Hilbert-style deduction system, a '''formal deduction''' is a finite sequence of formulas in which each formula is either an axiom or is obtained from previous formulas by a rule of inference. These formal deductions are meant to mirror natural-language proofs, although they are far more detailed.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a set of formulas, considered as '''hypotheses'''. For example, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; could be a set of axioms for [[group theory]] or [[set theory]]. The notation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt; means that there is a deduction that ends with &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; using as axioms only '''logical axioms''' and elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, informally, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable assuming all the formulas in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

Hilbert-style deduction systems are characterized by the use of numerous schemes of '''logical axioms'''. An [[axiom scheme]] is an infinite set of axioms obtained by substituting all formulas of some form into a specific pattern. The set of logical axioms includes not only those axioms generated from this pattern, but also any generalization of one of those axioms.  A generalization of a formula is obtained by prefixing zero or more universal quantifiers on the formula; thus

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y ( \forall x Pxy \to Pty)&lt;/math&gt;

is a generalization of &lt;math&gt;\forall x Pxy \to Pty&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Logical axioms ===
There are several variant axiomatisations of predicate logic, since for any logic there is freedom in choosing axioms and rules that characterise that logic.  We describe here a Hilbert system with nine axioms and just the rule modus ponens, which we call the one-rule axiomatisation and which describes classical equational logic.  We deal with a minimal language for this logic, where formulas use only the connectives &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and only the quantifier &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;. Later we show how the system can be extended to include additional logical connectives, such as &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;, without enlarging the class of deducible formulas.

The first four logical axiom schemes allow (together with modus ponens) for the manipulation of logical connectives.

:P1. &lt;math&gt;\phi \to \phi  &lt;/math&gt;
:P2. &lt;math&gt;\phi \to \left( \psi \to \phi \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:P3. &lt;math&gt;\left( \phi \to \left( \psi \rightarrow \xi \right) \right) \to \left( \left( \phi \to \psi \right) \to  \left( \phi \to \xi \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:P4. &lt;math&gt;\left ( \lnot \phi \to \lnot \psi \right) \to \left( \psi \to \phi \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The axiom P1 is redundant, as it follows from P3, P2 and modus ponens.  These axioms describe [[classical propositional logic]]; without axiom P4 we get [[List of logic systems#Implicational propositional calculus|positive implicational logic]]. [[Minimal logic]] is achieved either by adding instead the axiom P4m, or by defining &lt;math&gt;\lnot \phi&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;.

:P4m. &lt;math&gt;\left( \phi \to \psi \right) \to \left(\left(\phi \to \lnot \psi \right) \to \lnot \phi \right)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Intuitionistic logic]] is achieved by adding axioms P4i and P5i to positive implicational logic, or by adding axiom P5i to minimal logic. Both P4i and P5i are theorems of classical propositional logic.

:P4i. &lt;math&gt;\left(\phi \to \lnot \phi\right) \to \lnot \phi &lt;/math&gt;
:P5i. &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi \to \left( \phi \to \psi \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Note that these are axiom schemes, which represent infinitely many specific instances of axioms.  For example, P1 might represent the particular axiom instance &lt;math&gt;p \to p  &lt;/math&gt;, or it might represent &lt;math&gt;\left( p \to q \right) \to \left( p \to q \right) &lt;/math&gt;: the &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a place where any formula can be placed.  A variable such as this that ranges over formulae is called a 'schematic variable'.

With a second rule of [[uniform substitution]] (US), we can change each of these axiom schemes into a single axiom, replacing each schematic variable by some propositional variable that isn't mentioned in any axiom to get what we call the substitutional axiomatisation.  Both formalisations have variables, but where the one-rule axiomatisation has schematic variables that are outside the logic's language, the substitutional axiomatisation uses propositional variables that do the same work by expressing the idea of a variable ranging over formulae with a rule that uses substitution.

:US. Let &lt;math&gt;\phi(p)&lt;/math&gt; be a formula with one or more instances of the propositional variable &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be another formula.  Then from &lt;math&gt;\phi(p)&lt;/math&gt;, infer &lt;math&gt;\phi(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;.

The next three logical axiom schemes provide ways to add, manipulate, and remove universal quantifiers.

:Q5. &lt;math&gt; \forall x \left( \phi \right) \to \phi[x:=t]&lt;/math&gt; where ''t'' may be substituted for ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;\,\!\phi&lt;/math&gt;
:Q6. &lt;math&gt;\forall x \left( \phi \to \psi \right) \to \left( \forall x \left( \phi \right) \to \forall x \left( \psi \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:Q7. &lt;math&gt; \phi \to \forall x \left( \phi \right) &lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is not a [[free variable]] of &lt;math&gt;\,\!\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

These three additional rules extend the propositional system to axiomatise [[classical predicate logic]].  Likewise, these three rules extend system for intuitionstic propositional logic (with P1-3 and P4i and P5i)  to [[intuitionistic predicate logic]].

Universal quantification is often given an alternative axiomatisation using an extra rule of generalisation (see the section on Metatheorems), in which case the rules Q6 and Q7 are redundant.

The final axiom schemes are required to work with formulas involving the equality symbol.

:I8. &lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt; for every variable ''x''.
:I9. &lt;math&gt;\left( x = y \right) \to \left( \phi[z:=x] \to \phi[z:=y] \right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Conservative extensions ==
It is common to include in a Hilbert-style deduction system only axioms for implication and negation. Given these axioms, it is possible to form [[conservative extension]]s of the [[deduction theorem]] that permit the use of additional connectives. These extensions are called conservative because if a formula φ involving new connectives is rewritten as a [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] formula θ involving only negation, implication, and universal quantification, then φ is derivable in the extended system if and only if θ is derivable in the original system. When fully extended, a Hilbert-style system will resemble more closely a system of [[natural deduction]].

=== Existential quantification ===
* Introduction
:&lt;math&gt; \forall x(\phi \to \exists y(\phi[x:=y])) &lt;/math&gt;

* Elimination
:&lt;math&gt; \forall x(\phi \to \psi) \to \exists x(\phi) \to \psi &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[free variable]] of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Conjunction and disjunction ===
* Conjunction introduction and elimination
:introduction: &lt;math&gt; \alpha\to\beta\to\alpha\land\beta &lt;/math&gt;
:elimination left: &lt;math&gt; \alpha\wedge\beta\to\alpha &lt;/math&gt;
:elimination right: &lt;math&gt; \alpha\wedge\beta\to\beta &lt;/math&gt;
* Disjunction introduction and elimination
:introduction left: &lt;math&gt; \alpha\to\alpha\vee\beta &lt;/math&gt;
:introduction right: &lt;math&gt; \beta\to\alpha\vee\beta &lt;/math&gt;
:elimination: &lt;math&gt; (\alpha\to\gamma)\to (\beta\to\gamma) \to \alpha\vee\beta \to \gamma &lt;/math&gt;

== Metatheorems ==
Because Hilbert-style systems have very few deduction rules, it is common to prove '''metatheorems''' that show that additional deduction rules add no deductive power, in the sense that a deduction using the new deduction rules can be converted into a deduction using only the original deduction rules.

Some common metatheorems of this form are:

* The '''[[deduction theorem]]''': &lt;math&gt;\Gamma;\phi \vdash \psi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \phi \to \psi&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \phi \leftrightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \phi \to \psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \psi \to \phi&lt;/math&gt;.
* Contraposition: If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma;\phi \vdash \psi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma;\lnot \psi \vdash \lnot \phi&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Universal generalization|Generalization]]: If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt; and ''x'' does not occur free in any formula of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \forall x \phi&lt;/math&gt;.

== Alternative axiomatizations ==
{{Further|List of logic systems}}

The axiom 3 above&lt;!--which? P3? --&gt; is credited to [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]].&lt;ref name="Tarski"&gt;A. Tarski, Logic, semantics, metamathematics, Oxford, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The original system by [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] had axioms P2 and P3 but four other axioms instead of axiom P4 (see [[Frege's propositional calculus]]).
[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] also suggested a system with five propositional axioms.

== Further connections ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Associativity]] --&gt;
Axioms P1, P2 and P3, with the deduction rule modus ponens (formalising [[intuitionistic propositional logic]]), correspond to [[combinatory logic]] base combinators '''I''', '''K''' and '''S''' with the application operator. Proofs in the Hilbert system then correspond to combinator terms in combinatory logic.  See also [[Curry–Howard correspondence]].

The '''[[integral]] of the [[Trigonometric functions#Reciprocal functions|secant function]]''' of [[trigonometry]] was the subject of one of the "outstanding open problems of the mid-seventeenth century", solved in 1668 by [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]].&lt;ref name="rickey-tuchinsky"&gt;V. Frederick Rickey and Philip M. Tuchinsky, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2690106 An Application of Geography to Mathematics: History of the Integral of the Secant] in  [[Mathematics Magazine]], volume 53, number 3, May 1980, pages 162–166.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1599, [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] evaluated the integral by [[numerical method]]s – what today we would call [[Riemann sum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]], ''Certaine Errors in Navigation, Arising either of the ordinaire erroneous making or vsing of the sea Chart, Compasse, Crosse staffe, and Tables of declination of the Sunne, and fixed Starres detected and corrected'', Valentine Simms, London, 1599.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wanted the solution for the purposes of [[cartography]] – specifically for constructing an accurate [[Mercator projection]].&lt;ref name="rickey-tuchinsky"/&gt;  In the 1640s, Henry Bond, a teacher of navigation, surveying, and other mathematical topics, compared Wright's numerically computed table of values of the integral of the secant with a table of logarithms of the tangent function, and consequently conjectured&lt;ref name="rickey-tuchinsky"/&gt; that

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^\theta \sec\zeta\,d\zeta = \ln\left|\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right|. &lt;/math&gt;

That conjecture became widely known, and in 1665, [[Isaac Newton]] was aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Turnbull, editor, ''The Correspondence of Isaac Newton'', Cambridge University Press, 1959–1960, volume 1, pages 13–16 and volume 2, pages 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[D. T. Whiteside]], editor, ''The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton'', Cambridge University Press, 1967, volume 1, pages 466–467 and 473–475.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Gregory proved the conjecture in 1668 in his ''Exercitationes Geometricae'', the proof was presented in a form that renders it nearly impossible for modern readers to comprehend; [[Isaac Barrow]], in his ''Geometrical Lectures'' of 1670,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dresden, Arnold|authorlink=Arnold Dresden|title=Review: ''The Geometrical Lectures of Isaac Barrow'', translated, with notes and proofs, by James Mark Child|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1918|volume=24|issue=9|pages=454–456|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1918-24-09/S0002-9904-1918-03122-4/S0002-9904-1918-03122-4.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1918-03122-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the first "intelligible" proof, though even that was "couched in the geometric idiom of the day."&lt;ref name="rickey-tuchinsky"/&gt; Barrow's proof of the result was the earliest use of [[partial fraction]]s in integration.&lt;ref name="rickey-tuchinsky"/&gt;  Adapted to modern notation, Barrow's proof began as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \int \sec \theta \, d\theta = \int \frac{d\theta}{\cos\theta} = \int \frac{\cos\theta \, d\theta}{\cos^2\theta} = \int \frac{\cos\theta \, d\theta}{1 - \sin^2\theta} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt; reduces the integral to
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \frac{du}{1 - u^2} &amp; = \int\frac{du}{(1-u)(1+u)} = \dfrac12\int \left(\frac{1}{1+u} + \frac{1}{1-u}\right)\,du \\[10pt]
&amp; = \frac12 \left( \ln\left|1 + u\right|-\ln \left|1-u\right| \right) + C = \frac12 \ln\left|\frac{1+u}{1-u}\right| + C
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
: &lt;math&gt;
\int \sec \theta \, d\theta = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
\dfrac12 \ln \left|\dfrac{1+\sin\theta}{1-\sin\theta}\right| + C \\[15pt]
\ln\left|\sec\theta + \tan\theta\right| + C \\[15pt]
\ln\left| \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}\right) \right| + C
\end{array}\right\}\text{ (equivalent forms)}
&lt;/math&gt;
The second of these follows by first multiplying top and bottom of the interior fraction by &lt;math&gt;(1+\sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. This gives &lt;math&gt;\cos^2\theta&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator and the result follows by moving the factor of 1/2 into the logarithm as a square root.

The third form follows by replacing &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;-\cos(\theta+\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt; and expanding using the [[Trigonometric functions#Identities|identities]] for &lt;math&gt;\cos2x&lt;/math&gt;. It may also be obtained directly by means of the following substitutions:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sec\theta=\frac{1}{\sin\left(\theta + \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}
=\frac{1}{2\sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)
\cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}
=\frac{\sec^2\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}
{2\tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The conventional solution for the [[Mercator projection]] ordinate may be written without the modulus signs since the latitude (''&amp;phi;'') lies between &amp;minus;{{pi}}/2 and {{pi}}/2:
:&lt;math&gt;
y= \ln \tan\!\left(\frac \varphi 2 + \frac \pi 4 \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

The integral can also be derived by using the [[tangent half-angle substitution]]. A somewhat non-standard version of the tangent half-angle substitution, which is simpler in the case of this particular integral, published in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hardy, "Efficiency in Antidifferentiation of the Secant Function", ''American Mathematical Monthly'', June–July 2013, page 580.&lt;/ref&gt; is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; x = \tan \left( \frac \pi 4 + \frac \theta 2 \right) \\[10pt]
&amp; \frac{2x}{1+x^2} = 2\sin \left( \frac \pi 4 + \frac \theta 2 \right) \cos \left( \frac \pi 4 + \frac \theta 2 \right)=\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta \right)=\cos\theta \\[10pt]
&amp; dx=\frac{1}{2} \sec^2 \left(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{\theta}{2}\right)d\theta=\frac{1}{2} (1+x^2) d\theta\\[10pt]
&amp; \frac{2\,dx}{1+x^2} = d\theta \\[10pt]
\int \sec\theta \, d\theta &amp; = \int \frac{dx} x = \ln\left| \tan\left( \frac \pi 4 + \frac \theta 2 \right) \right| + C.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Hyperbolic forms==
Let
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \psi          &amp;=\ln(\sec\theta+\tan\theta),\\
  {\rm e}^\psi  &amp;=\sec\theta+\tan\theta,\\
\sinh\psi       &amp;=\frac12({\rm e}^\psi-{\rm e}^{-\psi})=\tan\theta,\\
\cosh\psi       &amp;=\sqrt{1+\sinh^2\psi}=\sec\theta,\\
\tanh\psi       &amp;=\sin\theta.
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \int \sec \theta \, d\theta&amp; 
    =\psi
    =\tanh^{-1}\! \left(\sin\theta\right)
    =\sinh^{-1}\! \left(\tan\theta\right)   
    =\cosh^{-1}\! \left(\sec\theta\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Gudermannian and lambertian==
The integral of the secant function defines the inverse of the [[Gudermannian function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \sec \theta \, d\theta&amp;  = \operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\theta)=\operatorname{lam}(\theta).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The lambertian function (lam) is a notation for the inverse of the gudermannian which is encountered in the theory of map projections. In particular the Mercator projection may be written&lt;ref name=lee_exact&gt;Lee, L.P. (1976). ''Conformal Projections Based on Elliptic Functions''. Supplement No. 1 to Canadian Cartographer, Vol 13. (Designated as Monograph 16)&lt;/ref&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
y= \operatorname{lam}(\varphi).
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[applied mathematics]], '''K-SVD''' is a [[dictionary learning]] algorithm for creating a dictionary for [[sparse representation]]s, via a [[singular value decomposition]] approach. K-SVD is a generalization of the [[k-means clustering]] method, and it works by iteratively alternating between sparse coding the input data based on the current dictionary, and updating the atoms in the dictionary to better fit the data.&lt;ref name="aharon2006"&gt;{{Citation

== Problem description ==
{{Main|Sparse approximation}}
{{close paraphrasing|section|http://intranet.daiict.ac.in/~ajit_r/IT530/KSVD_IEEETSP.pdf|date=May 2014}}
The goal of dictionary learning is to learn an overcomplete dictionary matrix &lt;math&gt;D \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times K}&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; signal-atoms (in this notation, columns of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;). A signal vector &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; can be represented, [[sparse vector|sparsely]], as a linear combination of these atoms; to represent &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, the representation vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; should satisfy the exact condition &lt;math&gt;y = Dx&lt;/math&gt;, or the approximate condition &lt;math&gt;y \approx Dx&lt;/math&gt;, made precise by requiring that &lt;math&gt;\|y - Dx\|_p \le  \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for some small value {{mvar|ε}} and some [[Lp norm|{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} norm]]. The vector &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^{K}&lt;/math&gt; contains the representation coefficients of the signal &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, the norm &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is selected as [[L1 norm|{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], [[L2 norm|{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], or [[Uniform norm|{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}]].

If &lt;math&gt;n &lt; K&lt;/math&gt; and D is a full-rank matrix, an infinite number of solutions are available for the representation problem. Hence, constraints should be set on the solution. Also, to ensure sparsity, the solution with the fewest number of nonzero coefficients is preferred. Thus, the sparsity representation is the solution of either

:&lt;math&gt;
 (P_0)  \quad  \min \limits _x \|x\|_0  \qquad \text{subject to } y = Dx
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
 (P_{0, \epsilon})  \quad  \min \limits _x \|x\|_0 \qquad  \text{subject to } \|y - Dx\|_2 \le \epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_0&lt;/math&gt; counts the nonzero entries in the vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  (See [[Lp space#When p .3D 0|the zero "norm"]].)

== K-SVD algorithm ==
K-SVD is a kind of generalization of K-means, as follows.
The [[k-means clustering]]  can be also regarded as a method of [[sparse representation]]. That is, finding the best possible codebook  to represent the data samples &lt;math&gt;\{y_i\}^M_{i=1}&lt;/math&gt;  by [[Nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]], by solving
:&lt;math&gt;
 \quad  \min \limits _{D, X}  \{ \|Y - DX\|^2_F\} \qquad \text{subject to } \forall i, x_i = e_k \text{ for some } k.
&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;
 \quad  \min \limits _{D, X} \{ \|Y - DX\|^2_F\} \qquad \text{subject to }\quad \forall i ,  \|x_i\|_0 = 1
&lt;/math&gt;. 

The letter F denotes the [[Frobenius norm]]. The sparse representation term &lt;math&gt;x_i = e_k&lt;/math&gt; enforces K-means algorithm to use only one atom (column) in dictionary &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. To relax this constraint, the target of the K-SVD algorithm is to represent signal as a linear combination of atoms in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

The K-SVD algorithm follows the construction flow of the K-means algorithm. However, in contrary to K-means,  in order to achieve a linear combination of atoms in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, the sparsity term of the constraint is relaxed so that the number of nonzero entries of each column &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; can be more than 1, but less than a number &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.

So, the objective function becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
 \quad  \min \limits _{D, X} \{ \|Y - DX\|^2_F \} \qquad \text{subject to } \quad \forall i \;,  \|x_i\|_0 \le T_0.
&lt;/math&gt;

or in another objective form
:&lt;math&gt;
 \quad  \min \limits _{D, X}  \sum_{i} \|x_i\|_0  \qquad \text{subject to } \quad \forall i \;,  \|Y - DX\|^2_F \le \epsilon.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the K-SVD algorithm, the &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is first fixed and the best coefficient matrix &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is found. As finding the truly optimal &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is impossible, we use an approximation pursuit method. Any algorithm such as OMP, the orthogonal [[matching pursuit]] can be used for the calculation of the coefficients, as long as it can supply a solution with a fixed and predetermined number of nonzero entries &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.

After the sparse coding task, the next is to search for a better dictionary &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. However, finding the whole dictionary all at a time is impossible, so the process is to update only one column of the dictionary &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; each time, while fixing &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The update of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th column is done by rewriting the penalty term as 
:&lt;math&gt;
\|Y - DX\|^2_F =  \left\| Y - \sum_{j = 1}^K d_j x^j_T\right\|^2_F = \left\| \left(Y - \sum_{j \ne k} d_j x^j_T \right)  -  d_k x^k_T \right\|^2_F = \| E_k - d_k x^k_T\|^2_F
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x^k_T&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''k''-th row of ''X''.

By decomposing the multiplication &lt;math&gt;DX&lt;/math&gt; into sum of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; rank 1 matrices, we can assume the other &lt;math&gt;K-1&lt;/math&gt; terms are assumed fixed, and the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th remains unknown.  After this step, we can solve the minimization problem by approximate the &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; term with a  &lt;math&gt;rank -1&lt;/math&gt; matrix using [[singular value decomposition]], then update &lt;math&gt;d_k&lt;/math&gt; with it. However, the new solution of vector &lt;math&gt;x^k_T&lt;/math&gt; is very likely to be filled, because the sparsity constraint is not enforced.

To cure this problem, Define &lt;math&gt; \omega_k &lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
\omega_k = \{i \mid 1 \le i \le N , x^k_T(i) \ne 0\}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

which points to examples &lt;math&gt;\{ y_i \}_{i=1}^N &lt;/math&gt; that use atom &lt;math&gt;d_k&lt;/math&gt; (also the entries of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; that is nonzero). Then, define &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; as a matrix  of size &lt;math&gt;N\times|\omega_k|&lt;/math&gt;, with ones on the &lt;math&gt;(i,\omega_k(i))\text{-th}, &lt;/math&gt; entries and zeros otherwise. When multiplying &lt;math&gt;x_R^k = x^k_T\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt;, this shrinks the row vector &lt;math&gt;x_T^k&lt;/math&gt; by discarding the zero entries. Similarly, the multiplication &lt;math&gt;Y^R_k = Y\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of the examples that are current using the &lt;math&gt;d_k&lt;/math&gt; atom. The same effect can be seen on &lt;math&gt;E^R_k = E_k\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt;.

So the minimization problem as mentioned before becomes 
:&lt;math&gt;
 \| E_k\Omega_k - d_k x^k_T\Omega_k\|^2_F =  \| E^R_k - d_k x^k_R\|^2_F
&lt;/math&gt;
 
and can be done by directly using SVD. SVD decomposes &lt;math&gt;E^R_k&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; U\Delta V^T&lt;/math&gt;. The solution for &lt;math&gt;d_k&lt;/math&gt; is the first column of U, the coefficient  vector &lt;math&gt;x^k_R&lt;/math&gt; as the first column of &lt;math&gt;V \times \Delta (1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. After updating the whole dictionary, the process then turns to iteratively solve X, then iteratively solve D.

==Limitations==
Choosing an appropriate "dictionary" for a dataset is a non-convex problem, and K-SVD operates by an iterative update which does not guarantee to find the global optimum.&lt;ref name="rubinstein2010"/&gt; However, this is common to other algorithms for this purpose, and K-SVD works fairly well in practice.&lt;ref name="rubinstein2010"/&gt;{{better source|date=May 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36755">Many '''works of art''' are claimed to have been designed using '''the golden ratio'''.
However, many of these claims are disputed, or refuted by measurement.&lt;ref name=Markowsky1992/&gt;

The [[golden ratio]], an [[irrational number]], is approximately 1.618; it is often denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] φ ([[Phi (letter)|phi]]).

==Early history==
Various authors have claimed that early monuments have [[golden ratio]] proportions, often on conjectural interpretations, using approximate measurements, and only roughly corresponding to 1.618.&lt;ref name=Markowsky1992/&gt; For example, claims have been made about golden ratio proportions in Egyptian, Sumerian and Greek vases, Chinese pottery, Olmec sculptures, and Cretan and Mycenaean products from the late Bronze Age. These predate by some 1,000 years the Greek mathematicians first known to have studied the golden ratio.&lt;ref name="klaus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="curso"/&gt; However, the historical sources are obscure, and the analyses are difficult to compare because they employ differing methods.&lt;ref name="klaus"/&gt;

It is claimed, for instance, that [[Stonehenge]] (3100 BC – 2200 BC) has golden ratio proportions between its concentric circles.&lt;ref name="klaus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trivede, Prash. ''The 27 Celestial Portals: The Real Secret Behind the 12 Star-Signs''. Lotus Press. Page 397&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Elam proposes this relation as early evidence of human cognitive preference for the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly Elam. ''Geometry of Design: Studies in Proportion and Composition By Kimberly Elam''. Princeton Architectural Press. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others point out that this interpretation of Stonehenge "may be doubtful" and that the geometric construction that generates it can only be surmised.&lt;ref name="klaus"&gt;{{cite book | title=Symmetries of Nature: A Handbook for Philosophy of Nature and Science | author=Mainzer, Klaus | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | year=1996 | isbn=3-11-012990-6 | pages=118 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqzaQo6CaA0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=stonehenge+golden-section&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=MY_cR9H5HKiwtAP_26WJDg&amp;sig=zTEHmqsZD1uUuqvofxzlSYrIKNY }}&lt;/ref&gt; As another example, [[Carlos Chanfon Olmos|Carlos Chanfón Olmos]] states that the Sculpture of King [[Gudea]] (c. 2350 BC) has golden proportions between all of its secondary elements repeated many times at its base.&lt;ref name=curso/&gt;

The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (constructed c. 2570 BC by [[Hemiunu]]) exhibits the golden ratio according to various [[pyramidology|pyramidologists]], including Charles Funck-Hellet.&lt;ref name=curso/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindwell"&gt;Lidwell, William; Holden, Kritina; and Butler, Jill. ''Universal Principles of Design''. Rockport Publishers. October 1, 2003. Page 96&lt;/ref&gt; John F. Pile, interior design professor and historian, has claimed that Egyptian designers sought the golden proportions without mathematical techniques and that it is common to see the 1.618:1 ratio, along with many other simpler geometrical concepts, in their architectural details, art, and everyday objects found in tombs. In his opinion, "That the Egyptians knew of it and used it seems certain."{{sfn | Pile | 2005 | p=29}}

From before the beginning of these theories, other historians and mathematicians have proposed alternative theories for the pyramid designs that are not related to any use of the golden ratio, and are instead based on purely rational slopes that only approximate the golden ratio.&lt;ref name="maor"&gt;[[Eli Maor|Maor, Eli]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xU0IPNGRXqEC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=intitle:trigonometric+inauthor:maor+seked+rhind&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=GYo5SJHPCJnstAPNk5S8Cw&amp;sig=dCMf0wTbtg6KwHNbxMS-2Ra_yDc Trigonometric Delights]'', Princeton Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians of those times apparently did not know the [[Pythagorean theorem]]; the only right triangle whose proportions they knew was the 3:4:5 triangle.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Eric Temple.

[[File:Parthenon from west.jpg|thumb|The Parthenon west façade]]

===Prehispanic Mesoamerican architecture===

Between 1950 and 1960, Manuel Amabilis applied some of the analysis methods of [[Frederik Macody Lund]] and [[Jay Hambidge]] in several designs of prehispanic buildings, such as  ''El Toloc'' and ''La Iglesia de Las Monjas'' (the Nuns Church), a notable complex of [[Terminal Classic Maya|Terminal Classic]] buildings constructed in the [[Puuc]] architectural style at [[Chichen Itza]]. According to his studies, their proportions are concretized from a series of polygons, circles and pentagrams inscribed, as [[Lund]] found in his studies of Gothic churches. Manuel Amabilis published his studies along with several self-explanatory images of other [[pre-columbian]] buildings made with golden ratio proportions in ''La Arquitectura Precolombina de Mexico''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;q=manuel+amabilis Manue Amabilis].

===Romanesque architecture===
The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style of architecture prevailed in Europe between 900–1200, a period which ends with the transition to [[Gothic architecture]]. The contrast between Romanesque and Gothic concepts in religious buildings can be understood in the epistolary between [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]], [[Cistercian]], and the [[Abbot Suger]] of the order of [[Cluny]], the initiator of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] art in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St. Denis]].

One of the most beautiful works of Romanesque Cistercian is the Abbey of [[Sénanque]] in Provence. The [[Sénanque]] abbatial was founded in 1148 and consecrated in 1178. It was initiated in life of [[St Bernard of Clairvaux]].
“La Lumière à Sénanque” (The Light in Sénanque),&lt;ref&gt;http://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/handle/2117/1794&lt;/ref&gt;
a chapter of ''Cîteaux : commentarii cistercienses'', a publication of the [[Cistercian Order]].  Its author, Kim Lloveras i Montserrat, made in 1992 a complete study of the abbatial, and argues that the abbatial church was designed using a system of measures founded in the golden ratio, and that the instruments used for its construction were the “Vescica” and the medieval squares used by the constructors, both designed with the golden ratio. The "Vescica" of [[Sénanque]] is located in the cloister of the monastery, in front of the Chapter, the site of the workshop.

[[File:Laon Cathedral's regulator lines.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of [[Notre-Dame of Laon]] cathedral. According to [[Frederik Macody Lund]], the superimposed regulator lines show that the cathedral has golden proportions.]]

In his 1919 book ''Ad Quadratum'', [[Frederik Macody Lund]], a historian who studied the geometry of several gothic structures, claims that the [[Cathedral of Chartres]] (begun in the 12th century), the [[Notre-Dame of Laon]] (1157–1205), and the [[Notre Dame de Paris]] (1160) are designed according to the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=curso/&gt;  Other scholars argue that until Luca Pacioli's 1509 ''De Divina Proportione'' (see next section), the golden ratio was unknown to artists and architects, although this is not likely the case since the ratio was explicitly defined by Euclid.&lt;ref name="livio"/&gt;

A 2003 conference on medieval architecture resulted in the book ''Ad Quadratum: The Application of Geometry to Medieval Architecture''. According to a summary by one reviewer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most of the contributors consider that the setting out was done ad quadratum, using the sides of a square and its diagonal. This gave an incommensurate ratio of [square root of (2)] by striking a circular arc (which could easily be done with a rope rotating around a peg). Most also argued that setting out was done geometrically rather than arithmetically (with a measuring rod). Some considered that setting out also involved the use of equilateral or Pythagorean triangles, pentagons, and octagons. Two authors believe the Golden Section (or at least its approximation) was used, but its use in medieval times is not supported by most architectural historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The geometry of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals. (Ad Quadratum: The Application of Geometry to Medieval Architecture) (Book Review) | journal=Architectural Science Review | volume=46 | issue=3 | pages=337–338 | date=September 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Australian architectural historian John James made a detailed study of the [[Cathedral of Chartres]]. In his work ''The Master Masons of Chartres'' he says that Bronze, one of the master masons, used the golden ratio. It was the same relation as between the arms of their metal square:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bronze by comparison was an innovator, in practical rather than in philosophic things. Amongst other things Bronze was one of the few masters to use the fascinating ratio of the golden mean. For the builder, the most important function Fi, as we write the golden mean, is that if the uses is consistently he will find that every subdivision, no matter how accidentally it may have been derived, will fit somewhere into the series.  Is not too difficult a ratio to reproduce, and Bronze could have had the two arms of his metal square cut to represent it.  All he would than have had to do was to place the square on the stone and, using the string draw between the corners, relate any two lengths by Phi. Nothing like making life easy.&lt;ref&gt;James, John, ''The Master Masons of Chartres''.

Da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (c. 1503–1506) ''"has been the subject of so many volumes of contradicting scholarly and popular speculations that it virtually impossible to reach any unambiguous conclusions"'' with respect to the golden ratio, according to Livio.&lt;ref name="livio"/&gt;

The final study of ''Parade'', executed prior to the oil on canvas, is divided horizontally into fourths and vertically into sixths (4 : 6 ratio) corresponding to the dimensions of the canvas, which is one and one-half times wider than its vertical dimension. These axes do not correspond precisely to the golden section, 1 : 1.6, as might have been expected. Rather, they correspond to basic mathematical divisions (simple ratios that appear to approximate the golden section), as noted by Seurat with citations from the mathematician, inventor, esthetician [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]].&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

The idea of the [[Section d'Or]] (or Groupe de Puteaux) originated in the course of conversations between [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Jacques Villon]]. The group's title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''Trattato della Pittura'' by [[Joséphin Péladan]]. Peladan attached great [[Mysticism|mystical]] significance to the [[golden section]] ({{lang-fr|Section d'Or}}), and other similar geometric configurations. For Villon, this symbolized his belief in order and the significance of mathematical proportions, because it reflected patterns and relationships occurring in nature. Jean Metzinger and the Duchamp brothers were passionately interested in mathematics.

===Le Corbusier===
The Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]], famous for his contributions to the [[modernism|modern]] [[International style (architecture)|international style]], centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p. 25, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p. 316, Taylor and Francis, {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modulor]]: Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], Leonardo da Vinci's  "[[Vitruvian Man]]", the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of [[architecture]]. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], Fibonacci numbers, and the double unit. He took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.&lt;ref name="modulor"&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'', p. 35, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p. 320. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Modulor: A Harmonious Measure to the Human Scale, Universally Applicable to Architecture and Mechanics'' Le Corbusier reveals he used his system in the Marseilles Unite D'Habitation (in the general plan and section, the front elevation, plan and section of the apartment, in the woodwork, the wall, the roof and some prefabricated furniture), a small office in 35 rue de Sèvres, a factory in Saint-Die and the [[United Nations Headquarters]] building in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor: A Harmonious Measure to the Human Scale, Universally Applicable to Architecture and Mechanics'', Birkhäuser, 2000, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors claim that the shape of the facade of the second is the result of three golden rectangles;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Geometry and the Visual Arts | author=Daniel Pedoe | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=1983 | isbn=0-486-24458-X | pages=121 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g24GMnuf36MC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=golden-ratio+united-nations&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=O3fdR7XsOIrysgP6yMXqAQ&amp;sig=_NDCQ2VQ1fYJLepf5I4vsofCxcw }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, each of the three rectangles that can actually be appreciated have different heights.

Another Swiss architect, [[Mario Botta]], bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in [[Origlio]], the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Simon. ''Analysing Architecture'' (2003)  pp. 154-5, {{isbn|0-415-30685-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[Ernő Lendvai]] analyzes [[Béla Bartók]]'s works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the [[acoustic scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Lendvai, Ernő (1971). ''Béla Bartók: An Analysis of His Music''. London: Kahn and Averill.&lt;/ref&gt; though other music scholars reject that analysis.&lt;ref name="livio"/&gt; In Bartók's ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' the xylophone progression occurs at the intervals 1:2:3:5:8:5:3:2:1.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Peter F. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgftUKoMnpkC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=bartok+intitle:The+intitle:Dynamics+intitle:of+intitle:Delight+intitle:Architecture+intitle:and+intitle:Aesthetics&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=WkkSR5L6OI--ogLpmoyzBg&amp;sig=Ijw4YifrLhkcdQSMVAjSL5g4zVk The Dynamics of Delight: Architecture and Aesthetics]'' (New York: Routledge, 2003) pp 83, {{isbn|0-415-30010-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French composer [[Erik Satie]] used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including ''Sonneries de la Rose+Croix''. 

The golden ratio is also apparent in the organisation of the sections in the music of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''Image: Reflections in the Water'', in which "the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position."&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;

The musicologist [[Roy Howat]] has observed that the formal boundaries of Debussy’s [[La mer (Debussy)|''La mer'']] correspond exactly to the golden section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Debussy in Proportion: A Musical Analysis | author=Roy Howat | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bwKykNp24wC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=intitle:Debussy+intitle:in+intitle:Proportion+golden+la-mer&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=KFKlR5b5O4bOiQGQt82pCg&amp;sig=oBWbHkWkhTG11w_BNdx89SWjQTY#PPA169,M1 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1983 | isbn=0-521-31145-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trezise finds the intrinsic evidence "remarkable", but cautions that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy consciously sought such proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Debussy: La Mer | author=Simon Trezise | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1994 | isbn=0-521-44656-2 | pages=53 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THD1nge_UzcC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=inauthor:Trezise+golden+evidence&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=DlSlR-7HJJXEigGR2sS5Cg&amp;sig=5auw0tRu24Jq0aFKOjLyZ2u7BGo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonid Sabaneyev]] hypothesizes that the separate time intervals of the musical pieces connected by the "culmination event", as a rule, are in the ratio of the golden section.&lt;ref&gt;Sabaneev, Leonid and [[Judah A. Joffe|JOFFE, Judah A.]] ''Modern Russian Composers''. 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; However the author attributes this incidence to the instinct of the musicians: ''"All such events are timed by author's instinct to such points of the whole length that they divide temporary durations into separate parts being in the ratio of the golden section."''

Ron Knott&lt;ref&gt;Knott, Ron, ''[Ron Knott's web pages on Mathematics]'', ''[http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibInArt.html Fibonacci Numbers and The Golden Section in Art, Architecture and Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228042058/http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibInArt.html |date=2009-02-28 }}'', Surrey University&lt;/ref&gt; exposes how the golden ratio is unintentionally present in several pieces of classical music:
* An article of ''American Scientist''&lt;ref&gt;May, Mike, "Did Mozart use the Golden mean?", ''American Scientist'', March/April 1996&lt;/ref&gt; ("Did Mozart use the Golden mean?", March/April 1996), reports that John Putz found that there was considerable deviation from ratio section division in many of Mozart's sonatas and claimed that any proximity to this number can be explained by constraints of the sonata form itself.
* Derek Haylock&lt;ref&gt;Haylock, Derek. ''Mathematics Teaching, Volume 84'', p. 56-57. 1978&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the opening motif of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] in C minor, Op. 67 (c. 1804–08), occurs exactly at the golden mean point 0.618 in bar 372 of 601 and again at bar 228 which is the other golden section point (0.618034 from the end of the piece) but he has to use 601 bars to get these figures. This he does by ignoring the final 20 bars that occur after the final appearance of the motif and also ignoring bar 387.

According to author Leon Harkleroad, "Some of the most misguided attempts to link music and mathematics have involved Fibonacci numbers and the related golden ratio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Math Behind the Music | author=Leon Harkleroad | publisher=Cambridge University Press | page=120|year=2006 | isbn=0-521-81095-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3dsb7Qysh4C&amp;pg=RA4-PA120&amp;dq=misguided+music+mathematics+%22golden+ratio%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=9GJwR7m-HIbktAO_-ayeBw&amp;sig=h_YrTJ6LYBsfmhjexiQvmmPZFFM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16720">In relativistic [[physics]], '''Lorentz symmetry''', named for [[Hendrik Lorentz]], is an equivalence of observation or observational symmetry due to [[special relativity]] implying that the laws of physics stay the same for all observers that are moving with respect to one another within an [[inertial frame]]. It has also been described as "the feature of nature that says experimental results are independent of the orientation or the boost velocity of the laboratory through space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29224 |title=Framing Lorentz symmetry |publisher=CERN Courier |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lorentz covariance''', a related concept, is a property of the underlying [[spacetime]] manifold.  Lorentz covariance has two distinct, but closely related meanings:

# A [[physical quantity]] is said to be Lorentz covariant if it transforms under a given [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lorentz group]]. According to the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]], these quantities are built out of [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]s, [[four-vector]]s, [[four-tensor]]s, and [[spinor]]s. In particular, a Lorentz covariant scalar (e.g., the [[space-time interval]])  remains the same under [[Lorentz transformation]]s and is said to be a ''Lorentz invariant'' (i.e., they transform under the [[trivial representation]]).
# An [[equation]] is said to be Lorentz covariant if it can be written in terms of Lorentz covariant quantities (confusingly, some use the term ''invariant'' here). The key property of such equations is that if they hold in one inertial frame, then they hold in any inertial frame; this follows from the result that if all the components of a tensor vanish in one frame, they vanish in every frame. This condition is a requirement according to the [[principle of relativity]]; i.e., all non-[[gravitation]]al laws must make the same predictions for identical experiments taking place at the same spacetime event in two different [[inertial frames of reference]].

On [[manifold]]s, the words [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|''covariant'' and ''contravariant'']] refer to how objects transform under general coordinate transformations. Both covariant and contravariant four-vectors can be Lorentz covariant quantities.

'''Local Lorentz covariance''', which follows from [[general relativity]], refers to Lorentz covariance applying only [[local symmetry|''locally'']] in an infinitesimal region of spacetime at every point. There is a generalization of this concept to cover [[Poincare covariance|Poincaré covariance]] and Poincaré invariance.

==Examples==

In general, the (transformational) nature of a Lorentz tensor{{clarify|this terminology should be introduced before use|date=March 2017}} can be identified by its [[tensor order]], which is the number of free indices it has. No indices implies it is a scalar, one implies that it is a vector, etc.  Some tensors with a physical interpretation are listed below.

The [[sign convention]] of the [[Minkowski metric]] η = [[diagonal matrix|diag]] (1, −1, −1, −1) is used throughout the article.

== Lorentz violating models ==
{{See also|Modern searches for Lorentz violation}}

In standard field theory, there are very strict and severe constraints on [[Renormalization group#Relevant and irrelevant operators, universality classes|marginal and relevant]] Lorentz violating operators within both [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] and the [[Standard Model]]. Irrelevant Lorentz violating operators may be suppressed by a high [[cutoff (physics)|cutoff]] scale, but they typically induce marginal and relevant Lorentz violating operators via radiative corrections. So, we also have very strict and severe constraints on irrelevant Lorentz violating operators.

Since some approaches to [[quantum gravity]] lead to violations of Lorentz invariance,&lt;ref name="Mattingly"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.12942/lrr-2005-5|pmid=28163649|pmc=5253993|title=Modern Tests of Lorentz Invariance|year=2005|last1=Mattingly|first1=David|journal=Living Reviews in Relativity|volume=8|issue=1|pages=5|arxiv = gr-qc/0502097 |bibcode = 2005LRR.....8....5M }}&lt;/ref&gt; these studies are part of [[Phenomenological Quantum Gravity]]. Lorentz violations are allowed in [[string theory]], [[supersymmetry]] and [[Horava-Lifshitz gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03434 Neutrino Interferometry for High-Precision Tests of Lorentz Symmetry with IceCube]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorentz violating models typically fall into four classes:{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

* The laws of physics are exactly [[Lorentz covariant]] but this symmetry is [[spontaneously broken]]. In [[special relativity|special relativistic]] theories, this leads to [[phonon]]s, which are the [[Goldstone boson]]s. The phonons travel at ''less'' than the [[speed of light]].
* Similar to the approximate Lorentz symmetry of phonons in a lattice (where the speed of sound plays the role of the critical speed), the Lorentz symmetry of special relativity (with the speed of light as the critical speed in vacuum) is only a low-energy limit of the laws of physics, which involve new phenomena at some fundamental scale. Bare conventional "elementary" particles are not point-like field-theoretical objects at very small distance scales, and a nonzero fundamental length must be taken into account. Lorentz symmetry violation is governed by an energy-dependent parameter which tends to zero as momentum decreases.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresMoriond1995"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Properties of a possible class of particles able to travel faster than light |journal=Dark Matter in Cosmology |pages=645 |author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres |date=1995-05-25 |arxiv=astro-ph/9505117 |bibcode=1995dmcc.conf..645G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such patterns require the existence of a [[preferred frame|privileged local inertial frame]] (the "vacuum rest frame"). They can be tested, at least partially, by ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments like the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresICRC97"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Absence of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Cutoff and Stability of Unstable Particles at Very High Energy, as a Consequence of Lorentz Symmetry Violation |journal=Proceedings of the 25th International Cosmic Ray Conference (held 30 July - 6 August |author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres |volume = 6|pages=113 |date=1997-05-26 |bibcode = 1997ICRC....6..113G|arxiv=physics/9705031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The laws of physics are symmetric under a [[deformation theory|deformation]] of the Lorentz or more generally, the [[Poincaré group]], and this deformed symmetry is exact and unbroken. This deformed symmetry is also typically a [[quantum group]] symmetry, which is a generalization of a group symmetry. [[Deformed special relativity]] is an example of this class of models. The deformation is scale dependent, meaning that at length scales much larger than the Planck scale, the symmetry looks pretty much like the Poincaré group. Ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments cannot test such models.
* [[Very special relativity]] forms a class of its own; if [[CP symmetry|charge-parity]] (CP) is an exact symmetry, a subgroup of the Lorentz group is sufficient to give us all the standard predictions. This is, however, not the case.

Models belonging to the first two classes can be consistent with experiment if Lorentz breaking happens at Planck scale or beyond it, or even before it in suitable [[preon]]ic models,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresCrete2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1051/epjconf/20147100062|title=Ultra-high energy physics and standard basic principles. Do Planck units really make sense?|journal=EPJ Web of Conferences|volume=71|pages=00062|year=2014|author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres|url=http://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2014/08/epjconf_icnfp2013_00062.pdf|publisher=EPJ Web of Conferences (ICNFP 2013 Conference)|bibcode=2014EPJWC..7100062G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if Lorentz symmetry violation is governed by a suitable energy-dependent parameter. One then has a class of models which deviate from Poincaré symmetry near the Planck scale but still flows towards an exact Poincaré group at very large length scales.  This is also true for the third class, which is furthermore protected from radiative corrections as one still has an exact (quantum) symmetry.

Even though there is no evidence of the violation of Lorentz invariance, several experimental searches for such violations have been performed during recent years. A detailed summary of the results of these searches is given in the Data Tables for Lorentz and CPT Violation.&lt;ref name="DataTables"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8329">[[File:Menelaus' theorem 1.svg|right|thumb|Menelaus's theorem, case 1: line DEF passes inside triangle ABC]]

'''Menelaus's theorem''', named for [[Menelaus of Alexandria]], is a proposition about [[triangle]]s in [[plane geometry]]. Given a triangle ''ABC'', and a [[Transversal (geometry)|transversal]] line that crosses ''BC'', ''AC'', and ''AB'' at points ''D'', ''E'', and ''F'' respectively, with ''D'', ''E'', and ''F'' distinct from ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', then 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{AF}{FB} \times \frac{BD}{DC} \times \frac{CE}{EA} = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

or simply

: &lt;math&gt;AF \times BD \times CE= - FB \times DC \times EA .&lt;/math&gt;

This equation uses signed lengths of segments, in other words the length ''AB'' is taken to be positive or negative according to whether ''A'' is to the left or right of ''B'' in some fixed orientation of the line. For example, ''AF''/''FB'' is defined as having positive value when ''F'' is between ''A'' and ''B'' and negative otherwise.

The [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] is also true: If points ''D'', ''E'', and  ''F'' are chosen on ''BC'', ''AC'', and ''AB'' respectively so that 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{AF}{FB} \times \frac{BD}{DC} \times \frac{CE}{EA} = -1,&lt;/math&gt;
then ''D'', ''E'', and  ''F'' are collinear. The converse is often included as part of the theorem.

The theorem is very similar to [[Ceva's theorem]] in that their equations differ only in sign.

== Proof ==
[[File:Menelaos' theorem 2.svg|right|thumb|Menelaus's theorem, case 2: line DEF is entirely outside triangle ABC]]

A standard proof is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Follows Russel&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the sign of the [[left-hand side]] will be negative since either all three of the ratios are negative, the case where the line DEF misses the triangle (lower diagram), or one is negative and the other two are positive, the case where DEF crosses two sides of the triangle. (See [[Pasch's axiom]].)

To check the magnitude, construct perpendiculars from ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' to the line ''DEF'' and let their lengths be ''a, b,'' and ''c'' respectively. Then by [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] triangles it follows that |''AF''/''FB''| = |''a''/''b''|, |''BD''/''DC''| = |''b''/''c''|, and |''CE''/''EA''| = ''c''/''a''. So 
: &lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{AF}{FB}\right| \cdot \left|\frac{BD}{DC}\right| \cdot \left|\frac{CE}{EA}\right| = \left| \frac{a}{b}  \cdot \frac{b}{c} \cdot \frac{c}{a} \right| = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

For a simpler, if less symmetrical way to check the magnitude,&lt;ref&gt;Follows {{cite book |title=Inductive Plane Geometry|first=George Irving|last=Hopkins|publisher=D.C. Heath &amp; Co.|year=1902|chapter=Art. 983}}&lt;/ref&gt; draw ''CK'' parallel to ''AB'' where ''DEF'' meets ''CK'' at ''K''. Then by similar triangles
: &lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{BD}{DC}\right| = \left|\frac{BF}{CK}\right|,\,\left|\frac{AE}{EC}\right| = \left|\frac{AF}{CK}\right|&lt;/math&gt;
and the result follows by eliminating ''CK'' from these equations.

The converse follows as a corollary.&lt;ref&gt;Follows Russel with some simplification&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''D'', ''E'', and ''F'' be given on the lines ''BC'', ''AC'', and ''AB'' so that the equation holds. Let ''F''′ be the point where ''DE'' crosses ''AB''. Then by the theorem, the equation also holds for ''D'', ''E'', and ''F''′. Comparing the two, 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{AF}{FB} = \frac{AF'}{F'B}.&lt;/math&gt;
But at most one point can cut a segment in a given ratio so ''F''=''F''′.

=== A proof using homothecies ===
The following proof&lt;ref&gt;See Michèle Audin, Géométrie, éditions BELIN, Paris 1998: indication for exercise 1.37, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; uses only notions of [[affine geometry]], notably [[Homothetic transformation|homothecies]].
Whether or not ''D'', ''E'', and ''F'' are collinear, there are three homothecies with centers ''D'', ''E'', ''F'' that respectively send ''B'' to ''C'', ''C'' to ''A'', and ''A'' to ''B''. The composition of the three then is an element of the group of homothecy-translations that fixes ''B'', so it is a homothecy with center ''B'', possibly with ratio&amp;nbsp;1 (in which case it is the identity). This composition fixes the line ''DE'' if and only if ''F'' is collinear with ''D'' and ''E'' (since the first two homothecies certainly fix ''DE'', and the third does so only if ''F'' lies on ''DE''). Therefore ''D'', ''E'', and ''F'' are collinear if and only if this composition is the identity, which means that the product of the three ratios is&amp;nbsp;1:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\overrightarrow{DC}}{\overrightarrow{DB}}  \times 
        \frac{\overrightarrow{EA}}{\overrightarrow{EC}} \times
        \frac{\overrightarrow{FB}}{\overrightarrow{FA}} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to the given equation.

==History==
It is uncertain who actually discovered the theorem; however, the oldest extant exposition appears in ''Spherics'' by Menelaus. In this book, the plane version of the theorem is used as a lemma to prove a spherical version of the theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|
last=Smith|first=D.E.|title=History of Mathematics|isbn=0-486-20430-8
|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1958|volume=II|page=607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Almagest]], [[Ptolemy]] applies the theorem on a number of problems in spherical astronomy.&lt;ref name="rashed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rashed|first=Roshdi|title=Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science|volume=2|page=483|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-02063-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], Muslim scholars devoted a number of works that engaged in the study of Menelaus's theorem, which they referred to as "the proposition on the secants" (''shakl al-qatta'''). The [[complete quadrilateral]] was called the "figure of secants" in their terminology.&lt;ref name="rashed" /&gt; [[Al-Biruni]]'s work, ''The Keys of Astronomy'', lists a number of those works, which can be classified into studies as part of commentaries on Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' as in the works of [[al-Nayrizi]] and [[al-Khazin]] where each demonstrated particular cases of Menelaus's theorem that led to the [[sine rule]],&lt;ref name="musa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moussa|first=Ali|title=Mathematical Methods in Abū al-Wafāʾ's Almagest and the Qibla Determinations|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S095742391000007X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or works composed as independent treatises such as:

* [[Husam al-DIn al-Salar]]'s ''Removing the Veil from the Mysteries of the Figure of Secants'' (Kashf al-qina' 'an asrar al-shakl al-qatta'), also known as "The Book on the Figure of Secants" (''Kitab al-shakl al-qatta''') or in Europe as ''The Treatise on the Complete Quadrilateral''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12150">In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''modal μ-calculus''' ('''Lμ''', '''L&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;''', sometimes just '''μ-calculus''', although this can have a more general meaning) is an extension of [[propositional logic|propositional]] [[modal logic]] (with [[Multimodal logic|many modalities]]) by adding the [[least fixed point]] operator μ and the [[greatest fixed point]] operator &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, thus a [[fixed-point logic]].

The (propositional, modal) μ-calculus originates with [[Dana Scott]] and [[Jaco de Bakker]],&lt;ref&gt;Kozen p.&amp;nbsp;333.&lt;/ref&gt; and was further developed by [[Dexter Kozen]] into the version most used nowadays. It is used to describe properties of [[labelled transition system]]s and for [[model checking|verifying]] these properties. Many [[temporal logic]]s can be encoded in the μ-calculus, including [[CTL*]] and its widely used fragments&amp;mdash;[[linear temporal logic]] and [[computational tree logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p.108, Theorem 6; Emerson p.&amp;nbsp;196&lt;/ref&gt;

An algebraic view is to see it as an [[universal algebra|algebra]] of [[monotonic function]]s over a [[complete lattice]], with operators consisting of [[functional composition]] plus the least and greatest fixed point operators; from this viewpoint, the modal μ-calculus is over the lattice of a [[power set algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold and Niwiński, pp. viii-x and chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[game semantics]] of μ-calculus is related to [[two-player game]]s with [[perfect information]], particularly infinite [[parity game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold and Niwiński, pp. viii-x and chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax ==
Let ''P'' (propositions) and ''A'' (actions) be two finite sets of symbols, and let ''V'' be a countably infinite set of variables. The set of formulas of (propositional, modal) μ-calculus is defined as follows:
* each proposition and each variable is a formula;
* if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are formulas, then &lt;math&gt;\phi \wedge \psi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula.
* if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula, then &lt;math&gt;\neg \phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula;
* if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an action, then &lt;math&gt;[a] \phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula;(pronounced either: &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; box &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; or after &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; necessarily &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;)
* if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; a variable, then &lt;math&gt;\nu Z. \phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula, provided that every free occurrence of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; occurs positively, i.e. within the scope of an even number of negations.

(The notions of free and bound variables are as usual, where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the only binding operator.)

Given the above definitions, we can enrich the syntax with:
* &lt;math&gt;\phi \lor \psi&lt;/math&gt; meaning &lt;math&gt;\neg (\neg \phi \land \neg \psi)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle \phi&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced either: &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; diamond &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; or after &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; possibly &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) meaning &lt;math&gt;\neg [a] \neg \phi&lt;/math&gt;  
* &lt;math&gt;\mu Z. \phi&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\neg \nu Z. \neg \phi [Z:=\neg Z]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi [Z:=\neg Z]&lt;/math&gt; means substituting &lt;math&gt;\neg Z&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in all [[free occurrence]]s of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt;.

The first two formulas are the familiar ones from the classical [[propositional calculus]] and respectively the minimal [[multimodal logic]] '''K'''.

The notation &lt;math&gt;\mu Z. \phi&lt;/math&gt; (and its dual) are inspired from the [[lambda calculus]]; the intent is to denote the least (and respectively greatest) fixed point of the expression &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; where the "minimization" (and respectively "maximization") are in the variable &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, much like in lambda calculus &lt;math&gt;\lambda Z. \phi&lt;/math&gt; is a function with formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in [[Lambda calculus#Free and bound variables|bound variable]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold and Niwiński, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  see the denotational semantics below for details.

== Denotational semantics ==
Models of (propositional) μ-calculus are given as [[labelled transition system]]s &lt;math&gt;(S, R, V)&lt;/math&gt; where:

* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a set of states;
* &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; maps to each label &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; a binary relation on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt; V : P \to 2^S&lt;/math&gt;, maps to each proposition &lt;math&gt;p \in P&lt;/math&gt; the set of states where the proposition is true.

Given a labelled transition system &lt;math&gt;(S, R, V)&lt;/math&gt; and an interpretation &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; of the variables &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-calculus, &lt;math&gt;[\![\cdot]\!]_i:\phi \to 2^S&lt;/math&gt;, is the function defined by the following rules:

* &lt;math&gt;[\![p]\!]_i = V(p)&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;[\![Z]\!]_i = i(Z)&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;[\![\phi \wedge \psi]\!]_i = [\![\phi]\!]_i \cap [\![\psi]\!]_i&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;[\![\neg \phi]\!]_i = S \smallsetminus [\![\phi]\!]_i&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;[\![[a] \phi]\!]_i = \{s \in S \mid \forall t \in S, (s, t) \in R_a \rightarrow t \in [\![\phi]\!]_i\}&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;[\![\nu Z. \phi]\!]_i = \bigcup \{T \subseteq S \mid T \subseteq [\![\phi]\!]_{i[Z := T]}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;i[Z := T]&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; while preserving the mappings of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; everywhere else.

By duality, the interpretation of the other basic formulas is:

* &lt;math&gt;[\![\phi \vee \psi]\!]_i = [\![\phi]\!]_i \cup [\![\psi]\!]_i&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;[\![\langle a \rangle \phi]\!]_i = \{s \in S \mid \exists t \in S, (s, t) \in R_a \wedge t \in [\![\phi]\!]_i\}&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;[\![\mu Z. \phi]\!]_i = \bigcap \{T \subseteq S \mid [\![\phi]\!]_{i[Z := T]} \subseteq T \}&lt;/math&gt;

Less formally, this means that, for a given transition system &lt;math&gt;(S, R, V)&lt;/math&gt;:

* &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; holds in the set of states &lt;math&gt;V(p)&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\phi \wedge \psi&lt;/math&gt; holds in every state where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; both hold;
* &lt;math&gt;\neg \phi&lt;/math&gt; holds in every state where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; does not hold.
* &lt;math&gt;[a] \phi&lt;/math&gt; holds in a state &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; if every &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;-transition leading out of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; leads to a state where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds.
* &lt;math&gt;\langle a\rangle \phi&lt;/math&gt; holds in a state &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; if there exists &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;-transition leading out of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; that leads to a state where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds.
* &lt;math&gt;\nu Z.\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds in any state in any set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; such that, when the variable &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is set to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds for all of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. (From the [[Knaster–Tarski theorem]] it follows that &lt;math&gt;[\![\nu Z.\phi]\!]_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[greatest fixed point]] of &lt;math&gt;[\![\phi]\!]_{i[Z := T]}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;[\![\mu Z. \phi]\!]_i&lt;/math&gt; its [[least fixed point]].)

The interpretations of &lt;math&gt;[a] \phi&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\langle a\rangle \phi&lt;/math&gt; are in fact the "classical" ones from [[Dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]]. Additionally, the operator &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as [[liveness]] ("something good eventually happens") and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; as [[safety (computer science)|safety]] ("nothing bad ever happens") in [[Leslie Lamport]]'s informal classification.&lt;ref name="Bradfield and Stirling, p. 731"&gt;Bradfield and Stirling, p. 731&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

* &lt;math&gt;\nu Z.\phi \wedge [a]Z&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as "&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is true along every ''a''-path".&lt;ref name="Bradfield and Stirling, p. 731"/&gt; The idea is that "&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is true along every ''a''-path" can be defined axiomatically as that (weakest) sentence &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and which remains true after processing any ''a''-label. &lt;ref name="Bradfield and Stirling, p. 6"/&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mu Z.\phi \vee \langle a \rangle Z&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the existence of a path along ''a''-transitions to a state where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds.&lt;ref name="GrädelKolaitis2007"/&gt;

==Parables==
{{further2|[[History of Grandi's series|Grandi]], [[Thomson's lamp|Mathematical series analogy]]}}

[[Guido Grandi]] illustrated the series with a parable involving two brothers who share a gem.

[[Thomson's lamp]] is a [[supertask]] in which a hypothetical lamp is turned on and off infinitely many times in a finite time span. One can think of turning the lamp on as adding 1 to its state, and turning it off as subtracting 1. Instead of asking the sum of the series, one asks the final state of the lamp.&lt;ref&gt;Rucker p.297&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best-known classic parables to which infinite series have been applied, [[Achilles and the tortoise]], can also be adapted to the case of Grandi's series.&lt;ref&gt;Saichev pp.&amp;nbsp;255&amp;ndash;259&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numerical series==
The [[Cauchy product]] of Grandi's series with itself is [[1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + · · ·]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardy p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Several series resulting from the introduction of zeros into Grandi's series have interesting properties; for these see [[Summation of Grandi's series#Dilution]].

Grandi's series is just one example of a [[divergent geometric series]].

The rearranged series 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;· occurs in Euler's 1775 treatment of the [[pentagonal number theorem]] as the value of the [[Euler function]] at ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

==Power series==
The power series most famously associated with Grandi's series is its [[ordinary generating function]],

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 1-x+x^2-x^3+\cdots = \frac{1}{1+x}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Fourier series==

===Hyperbolic sine===
In his 1822 ''Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur'', [[Joseph Fourier]] obtains what we now call a [[Fourier sine series]] for a scaled version of the [[hyperbolic sine]] function,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{\pi}{2\sinh\pi} \sinh x.&lt;/math&gt;

He finds that the general coefficient of sin ''nx'' in the series is

:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{n-1}\left(\frac 1 n - \frac{1}{n^3} + \frac{1}{n^5} - \cdots\right) = (-1)^{n-1}\frac{n}{1+n^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 the above series converges, while the coefficient of sin&amp;nbsp;''x'' appears as 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;· and so is expected to be &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In fact, this is correct, as can be demonstrated by directly calculating the Fourier coefficient from an integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 2 \pi \int_0^\pi f(x)\sin x \;dx = \left.\frac 1 {2\sinh\pi}(\cosh x \sin x - \sinh x \cos x)\right|_0^\pi = \frac 1 2.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich p.&amp;nbsp;320&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dirac comb===
Grandi's series occurs more directly in another important series,

:&lt;math&gt;\cos x + \cos 2x + \cos 3x + \cdots = \sum_{k=1}^\infty\cos(kx).&lt;/math&gt;

At ''x'' = {{pi}}, the series reduces to −1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;· and so one might expect it to meaningfully equal −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In fact, Euler held that this series obeyed the formal relation Σ cos ''kx'' = −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while d'Alembert rejected the relation, and Lagrange wondered if it could be defended by an extension of the geometric series similar to Euler's reasoning with Grandi's numerical series.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 2005 p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

Euler's claim suggests that

:&lt;math&gt;1 +2\sum_{k=1}^\infty\cos(kx) = 0?&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x''. This series is divergent everywhere, while its Cesàro sum is indeed 0 for almost all ''x''. However, the series diverges to infinity at ''x'' = 2{{pi}}''n'' in a significant way: it is the Fourier series of a [[Dirac comb]]. The ordinary, Cesàro, and Abel sums of this series involve limits of the [[Dirichlet kernel|Dirichlet]], [[Fejér kernel|Fejér]], and [[Poisson kernel]]s, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Davis pp.&amp;nbsp;153&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dirichlet series==
{{main|Dirichlet eta function}}
Multiplying the terms of Grandi's series by 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt; yields the [[Dirichlet series]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\eta(z)=1-\frac{1}{2^z}+\frac{1}{3^z}-\frac{1}{4^z}+\cdots=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^z},&lt;/math&gt;
which converges only for complex numbers ''z'' with a positive real part. Grandi's series is recovered by letting ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Unlike the geometric series, the Dirichlet series for ''η'' is not useful for determining what 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · "should" be. Even on the right half-plane, ''η''(''z'') is not given by any elementary expression, and there is no immediate evidence of its limit as ''z'' approaches 0.&lt;ref&gt;Knopp (p.458) makes this point to criticize Euler's use of analytical expressions to evaluate numerical series, saying "it ''need not'' at any rate be +&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if one uses stronger methods of summability, then the Dirichlet series for ''η'' defines a function on the whole complex plane — the [[Dirichlet eta function]] — and moreover, this function is [[analytic function|analytic]]. For ''z'' with real part &gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1 it suffices to use Cesàro summation, and so ''η''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; after all.

The function ''η'' is related to a more famous Dirichlet series and function:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\eta(z) &amp; = 1+\frac 1 {2^z}+\frac 1 {3^z}+\frac 1 {4^z}+\cdots - \frac 2 {2^z} \left(1+\frac 1 {2^z}+\cdots\right) \\[5pt]
  &amp; = \left(1-\frac 2 {2^z}\right)\zeta(z),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ζ is the [[Riemann zeta function]]. Keeping Grandi's series in mind, this relation explains why ζ(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; see also [[1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · ·]]. The relation also implies a much more important result. Since ''η''(''z'') and  (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;minus;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;) are both analytic on the entire plane and the latter function's only [[zero (complex analysis)|zero]] is a [[simple zero]] at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, it follows that ζ(''z'') is [[meromorphic function|meromorphic]] with only a [[simple pole]] at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;Knopp pp.&amp;nbsp;491&amp;ndash;492&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euler characteristics==
Given a [[CW complex]] ''S'' containing one vertex, one edge, one face, and generally exactly one cell of every dimension, Euler's formula {{nowrap|''V'' − ''E'' + ''F'' − · · ·}} for the [[Euler characteristic]] of ''S'' returns {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − · · ·}}. There are a few motivations for defining a generalized Euler characteristic for such a space that turns out to be 1/2.

One approach comes from [[combinatorial geometry]]. The open interval (0, 1) has an Euler characteristic of &amp;minus;1, so its power set 2&lt;sup&gt;(0, 1)&lt;/sup&gt; should have an Euler characteristic of 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/2. The appropriate power set to take is the "small power set" of finite subsets of the interval, which consists of the union of a point (the empty set), an open interval (the set of singetons), an open triangle, and so on. So the Euler characteristic of the small power set is {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − · · ·}}. [[James Propp]] defines a regularized [[Euler measure]] for [[polyhedral set]]s that, in this example, replaces {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − · · ·}} with {{nowrap|1 − ''t'' + ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − · · ·}}, sums the series for |''t''| &lt; 1, and analytically continues to ''t'' = 1, essentially finding the Abel sum of {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − · · ·}}, which is 1/2. Generally, he finds χ(2&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;) = 2&lt;sup&gt;χ(''A'')&lt;/sup&gt; for any polyhedral set ''A'', and the base of the exponent generalizes to other sets as well.&lt;ref&gt;Propp pp.&amp;nbsp;7&amp;ndash;8,&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Infinite-dimensional real projective space|Infinite-dimensional]] [[real projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is another structure with one cell of every dimension and therefore an Euler characteristic of {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − · · ·}}. This space can be described as the quotient of the [[infinite-dimensional sphere|infinite-dimensional]] [[sphere]] by identifying each pair of [[antipodal point]]s. Since the infinite-dimensional sphere is [[contractible]], its Euler characteristic is 1, and its 2-to-1 quotient should have an Euler characteristic of 1/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first=James |last=Propp |title=Euler measure as generalized cardinality |year=2002 |eprint=math.CO/0203289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This description of '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; also makes it the [[classifying space]] of Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[cyclic group]] [[cyclic group of order 2|of order 2]]. Tom Leinster gives a definition of the Euler characteristic of any [[category (mathematics)|category]] which bypasses the classifying space and reduces to 1/|''G''| for any [[group (mathematics)|group]] when viewed as a one-object category. In this sense the Euler characteristic of Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is itself &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leinster |first=Tom |title=The Euler characteristic of a category |year=2006 |pages=21–49 |volume=13 |journal=Documenta Mathematica |arxiv=math/0610260|bibcode=2006math.....10260L }} {{cite web |last=Baez |first=John |title= This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 244) |year=2006 |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week244.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In physics ==
Grandi's series, and generalizations thereof, occur frequently in many branches of physics; most typically in the discussions of quantized [[fermion]] fields (for example, the [[chiral bag model]]), which have both positive and negative [[eigenvalue]]s; although similar series occur also for [[boson]]s, such as in the [[Casimir effect]].

The general series is discussed in greater detail in the article on [[spectral asymmetry]], whereas methods used to sum it are discussed in the articles on [[regularization (physics)|regularization]] and, in particular, the [[zeta function regulator]].

==In art==
[[Jliat]]'s 2000 musical single ''Still Life #7: The Grandi Series'' advertises itself as "conceptual art"; it consists of nearly an hour of silence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splendidezine.com/reviews/may-7-01/aag.html Review by George Zahora]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Growth and Form''''' is a book by the Scottish [[mathematical biology|mathematical biologist]] [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860–1948). The book is long – 793 pages in the first edition of 1917, 1116 pages in the second edition of 1942.

The book covers many topics including the effects of scale on the shape of animals and plants, large ones necessarily being relatively thick in shape; the effects of surface tension in shaping soap films and similar structures such as cells; the [[logarithmic spiral]] as seen in mollusc shells and ruminant horns; the arrangement of leaves and other plant parts ([[phyllotaxis]]); and Thompson's own method of transformations, showing the changes in shape of animal skulls and other structures on a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian grid]].

The work is widely admired by biologists, anthropologists and architects among others, but less often read than cited.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt; [[Peter Medawar]] explains this as being because it clearly pioneered the use of [[Mathematical biology|mathematics in biology]], and helped to defeat mystical ideas of [[vitalism]]; but that the book is weakened by Thompson's failure to understand the role of [[evolution]] and evolutionary history in shaping living structures. [[Philip Ball]] and [[Michael Ruse]], on the other hand, suspect that while Thompson argued for physical mechanisms, his rejection of natural selection bordered on vitalism.

==Overview==
[[File:Haeckel Phaeodaria 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Thompson analyses the polyhedral forms of [[Radiolaria]] from the [[Challenger expedition]] drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], 1904.]]

[[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]]'s most famous work, ''On Growth and Form'' was written in Dundee, mostly in 1915, but publication was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarron |first1=Matthew |title=Sketching the Universe: the Artistic Influence of D’Arcy Thompson |journal=Scottish Society for Art History Newsletter | date=2010 |issue=Summer 2010 |volume=34 |page=9 |url=http://ssah.org.uk/files/2012/05/SSAHnewsletter08-10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of the book is that biologists of its author's day overemphasized [[evolution]] as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of [[physics|physical laws]] and [[classical mechanics|mechanics]]. At a time when [[vitalism]] was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated [[structuralism (biology)|structuralism]] as an alternative to [[natural selection]] in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ruse, Michael |editor1-last=Henning |editor1-first=Brian G. |editor2-last=Scarfe |editor2-first=Adam |title=Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |date=2013 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=419 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtosxAtq-EC|chapter=17. From Organicism to Mechanism-and Halfway Back?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson had previously criticized [[Darwinism]] in his paper ''Some Difficulties of Darwinism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=D'Arcy Wentworth |title=Some Difficulties of Darwinism |journal=Nature |date=1894 |volume=50 |pages=435ff|doi=10.1038/050433b0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Growth and Form'' explained in detail why he believed Darwinism to be an inadequate explanation for the origin of new [[species]]. He did not reject [[natural selection]], but regarded it as secondary to physical influences on [[Morphology (biology)|biological form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boden, Margaret A. | date=2008 | title=Mind as Machine: A History of Cognitive Science | publisher=Oxford University Press | page=1255 | isbn=978-0199543168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a mass of examples, Thompson pointed out correlations between biological forms and mechanical phenomena. He showed the similarity in the forms of [[jellyfish]] and the forms of drops of liquid falling into [[viscosity|viscous]] fluid, and between the internal supporting structures in the hollow bones of birds and well-known engineering [[truss]] designs. He described [[phyllotaxis]] (numerical relationships between spiral structures in plants) and its relationship to the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Richards, Oscar W. | title= D'Arcy W.

Perhaps the most famous part of the book is Chapter 17, "The Comparison of Related Forms," where Thompson explored the degree to which [[allometry|differences in the forms of related animals]] could be described, in work inspired by the German [[engraving|engraver]] [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528), by [[Transformation (mathematics)|mathematical transformations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Milnor, John | authorlink=John Milnor | title=Geometry of Growth and Form: Commentary on D'Arcy Thompson | url=http://video.ias.edu/milnor-80th | work=video | publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]] | accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is descriptive rather than experimental science: Thompson did not articulate his insights in the form of hypotheses that can be tested. He was aware of this, saying that "This book of mine has little need of preface, for indeed it is 'all preface' from beginning to end."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1917. 'Prefatory Note', first paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

The first edition appeared in 1917 in a single volume of 793 pages published by Cambridge University Press.  A second edition, enlarged to 1116 pages, was published in two volumes in 1942. Thompson wrote in the preface to the 1942 edition that he had written "this book in wartime, and its revision has employed me during another war. It gave me solace and occupation, when service was debarred me by my years. Few are left of the friends who helped me write it." The unabridged edition is no longer in print in English, but an edition of 346 pages was abridged&lt;!--the changes are indicated in the next section--&gt; by [[John Tyler Bonner]], and is widely published under the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ulett |first1=Mark A. |title=On Growth and Form, by Sir D'Arcy Thompson |url=http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/growth-and-form-sir-darcy-thompson |website=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia | publisher=Arizona State University |accessdate=13 November 2014 |date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, often in the abridged edition, has been reprinted more than 40 times,&lt;ref name=WorldCat/&gt; and has been translated into Chinese, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name=WorldCat&gt;{{cite web | title=All editions for 'On Growth and Form'|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/on-growth-and-form/oclc/1610840/editions?cookie=&amp;start_edition=1&amp;sd=desc&amp;se=yr&amp;referer=br&amp;qt=show_more_yr%3A&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq=&amp;fc=yr%3A_25 | publisher=Worldcat | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The contents of the chapters in the first edition are summarized below. All but Chapter 11 have the same titles in the second edition, but many are longer, as indicated by the page numbering of the start of each chapter. Bonner's abridgment shortened all the chapters, and removed some completely, again as indicated at the start of each chapter's entry below.

===1. Introductory===

(1st edition p1 - 2nd edition p1 - Bonner p1)
:: Thompson names the progress of [[chemistry]] towards [[Kant]]'s goal of a mathematical science able to explain reactions by molecular mechanics, and points out that zoology has been slow to look to mathematics. He agrees that zoologists rightly seek for  reasons in animals' [[adaptation]]s, and reminds readers of the related but far older philosophical search for [[teleology]], explanation by some [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] final cause. His analysis of "growth and form" will try to show how these can be explained with ordinary [[physical laws]].

=== 2. On Magnitude ===
[[Image:Boat models by William Froude.JPG|thumb|right|Models used (by [[William Froude]]) to show that the [[Froude number|drag on a hull varies with square root of waterline length]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Newman | first=John Nicholas | authorlink=John Nicholas Newman | title=Marine hydrodynamics | year=1977 | publisher=[[MIT Press]] | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=0-262-14026-8 | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

(1st p16 - 2nd p22 - Bonner p15)
:: Thompson begins by showing that an [[Surface-area-to-volume ratio|animal's surface and volume (or weight) increase with the square and cube of its length]], respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. He shows in a few short equations that the [[Froude number|speed of a fish or ship rises with the square root of its length]]. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.

===3. The Rate of Growth ===

(1st p50 - 2nd p78 - Bonner removed)
:: Thompson points out that all changes of form are phenomena of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth and again in the teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in ''[[Spirogyra]]'', peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. [[Dendrochronology|Tree growth]] varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.

===4. On the Internal Form and Structure of the Cell===

(1st p156 - 2nd p286 - Bonner removed)
::Thompson argues for the need to study cells with physical methods, as morphology alone had little explanatory value. He notes that in [[mitosis]] the dividing cells look like iron filings between the poles of a magnet, in other words like a [[force field (physics)|force field]].

===5. The Forms of Cells===
[[File:Vorticella campanula.jpg|thumb|''[[Vorticella campanula]]'' (stalked cup shaped organisms) attached to a green plant]]

(1st p201 - 2nd p346 - Bonner p49)
::He considers the forces such as [[surface tension]] acting on cells, and [[Plateau's laws|Plateau's experiments]] on [[soap film]]s. He illustrates the way a splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of [[Campanularia]]n zoophytes ([[Hydrozoa]]). He looks at the flask-like shapes of [[protista|single-celled organisms]] such as species of ''[[Vorticella]]'', considering teleological and physical explanations of their having [[minimal area]]s; and at the hanging drop shapes of some [[Foraminifera]] such as ''[[Lagena (foraminifera)|Lagena]]''. He argues that the cells of [[trypanosomatid|trypanosomes]] are similarly shaped by surface tension.

===6. A Note on Adsorption===

(1st p277 - 2nd p444 - Bonner removed)
::Thompson notes that surface tension in living cells is reduced by substances resembling oils and soaps; where the concentrations of these vary locally, the shapes of cells are affected. In the green alga ''[[Mesocarpus|Pleurocarpus]]'' ([[Zygnematales]]), potassium is concentrated near growing points in the cell.

===7. The Forms of Tissues, or Cell-aggregates===

(1st p293 - 2nd p465 - Bonner p88)
::Thompson observes that in multicellular organisms, cells influence each other's shapes with [[triangle of forces|triangles of forces]]. He analyses [[parenchyma]] and the cells in a [[embryogenesis|frog's egg]] as soap films, and considers the [[symmetry|symmetries]] bubbles meeting at points and edges. He compares the shapes of living and fossil [[corals]] such as ''[[Cyathophyllum]]'' and  ''[[Comoseris]]'', and the hexagonal structure of [[honeycomb]], to such soap bubble structures.

===8. The same (continued)===
(1st p346 - 2nd p566 - Bonner merged with previous chapter)
::Thompson considers the laws governing the shapes of cells, at least in simple cases such as the fine hairs (a cell thick) in the rhizoids of [[moss]]es. He analyses the geometry of cells in a frog's egg when it has divided into 4, 8 and even 64 cells. He shows that uniform growth can lead to unequal cell sizes, and argues that the way cells divide is driven by the shape of the dividing structure (and not vice versa).

===9. On Concretions, Spicules, and Spicular Skeletons===
[[File:Demospongiae spicule diversity.png|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|A selection of [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]] in the [[Demospongiae]]]]

(1st p411 - 2nd p645 - Bonner p132)
::Thompson considers the skeletal structures of [[diatom]]s, [[radiolarians]], foraminifera and [[sponge]]s, many of which contain hard [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]] with geometric shapes. He notes that these structures form outside living cells, so that physical forces must be involved.

===10. A Parenthetic Note on Geodetics===
(1st p488 - 2nd p741 - Bonner removed)
::Thompson applies the use of the [[geodesy|geodetic]] line, "the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a solid of revolution", to the spiral thickening of plant cell walls and other cases.

===11. The Logarithmic Spiral ['The Equiangular Spiral' in 2nd Ed.]===
[[Image:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|Halved shell of ''[[Nautilus]]'' showing the chambers (camerae) in a [[logarithmic spiral]]]]

(1st p493 - 2nd p748 - Bonner p172)
::Thompson observes that there are many [[patterns in nature|spirals in nature]], from the horns of ruminants to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the [[spiral of Archimedes]] before moving on to the [[logarithmic spiral]], which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually [[self-similar]]. Shells as diverse as ''[[Haliotis]]'', ''[[Triton (gastropod)|Triton]]'', ''[[Terebra]]'' and ''[[Nautilus]]'' (illustrated with a halved shell and a [[radiograph]]) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as [[ammonite]]s.

===12. The Spiral Shells of the Foraminifera===
(1st p587 - 2nd p850 - Bonner merged with previous chapter)
::Thompson analyses diverse forms of minute spiral shells of the [[foraminifera]], many of which are logarithmic, others irregular, in a manner similar to the previous chapter.

===13. The Shapes of Horns, and of Teeth or Tusks: with A Note on Torsion===
[[File:Big Horn Sheep 2.jpg|thumb|The spiral horns of the male bighorn sheep, ''[[Ovis canadensis]]'']]
(1st p612 - 2nd p874 - Bonner p202)
::Thompson considers the three types of horn that occur in quadrupeds: the [[keratin]] horn of the [[rhinoceros]]; the paired horns of sheep or goats; and the bony [[antlers]] of deer.
:: In a note on torsion, Thompson mentions [[Charles Darwin]]'s treatment of climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's [[teleological argument|teleological explanation]], that the twisting makes the stems stiffer in the same way as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.

===14. On Leaf-arrangement, or Phyllotaxis===
&lt;!--[[File:Cones14062008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Phyllotaxis]] of cones of ''[[Abies koreana]]'']]--&gt;
[[File:SunFlower Closeup Hungary.jpg|thumb|[[Phyllotaxis]] of [[sunflower]] florets]]

(1st p635 - 2nd p912 - Bonner removed)
::Thompson analyses [[phyllotaxis]], the arrangement of plant parts around an axis. He notes that such parts include leaves around a stem; fir cones made of scales; sunflower florets forming an elaborate crisscrossing [[patterns in nature|pattern]] of different spirals (parastichies). He recognises their beauty but dismisses any mystical notions; instead he remarks that

::{{quote|When the bricklayer builds a factory chimney, he lays his bricks in a certain steady, orderly way, with no thought of the spiral patterns to which this orderly sequence inevitably leads, and which spiral patterns are by no means "subjective".|Thompson, 1917, page 641}}

The numbers that result from such spiral arrangements are the [[Fibonacci sequence]] of ratios 1/2, 2/3, 3.5 ... converging on 0.61803..., the [[golden ratio]] which is

::{{quote|beloved of the circle-squarer, and of all those who seek to find, and then to penetrate, the secrets of the Great Pyramid. It is deep-set in [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] as well as in [[Euclidean geometry]].|Thompson, 1917, page 649}}

===15. On the Shapes of Eggs, and of certain other Hollow Structures===
(1st p652 - 2nd p934 - Bonner removed)
::Eggs are what Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of [[owl]]s through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the markedly pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the [[guillemot]]. He shows that the shape of the egg favours its movement along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, [[sea urchin]] shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.

===16. On Form and Mechanical Efficiency===
&lt;!--[[File:Gray250.png|thumb|Lines of stress calculated for a human femur]]--&gt;
[[File:Forth Rail &amp; Road Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Thompson compared a dinosaur's spine to the [[Forth Railway Bridge]] (right).]]

(1st p670 - 2nd p958 - Bonner p221)
::Thompson criticizes talk of [[adaptation]] by [[animal coloration|coloration in animals]] for presumed purposes of [[crypsis]], [[warning coloration|warning]] and [[mimicry]] (referring readers to [[E. B. Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', and more sceptically to [[Abbott Thayer]]'s ''[[Concealing-coloration in the Animal Kingdom]]''). He considers the mechanical engineering of bone to be a far more definite case. He compares the strength of bone and wood to materials such as steel and cast iron; illustrates the "cancellous" structure of the bone of the human [[femur]] with thin trabeculae which formed "nothing more nor less than a diagram of the lines of stress ... in the loaded structure", and compares the femur to the head of a building crane. He similarly compares the [[cantilever]]ed backbone of a quadruped or dinosaur to the [[girder]] structure of the [[Forth Railway Bridge]].

===17. On the Theory of Transformations, or the Comparison of Related Forms===
[[File:Durer face transforms.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht Dürer]]'s face transforms (1528) were among Thompson's inspirations]]

(1st p719 - 2nd p1026 - Bonner p268)
::Inspired by the work of [[Albrecht Dürer]], Thompson explores how the forms of organisms and their parts, whether leaves, the bones of the foot, human faces or the body shapes of [[copepod]]s, crabs or fish, can be explained by geometrical transformations. For example:

[[File:Darcythompson.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|Thompson illustrated the [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]] of ''[[Argyropelecus|Argyropelecus olfersi]]'' into ''[[Sternoptyx|Sternoptyx diaphana]]'' by applying a [[shear mapping]].]]

::{{quote|Among the fishes we discover a great variety of deformations, some of them of a very simple kind, while others are more striking and more unexpected. A comparatively simple case, involving a simple shear, is illustrated by Figs. 373 and 374. Fig. 373 represents, within Cartesian co-ordinates, a certain little oceanic fish known as ''Argyropelecus olfersi''. Fig. 374 represents precisely the same outline, transferred to a system of oblique co-ordinates whose axes are inclined at an angle of 70°; but this is now (as far as can be seen on the scale of the drawing) a very good figure of an allied fish, assigned to a different genus, under the name of ''Sternoptyx diaphana''. Thompson 1917, pages 748–749}}

::In similar style he transforms the shape of the carapace of the crab ''[[Geryon trispinosus|Geryon]]'' variously to that of ''[[Corystes]]'' by a simple [[shear mapping]], and to ''[[Rochinia|Scyramathia]]'', ''[[Paralomis]]'', ''[[Lupa (crab)|Lupa]]'', and ''[[Chorinus]]'' ([[Pisinae]]) by stretching the top or bottom of the grid sideways. The same process changes ''[[Crocodylus porosus|Crocodilus porosus]]'' to  ''[[Crocodylus acutus|Crocodilus americanus]]'' and  ''[[Notosuchus terrestris]]''; relates the hip-bones of fossil reptiles and birds such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and ''[[Apatornis]]''; the skulls of various fossil horses, and even the skulls of a horse and a rabbit. A human skull is stretched into those of the chimpanzee and baboon, and with "the mode of deformation .. on different lines" (page 773), of a dog.

===Epilogue===
(1st p778 - 2nd p1093 - Bonner p326)

::In the brief epilogue, Thompson writes that he will have succeeded "if I have been able to shew [the morphologist] that a certain mathematical aspect of morphology ... is ... complementary to his descriptive task, and helpful, nay essential, to his proper study and comprehension of Form."  More lyrically, he writes that "For the harmony of the world is made manifest in Form and Number, and the heart and soul and all the poetry of Natural Philosophy are embodied in the concept of mathematical beauty" and quotes [[Isaiah]] 40:12 on measuring out the waters and heavens and the dust of the earth. He ends with a paragraph praising the French [[entomologist]] [[Jean-Henri Fabre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Russel | first1=Alfred | title=Decoding D’Arcy Thompson – Part 1 | url=http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/decoding-darcy-thompson-part-1/ | accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who "being of the same blood and marrow with [[Plato]] and [[Pythagoras]], saw in Number 'la clef de voute' [the key to the vault (of the universe)] and found in it 'le comment et le pourquoi des choses' [the how and the why of things]".

==Reception==

===Contemporary===

"J. P. McM[urrich]", reviewing the book in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' in 1917, wrote that "the book is one of the strongest documents in support of the mechanistic view of life that has yet been put forth", contrasting this with "vitalism". The reviewer was interested in the "discussion of the physical factors determining the size of organisms, especially interesting being the consideration of the conditions which may determine the minimum size".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McM___ |first1=J. P. |authorlink=J. P. McMurrich |title=Book Review: On Growth and Form |journal=Science |date=23 November 1917 |pages=513–514 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/46/1195/513.citation |doi=10.1126/science.46.1195.513 |volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. W. Buchanan, reviewing the second edition in ''Physiological Zoology'' in 1943, described it as "an imposing extension of his earlier attempt to formulate a geometry of Growth and Form" and "beautifully written", but warned that "the reading will not be easy" and that "A vast store of literature has here been assembled and assimilated". Buchanan summarizes the book, and notes that Chapter 17 "seems to the reviewer to contain the essence of the long and more or less leisurely thesis... The chapter is devoted to comparison of related forms, largely by the method of co-ordinates. Fundamental differences in these forms are thus revealed", and Buchanan concludes that the large "gaps" indicate that Darwin's endless series of continuous variations is not substantiated. But he does have some criticisms: Thompson should have referenced the effects of hormones on growth; and the relation of molecular configuration and form; [[genetics]] is barely mentioned, and experimental [[embryology]] and regeneration [despite Thompson's analysis of the latter] are overlooked. The mathematics used consists of [[statistics]] and [[geometry]], while [[thermodynamics]] is "largely absent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buchanan |first1=J. W. |title=On Growth and Form by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson |journal=Physiological Zoology |date=January 1943 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=135–137 |jstor=30151680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edmund Mayer, reviewing the second edition in ''The Anatomical Record'' in 1943, noted that the "scope of the book and the general approach to the problems dealt with have remained unchanged, but considerable additions have been made and large parts have been recast". He was impressed at the extent to which Thompson had kept up with developments in many sciences, though he thought the mentions of quantum theory and Heisenberg uncertainty unwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayer|first1=Edmund |title=On growth and form. By D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson |journal=The Anatomical Record |date=January 1943 |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=111–116 |doi=10.1002/ar.1090850108 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.1090850108/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George C. Williams, reviewing the 1942 edition and Bonner's abridged edition for the ''Quarterly Review of Biology'' (of which he was the editor), writes that the book is "a work widely praised, but seldom used. It contains neither original insights
that have formed a basis for later advances nor instructive fallacies that have stimulated fruitful attack. This seeming paradox is brilliantly discussed by P. B. Medawar [in] ''Pluto's Republic''."&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;&lt;ref name=Medawar&gt;{{cite book |last1=Medawar |first1=Peter |authorlink=Peter Medawar |title=Pluto's Republic |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=228–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams then attempts a "gross simplification" of Medawar's evaluation:

{{quote|It was a compelling demonstration of how readily one can use physical and geometric principles in trying to understand biology. This was a major contribution in 1917 when vitalism was still being defended by prominent biologists. The battle was as won as it is ever likely to be by the time of the 1942 edition. The book was deficient because of Thompson's lack of understanding of evolution and antipathy for any concepts of historical causation."&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=George C. |title=On Growth and Form by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson; On Growth and Form by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson; John Tyler Bonner |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |date=June 1993 |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=267–268 |doi=10.1086/418080 |jstor=2830008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modern===

The [[architect]]s Philip Beesley and Sarah Bonnemaison write that Thompson's book at once became a classic "for its exploration of natural geometries in the dynamics of growth and physical processes."&lt;ref name=Beesley/&gt; They note the "extraordinary optimism" in the book, its vision of the world as "a symphony of harmonious forces",&lt;ref name=Beesley/&gt; and its huge range, including:

{{quote|the laws governing the dimension of organisms and their growth, the statics and dynamics at work in cells and tissues including the phenomena of geometrical packing, membranes under tension, symmetries, and cell division; as well as the engineering and geodesics of skeletons in simple organisms.&lt;ref name=Beesley/&gt;}}

Beesley and Bonnemaison observe that Thompson saw form "as a product of dynamic forces .. shaped by flows of energy and stages of growth."&lt;ref name=Beesley/&gt; They praise his "eloquent writing and exquisite illustrations"&lt;ref name=Beesley/&gt; which have provided inspiration for artists and architects as well as scientists.

[[Computer scientist |Computer-scientist]] and [[physicist]], [[Stephen Wolfram]], writes: 
{{quote |In Thompson's time - as still to a large extent today - the dominant form of explanation in biology was Darwinism: essentially the idea that things are the way they are because they've somehow evolved to be that way, in order to maximize some kind of fitness.&lt;ref name=Wolfram&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolfram |first=Stephen |title=Are All Fish the Same Shape if You Stretch Them? The Victorian Tale of On Growth and Form |url=https://www.wired.com/story/darcy-wentworth-thompson-on-growth-and-form/ |website = wired.com |accessdate = 2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote |Thompson's book is an important inspiration for the concept that even though biological forms may at first look complicated, there can still be theories and explanations for them.  In modern times, there's a crucial new idea that Thompson did not have; the idea of using not traditional mathematics and physics, but instead computation and simple programs as a way of describing the rules by which things grow.&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt; It's remarkable to what extent that idea lets us understand the mechanisms by which complex biological forms are produced, and lets us finish the bold initiative that Thompson began a century ago in ''On Growth and Form''.&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt;}}

The [[statistician]] [[Cosma Shalizi]] writes that the book "has haunted all discussion of these matters ever since."&lt;ref name=Shalizi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shalizi|first1=Cosma|title=Review: The Self-Made Tapestry by Philip Ball|url=http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/self-made-tapestry/|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shalizi states that Thompson's goal is to show that biology follows inevitably from physics, and to a degree also from chemistry. He argues that when Thompson says "the form of an object is a 'diagram of forces,'",&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; Thompson means that we can infer from an object the physical forces that act (or once acted) upon it. Shalizi calls Thompson's account of the physics of morphogenesis

{{quote|ingenious, extremely elegant, very convincing and, significantly, aimed at very large features of the organism: the architecture of the skeleton, the curve of horns or shells, the outline of the organism as a whole.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;}}

Shalizi notes Thompson's simplicity, explaining the processes of life "using little that a second-year physics undergrad wouldn't know. (Thompson's anti-reductionist admirers seldom put it this way.)".&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; He notes that Thompson deliberately avoided invoking natural selection as an explanation, and left history, whether of species or of an individual's life, out of his account. He quotes Thompson's "A snow-crystal is the same today as when the first snows fell": adding "so, too, the basic forces acting upon organisms",&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; and comments that we have forgotten other early twentieth century scientists who scorned evolution. In contrast, he argues,

{{quote|Thompson owes his continuing influence to the fact that his alternative doesn't beg questions at every turn. (Also, of course, he wrote beautifully, better than the poets of his day.)&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;}}

The [[anthropologist]] [[Barry Bogin]] writes that Thompson's book

{{quote|is a ''tour de force'' combining the classical approaches of natural philosophy and geometry with modern biology and mathematics to understand the growth, form, and evolution of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=Bogin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Barry|title=Patterns of Human Growth|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-56438-7|page=53|edition=2nd|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/64380/sample/9780521564380WS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bogin observes that Thompson originated the use of transformational grids to measure growth in two dimensions, but that without modern computers the method was tedious to apply and was not often used. Even so, the book stimulated and lent intellectual validity to the new field of growth and development research.&lt;ref name=Bogin/&gt;

Peter Coates recalls that

{{quote|[[Peter Medawar]] famously called ''On Growth and Form'' "beyond comparison the finest work of literature in all the annals of science that have been recorded in the English tongue."&lt;ref name=Coates&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coates |first1=Peter |title=An Elegant and Original Idea |url=http://thesecondpass.com/?p=7447 |website=The Second Pass |date=2 May 2011 | accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coates argues however that the book goes far beyond expressing knowledge elegantly and influentially, in a form "that can be read for pleasure by scientists and nonscientists";&lt;ref name=Coates/&gt; it is in his view

{{quote|one of the most peculiar and original works of modern science, advancing an idiosyncratic view of how organisms develop, a view that was deeply at odds with the intellectual climate of Thompson's time ... and a textbook on how to think in any field.&lt;ref name=Coates/&gt;}}

The science writer [[Philip Ball]] observes that

{{quote|Like Newton's ''Principia'', D’Arcy Thompson's ''On Growth and Form'' is a book more often cited than read."&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=Philip |title=In retrospect: On Growth and Form |journal=Nature |date=7 February 2013|volume=494 |pages=32–33 |doi=10.1038/494032a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v494/n7435/full/494032a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ball quotes the 2nd Edition's epigraph by the statistician [[Karl Pearson]]: "I believe the day must come when the biologist will—without being a mathematician—not hesitate to use mathematical analysis when he requires it." Ball argues that Thompson "presents mathematical principles as a shaping agency that may supersede natural selection, showing how the structures of the living world often echo those in inorganic nature", and notes his "frustration at the '[[Just So Stories|Just So]]' explanations of morphology offered by Darwinians." Instead, Ball argues, Thompson elaborates on how not heredity but physical forces govern biological form. Ball suggests that "The book's central motif is the logarithmic spiral", evidence in Thompson's eyes of the universality of form and the reduction of many phenomena to a few principles of mathematics.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

The [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Michael Ruse]] wrote that Thompson "had little time for natural selection."&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt; Instead, Thompson emphasised "the formal aspects of organisms", trying to make a case for [[self-organization]] through normal physical and chemical processes. Ruse notes that, following [[Aristotle]], Thompson used as an example the morphology of jellyfish, which he explained entirely mechanically with the physics of a heavy liquid falling through a lighter liquid, avoiding natural selection as an explanation. Ruse is not sure whether Thompson believed he was actually breaking with "mechanism", in other words adopting a [[vitalism|vitalist]] (ghost in the machine) view of the world. In Ruse's opinion, Thompson can be interpreted as arguing that "we can have completely mechanical explanations of the living world"&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt; – with the important proviso that Thompson apparently felt there was no need for natural selection. Ruse at once adds that "people like Darwin and [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] undoubtedly would disagree";&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt; they would insist that

{{quote|the adaptive complexity that we see in the living world simply cannot be explained by physics and chemistry. If D'Arcy Thompson thought otherwise, it can only be because in some way he was putting [[Orthogenesis|special direction]] into his physical models. He may not have been an explicit vitalist, but there is certainly the odor of spirit forces about what he claims.&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;}}

==Influence==

For his revised ''On Growth and Form'', Thompson was awarded the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=Elliot&gt;{{cite web | title=Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal | url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot | publisher=National Academy of Sciences | accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''On Growth and Form'' has inspired thinkers including the biologists [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Conrad Hal Waddington]], the mathematician [[Alan Turing]] and the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. The book has powerfully influenced architecture and has long been a set text on architecture courses.&lt;ref name=Beesley&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beesley |first1=Philip |last2=Bonnemaison |first2=Sarah |title=On Growth and Form: Organic Architecture and Beyond |url=http://www.philipbeesleyarchitect.com/publications/ogf/ogf_sample.pdf |publisher=Tuns Press and Riverside Architectural Press |date=2008 | isbn=978-0-929112-54-1 | pages=7 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''On Growth and Form'' has inspired artists including [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]],  [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], and [[Ben Nicholson]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |title=About D'Arcy |url=http://www.darcythompson.org/about.html |website=D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[University of Dundee]] was awarded a £100,000 grant by [[The Art Fund]] to build a collection of art inspired by his ideas and collections, much of which is displayed in the D'Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum in Dundee.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web | title=The D'Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum | url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/collections/zoology/ | publisher=[[University of Dundee]] | accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the centenary of ''On Growth and Form'' numerous events are being staged around the world, including New York, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Edinburgh, St Andrews and in [[Dundee]] where the book was written. The ''On Growth and Form 100'' website was set up in late 2016 to map all of this activity.&lt;ref name=Website&gt;{{cit web | title="On Growth and Foerm 100 | url=https://www.ongrowthandform.org/ | publisher=[[University of Dundee]] | accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">[[File:Perles configuration.svg|thumb|The Perles configuration]]
In geometry, the '''Perles configuration''' is a configuration of 9 points and 9 lines that can be realized in the [[Euclidean plane]] but for which every realization has at least one [[irrational number]] as one of its coordinates. It is not a [[projective configuration]], however, because its points and lines do not all have the same number of incidences as each other. It was introduced by [[Micha Perles]] in the 1960s.

==Construction from a regular pentagon==
One way of constructing the Perles configuration is to start with a regular [[pentagon]] and its five diagonals, which form the sides of a smaller regular pentagon within the initial one. The nine points of the configuration consist of four out of the five vertices of each pentagon and the shared center of the two pentagons; the two missing pentagon vertices are chosen to be collinear with the center. The nine lines of the configuration consist of the five lines that are diagonals of the outer pentagon and sides of the inner pentagon, and the four lines that pass through the center and through corresponding pairs of vertices from the two pentagons.

==Projective invariance==
Every realization of this configuration in the real [[projective plane]] is equivalent, under a [[projective transformation]], to a realization constructed in this way from a regular pentagon. Therefore, in every realization, there are four points having the same [[cross-ratio]] as the cross-ratio of the four collinear points in the realization derived from the regular pentagon. But, these four points have &lt;math&gt;1+\varphi&lt;/math&gt; as their cross-ratio, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]], an irrational number. Every four collinear points with rational coordinates have a rational cross ratio, so the Perles configuration cannot be realized by rational points. [[Branko Grünbaum]] has conjectured that every configuration that can be realized by irrational but not rational numbers has at least nine points; if so, the Perles configuration would be the smallest possible irrational configuration of points and lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in polyhedral combinatorics==
Perles used his configuration to construct an eight-dimensional [[convex polytope]] with twelve vertices that can similarly be realized with real coordinates but not with rational coordinates. [[Ernst Steinitz]]'s proof of [[Steinitz's theorem]] can be used to show that every three-dimensional polytope can be realized with rational coordinates, but it is now known that there exist irrational polytopes in four dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2003}}, p. 96a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poincaré spaces are used in [[surgery theory]] to analyze and classify manifolds. Not every Poincaré space is a manifold, but the difference can be studied, first by having a [[Normal invariant|normal map]] from a manifold, and then via [[obstruction theory]].

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
The '''pointwise product''' of two [[function (mathematics)|function]]s is another function, obtained by multiplying the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the two functions at each value in the domain. If ''f'' and ''g'' are both functions with [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''X'' and [[codomain]] ''Y'', and elements of ''Y'' can be multiplied (for instance, ''Y'' could be some set of numbers), then the pointwise product of ''f'' and ''g'' is another function from ''X'' to ''Y'' which maps ''x'' ∈ ''X'' to ''f''(''x'')''g''(''x'').

==Formal definition==
Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[set (mathematics)|set]]s, and let [[multiplication]] be defined in ''Y''&amp;mdash;that is, for each ''y'' and ''z'' in ''Y'' let the [[Product (mathematics)|product]]
: &lt;math&gt;\cdot : Y \times Y \longrightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;y \cdot z = yz&lt;/math&gt;
be well-defined. Let ''f'' and ''g'' be [[function (mathematics)|function]]s {{nowrap|''f'', ''g'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}. Then the '''pointwise product''' {{nowrap|(''f'' ⋅ ''g'') : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;(f \cdot g)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for each ''x'' in ''X''. In the same manner in which the [[binary operator]] ⋅ is omitted from products, we say that {{nowrap|1=''f'' ⋅ ''g'' = ''fg''}}.

==Examples==
The most common case of the pointwise product of two functions is when the [[codomain]] is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (or [[field (mathematics)|field]]), in which multiplication is well-defined. 

{{unordered list
| If ''Y'' is the set of [[real number]]s '''R''', then the pointwise product of ''f'', ''g'' : ''X'' → '''R''' is just normal multiplication of the images. For example, if we have ''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x'' and ''g''(''x'') {{=}} ''x'' + 1 then
: &lt;math&gt;(fg)(x) = f(x)g(x) = 2x(x + 1) = 2x^2 + 2x\,&lt;/math&gt;

for every real number ''x'' in '''R'''.
| The [[convolution theorem]] states that the Fourier transform of a convolution is the pointwise product of Fourier transforms:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{f*g\} = \mathcal{F}\{f\} \cdot \mathcal{F}\{g\}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

==Algebraic application of pointwise products==
Let ''X'' be a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and let ''R'' be a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Since [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] are defined in ''R'', we can construct an algebraic structure known as an [[K-algebra|algebra]]  out of the functions from ''X'' to ''R'' by defining addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication of functions to be done pointwise. 

If ''R''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the set of functions from ''X'' to ''R'', then we say that if ''f'', ''g'' are elements of ''R''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''f'' + ''g'', ''fg'', and ''rf'', the last of which is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;(rf)(x) = rf(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''r'' in ''R'', are all elements of ''R''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Generalization==
If both ''f'' and ''g'' have as their domain all possible assignments of a set of discrete variables, then their pointwise product is a function whose domain is constructed by all possible assignments of the [[union (set theory)|union]] of both sets. The value of each assignment is calculated as the product of the values of both functions given to each one the subset of the assignment that is in its domain.

For example, given the function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;() for the boolean variables ''p'' and ''q'', and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;() for the boolean variables ''q'' and ''r'', both with the [[range (mathematics)|range]] in '''R''', the pointwise product of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;() and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;() is shown in the next table:

{{Pi box}}
In the 1760's, [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] proved that the number [[pi|{{pi}}]] (pi) is [[irrational number|irrational]]: that is, it cannot be expressed as a fraction ''a''/''b'', where ''a'' is an [[integer]] and ''b'' is a non-zero integer. In the 19th century, [[Charles Hermite]] found a proof that requires no prerequisite knowledge beyond basic [[calculus]]. Three simplifications of Hermite's proof are due to [[Mary Cartwright]], [[Ivan Niven]], and [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]. Another proof, which is a simplification of Lambert's proof, is due to [[Miklós Laczkovich]].

In 1882, [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] proved that {{pi}} is not just irrational, but [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem#Transcendence of e and π|transcendental as well]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-last = Berggren|editor1-first = Lennart|editor2-last = Borwein|editor2-first = Jonathan M.|editor2-link = Jonathan M.

== Lambert's proof ==
[[File:LambertContinuedFraction.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Scan of formula on page 288 of Lambert's "Mémoires sur quelques propriétés remarquables des quantités transcendantes, circulaires et logarithmiques", Mémoires de l'Académie royale des sciences de Berlin (1768), 265&amp;ndash;322.]]
In 1761, Lambert proved that {{pi}} is irrational by first showing that this [[continued fraction]] expansion holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(x) = \cfrac{x}{1 - \cfrac{x^2}{3 - \cfrac{x^2}{5 - \cfrac{x^2}{7 - {}\ddots}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then Lambert proved that if ''x'' is non-zero and rational then this expression must be irrational. Since tan({{pi}}/4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, it follows that {{pi}}/4 is irrational and therefore that {{pi}} is irrational.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-last = Berggren|editor1-first = Lennart|editor2-last = Borwein|editor2-first = Jonathan M.|editor2-link = Jonathan M.

== Hermite's proof ==
This proof uses the characterization of {{pi}} as the smallest positive number whose half is a [[zero of a function|zero]] of the [[Trigonometric functions#Sine, cosine, and tangent|cosine]] function and it actually proves that {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is irrational.&lt;ref name="Hermite"&gt;{{citation|last = Hermite|first = Charles|author-link = Charles Hermite|year = 1873|title = Extrait d'une lettre de Monsieur Ch.

Consider the sequences (''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0&lt;/sub&gt; and (''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0&lt;/sub&gt; of functions from '''R''' into '''R''' thus defined:

U_0(x) &amp;= \frac{\sin(x)}x, &amp;&amp; U_{n+1}(x) =-\frac{U_n'(x)}x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using induction we can prove that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A_n(x) &amp;=\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!!}-\frac{x^{2n+3}}{2\times(2n+3)!!}+\frac{x^{2n+5}}{2\times4\times(2n+5)!!}\mp\cdots \\[4pt]
U_n(x) &amp;=\frac1{(2n+1)!!}-\frac{x^2}{2\times(2n+3)!!}+\frac{x^4}{2\times4\times(2n+5)!!}\mp\cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore we have:

:&lt;math&gt;U_n(x)=\frac{A_n(x)}{x^{2n+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{A_{n+1}(x)}{x^{2n+3}} &amp; =U_{n+1}(x)=-\frac{U_n'(x)}x=-\frac1x\frac d{dx}\left(\frac{A_n(x)}{x^{2n+1}}\right) \\[6pt]
&amp; = -\frac{1}{x} \left( \frac{A_n'(x) \cdot x^{2n+1} - (2n+1) x^{2n} A_n(x)}{x^{2(2n+1)}} \right ) = \frac{(2n+1)A_n(x)-xA_n'(x)}{x^{2n+3}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}(x)=(2n+1)A_n(x)-x^2A_{n-1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of the sequence and employing induction we can show that 

:&lt;math&gt;A_n(x) = P_n(x^2) \sin(x) + x Q_n(x^2) \cos(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are polynomial functions with integer coefficients and the degree of ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is smaller than or equal to ⌊''n''/2⌋. In particular, ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''({{pi}}/2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''({{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4).

Hermite also gave a closed expression for the function ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', namely

:&lt;math&gt;A_n(x)=\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2^nn!}\int_0^1(1-z^2)^n\cos(xz)\,dz.&lt;/math&gt;

He did not justify this assertion, but it can be proved easily. First of all, this assertion is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2^nn!}\int_0^1(1-z^2)^n\cos(xz)\,dz=\frac{A_n(x)}{x^{2n+1}}=U_n(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Proceeding by induction, take&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1\cos(xz)\,dz=\frac{\sin(x)}x=U_0(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and, for the inductive step, consider any ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;. If

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2^nn!}\int_0^1(1-z^2)^n\cos(xz)\,dz=U_n(x),&lt;/math&gt;

then, using [[integration by parts]] and [[Leibniz integral rule|Leibniz's rule]], one gets

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2^{n+1}(n+1)!} &amp;\int_0^1(1-z^2)^{n+1}\cos(xz)\,dz \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2^{n+1}(n+1)!}\left (\overbrace{\left.(1-z^2)^{n+1}\frac{\sin(xz)}x\right|_{z=0}^{z=1}}^{=0} + \int_0^12(n+1)(1-z^2)^nz \frac{\sin(xz)}x\,dz\right )\\[8pt]
&amp;= \frac1x\cdot\frac1{2^nn!}\int_0^1(1-z^2)^nz\sin(xz)\,dz\\[8pt]
&amp;= -\frac1x\cdot\frac d{dx}\left(\frac1{2^nn!}\int_0^1(1-z^2)^n\cos(xz)\,dz\right) \\[8pt]
&amp;= -\frac{U_n'(x)}x \\[4pt]
&amp;= U_{n+1}(x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''/''q'', with ''p'' and ''q'' in '''N''', then, since the coefficients of ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are integers and its degree is smaller than or equal to ⌊''n''/2⌋, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;⌊''n''/2⌋&lt;/sup&gt;''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''({{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4) is some integer ''N''. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;N=q^{\left\lfloor\frac n2\right\rfloor}A_n\left(\frac\pi2\right) =q^{\left\lfloor\frac n2\right\rfloor}\frac{\left(\frac pq\right)^{n+\frac 12}}{2^nn!}\int_0^1(1-z^2)^n \cos \left(\frac\pi2z \right)\,dz.&lt;/math&gt;

But this number is clearly greater than 0. On the other hand, the limit of this quantity as n goes to infinity is zero, and so, if ''n'' is large enough, ''N''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. Thereby, a contradiction is reached.

Hermite did not present his proof as an end in itself but as an afterthought within his search for a proof of the transcendence of {{pi}}. He discussed the recurrence relations to motivate and to obtain a convenient integral representation. Once this integral representation is obtained, there are various ways to present a succinct and self-contained proof starting from the integral (as in Cartwright's, Bourbaki's or Niven's presentations), which Hermite could easily see (as he did in his proof of the transcendence of ''e''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Hermite|first = Charles|author-link = Charles Hermite|editor-last = Picard|editor-first = Émile|editor-link=Charles Émile Picard|title = Œuvres de Charles Hermite|volume = III|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|year = 1912|language = french| pages = 150–181|contribution = Sur la fonction exponentielle|url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=umhistmath;cc=umhistmath;rgn=full%20text;idno=AAS7821.0003.001;didno=AAS7821.0003.001;view=pdf;seq=00000161|origyear=1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Moreover, Hermite's proof is closer to Lambert's proof than it seems. In fact, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the "residue" (or "remainder") of Lambert's continued fraction for tan(''x'').&lt;ref name="Zhou"&gt;{{citation|last = Zhou|first = Li|title = Irrationality proofs à la Hermite|periodical = Math.

== Cartwright's proof ==

[[Harold Jeffreys]] wrote that this proof was set as an example in an exam at [[Cambridge University]] in 1945 by [[Mary Cartwright]], but that she had not traced its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Jeffreys|first = Harold|author-link = Harold Jeffreys|title = Scientific Inference|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1973|page =268|edition = 3rd|isbn = 0-521-08446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the integrals

:&lt;math&gt;I_n(x)=\int_{-1}^1(1 - z^2)^n\cos(xz)\,dz, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is a non-negative integer.

Two [[integration by parts|integrations by parts]] give the [[recurrence relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x^2I_n(x)=2n(2n-1)I_{n-1}(x)-4n(n-1)I_{n-2}(x). \qquad (n \geq 2)&lt;/math&gt;

If

:&lt;math&gt;J_n(x)=x^{2n+1}I_n(x),&lt;/math&gt;

then this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;J_n(x)=2n(2n-1)J_{n-1}(x)-4n(n-1)x^2J_{n-2}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2sin(''x'') and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−4''x''&amp;nbsp;cos(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4sin(''x''). Hence for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;J_n(x)=x^{2n+1}I_n(x)=n!\bigl(P_n(x)\sin(x)+Q_n(x)\cos(x)\bigr),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') and ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') are [[polynomial]]s of degree ≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', and with [[integer]] coefficients (depending on ''n'').

Take ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}/2, and suppose if possible that {{pi}}/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''/''b'', where ''a'' and ''b'' are natural numbers (i.e., assume that {{pi}} is rational). Then

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{a^{2n+1}}{n!}I_n\left(\frac\pi2\right) = P_n\left(\frac\pi2\right)b^{2n+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

The right side is an integer. But 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}/2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 since the interval [&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;1] has length&amp;nbsp;2 and the function that is being integrated takes only values between&amp;nbsp;0 and&amp;nbsp;1. On the other hand,

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{a^{2n+1}}{n!} \to 0 \quad \text{ as }n \to \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, for sufficiently large ''n''

: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \frac{a^{2n+1}I_n\left(\frac\pi2\right)}{n!} &lt; 1, &lt;/math&gt;

that is, we could find an integer between 0 and 1. That is the contradiction that follows from the assumption that {{pi}} is rational.

This proof is similar to Hermite's proof. Indeed,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
J_n(x)&amp;=x^{2n+1}\int_{-1}^1 (1 - z^2)^n \cos(xz)\,dz\\[5pt]
 &amp;=2x^{2n+1}\int_0^1 (1 - z^2)^n \cos(xz)\,dz\\[5pt]
 &amp;=2^{n+1}n!A_n(x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, it is clearly simpler. This is achieved by omitting the inductive definition of the functions ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and taking as a starting point their expression as an integral.

== Niven's proof ==
This proof uses the characterization of {{pi}} as the smallest positive [[zero of a function|zero]] of the [[sine]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Niven|first = Ivan|author-link = Ivan Niven|year = 1947|title = A simple proof that {{pi}} is irrational|periodical = [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume = 53|issue = 6|page = 509|url = http://www.ams.org/bull/1947-53-06/S0002-9904-1947-08821-2/S0002-9904-1947-08821-2.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1947-08821-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose that {{pi}} is rational, i.e. {{nowrap|{{pi}} {{=}} ''a''&amp;thinsp;/''b''}} for some integers ''a'' and {{nowrap|''b'' ≠ 0}}, which may be taken [[without loss of generality]] to be positive. Given any positive integer ''n'', we define the polynomial function:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{x^n(a - bx)^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;

and, for each ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;ℝ let

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = f(x)-f''(x)+f^{(4)}(x)+\cdots+(-1)^n f^{(2n)}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Claim 1:''' {{nowrap|''F''(0) + ''F''({{pi}})}} is an integer.

'''Proof:'''
Expanding ''f'' as a sum of monomials, the coefficient of ''x&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a number of the form {{nowrap|''c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;/''n''!}} where ''c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an integer, which is&amp;nbsp;0 if {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; ''n''}}. Therefore, {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;(0)}} is&amp;nbsp;0 when {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; ''n''}} and it is equal to {{nowrap|(''k''!&amp;thinsp;/''n''!)&amp;thinsp;''c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} if {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ ''k'' ≤ 2''n''}}; in each case, {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;(0)}} is an integer and therefore ''F''(0) is an integer.

On the other hand, {{nowrap|''f''({{pi}} – ''x'')}} = ''f''(''x'') and so {{nowrap|(–1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;({{pi}} – ''x'')}} = {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} for each non-negative integer&amp;nbsp;''k''. In particular, {{nowrap|(–1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;({{pi}})}} = {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;(0).}} Therefore, {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;({{pi}})}} is also an integer and so ''F''({{pi}}) is an integer (in fact, it is easy to see that ''F''({{pi}})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''(0), but that is not relevant to the proof). Since ''F''(0) and ''F''({{pi}}) are integers, so is their sum.

'''Claim 2:'''

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(x)\,dx=F(0)+F(\pi)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' Since {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(2''n''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;2)&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the zero polynomial, we have

:&lt;math&gt; F'' + F = f.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Table of derivatives#Derivatives of trigonometric functions|derivatives]] of the [[sine]] and [[cosine]] function are given by sin'&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos and cos'&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;sin. Hence the [[product rule]] implies

:&lt;math&gt; (F'\cdot\sin - F\cdot\cos)' = f\cdot\sin&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]

: &lt;math&gt; \left. \int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(x)\,dx= \bigl(F'(x)\sin x - F(x)\cos x\bigr) \right|_0^\pi. &lt;/math&gt;

Since {{nowrap|sin 0 {{=}} sin {{pi}} {{=}} 0}} and {{nowrap|cos 0 {{=}} –&amp;thinsp;cos {{pi}} {{=}} 1}} (here we use the above-mentioned characterization of {{pi}} as a zero of the sine function), Claim&amp;nbsp;2 follows.

'''Conclusion:''' Since {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') &gt; 0}} and {{nowrap|sin ''x'' &gt; 0}} for {{nowrap|0 &lt; ''x'' &lt; {{pi}}}} (because {{pi}} is the ''smallest'' positive zero of the sine function), Claims&amp;nbsp;1 and 2 show that {{nowrap|''F''(0) + ''F''({{pi}})}} is a ''positive'' integer. Since {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''x''(''a'' – ''bx'') ≤ {{pi}}''a''}} and {{nowrap|0 ≤ sin ''x'' ≤ 1}} for {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ {{pi}}}}, we have, by the original definition of&amp;nbsp;''f'',

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(x)\,dx\le\pi\frac{(\pi a)^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;

which is smaller than 1 for large&amp;nbsp;''n'', hence {{nowrap|''F''(0) + ''F''({{pi}}) &lt; 1}} for these ''n'', by Claim&amp;nbsp;2. This is impossible for the positive integer {{nowrap|''F''(0) + ''F''({{pi}})}}.

The above proof is a polished version, which is kept as simple as possible concerning the prerequisites, of an analysis of the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(x)\,dx = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j \left (f^{(2j)}(\pi)+f^{(2j)}(0)\right )+(-1)^{n+1}\int_0^\pi f^{(2n+2)}(x)\sin(x)\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;

which is obtained by {{nowrap|2''n'' + 2}} [[integration by parts|integrations by parts]]. Claim&amp;nbsp;2 essentially establishes this formula, where the use of ''F'' hides the iterated integration by parts. The last integral vanishes because {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(2''n''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;2)&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the zero polynomial. Claim&amp;nbsp;1 shows that the remaining sum is an integer.

Niven's proof is closer to Cartwright's (and therefore Hermite's) proof than it appears at first sight.&lt;ref name="Zhou"/&gt; In fact,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
J_n(x)&amp;=x^{2n+1}\int_{-1}^1(1-z^2)^n\cos(xz)\,dz\\
&amp;=\int_{-1}^1\left (x^2-(xz)^2\right )^nx\cos(xz)\,dz.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the [[Integration by substitution|substitution]] ''xz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y'' turns this integral into 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-x}^x(x^2-y^2)^n\cos(y)\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
J_n\left(\frac\pi2\right)&amp;=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\left(\frac{\pi^2}4-y^2\right)^n\cos(y)\,dy\\[5pt]
&amp;=\int_0^\pi\left(\frac{\pi^2}4-\left(y-\frac\pi2\right)^2\right)^n\cos\left(y-\frac\pi2\right)\,dy\\[5pt]
&amp;=\int_0^\pi y^n(\pi-y)^n\sin(y)\,dy\\[5pt]
&amp;=\frac{n!}{b^n}\int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(x)\,dx.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Another connection between the proofs lies in the fact that Hermite already mentions&lt;ref name="Hermite"/&gt; that if ''f'' is a polynomial function and

:&lt;math&gt;F=f-f^{(2)}+f^{(4)}\mp\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\sin(x)\,dx=F'(x)\sin(x)-F(x)\cos(x)+C,&lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(x)\,dx=F(\pi)+F(0).&lt;/math&gt;

== Bourbaki's proof ==
[[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]'s proof is outlined as an exercise in his [[calculus]] treatise.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Bourbaki|first = Nicolas|authorlink = Nicolas Bourbaki|year=1949|title=Fonctions d'une variable réelle, chap. I–II–III|series = Actualités Scientifiques et Industrielles|volume = 1074|publisher = [[Éditions Hermann|Hermann]]|language = french|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each natural number ''b'' and each non-negative integer ''n'', define

:&lt;math&gt;A_n(b)=b^n\int_0^\pi\frac{x^n(\pi-x)^n}{n!}\sin(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''b'') is the integral of a function which defined on [0,{{pi}}] that takes the value&amp;nbsp;0 on 0 and on {{pi}} and which is greater than&amp;nbsp;0 otherwise, ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''b'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. Besides, for each natural number ''b'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''b'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 if ''n'' is large enough, because

: &lt;math&gt; x(\pi-x) \le \left(\frac\pi2\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;A_n(b)\le\pi b^n \frac{1}{n!} \left(\frac\pi2\right)^{2n} = \pi \frac{(b\pi^2/4)^n}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, [[Integration by parts#Recursive integration by parts|recursive integration by parts]] allows us to deduce that, if ''a'' and ''b'' are natural number such that {{pi}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''/''b'' and ''f'' is the polynomial function from [0,{{pi}}] into '''R''' defined by

: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x^n(a-bx)^n}{n!},&lt;/math&gt;

then:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A_n(b) &amp;= \int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(x)\,dx \\[5pt]
 &amp;= \Big[-f(x)\cos(x)\Big]_{x=0}^{x=\pi}-\Big[-f'(x) \sin(x) \Big]_{x=0}^{x=\pi} + \cdots \pm \Big[ f^{(2n)}(x) \cos(x) \Big]_{x=0}^{x=\pi} \pm \int_0^\pi f^{(2n+1)}(x)\cos(x)\,dx.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This last integral is 0, since ''f''&lt;sup&gt;(2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/sup&gt; is the null function (because ''f'' is a polynomial function of degree&amp;nbsp;2''n''). Since each function ''f''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt; (with {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''k'' ≤ 2''n''}}) takes integer values on 0 and on {{pi}} and since the same thing happens with the sine and the cosine functions, this proves that ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''b'') is an integer. Since it is also greater than&amp;nbsp;0, it must be a natural number. But it was also proved that ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''b'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 if ''n'' is large enough, thereby reaching a [[Proof by contradiction|contradiction]].

This proof is quite close to Niven's proof, the main difference between them being the way of proving that the numbers ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''b'') are integers.

== Laczkovich's proof ==
[[Miklós Laczkovich]]'s proof is a simplification of Lambert's original proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Laczkovich|first = Miklós| authorlink = Miklós Laczkovich|year = 1997|title = On Lambert's proof of the irrationality of {{pi}}|periodical = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume = 104|issue = 5|pages = 439–443|jstor = 2974737|doi=10.2307/2974737}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers the functions

:&lt;math&gt;f_k(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}k+\frac{x^4}{2! k(k+1)}-\frac{x^6}{3! k(k+1)(k+2)} + \cdots \quad (k\notin\{0,-1,-2,\ldots\}).&lt;/math&gt;

These functions are clearly defined for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''. Besides

:&lt;math&gt;f_{\frac{1}{2}}(x) = \cos(2x),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_{\frac{3}{2}}(x) = \frac{\sin(2x)}{2x}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Claim 1:''' The following [[recurrence relation]] holds:

In order to see why, take ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 if ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; otherwise, choose integers ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')/''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''/''a'' and define ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')/''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')/''b''. In each case, ''y'' cannot be 0, because otherwise it would follow from claim 1 that each ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') (''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N''') would be&amp;nbsp;0, which would contradict claim 2. Now, take a natural number ''c'' such that all three numbers ''bc''/''k'', ''ck''/''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c''/''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are integers and consider the sequence

:&lt;math&gt;g_n=\begin{cases}f_k(x) &amp; n=0\\ \dfrac{c^n}{k(k+1)\cdots(k+n-1)}f_{k+n}(x) &amp; n \neq 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;g_0=f_k(x)=ay\in\Z y \quad \text{ and } \quad g_1=\frac ckf_{k+1}(x)=\frac{bc}ky\in\Z y.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, it follows from claim 1 that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g_{n+2}&amp;=\frac{c^{n+2}}{x^2k(k+1)\cdots(k+n-1)}\cdot\frac{x^2}{(k+n)(k+n+1)}f_{k+n+2}(x)\\[5pt]
&amp; =\frac{c^{n+2}}{x^2k(k+1)\cdots(k+n-1)}f_{k+n+1}(x)-\frac{c^{n+2}}{x^2k(k+1)\cdots(k+n-1)}f_{k+n}(x)\\[5pt]
&amp;=\frac{c(k+n)}{x^2}g_{n+1}-\frac{c^2}{x^2}g_n\\[5pt]
&amp;=\left(\frac{ck}{x^2}+\frac c{x^2}n\right)g_{n+1}-\frac{c^2}{x^2}g_n,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which is a linear combination of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with integer coefficients. Therefore, each ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an integer multiple of ''y''. Besides, it follows from claim 2 that each ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is greater than&amp;nbsp;0 (and therefore that ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;|''y''|) if ''n'' is large enough and that the sequence of all ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to 0. But a sequence of numbers greater than or equal to |''y''| cannot converge to 0.

Since ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}/4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos({{pi}}/2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, it follows from claim 3 that {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/16 is irrational and therefore that {{pi}} is irrational.

On the other hand, since

:&lt;math&gt;\tan x=\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}=x\frac{f_{3/2}(x/2)}{f_{1/2}(x/2)},&lt;/math&gt;

another consequence of Claim 3 is that, if ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Q'''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{0}, then tan&amp;nbsp;''x'' is irrational.

Laczkovich's proof is really about the [[hypergeometric function]]. In fact, ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(k;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] found a continued fraction expansion of the hypergeometric function using its [[functional equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Gauss | first = Carl Friedrich | authorlink = Carl Friedrich Gauss | title = Disquisitiones generales circa seriem infinitam | journal = Commentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingensis recentiores | volume = 2 | year = 1811–1813 | language = latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Laczkovich to find a new and simpler proof of the fact that the tangent function has the continued fraction expansion that Lambert had discovered.

Laczkovich's result can also be expressed in [[Bessel function#Bessel functions of the first kind : J.CE.B1|Bessel functions of the first kind ''J''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')]]. In fact, [[Gamma function|Γ]](''k'')''J''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(2''x'')&amp;nbsp;= ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''). So Laczkovich's result is equivalent to: If ''x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 and if ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is rational, then

:&lt;math&gt;\forall k\in\Q\smallsetminus\{0,-1,-2,\ldots\}: \qquad \frac{x J_k(x)}{J_{k-1}(x)}\notin\Q.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], '''quasiperiodic motion''' is in rough terms the type of motion executed by a [[dynamical system]] containing a finite number (two or more) of [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] frequencies.

That is, if we imagine that the [[phase space]] is modelled by a [[torus]] ''T'' (that is, the variables are periodic like angles), the trajectory of the system is modelled by a [[curve]] on ''T'' that wraps around the torus without ever exactly coming back on itself.

A '''quasiperiodic function''' on the [[real line]] is the type of function (continuous, say) obtained from a function on ''T'', by means of a curve

:''R'' &amp;rarr; ''T''

which is linear (when lifted from ''T'' to its covering [[Euclidean space]]), by composition. It is therefore oscillating, with a finite number of underlying frequencies. (NB the sense in which [[theta function]]s and the [[Weierstrass zeta function]] in [[complex analysis]] are said to have [[quasi-period]]s with respect to a [[period lattice]] is something distinct from this.)

The theory of [[almost periodic function]]s is, roughly speaking, for the same situation but allowing ''T'' to be a torus with an infinite number of dimensions.

[[File:Superdense coding.png|right|frame|When the sender and receiver share a Bell state, two classical bits can be packed into one qubit. See the section below "The protocol" for more details regarding this picture.]]

In [[quantum information theory]], '''superdense coding''' is a [[quantum communication]] protocol to transmit two classical bits of information (i.e., either 00, 01, 10 or 11) from a sender (often called Alice) to a receiver (often called Bob), by sending only one [[qubit]] from Alice to Bob, under the assumption of Alice and Bob pre-sharing an entangled state.&lt;ref name="bennett1992communication"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=C.|last2=Wiesner|first2=S.|year=1992|title=Communication via one- and two-particle operators on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=69|issue=20|pages=2881|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.2881|pmid=10046665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NielsenChuang2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s4DEy7o-a0C|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition|last1=Nielsen|first1=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|date=9 December 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49548-6|page=97|section=2.3 Application: superdense coding}}&lt;/ref&gt; By performing one of four [[quantum gate]] operations on the (entangled) qubit she possesses, Alice can prearrange the measurement Bob makes. After receiving Alice's qubit, operating on the pair and measuring both, Bob has two classical bits of information. If Alice and Bob do not already share entanglement before the protocol begins, then it is impossible to send two classical bits using 1 qubit, as this would violate [[Holevo's theorem]].

Superdense coding is a the underlying principle of secure quantum secret coding. The necessity of having both qubits to decode the information being sent eliminates the risk of eavesdroppers intercepting messages.&lt;ref name="Wang2005"&gt;{{Wang, C., Deng, F.-G., Li, Y.-S., Liu, X.-S., &amp; Long, G. L. (2005). Quantum secure direct communication with high-dimension quantum superdense coding. Physical Review A, 71(4).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be thought of as the opposite of [[quantum teleportation]], in which one transfers one qubit from Alice to Bob by communicating two classical bits, as long as Alice and Bob have a pre-shared Bell pair.&lt;ref name="Wilde2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T36v2Sp7DnIC&amp;pg=PA181|title=Quantum Information Theory|last=Wilde|first=Mark|date=18 April 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03425-9|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Suppose Alice wants to send two classical bits of information (00, 01, 10, or 11) to Bob using [[Qubit|qubits]] (instead of classical [[Bit|bits]]). To do this, an entangled state (e.g. a Bell state) is prepared using a Bell circuit or gate by Charlie, a third person. Charlie then sends one of these qubits (in the Bell state) to Alice and the other to Bob. Once Alice obtains her qubit in the entangled state, she applies a certain quantum gate to her qubit depending on which two-bit message (00, 01, 10 or 11) she wants to send to Bob. Her entangled qubit is then sent to Bob who, after applying the appropriate quantum gate and making a [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]], can retrieve the classical two-bit message. Alice must tell Bob which gate to apply after he receives the entangled qubit in order to obtain the correct classical bits.

== The protocol ==

The protocol can be split into five different steps: preparation, sharing, encoding, sending, and decoding. 

=== Preparation === 

The protocol starts with the preparation of an entangled state, which is later shared between Alice and Bob. Suppose the following [[Bell state]]

:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\otimes &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[tensor product]], is prepared. Note: we can omit the tensor product symbol &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;and write the Bell state as

:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_A0_B\rangle + |1_A1_B\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Sharing ===

After the preparation of the Bell state &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the qubit denoted by subscript ''A'' is sent to Alice and the qubit denoted by subscript ''B'' is sent to Bob (note: this is the reason these states have subscripts). At this point, Alice and Bob may be in completely different locations (which might be very distant from each other).

There may be a long period of time between the preparation and sharing of the entangled state &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the rest of the steps in the procedure.

=== Encoding ===

By applying a [[Quantum logic gate|quantum gate]] to her qubit locally, Alice can transform the entangled state &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; into any of the four [[Bell states]] (including, of course, &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;). Note that this process cannot "break" the entanglement between the two qubits.

Let's now describe which operations Alice needs to perform on her entangled qubit, depending on which classical two-bit message she wants to send to Bob. We'll later see why these specific operations are performed. There are four cases, which correspond to the four possible two-bit strings that Alice may want to send.

1. If Alice wants to send the classical two-bit string 00 to Bob, then she applies the identity quantum gate, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, to her qubit, so that it remains unchanged. The resultant entangled state is then

: &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle := |B_{00}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_A0_B\rangle + |1_A1_B\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;
 
In other words, the entangled state shared between Alice and Bob has not changed, i.e. it is still &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The notation &lt;math&gt;|B_{00}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is also used to remind us of the fact that Alice wants to send the two-bit string 00.

2. If Alice wants to send the classical two-bit string 01 to Bob, then she applies the [[Quantum logic gate|quantum ''NOT'' (or ''bit-flip'') gate]], &lt;math&gt;X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;, to her qubit, so that the resultant entangled quantum state becomes

: &lt;math&gt; |\Psi ^{+}\rangle := |B_{01}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1_A0_B\rangle + |0_A1_B\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

3. If Alice wants to send the classical two-bit string 10 to Bob, then she applies the [[Quantum logic gate|quantum ''phase-flip'' gate]] &lt;math&gt;Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; to her qubit, so the resultant entangled state becomes

: &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{-}\rangle := |B_{10}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_A0_B\rangle - |1_A1_B\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

4. If, instead, Alice wants to send the classical two-bit string 11 to Bob, then she applies the quantum gate &lt;math&gt;Z*X&lt;/math&gt; to her qubit, so that the resultant entangled state becomes

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi ^{-}\rangle := |B_{11}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_A1_B\rangle -|1_A0_B\rangle ) &lt;/math&gt;

The matrices &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are two of the [[Pauli matrices]]. The quantum states &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{+}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|\Psi ^{+}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|\Phi ^{-}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\Psi ^{-}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (or, respectively, &lt;math&gt;B_{00}, B_{01}, B_{10}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{11}&lt;/math&gt;) are the [[Bell states]].

=== Sending === 

After having performed one of the operations described above, Alice can send her entangled qubit to Bob using a [[quantum network]] through some conventional physical medium.

=== Decoding === 

In order for Bob to find out which classical bits Alice sent he will perform the [[Controlled NOT gate|CNOT]] unitary operation, with A as control qubit and B as target qubit. Then, he will perform &lt;math&gt;H\otimes I&lt;/math&gt; unitary operation on the entangled qubit A. In other words, the Hadamard quantum gate H is only applied to A (see the figure above).

* If the resultant entangled state was &lt;math&gt;B_{00}&lt;/math&gt; then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled state will become &lt;math&gt;|00\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
* If the resultant entangled state was &lt;math&gt;B_{01}&lt;/math&gt; then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled state will become &lt;math&gt;|01\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
* If the resultant entangled state was &lt;math&gt;B_{10}&lt;/math&gt; then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled state will become &lt;math&gt;|10\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
* If the resultant entangled state was &lt;math&gt;B_{11}&lt;/math&gt; then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled state will become &lt;math&gt;|11\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

These operations performed by Bob can be seen as a measurement which projects the entangled state onto one of the four two-qubit basis vectors &lt;math&gt;|00 \rangle, |01 \rangle, |10 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|11 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; (as you can see from the outcomes and the example below).

==== Example ==== 

For example, if the resultant entangled state (after the operations performed by Alice) was &lt;math&gt;|\Psi ^{+}\rangle := B_{01} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1_A0_B\rangle + |0_A1_B\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;, then a CNOT with A as control bit and B as target bit will change &lt;math&gt;B_{01}&lt;/math&gt; to become &lt;math&gt;B_{01}' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1_A1_B\rangle + |0_A1_B\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, the Hadamard gate is applied only to A, to obtain

&lt;math&gt;B_{01}'' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left({\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0 \rangle - |1 \rangle) \right) }_A \otimes
 |1_B\rangle + {\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle) \right) }_A \otimes
|1_B\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity, let's get rid of the subscripts, so we have

&lt;math&gt;B_{01}'' = 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\left(
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0 \rangle - |1 \rangle) \otimes |1\rangle + 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle)  \otimes |1\rangle 
\right)
=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\left(
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01 \rangle - |11 \rangle) + 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01 \rangle + |11 \rangle)
\right)
= 
\frac{1}{2}|01 \rangle - \frac{1}{2}|11 \rangle + 
\frac{1}{2}|01 \rangle + \frac{1}{2} |11 \rangle
= |01 \rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, Bob has the basis state &lt;math&gt;|01 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, so he knows that Alice wanted to send the  two-bit string 01.

== Security ==
Superdense coding is a form of secure quantum communication.&lt;ref name="Wang2005" /&gt; If an eavesdropper, which may be referred to as Eve, intercepts Alice's qubit en route to Bob, all that is obtained by Eve is part of an entangled state. Without Access to Bob's qubit, Eve is unable to get any information from Alice's qubit. A third party is unable to eavesdrop on information being communicated through superdense coding and an attempt to measure either qubit would collapse the state of that qubit and alert Bob and Alice.

== General dense coding scheme ==

General dense coding schemes can be formulated in the language used to describe [[quantum channel]]s. Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled state ''ω''. Let the subsystems initially possessed by Alice and Bob be labeled 1 and 2, respectively. To transmit the message ''x'', Alice applies an appropriate channel

:&lt;math&gt;\; \Phi_x&lt;/math&gt;

on subsystem 1. On the combined system, this is effected by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega \rightarrow (\Phi_x \otimes I)(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' denotes the identity map on subsystem 2. Alice then sends her subsystem to Bob, who performs a measurement on the combined system to recover the message. Let the ''effects'' of Bob's measurement be ''F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''. The probability that Bob's measuring apparatus registers the message ''y'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}\; (\Phi_x \otimes I)(\omega) \cdot F_y .&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, to achieve the desired transmission, we require that

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}\; (\Phi_x \otimes I)(\omega) \cdot F_y = \delta_{xy}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]].

'''Univariate''' is a term commonly used in statistics to describe a type of data which consists of observations on only a single characteristic or attribute. A simple example of univariate data would be the salaries of workers in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kachigan|first1=Sam Kash|title=Statistical analysis : an interdisciplinary introduction to univariate &amp; multivariate methods|date=1986|publisher=Radius Press|location=New York|isbn=0-942154-99-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all the other data, univariate data can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools after the data is measured, collected, reported, and analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacke|first1=Prem S. Mann ; with the help of Christopher Jay|title=Introductory statistics.|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-44466-5|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Univariate data types ==
Some univariate data consists of numbers (such as the height of 65 inches or the weight of 100 pounds), while others are nonnumerical (such as eye colors of brown or blue). Generally, the terms [[categorical data|categorical]] univariate data and [[numerical data|numerical]] univariate data are used to distinguish between these types.

=== Categorical univariate data ===
Categorical univariate data consist non-numerical [[observation]]s that may be placed in categories. It includes labels or names used to identify an attribute of each element. Categorical univariate data usually use either [[nominal number|nominal]] or [[ordinal number|ordinal]] [[scale of measurement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=David R.|last2=Sweeney|first2=Dennis J.|last3=Williams|first3=Thomas A.|title=Statistics For Business &amp; Economics|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-324-80926-8|pages=1018|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numerical univariate data ===
Numerical univariate data consist observations that are numbers. They are obtained using either [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] or [[ratio]] scale of measurement. This type of univariate data can be classified even further into two subcategories: [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]] and [[continuous probability distribution|continuous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacke|first1=Prem S. Mann; with the help of Christopher Jay|title=Introductory statistics.|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-44466-5|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; A numerical univariate data is discrete if the set of all possible values is [[finite set|finite]] or countably [[infinite set|infinite]]. Discrete univariate data are usually associated with counting (such as the number of books read by a person). A numerical univariate data is continuous if the set of all possible values is an interval of numbers. Continuous univariate data are usually associated with measuring (such as the weights of people).

== Data analysis and applications ==
Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data. '''Uni''' means '''one''', so in other words the data has only one variable.&lt;ref name=stathow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticshowto.com/univariate/|title=Univariate analysis|website=stathow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Univariate data requires to analyze each [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] separately. Data is gathered for the purpose of answering a question, or more specifically, a research question. Univariate data does not answer research questions about relationships between variables, but rather it is used to describe one characteristic or attribute that varies from observation to observation.&lt;ref name=study.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/univariate-data-definition-analysis-examples.html|title=Univariate Data|website=study.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually there are two purposes that a researcher can look for. The first one is to answer a research question with descriptive study and the second one is to get knowledge about how [[Variable and attribute (research)|attribute]] varies with individual effect of a variable in [[Regression analysis]]. There are some ways to describe patterns found in univariate data which include graphical methods, measures of central tendency and measures of variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trochim|first1=William|title=Descriptive Statistics|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/statdesc.php|website=Web Center for Social Research Methods|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graphical methods===
The most frequently used graphical illustrations for univariate data are:

==== Frequency distribution tables  ====
Frequency is how many times a number occurs. The frequency of an observation in statistics tells us the number of times the observation occurs in the data. For example, in the following list of numbers {''1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 9, 8, 5, 1, 1, 9, 9, 0, 6, 9''}, the frequency of the number 9 is 5 (because it occurs 5 times).

==== Bar charts ====
[[File:Barplot.jpg|thumb|This is an example of barplot.]]
Bar chart is a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] consisting of [[rectangular]] bars. There bars actually represents [[number]] or percentage of observations of existing categories in a variable. The [[length]] or [[height]] of bars gives a visual representation of the proportional differences among categories.

==== Histograms ====
[[File:Histarman2.jpg|thumb|histogram]]
[[Histograms]] are used to estimate distribution of the data, with the frequency of values assigned to a value range called a [[Data binning|bin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diez|first1=David M.|last2=Barr|first2=Christopher D.|last3=Çetinkaya-Rundel|first3=Mine|title=OpenIntro Statistics|date=2015|publisher=OpenIntro, Inc.|isbn=978-1-9434-5003-9|page=30|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pie charts ====
Pie chart is a circle divided into portions that represent the relative frequencies or percentages of a population or a sample belonging to different categories.

=== Measures of central tendency ===
Central tendency is one of the most common numerical descriptive measures. It's used to estimate the central location of the univariate data by the calculation of [[mean]], [[median]] and [[Mode (statistics)|mode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stepanski|first1=Norm O'Rourke, Larry Hatcher, Edward J.|title=A step-by-step approach to using SAS for univariate &amp; multivariate statistics|date=2005|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=New York|isbn=1-59047-417-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these calculation has its own advantages and limitations.The mean has the advantage that its calculation includes each value of the data set, but it is particularly susceptible to the influence of [[outlier]]s. The median is a better measure when the data set contains [[outlier]]s. The mode is simple to locate. The important thing is that it's not restricted to using only one of these measure of central tendency. If the data being analyzed is categorical, then the only measure of central tendency that can be used is the mode. However, if the data is numerical in nature ([[ordinal number|ordinal]] or [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]/[[ratio]]) then the mode, median, or mean can all be used to describe the data. Using more than one of these measures provides a more accurate descriptive summary of central tendency for the univariate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longnecker|first1=R. Lyman Ott, Michael|title=An introduction to statistical methods and data analysis|date=2009|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Pacific Grove, Calif.|isbn=978-0-495-10914-3|edition=6th ed., International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measures of variability ===
A measure of [[Statistical variability|variability]] or [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] (deviation from the mean) of a univariate data set can reveal the shape of a univariate data distribution more sufficiently. It will provide some information about the variation among data values. The measures of variability together with the measures of central tendency give a better picture of the data than the measures of central tendency alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistical Data Analysis A Practical Guide.|last2=Militky|first2=Jirí|date=2011|publisher=Woodhead Pub Ltd|isbn=978-0-85709-109-3|location=New Delhi|last1=Meloun|first1=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three most frequently used measures of variability are [[range (mathematics)|range]], [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics|date=2007|publisher=Norton|isbn=0-393-92972-8|edition=4.|location=New York [u.a.]|last1=Purves|first1=David Freedman ; Robert Pisani ; Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriateness of each measure would depend on the type of data, the shape of the distribution of data and which measure of central tendency are being used. If the data is categorical, then there is no measure of variability to report. For data that is numerical, all three measures are possible. If the distribution of data is symmetrical, then the measures of variability are usually the variance and standard deviation. However, if the data are [[Skewness|skewed]], then the measure of variability that would be appropriate for that data set is the range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=David R.|last2=Sweeney|first2=Dennis J.|last3=Williams|first3=Thomas A.|title=Statistics For Business &amp; Economics|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-324-80926-8|pages=1018|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Univariate distributions ==
[[Univariate distribution]] is a dispersal type of a single random variable described either with a [[probability mass function]] (pmf) for [[discrete probability distribution]], or [[probability density function]] (pdf) for [[continuous probability distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Samaniego|first1=Francisco J.|title=Stochastic modeling and mathematical statistics : a text for statisticians and quantitative scientists|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4665-6046-8|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with [[multivariate distribution]].

===Common discrete distributions===
[[Uniform distribution (discrete)]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Bernoulli distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Binomial distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Geometric distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Negative binomial distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Poisson distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Hypergeometric distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Zeta distribution]]

===Common continuous distributions===
[[Uniform distribution (continuous)]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Normal distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Gamma distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Exponential distribution]] &lt;br&gt;
[[Weibull distribution]] &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2707">In mathematics, a '''weighted Voronoi diagram''' in ''n'' dimensions is a special case of a [[Voronoi diagram]]. The Voronoi cells in a weighted Voronoi diagram are defined in terms of a distance function. The distance function may specify the usual [[Euclidean distance]], or may be some other, special distance function. Usually, the distance function is a function of the generator points' weights.

The '''multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram''' is defined when the distance between points is multiplied by positive weights.&lt;ref name=deza&gt;"Dictionary of distances", by Elena Deza  and [[Michel Deza]] [https://www.google.com/books?id=Xe2AZS6NcVAC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=%22weighted+voronoi+diagram%22 pp. 255, 256]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the plane under the ordinary [[Euclidean distance]], the multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram is also called '''circular Dirichlet tessellation'''&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Ash1 and Ethan D. Bolker, [Generalized Dirichlet tessellations http://www.springerlink.com/content/j334537p07370405/], ''[[Geometriae Dedicata]]'', 	Volume 20, Number 2 , 209-243{{doi|10.1007/BF00164401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: "[[Dirichlet tessellation]]" is a synonym for "Voronoi diagram".&lt;/ref&gt; and its edges are circular arc and straight line segments. A Voronoi cell may be non-convex, disconnected and may have holes. This diagram arises, e.g., as a model of [[crystal growth]], where crystals from different points may grow with different speed. Since crystals may grow in empty space only and are continuous objects, a natural variation is the '''crystal Voronoi diagram''', in which the cells are defined somewhat differently.

The '''additively weighted Voronoi diagram''' is defined when positive weights are subtracted  from the distances between points. In the plane under the ordinary [[Euclidean distance]] this diagram is also known as the '''hyperbolic Dirichlet tessellation''' and its edges are hyperbolic arc and straight line segments.&lt;ref name=deza/&gt;

The [[power diagram]] is defined when weights are added to the [[quadrance|squared Euclidean distance]]. It can also be defined using the [[power of a point|power distance]] defined from a set of circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''William Edwin Hamilton''' (10 May 1834 – 17 March 1902) was the elder son of the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton|Sir William Rowan Hamilton]] and Lady Helen Maria Hamilton Bayly.

==Life and work==
William Edwin Hamilton was born at [[Dunsink Observatory]], in the civil parish of [[Castleknock]], [[Dublin]]. He graduated in 1857 from [[Trinity College Dublin]] and became a civil engineer, working for some years as a surveyor for railway purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman (1999) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 Hamilton left for [[Nicaragua]] with his aunt Sydney Hamilton on a venture scheme anticipating a canal project across the [[Isthmus of Darien]]. Realizing the futility of this venture, and not used to the diet and the climate, in 1864 he returned to the Observatory and lived with his parents until his father's death in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins (1980) pp. 371-376&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 Hamilton's father had discovered the [[quaternions]], a four-dimensional number system that extends the [[complex numbers]], and he had published ''[https://archive.org/details/lecturesonquater1853hami Lectures on Quaternions]'' in 1853. From 1858 until his death in 1865 he worked on a second book,&lt;ref&gt;Graves (1889) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elements of Quaternions'', which was nearly finished when he died.&lt;ref&gt;Graves (1889) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's brother Archibald Henry Hamilton, a clergyman and executor of his father’s estate, being too much engaged in his clerical duties to undertake the task, asked Hamilton to bring the ''Elements of Quaternions'' to publication. Hamilton published the manuscript as his father had left it, removing "a few typographical errors" and adding a short preface in which he wrote: "Shortly before my father’s death I had several conversations with him on the subject of the ''Elements''. In these he spoke of anticipated applications of quaternions to electricity, and to all questions in which the idea of polarity is involved — applications which he never in his own lifetime expected to be able to fully develop, bows to be reserved for the hands of another Ulysses."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W.E. (ed) (1866) p. v&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 Hamilton emigrated to Canada where he became a journalist and an editor, working in [[Bracebridge, Ontario]] at E.F. Stephenson's ''Free Grant Gazette'', and as a Government Immigration Agent.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W.E. (1895) pp. 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction to ''Guidebook and Atlas'' of [[Muskoka]], Hamilton outlines the history of the region. The name he traces to Muska Ukee, or [[William Yellowhead|Musquakie]], a leader of the [[Ojibwe|Chippewa]] of Lakes [[Lake Huron|Huron]] and [[Lake Simcoe|Simcoe]]. He passes over the surveying by [[Henry Bayfield]]&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W.E. (1879) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Acts#Canada Free Grants Act of 1868], notes the efforts to organize as a county in Ontario, and the $2000 bonus and tax deferral given to Beardmore Brothers tannery to locate in Bracebridge.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W.E. (1879) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He promotes tourism to Muskoka and celebrates the local success. However rocky soil hindered agriculture, and the period was recalled in ''Hardscrabble: the High Cost of Free Land''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;       The ''Guidebook and Atlas'' was "the last concerted effort to draw settlers to Muskoka."&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2013) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hardscrabble'' Williams writes: "Eccentric was W. E. Hamilton, the scholar and newspaperman, with his pet [[snowy owl]] and birch bark accessories, holed up with his books above the ''Free Grant Gazette''."&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2013) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Hamilton finally settled in Chatham, where he was for some time editor of the ''Chatham Planet''. After having lost his editorship, in 1885 he started his own ''Market Guide'', "a four-page, pink paper tabloid, ... in which he sold sufficient advertising to eke out a starved existence."&lt;ref&gt;Wayman (1987) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; For several years in the late 1880s Hamilton was an alcoholic, but according to [[Alexander Macfarlane|Macfarlane]] he took [[Leslie Keeley]]'s [[Gold Cure]].&lt;ref&gt;Macfarlane (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; He was cured, and became in his last years a "kindly good-natured old Irishman," known for his 'amazing erudition.'&lt;ref&gt;Wayman (1987) pp. 305, 308&lt;/ref&gt;
