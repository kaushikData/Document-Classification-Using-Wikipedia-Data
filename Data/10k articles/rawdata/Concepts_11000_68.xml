{{Pakistan terrorist attacks}}
The '''2009 attack on the [[Sri Lanka national cricket team]]''' occurred on 3 March 2009, when a bus carrying [[Sri Lanka]]n [[cricket]]ers, part of a larger convoy, was fired upon by 12 gunmen near [[Gaddafi Stadium]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="samaylive" /&gt; The cricketers were on their way to play the third day of the second [[Test cricket|Test]] against the [[Pakistani cricket team]]. Six members of the Sri Lanka national cricket team were wounded. Six Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7920260.stm|title= Gunmen shoot Sri Lanka cricketers|date=3 March 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090304020128/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7920260.stm| archivedate= 4 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack was believed to have been carried out by [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]]. In August 2016, three of the terrorists involved in the attack were killed during a police raid in Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1171349/terrorists-involved-sri-lankan-cricket-team-attack-killed-lahore-raid/ Terrorists involved in Sri Lankan cricket team attack killed in Lahore raid]&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the attack's mastermind was killed in eastern [[Afghanistan]] during a military operation, while hiding there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1196066/sri-lanka-cricket-team-attack-mastermind-killed-afghanistan/ ri Lanka cricket team attack mastermind 'killed' in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the tour==
The safety of touring cricket teams in Pakistan had long been an issue.  In May 2002, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] abandoned their Test series in Pakistan after a [[2002 Karachi bus bombing|suicide bomb attack]] outside their hotel. However, they returned in the 2003/2004 season to fulfill their commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/newzealand/engine/series/61139.html |title=New Zealand in Pakistan ODI Series, 2003/04 |publisher=Cricinfo |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] had recently refused to tour on safety grounds.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s644978.htm|title=Australian cricket team cancel Pakistan tour|last=Knight|first=Ben |date=9 August 2002|work=ABC News|accessdate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan in 2008–09|The Sri Lankan cricket team was in Pakistan]] as a replacement for the [[India national cricket team|Indian team]], who had pulled out after the [[Mumbai attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/383401.html|title=Sri Lanka have confirmed tour – Pakistan board|date=10 December 2008|work=Cricinfo Pakistan|accessdate=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208034909/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/383401.html| archivedate=8 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to persuade the Sri Lankan team to visit, the Pakistan government offered to give them presidential-style security.&lt;ref name="NYT_Mar03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/asia/04pstan.html|title=For Pakistan, Attack Exposes Security Flaws |last=Perlez|first=Jane|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-04| date=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090402020739/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/asia/04pstan.html| archivedate=2 April 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The series was the first Test tour of Pakistan since South Africa visited in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/298999.html |title=Cricinfo – South Africa in Pakistan Test Series, 2007/08 |publisher=Content-www.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
[[File:Location of 2009 Liberty chowk attack.png|thumb|left|250px|Black/grey depicts the route for team convoy. The escape route for attackers is shown in blue.]]

According to the officials, 12 gunmen were hiding near Liberty Square, in the centre of Lahore, waiting for the Sri Lankan team to pass on their way to the Gaddafi stadium. They started firing at the bus when it crossed the road. The [[Pakistan police]] escorting the team returned fire; in the ensuing fighting, six policemen and two civilians died. After about 20 minutes, the militants fled, leaving behind rocket launchers and grenades.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The gunmen first shot at the wheels of the bus, and then fired at the bus itself and its occupants.&lt;ref name="safe and out of danger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/srilanka/4931223/Sri-Lankans-safe-and-out-of-danger-after-Pakistan-terror-attack.html|title=Sri Lankans 'safe and out of danger' after Pakistan terror attack|date=3 March 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 March 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090307084008/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/srilanka/4931223/Sri-Lankans-safe-and-out-of-danger-after-Pakistan-terror-attack.html| archivedate= 7 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers had fired a rocket at the bus, which missed and hit a nearby electric pole. The driver of the bus, Mehar Mohammad Khalil, had then kept on driving a distance of about {{Convert|500|m|ft}} until they reached the stadium. Khalil was hailed as a hero for his bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903181732.htm|title=Pakistan honours bus driver Khalil for his brave act |date=18 March 2009|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2009-03-29|location=Chennai, India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090322124217/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903181732.htm| archivedate= 22 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/man-who-saved-sri-lankan-team-in-2009-lahore-attack-still-traumatised-995354.html | title=Man who saved Sri Lankan team in 2009 Lahore attack still traumatised | work=[[Network18]] | date=August 17, 2015 | accessdate=May 27, 2017 | agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers had also thrown a grenade under the bus, which exploded after the bus had passed over it.&lt;ref name="lucky to survive" /&gt;

A minivan following the team bus carrying the match referee and umpires was also fired upon and the driver was killed.&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt;  [[Simon Taufel]], [[Steve Davis (umpire)|Steve Davis]], [[Nadeem Ghauri]], [[Ahsan Raza]], umpires performance manager Peter Manuel, liaison officer Abdul Sami and ICC match referee [[Chris Broad]] were in this minivan.  The minivan was subsequently allegedly abandoned by security personnel and no bullets were fired by the security forces for twenty minutes. [[Chris Broad]] threw himself over and kept his hand on the chest of [[Ahsan Raza]] to slow down the profuse bleeding from a bullet injury.  A police officer who climbed into the minivan to seek cover drove the minivan to safety.

Security cameras captured footage of several gunmen carrying automatic weapons and backpacks, firing on the convoy from the Liberty Square roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/02/pakistan.srilanka.attack/ |title=6 dead in attack on Sri Lankan cricketers |date=3 March 2009 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2009-03-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306212512/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/02/pakistan.srilanka.attack/ |archivedate= 6 March 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later seen jogging up the street and escaping on motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/04/pakistan.srilanka.attack/|title=Pakistan hunts for cricket attack gunmen|date=4 March 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was broadcast around the world presenting pictures of the attacks.&lt;ref name="NYT_Mar03"/&gt;

Security officials in [[Pakistan]] told [[The Times]] that most of the two dozen people arrested in connection with the attacks belonged to [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]],  [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]], outlawed militant groups with close links to [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5854505.ece Gunmen who attacked cricketers in Lahore 'had links to al-Qaeda'], [[The Times]], 2009-03-06&lt;/ref&gt;  Aqeel, who is  an activist of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, escaped a police raid on his home in [[Kahuta]] on 9 March 2009.&lt;ref name=lontimes&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5875297.ece Lahore attack 'mastermind' escapes police raid in Punjab], [[The Times]], 2009-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Also another gunman Zubair, aka Naik Mohammad, of Zubair, was arrested from Madina Colony, Walton Road in Lahore. He was a waiter at a hotel in Rawalpindi, when he was recruited by Sifullah. He went to [[Miram Shah]] and was trained in the use of different weapons.

Other accused including Samiullah, alias Ejaz of [[Nankana Sahib District|Nankana district]], Adnan, alias Sajjad, Ajmal alias Ahsaan, Farooq, Ameer of Punjab [[Taliban]], and Umer, alias Abdul Wahab of [[D. I. Khan]], were still at large.

The attack was planned at Tauheed Hotel, and a house rented for this purpose in Madina Colony, Walton Road. The [[auto rickshaws]] used in the attack were purchased by Samiullah.

A secret investigative report has surfaced later prepared by the Additional Inspector General of the Crime Investigation Division, Punjab on 22 January 2009 outlining the potential threat to the Sri Lankan team.&lt;ref name="Sri Lankan team attack suspect held"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-police-track-mastermind-of-attack-on-lankan-cricket-team--il--04|title=Sri Lankan team attack suspect held|last=Dawn Staff Reporter |date=17 June 2009|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=2009-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090620151639/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-police-track-mastermind-of-attack-on-lankan-cricket-team--il--04| archivedate= 20 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovenia]], access to public information is guaranteed by Article 39 of the Constitution that protects freedom of speech and right of access to public information. The constitutional right of access to public information is embodied in the Access to Public Information Act adopted in 2004. In Slovenia everyone has the right to obtain information of a public nature in which he/she has a well grounded legal interest under the law, with the only exceptions provided by law. The Access to Public Information Act also enables every citizen to enjoy the right enshrined by Article 44 of the Constitution to actively participate in the management of public affairs.&lt;ref name=DP-RS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dp-rs.si/en/public_information/ |title=Public Information |last= |first= |date= |website=Dp-rs.si |publisher=Republic of Slovenia. state Attorney's Office |access-date=16 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
Slovenia has a good regulatory framework on access to public information.&lt;ref name=ASPA&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013 |title=Building Good Governance by Access to Information in Administrative Matters - Trends in Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia |url=http://www.nispa.org/files/conferences/2013/papers/ASPA-NewOrleans-March-13-Right-to-info-KovacPolonca.pdf  |journal=ASPA Conference, New Orleans, March 2013.

Slovenian Constitution, adopted in 1991, for the first time legally defined a right to access to public information.&lt;ref name=avosetta&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rajko Knez |date=2015 |title=Free Access to environmental information. Report - Slovenia |url=http://avosetta.jura.uni-bremen.de/repslovenia2015.pdf |journal=Avosetta Annual Meeting on 29/30 May 2015 in Bremen |access-date= 10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Slovenia access to public information is regulated by the '''Access to Public Information Act (2004)''', the Decree on communication and re-use of information of a public nature (2005) and the decree amending it (2007), and the Information Commissioner Act (2005).&lt;ref name=DP-RS/&gt;

The aim of the Slovenian Access to Public Information Act is to ensure that the work of public bodies is open and transparent and to enable natural and legal entities to exercise their rights to obtain public information from public authorities holding such information. In order to achieve this aim, the law prescribes that public authorities have to obligation to inform the public about their work to the greatest extend possible.&lt;ref name=DP-RS/&gt;

The law defines the information to be considered as "public" stipulating that public information subject to access to information law refers to information and data originating from the field of work of public authorities, regardless of its form or origin.&lt;ref name=DP-RS/&gt;

Exceptions to the rule of disclosure are defined in Article 6 of the Law. Reasons for refusing can be due to the sensitive nature of the information requested, for instance information defined as classified pursuant the Act governing classified data, or information concerning personal data, or when disclosure of such information would prejudice the implementation of a judicial or administrative procedure.&lt;ref name=DP-RS/&gt;

Public authorities are obliged to provide access to information both to Slovenian and foreign nationals, including the foreign media.&lt;ref name=EBRD&gt;{{cite journal |date=2014 |title=Commercial laws of Slovenia. An assessment by the EBRD
|url=http://www.ebrd.com/documents/legal-reform/slovenia-country-law-assessment.pdf |publisher=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|access-date= 16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant bodies have to make a decision on a FOI request within 20 business days: this term may be extended to a maximum of 30 business days in case of requests requiring a complex compilation of the documents sought. In case a response is not provided within the designed period of time the application is considered refused and the applicant may file a complaint with the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]].&lt;ref name=EBRD/&gt;

In 2005, the Information Commissioner Act established the institution of the Information Commissioner, an autonomous and independent body in charge of supervising the protection of personal data and the access to public information. The Commissioner is appointed by the National Assembly at the proposal of the President of the Republic.&lt;ref name=Slovenia.si&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/officials-stress-importance-of-access-to-public-information |title=Officials Stress Importance of Access to Public Information |last= |first= |date=29 September 2015 |website=Sloveniatimes.com |publisher=The Slovenia Times |access-date=16 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==
{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}

When the right of access to public information was first introduced into the Constitution, most of Slovenians were not aware of this right. According to some experts, it tooks a decade for the right to be known, accepted and used by citizens of Slovenia.&lt;ref name=avosetta/&gt; The right of access to public information is most widely used by journalists and NGOs, while citizens are requesting public information under the FOI law more and more frequently.&lt;ref name=avosetta/&gt;

On the occasion of the [[International Right to Know Day]] celebrated on September 28th 2015, Information Commissioner Mojce Prelesnik highlighted that a key problem affecting the right of access to public information in Slovenia is the failure of state institutions to store certain data, which is particularly problematic in fields such as environmental protection, healthy food and consumer protection.&lt;ref name=Slovenia.si/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10458">In [[mathematical physics]], the '''[[Frederik Belinfante|Belinfante]]–[[Léon Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]] tensor''' is a modification of the energy–momentum tensor that is constructed from the canonical energy–momentum tensor and the spin current so as to be  symmetric yet still conserved.

In a [[classical field theory|classical]] or [[quantum field theory|quantum]] local field theory, the generator of [[Lorentz transformation]]s  can be written as an integral

: &lt;math&gt;M_{\mu\nu} = \int \mathrm{d}^3x \, {M^0}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

of a local current

: &lt;math&gt;{M^\mu}_{\nu\lambda}= (x_\nu {T^\mu}_\lambda - x_\lambda {T^\mu}_\nu)+ {S^\mu}_{\nu\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;{T^\mu}_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical [[Noether's theorem|Noether]] [[energy–momentum tensor]], and &lt;math&gt; {S^{\mu}}_{\nu\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is the contribution of the intrinsic (spin) [[angular momentum]].  Local conservation of angular momentum

: &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu {M^\mu}_{\nu\lambda}=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

requires that

: &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu {S^\mu}_{\nu\lambda}=T_{\lambda\nu}-T_{\nu\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a source of [[spin tensor|spin-current]] implies a non-symmetric canonical energy–momentum tensor.

The Belinfante–Rosenfeld tensor&lt;ref name="belinfante"&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Belinfante|title=On the current and the density of the electric charge, the energy, the linear momentum and the angular momentum of arbitrary fields |journal=Physica |volume=7| page=449| year=1940|doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(40)90091-X|bibcode=1940Phy.....7..449B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenfeld"&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. Rosenfeld |title=Sur le tenseur D’Impulsion-Energie |journal=Acad. Roy. Belg. Memoirs de classes de Science |volume=18 |issue =fasc. 6|year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a modification of the energy momentum tensor

: &lt;math&gt;T_B^{\mu\nu} = T^{\mu\nu} +\frac 12 \partial_\lambda(S^{\mu\nu\lambda}+S^{\nu\mu\lambda}-S^{\lambda\nu\mu})&lt;/math&gt;

that is constructed from the canonical energy momentum tensor and the spin current &lt;math&gt; {S^{\mu}}_{\nu\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; so as to be  symmetric yet still conserved.
  
An integration by parts shows that

: &lt;math&gt;M^{\nu\lambda} = \int (x^\nu T^{0\lambda}_B - x^\lambda T^{0\nu}_B) \, \mathrm{d}^3x,&lt;/math&gt;

and so a physical interpretation of Belinfante tensor is that it includes the "bound momentum" associated with gradients of the intrinsic angular momentum. In other words, the added term is an analogue of the &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf J}_\text{bound}= \nabla\times \mathbf {M}&lt;/math&gt; "[[bound current]]" associated with a magnetization density &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf M}&lt;/math&gt;.

The curious combination of spin-current components required to make &lt;math&gt; T_B^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; symmetric and yet still conserved seems totally ''ad hoc'', but it was shown by both Rosenfeld and Belinfante that the modified  tensor  is precisely the symmetric Hilbert energy–momentum tensor that acts as the source of gravity in  [[general relativity]].  Just as it is the sum of the   bound and free currents that acts as  a source of the  magnetic field, it is the sum of the bound and free energy–momentum that acts as a source of gravity.

==Belinfante-Rosenfeld and  the Hilbert energy-momentum tensor==

The Hilbert   energy-momentum tensor &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the variation of the action functional &lt;math&gt;S_{\rm eff}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the metric as

&lt;math&gt;\delta S_{\rm eff}=\frac 12 \int d^nx \sqrt{g} \,T_{\mu\nu}\,\delta g^{\mu\nu},&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently as

&lt;math&gt;\delta S_{\rm eff}=-\frac 12 \int d^nx \sqrt{g} \,T^{\mu\nu}\,\delta g_{\mu\nu}. &lt;/math&gt;

(The minus sign in the second equation arises because &lt;math&gt; \delta g^{\mu\nu}= - g^{\mu\sigma} \delta g_{\sigma\tau} g^{\tau\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.)

We  may  also  define  an energy-momentum  tensor &lt;math&gt;T_{cb}&lt;/math&gt; by varying a Minkowski-orthonormal  vierbein &lt;math&gt; {\bf e}_a&lt;/math&gt; to get

&lt;math&gt; \delta S_{\rm eff}=  \int d^nx\sqrt{g}\left( \frac{\delta S}{\delta e^\mu_a}\right) \delta e^\mu_a  \equiv  \int d^nx\sqrt{g} \left(T_{cb} \eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\mu\right) \delta e^\mu_a.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; \eta_{ab} = {\bf e}_a \cdot {\bf e}_b &lt;/math&gt; is the Minkowski metric for the orthonormal vierbein frame, and &lt;math&gt;{\bf e}^{*b}&lt;/math&gt; are the covectors dual to the vierbeins.

With the vierbein variation  there is no immediately obvious  reason for &lt;math&gt;T_{cb}&lt;/math&gt; to be symmetric. 
However, the  action functional &lt;math&gt; S_{\rm eff}({\bf e}_a) &lt;/math&gt; should be invariant under  an infinitesimal  local Lorentz transformation  &lt;math&gt;\delta e^\mu_a= e^\mu_b {\theta^{b}}_a(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta^{ab}=-\theta^{ba}&lt;/math&gt;,
and so

&lt;math&gt;\delta S_{\rm eff}
=   \int d^nx\sqrt{g} \,T_{cb}\,\eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\mu e^\mu_d {\theta^d}_a
=  \int d^nx\sqrt{g} \,T_{cb}\,\eta^{ca}  {\theta^b}_a
=  \int d^nx\sqrt{g}\, T_{cb}\, \theta^{bc}(x),
&lt;/math&gt;

should be zero.
As  &lt;math&gt;\theta^{bc}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary position-dependent skew symmetric matrix, we see that local Lorentz and rotation invariance both  requires and implies that  &lt;math&gt;T_{bc}=T_{cb}&lt;/math&gt;.

Once we know that &lt;math&gt;T_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric, it is easy to show that &lt;math&gt;T_{ab}= e_a^\mu e_b^\nu T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, and so the vierbein-variation energy-momentum  tensor is equivalent to  the metric-variation Hilbert  tensor.

We can now understand  the origin of the Belinfante-Rosefeld modification of the Noether canonical energy momentum tensor. 
Take the  action to be  &lt;math&gt;S_{\rm eff}({\bf e}_a, {\omega}^{ab}_\mu )&lt;/math&gt; where   &lt;math&gt;{\omega}^{ab}_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the spin connection that   is   determined by &lt;math&gt;{\bf e}_a&lt;/math&gt;   via    the condition of being metric compatible  and torsion free.   The spin current   &lt;math&gt;{S^\mu}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;  is then   defined by the variation

&lt;math&gt;
{S^\mu}_{ab}= \frac{2}{\sqrt g} \left(\frac{\delta S_{\rm eff}}{\delta \omega^{ab}_\mu}\right)_{{\bf e}_a},
&lt;/math&gt;

and the "canonical"  Noether energy momentum tensor &lt;math&gt;T^{(0)}_{cb}&lt;/math&gt;  is the part that arises from the variation where we keep the spin connection fixed:

&lt;math&gt;
 T_{cb} ^{(0)}  \eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\mu= \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}}\left(\frac{\delta S_{\rm eff}}{\delta e^\mu_a}\right)_{\omega^{ab}_\mu}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then

&lt;math&gt;
\delta S_{\rm eff} = \int d^nx \sqrt{g} \left\{ T_{cb} ^{(0)}  \eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\mu  \delta e^\mu_a+ \frac 12 {S^{\mu}}_{ab} \delta {\omega^{ab}}_\mu\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, for a torsion-free and metric-compatible connection, we have
that

&lt;math&gt;
(\delta \omega_{ij\mu}) e^\mu_k 
=-\frac 12\left\{(\nabla_j \delta e_{ik} -  \nabla_k  \delta e_{ij})
+( \nabla_k \delta e_{ji}- \nabla_i  \delta e_{jk}) -( \nabla_i \delta e_{kj}-\nabla_j \delta e_{ki})\right\},
&lt;/math&gt;

where we are using the notation

&lt;math&gt;
\delta e_{ij} =  {\bf e}_i\cdot \delta {\bf e}_j= \eta_{ib}[e^{*b}_\alpha \delta e_j^\alpha].
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the spin-connection variation, and after an integration by parts, we find

&lt;math&gt;
\delta S_{\rm eff} = \int d^nx \sqrt{g} \left\{ T_{cb} ^{(0)} +\frac 12 \nabla_a({S_{bc}}^a+{S_{cb}}^a-{S^a}_{bc})\right\}  \eta^{cd}e^{*b}_\mu \,\delta e_d^\mu.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we see that  corrections to the canonical Noether tensor that appear in the  Belinfante-Rosenfeld tensor occur because we need to simultaneously vary the vierbein and the spin connection if we are to preserve local Lorentz invariance.

As an example,  consider the  classical Lagrangian for the Dirac field

&lt;math&gt;
\int d^dx\sqrt{g}\left\{ \frac i 2 \left( \bar \Psi \gamma^a e^\mu_a\nabla_\mu \Psi - (\nabla_\mu \bar\Psi)e^\mu_a \gamma_a \Psi\right)+m\bar\Psi\Psi \right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the spinor covariant derivatives are

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_\mu \Psi =\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}+\frac 18 [\gamma_b,\gamma_c] {\omega^{bc}}_\mu\right) \Psi,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_\mu\bar  \Psi =\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}-\frac 18 [\gamma_b,\gamma_c] {\omega^{bc}}_\mu\right) \bar\Psi.
&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore get

&lt;math&gt;
T^{(0)}_{bc}= \frac i2\left(\bar \Psi \gamma_c( \nabla_b\Psi) -(\nabla_b \bar \Psi)\gamma_c \Psi\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
{S^a}_{bc}= \frac i8 \bar\Psi\{\gamma^a,[\gamma_b,\gamma_c]\}\Psi.
&lt;/math&gt;

There is no contribution from &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g}&lt;/math&gt; if we use the equations of motion.

Now  
&lt;math&gt;
\{\gamma_a,[\gamma_b,\gamma_c]\}=4 \gamma_a\gamma_b\gamma_c, 
&lt;/math&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;a,b c&lt;/math&gt; are distinct 
and zero otherwise.
As a consequence  &lt;math&gt;S_{abc}&lt;/math&gt;  is totally antisymmetric. Now,  using this result, and again  the equations of motion, we find that

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_a {S^a}_{bc}= T^{(0)}_{cb}-T^{(0)}_{bc},
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus  the Belinfante-Rosenfeld  tensor becomes

&lt;math&gt;
T_{bc} = T^{(0)}_{bc}+ \frac 12(T^{(0)}_{cb}-T^{(0)}_{bc})
= \frac 12 (T^{(0)}_{bc}+T^{(0)}_{cb}).
&lt;/math&gt;

The on-shell Belinfante-Rosenfeld  tensor for the Dirac field is  therefore seen to be  the symmetrized canonical energy-momentum tensor.

==Weinberg's definition==

Weinberg defines the Belinfante tensor as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=The quantum theory of fields|date=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ. Press]]|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521670531|edition=Repr., pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_B^{\mu\nu}=T^{\mu\nu}-\frac{i}{2}\partial_\kappa \left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\kappa\Psi^\ell)}(\mathcal{J}^{\mu\nu})^\ell_{\,\, m}\Psi^m-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\Psi^\ell)}(\mathcal{J}^{\kappa\nu})^\ell_{\,\, m}\Psi^m-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\nu\Psi^\ell)}(\mathcal{J}^{\kappa\mu})^\ell_{\,\, m}\Psi^m\right]    &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian density]], the set {Ψ} are the fields appearing in the Lagrangian, the non-Belinfante energy momentum tensor is defined by

The [[United States Military Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[Virginia Military Institute]], and [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]]  have a '''Cadet Honor Code''' as a formalized statement of the minimum standard of ethics expected of cadets. The only single-sanction honor code systems in the United States exists at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], where a "Drum-Out" ceremony is still conducted in barracks in the middle of the night for those found guilty of an honor violation. At [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] where if found guilty the result of the trial is announced at lunch the following day, and they are never permitted to return to the campus. 
The [[United States Naval Academy]] has a related standard, known as the [[Honor Concept]].

Other military-styled schools like [[Norwich University]] and [[Texas A&amp;M]] have similar codes which apply to both cadets and civilian students with their own methods of administration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|access-date=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A system and tradition of peer-enforced honorable conduct in a higher educational setting has historically been a part of campus life in other notable U.S. institutions, including [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[College of William and Mary]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]], [[University of Virginia]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], among others. In contrast, the U.K. educational system has not until very recently adopted such honor codes, sarcastically dubbing them "cheaters charters".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/mar/20/highereducation.students An idea worth imitating]", Jessica Shepherd, ''The Guardian'', 20 March 2007, Retrieved 26 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The U.S. Military Academy at West Point==
West Point's Cadet Honor Code reads simply that

:'''''"A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do."'''''

Cadets accused of violating the Honor Code face a standardized investigative and hearing process ([http://www.west-point.org/publications/honorsys/chap3.html]).  First they are tried by a jury of their peers.  If they are found guilty, the case will go up to the Commandant of the Academy who will give his recommendation, then to the Superintendent of the Academy, who has the discretion to either impose sanctions or recommend that the Secretary of the Army expel the cadet from the Academy.

===Definitions of the tenets of the Honor Code===
LYING: Cadets violate the Honor Code by lying if they deliberately deceive another by stating an untruth or by any direct form of communication to include the telling of a partial truth and the vague or ambiguous use of information or language with the intent to deceive or mislead.

CHEATING: A violation of cheating would occur if a Cadet fraudulently acted out of self-interest or assisted another to do so with the intent to gain or to give an unfair advantage. Cheating includes such acts as plagiarism (presenting someone else's ideas, words, data, or work as one's own without documentation), misrepresentation (failing to document the assistance of another in the preparation, revision, or proofreading of an assignment), and using unauthorized notes.

STEALING: The wrongful taking, obtaining, or withholding by any means from the possession of the owner or any other person any money, personal property, article, or service of value of any kind, with intent to permanently deprive or defraud another person of the use and benefit of the property, or to appropriate it to either their own use or the use of any person other than the owner.

TOLERATION: Cadets violate the Honor Code by tolerating if they fail to report an unresolved incident with honor implications to proper authority within a reasonable length of time. "Proper authority" includes the Commandant, the Assistant Commandant, the Director of Military Training, the Athletic Director, a tactical officer, teacher or coach. A "reasonable length of time" is the time it takes to confront the Cadet candidate suspected of the honor violation and decide whether the incident was a misunderstanding or a possible violation of the Honor Code. A reasonable length of time is usually considered not to exceed 24 hours.

To have violated the honor code, a Cadet must have lied, cheated, stolen, or attempted to do so, or tolerated such action on the part of another Cadet. The procedural element of the Honor System examines the two elements that must be present for a Cadet to have committed an honor violation: the act and the intent to commit that act. The latter does not mean intent to violate the Honor Code, but rather the intent to commit the act itself.

===Three rules of thumb===
#Does this action attempt to deceive anyone or allow anyone to be deceived?
#Does this action gain or allow the gain of privilege or advantage to which I  or someone else would not otherwise be entitled?
#Would I be dissatisfied by the outcome if I were on the receiving end of this action?

===History and relevance===
The premise behind the Honor Code is as old as the Academy itself.  When the Academy was founded in 1802, the officer corps operated on a simple code of honor—an officer's word was his bond.  [[Sylvanus Thayer]], Superintendent of the Academy from 1817 to 1833, explicitly banned cheating as part of his efforts to increase the Academy's scholarship standards. Allegations of theft were dealt with under normal Army regulations until the 1920s. The first major step toward formalizing the unwritten Honor Code came in 1922 when  Superintendent [[Douglas MacArthur]] formed the first Cadet Honor Committee, which reviewed all allegations of honor infractions. In 1947, Superintendent [[Maxwell Taylor]] drafted the first official Honor Code publication, which is considered the first codification of the “Cadet Honor Code.” Although failure to report violations had long been reckoned as grounds for expulsion, the code wasn't formally amended to expressly forbid "toleration" until 1970."&lt;ref name="westpoint"&gt;"[http://www.usma.edu/PublicAffairs/PressReleasesbd/nr14-08_brigade_honor_cpt.htm Brigade Honor Captain Named For 2009 ]", Release № 14-08 ''[[United States Military Academy]]'', 14 March 2008, Retrieved 3 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1951, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that 90 of the Academy's 2,500 cadets were facing dismissal for mass violations of the honor code related to "cribbing", receiving the answers to exams ahead of time, allegedly through upperclass tutors who were assisting other cadets, mostly dedicated football players, to study for those exams."&lt;ref name="TimeMag"&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889147,00.html TIME Magazine: The Nation: Trouble at West Point]", 13 August 1951, Retrieved 26 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army arranged for an investigation by a panel which included famed jurist [[Learned Hand]] and retired generals [[Troy H. Middleton]], then president of [[Louisiana State University]], and [[Robert M. Danford]], a former [[List of Commandants of Cadets of the United States Military Academy|Commandant of Cadets]] at West Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ambrose |first=Stephen E. |date=1999 |title=Duty, Honor, Country: A History of West Point |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC5wr5A_hbkC&amp;pg=PA318 |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |page=318 |isbn=978-0-8018-6293-9 |author-link=Stephen E. Ambrose}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board recommended dismissal of all 90 suspected violators of the Honor Code, and while the Army and Congress debated the issue and its causes, the cadets were left with a cloud hanging over their heads and their futures.

There have been other instances of mass cheating scandals at the Academy, including two very famous ones.  In August 1976, where it was found that possibly over half of the junior class at the Academy had violated the honor code by cheating on a case assignment.&lt;ref name="Jorgie"&gt;"[http://www.west-point.org/publications/aba_article.html Duty, Honor, Country, and Too Many Lawyers]", John Harry "Jorgie" Jorgenson, Originally printed in "The Lawyer's Washington" column in the American Bar Association Journal for April 1977 (63 ABAJ 564-S67). Copyright 1977 by the American Bar Association, Retrieved 26 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1951, 37 members of the football team were dismissed after they were found to have cheated.  The team was so decimated that it fell to 2-7, the only losing record suffered by legendary coach [[Red Blaik]].

==Virginia Military Institute==
"Above all else, cadets are men and women of honor and integrity who can always be trusted. They live by a simple code, The VMI Honor Code, which states:

''“'''A Cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do'''.”'' 

The Code pervades all aspects of a cadet’s life. A cadet’s honor is his/her most guarded possession.
The education of new cadets about the Honor System is the responsibility of the Honor Court. The Honor Court is composed of first and second class cadets elected by their classmates. In addition to education, the Honor Court is also responsible for adjudicating reported violations of the Honor Code.
The VMI Honor System is unique in that it is a single sanction system. The system does not recognize degrees of honor. The sanction for any breach of honor is dismissal. So, when new cadets sign the book on matriculation day they are committing themselves to a life of honesty and integrity. If their commitment is not complete, their stay at the Institute may be short."

Cadets found guilty of an honor violation at VMI are still dismissed in a Drum Out Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/cadet-life/citizen-soldiers/honor-code/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Air Force Academy==
The Cadet Honor Code at the Air Force Academy, like that at West Point, is the cornerstone of a cadet's professional training and development — the minimum standard of ethical conduct that cadets expect of themselves and their fellow cadets. Air Force's honor code was developed and adopted by the Class of 1959, the first class to graduate from the Academy, and has been handed down to every subsequent class.&lt;ref name="honorcode"&gt;"[http://www.usafa.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9427 The Honor Code ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626141648/http://www.usafa.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9427 |date=26 June 2010 }}", ''[[USAFA]]'' Fact Sheet, April 2009, Retrieved 3 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Honor Code Handbook"&gt;"[http://www.usafa.edu/Commandant/cwc/cwch/HCHandbook_Vol02.pdf Honor Code Reference Handbook- Volume II – The Honor System ]", (646 KB) ''USAFA'', August 2008, Retrieved 3 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The code adopted was based largely on West Point's Honor Code, but was modified slightly to its current wording:

:'''''We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.'''''

In 1984, the Cadet Wing voted to add an "Honor Oath," which was to be taken by all cadets. The oath is administered to fourth class cadets (freshmen) when they are formally accepted into the Wing at the conclusion of Basic Cadet Training.&lt;ref name="Honor Code Handbook" /&gt; The oath consists of a statement of the code, followed by a resolution to live honorably:

:'''''We will not lie, steal or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.'''''
:'''''Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably (so help me God).&lt;ref name="Final clause in cadet Honor Oath made optional"&gt;"[http://www.usafa.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123368388]", Final clause in cadet Honor Oath made optional, October 2013, Retrieved 4 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;'''''

Cadets are considered the "guardians and stewards" of the Code. Cadet honor representatives throughout the Wing oversee the honor system by conducting education classes and investigating possible honor incidents. Cadets throughout the Wing are expected to sit on Honor Boards as [[jury|juries]] that determine whether their fellow cadets violated the code. Cadets also recommend sanctions for violations. Although the presumed sanction for a violation is disenrollment, mitigating factors may result in the violator being placed in a probationary status for some period of time. This "honor probation" is usually only reserved for cadets in their first two years at the Academy.

==Norwich University, Texas A&amp;M University, The Citadel==

The Cadet Honor Codes, described within the Cadet Honor Manuals, belong to the Corps of Cadets at these institutions and is administered by cadets. It is each cadet's duty upon enrollment to be familiar with the honor system as set forth in the Honor Manual and to abide by the Honor Code. Simply stated, the Code demands that a cadet does not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor at The Citadel|url=http://155.225.198.23/root/honor-at-the-citadel|website=www.citadel.edu|publisher=The Citadel|accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|access-date=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilian Students at these schools are also required to adhere to an honor code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|access-date=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 2005 [[ESPN]] made-for-TV movie ''[[Code Breakers (film)|Code Breakers]]'' was about the 1951 scandal in which 83 West Point cadets were implicated in violations of the Cadet Honor Code in order to help the [[Army Black Knights football|West Point football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code Breakers at IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463944/|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The film was nominated for two awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for Code Breakers at IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463944/awards|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song 'Intolerance' by the rock band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] makes specific mention of the Honor Code.

The 1975 TV movie [[The Silence (1975 film)|The Silence]] is a recounting of the case of Cadet James Pelosi, who though accused of an honor code violation maintained his innocence and refused to resign from the Military Academy; and as a result was "silenced" by his fellow cadets as permitted under such circumstances by the Honor Code at that time. He was isolated from the other cadets, was not permitted to have roommates, and had to eat all his meals at a separate table. He was not spoken to by other cadets or officers except on duty, and then only on matters of duty; and when addressed was addressed as "Mister," not by name. Pelosi endured 19 months of this treatment, but went on to graduate with his class in 1973.

[[The Long Gray Line]], a 1955 biopic of Master Sergeant Martin Maher, who served in the West Point Athletic Department as both an Army enlisted man and a civilian employee, featured a sequence concerning a cadet who married a girl on impulse while on leave. Even though the marriage was immediately annulled, Sergeant Maher pointed out to the cadet that there was the Honor Code to consider. (Cadets at West Point cannot be married, an inflexible rule even today.) The cadet in question submitted his resignation rather than face the Honor Committee.

Jimmy Cagney starred in the 1950 movie [[The West Point Story (film)|The West Point Story]]. Part of the plot involved his character, Elwin "Bix" Bixby, a World War II combat veteran and Broadway director, living at West Point as a [[plebe]] cadet and occasionally running afoul of the Honor Code.

'''China Time-honored Brand''' ([[simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: '''''Zhonghua lao zihao''''' 中华老字号 or simply '''''lao zihao''''' 老字号) is a title granted by the [[Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Commerce]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] to Chinese enterprises that existed before 1956, sell products, techniques or services passed down through generations, have distinct Chinese cultural characteristics and are widely recognized by society.{{sfn|van der Meulen|Sun|Carvajal|Kite|2016|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H2glBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=%22China%20time-honored%20brand%22&amp;pg=PA454#v=onepage&amp;q=%22China%20time-honored%20brand%22&amp;f=false 454]}}

This title was first granted soon after the foundation of the PRC in 1949.{{sfn|Forêt|Mazzalovo|2014|p=133}} The current eligibility criteria were set in 2006, when the Ministry of Commerce revised them for the last time.{{sfn|Forêt|Mazzalovo|2014|p=133}}

There are currently around 1,000 brands granted this title,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} among which are [[Tongrentang]] ([[traditional Chinese medicine]]), [[Quanjude]] ([[Peking Duck]]) and [[Go Believe]] ([[baozi]] or steamed dumpling).

In [[differential geometry]], the '''Cotton tensor''' on a (pseudo)-[[Riemannian manifold]] of dimension ''n'' is a third-order [[tensor field|tensor]] concomitant of the [[metric tensor|metric]], like the [[Weyl curvature|Weyl tensor]]. The vanishing of the Cotton tensor for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} is [[necessary condition|necessary]] and [[sufficient condition]] for the manifold to be [[conformally flat]], as with the Weyl tensor for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 4}}. For {{nowrap|''n'' &lt; 3}} the Cotton tensor is identically zero. The concept is named after [[Émile Cotton]].

The proof of the classical result that for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} the vanishing of the Cotton tensor is equivalent to the metric being conformally flat is given by [[Luther P. Eisenhart|Eisenhart]] using a standard [[integrability condition|integrability]] argument. This tensor density is  uniquely characterized by its conformal properties coupled with the demand that it be differentiable for arbitrary metrics, as shown by {{Harv|Aldersley|1979}}.

Recently, the study of three-dimensional spaces is becoming of great interest, because the Cotton tensor restricts the relation between the Ricci tensor and the [[energy–momentum tensor]] of matter in the [[Einstein equation]]s and plays an important role in the [[Hamiltonian formalism]] of [[general relativity]].

== Definition ==

In coordinates, and denoting the [[Ricci tensor]] by ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and the scalar curvature by ''R'', the components of the Cotton tensor are

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ijk} = \nabla_{k} R_{ij} - \nabla_{j} R_{ik} + \frac{1}{2(n-1)}\left( \nabla_{j}Rg_{ik} -  \nabla_{k}Rg_{ij}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Cotton tensor can be regarded as a vector valued [[Differential form|2-form]], and for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 one can use the [[Hodge star operator]] to convert this into a second order trace free tensor density

:&lt;math&gt;C_i^j = \nabla_{k} \left( R_{li} - \frac{1}{4} Rg_{li}\right)\epsilon^{klj},&lt;/math&gt;

sometimes called the ''Cotton–[[James W. York|York]] tensor''.

==Properties==

===Conformal rescaling===
Under conformal rescaling of the metric &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g} = e^{2\omega} g&lt;/math&gt; for some scalar function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. We see that the [[Christoffel symbol]]s transform as

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\Gamma}^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}=\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}+S^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is the tensor

:&lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} = \delta^{\alpha}_{\gamma} \partial_{\beta} \omega + \delta^{\alpha}_{\beta} \partial_{\gamma} \omega - g_{\beta\gamma} \partial^{\alpha} \omega&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Riemann curvature tensor]] transforms as

:&lt;math&gt;{\widetilde{R}^{\lambda}}{}_{\mu\alpha\beta}={R^{\lambda}}_{\mu\alpha\beta}+\nabla_{\alpha}S^{\lambda}_{\beta\mu}-\nabla_{\beta}S^{\lambda}_{\alpha\mu}+S^{\lambda}_{\alpha\rho}S^{\rho}_{\beta\mu}-S^{\lambda}_{\beta\rho}S^{\rho}_{\alpha\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

In &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional manifolds, we obtain the [[Ricci tensor]] by contracting the transformed Riemann tensor to see it transform as

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}_{\beta\mu}=R_{\beta\mu}-g_{\beta\mu}\nabla^{\alpha}\partial_{\alpha}\omega-(n-2)\nabla_{\mu}\partial_{\beta}\omega+(n-2)(\partial_{\mu}\omega\partial_{\beta}\omega-g_{\beta\mu}\partial^{\lambda}\omega\partial_{\lambda}\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly the [[Ricci scalar]] transforms as

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}=e^{-2\omega}R-2e^{-2\omega}(n-1)\nabla^{\alpha}\partial_{\alpha}\omega-(n-2)(n-1)e^{-2\omega}\partial^{\lambda}\omega\partial_{\lambda}\omega&lt;/math&gt;

Combining all these facts together permits us to conclude the Cotton-York tensor transforms as

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{C}_{\alpha\beta\gamma}=C_{\alpha\beta\gamma}+(n-2)\partial_{\lambda}\omega {W_{\beta\gamma\alpha}}^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

or using coordinate independent language as

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{C} = C \; + \; \operatorname{grad} \, \omega \; \lrcorner \; W,&lt;/math&gt;

where the gradient is plugged into the symmetric part of the [[Weyl tensor]]&amp;nbsp;''W''.

===Symmetries===
The Cotton tensor has the following symmetries:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ijk} = - C_{ikj} \, &lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;C_{[ijk]} = 0. \, &lt;/math&gt;

In addition the Bianchi formula for the [[Weyl tensor]] can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = (3-n) C, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the positive divergence in the first component of ''W''.

'''Della Moneta''' ('''On Money''') is a book written by [[Ferdinando Galiani]], and is considered one of the first specific treatise on [[economics]], especially [[monetary theory]], preceding [[Adam Smith]]'s [[The Wealth of Nations]] by twenty-five years.

==Summary==
''Della Moneta'' is divided into five sections, covering what are still seen today as the standard aspects of [[monetary theory]]. These include the [[history of money|origin of money]], its [[Theory of value (economics)|value]] (including [[inflation]] and [[deflation]]), [[interest]], and [[monetary policy]].

==The Origin of Money==

The author, only 23 years old at the time, started with the history of Italian coinage, going back to the Greeks and Romans. Discarding the contemporary view of the origin of money through centrally planned contracts, Galiani proposes that money tends to arise spontaneously, through the need for trade, anticipating the [[Austrian school]] of economics by well over a century. He describes a sort of thought experiment, in which a government would attempt to trade or confiscate through taxes a portion of all goods in the kingdom, until it finds that the plunder is too diverse and complex to manage, and would then turn to demanding only the trade equivalent in some simple commodities that happen to have the traits seen as useful for money at the time, like compactness, ease of distribution and ease of storage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3868531/Della_Moneta_by_Ferdinando_Galiani_a_Quarter_Millennium_Assessment_-_Editors_Introduction Della Moneta by Ferdinando Galiani: a Quarter Millennium Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Value of Money==
Interwoven into the other themes throughout the book is a second premise, that money, and material goods in general, have value based on their utility to people: a premise that was only rediscovered with examination of [[marginal utility]] 120 years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinando-Galiani#ref725639 Encyclopedia Brittanica: Ferdinando Galiani]&lt;/ref&gt; He even touches upon a modern idea that would not be deeply examined again until the mid 20th century: that the value of money and goods may reach an equilibrium in price, based on [[supply and demand]]. This may also be the first modern examination of supply and demand as an economic driver.

==Methodology==
Galiani attempts to use sound philosophical methodology in the presentation and organization of his book. He even criticizes other early economic texts as failing to do so. For example, in Della Moneta he mentions [[Montesquieu]], whose book he says was harmful to France, because it commits the [[is-ought fallacy]], is full of wishful thinking, and lacks scientific rigour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3868531/Della_Moneta_by_Ferdinando_Galiani_a_Quarter_Millennium_Assessment_-_Editors_Introduction Della Moneta by Ferdinando Galiani: a Quarter Millennium Assessment - Editors' Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects a cutting-edge understanding of logic, as for example the is-ought problem was only recently identified by [[David Hume]].

==Influences==
Galiani appears to have been well-versed in the complex debates about how and why money had such an impact on Europe in the previous two centuries, brought on by incidents like the [[price revolution]] in [[Spain]] in the 16th century, where an influx of gold plundered from the [[New World]] caused dramatic inflation in first Spain, then all of Europe, a crisis that continued to varying degrees until around the time of Galiani's book.

He makes mention, in the book, of previous thoughts on topics of political economy by others, including [[John Locke]] and [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]].

==Impact==
This book has widely cited by economists from different [[schools of economic thought]] from Adam Smith's time on, from [[Karl Marx]] through [[Joseph Schumpeter]].

[[Image:Duality_(CoP).png|thumb|300px|Adaptation of the taichi symbol for [[Yin and yang]] by {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.]]

In the context of a [[community of practice]], the notion of a '''duality''' is used to capture the idea of the tension between two opposing forces which become a driving force for change and creativity.  Wenger {{Harv|Wenger|1998}} uses the concept of dualities to examine the forces that create and sustain a community of practice.  He describes a duality as "a single conceptual unit that is formed by two inseparable and mutually constitutive elements whose inherent tensions and complementarity give the concept richness and dynamism" {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=66}}.  

Some compare the concept of a duality to that of [[yin and yang]], i.e. two mutually defining opposites.

The opposing entities in a duality need to be viewed from a perspective of balance rather than opposition.  The term implies a dynamism, continual change and mutual adjustment as the tensions that are inherent in dualities can be both creative and constraining. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}} identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice: participation–reification, designed–emergent, identification–negotiability and local–global.

== Participation and reification ==
The ''participation–reification'' duality is concerned with meaning.  Meaning is created through participation and active involvement in some practice.  Reification is a way of making an abstract and concise representation of what is often a complex and frequently messy practice, thus making it easier to share within the community.  Because of its obvious links to [[knowledge management]], the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest in this field {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.

== Designed and emergent ==
The ''designed–emergent'' duality focuses on time and captures the tension between pre-planned and emergent activities.  Designers can plan an activity that is designed to achieve a particular purpose however, some activities emerge through interaction and participation of the community; these are unplanned and may be contrary to what the designers intended.  These give participants the opportunity to (re)negotiate existing meaning.  The designed–emergent duality is often mentioned in relation to the design of on-line learning environments e.g. {{Harv|Barab|MaKinster|Scheckler|2003}}.

== Identification and negotiability ==
The ''identification–negotiability'' duality is concerned with "how the power to define, adapt, or interpret the design is distributed" {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=235}}.  Identification is the process through which individuals build their identities.  This can include not only how individuals perceive themselves but also their right to contribute to and shape the direction of a community as a whole.  Thus, this duality serves to combine both power and belonging in the shaping of the community.

== Local and global ==
The ''local–global'' duality concerns how one CoP relates to another.  The challenge is to share local knowledge that meets the needs of a particular domain in a way that will be of relevance to others who are not involved in it.  Wenger uses the notion of a [[boundary object]], [[brokerage]] {{Harv|Wenger|1998|p=106}} and boundary encounters {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002|p=84}} to explain how individuals can establish relationships and learn from other communities.

However, this power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons or corporations, when they are authorized by the legislature to exercise the functions of public character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eminent Domain|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/eminent+domain|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anglo-American historical context, property taken could be used only by the government taking the property in question. The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and [[public utility|public utilities]]. However, in the mid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party. This was initially done only to "blighted" property, on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners, but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new 3rd party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government.

Some jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once the property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in [[fee simple]], and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action.

Takings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee simple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee simple title).

==Meaning==
The term "eminent domain" was taken from the legal treatise ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (On the Law of War and Peace), written by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[jurist]] [[Hugo Grotius]] in 1625,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Nowak |first2=Ronald D. |last2=Rotunda |title=Constitutional Law |publisher=Thomson West |location=St. Paul, MN |year=2004 |page=263 |edition=Seventh |isbn=0-314-14452-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which used the term ''dominium eminens'' ([[Latin]] for ''supreme lordship'') and described the power as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp; The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so that the state or those who act for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even private persons have a right over the property of others, but for ends of public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way. But, when this is done, the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property. Condemnors may also take personal property, even intangible property such as [[contract]] rights, [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s, and [[copyright]]s. Even the taking of a [[Professional sports|professional]] [[sports team]]'s franchise has been held by the California Supreme Court to be within the purview of the "public use" constitutional limitation, although eventually, that taking (of the [[Oakland Raiders]]' [[NFL]] franchise) was not permitted because it was deemed to violate the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/32C3d60.htm |title=City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders (1982) 32 C3d 60 |website=Online.ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A taking of property must be accompanied by payment of "just compensation" to the [former] owner. In theory, this is supposed to put the owner in the same position "pecuniarily" that he would have been in had his property not been taken. But in practice courts have limited compensation to the property's fair market value, considering its highest and best use. But though rarely granted, this is not the exclusive measure of compensation; see [[Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States]] (business losses in temporary takings) and United States v. Pewee Coal Co. (operating losses caused by government operations of a mine seized during World War II). In most takings owners are not compensated for a variety of incidental losses caused by the taking of their property that, though incurred and readily demonstrable in other cases, are deemed by the courts to be noncompensable in eminent domain. The same is true of attorneys' and appraisers fees. But as a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional requirement some of these losses (e.g., business goodwill) have been made compensable by state legislative enactments, and may be partially covered by provisions of the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance Act.

{{main|Eminent domain in the United States}}

Most states use the term ''eminent domain'', but some U.S. states use the term ''[[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]'' (New York) or ''expropriation'' (Louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Code, Public Lands, Art. 2, Sec. 27, Appropriations |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBL/27 |website=NYSenate.gov |publisher=The New York Senate |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Louisiana Revised Statutes, Title 19, Expropriation |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/laws_Toc.aspx?folder=75&amp;level=Parent |website=Louisiana State Legislature |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''condemnation'' is used to describe the formal act of exercising this power to transfer title or some lesser interest in the subject property.

The constitutionally required "just compensation" in partial takings is usually measured by fair market value of the part taken, plus severance damages (the diminution in value of the property retained by the owner [remainder] when only a part of the subject property is taken). Where a partial taking provides economic benefits specific to the remainder, those must be deducted, typically from severance damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Aaron |title=Eminent Domain|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/real_estate/eminent_domain.html |website=ExpertLaw.com |publisher=ExpertLaw |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former owners of the property rarely receive full market value because some elements of value are deemed noncompensable in eminent domain law.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The practice of condemnation came to the American colonies with the [[common law]]. When it came time to draft the [[United States Constitution]], differing views on eminent domain were voiced. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution requires that the taking be for a "public use" and mandates payment of "just compensation" to the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_03_04_benson.pdf |title=The Evolution of Eminent Domain: A Remedy for Market Failure or an Effort to Limit Government Power and Government Failure? |format=PDF |website=Independent.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In federal law, Congress may take private property directly (without recourse to the courts) by passing an Act transferring title of the subject property directly to the government. In such cases, the property owner seeking compensation must sue the United States for compensation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads, and even to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=''Linggi v. Garovotti'', 45 Cal.2d 20, 286 P.2d 15 (1955).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15917425264572652948|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has consistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations of "public use".

=== Canada ===
In Canada, expropriation is governed by federal or provincial statutes. Under these statutory regimes, public authorities have the right to acquire private property for public purposes, so long as the acquisition is approved by the appropriate government body. Once a property is taken, an owner is entitled to "be made whole" by compensation for: the market value of the expropriated property, injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any), disturbance damages, business loss, and special difficulty relocating. Owners can advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the expropriating authority by bringing a claim before the court or an administrative body appointed by the governing legislation.

==Europe==
In many European nations, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] provides protection from an appropriation of private property by the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence" and prohibits interference with this right by the state, unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of [[national security]], public safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights#toc|First Protocol]] to the Convention, which states that "Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions." Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or [[public interest]], is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of [[tax]]es. Settled case-law of ECHR provides that just compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;See James v.the UK, decision of ECHR dated by 21 February 1986, para 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] similarly mandates just and preliminary compensation before expropriation; and a [[Déclaration d'utilité publique]] is commonly required, to demonstrate a public benefit.

Notably, in 1945, by decree of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] based on untried&lt;ref name="shame" /&gt; accusations of collaboration, the [[Renault]] company was expropriated from Louis Renault posthumously and nationalised as ''Régie Nationale des Usines Renault''&lt;ref name="shame"&gt;{{cite news |title=Louis Renault and the shame of a nation |publisher=The Daily Telegraph, Ian Morton |date=14 May 2005 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2735296/Louis-Renault-and-the-shame-of-a-nation.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;—without compensation.&lt;ref name="ogre"&gt;{{cite news |title=Foreign News: Was He Murdered? |publisher=Time Magazine |date=Feb 6, 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893292,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
{{main|Compulsory purchase in England and Wales}}
After his victory in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] seized virtually all land in England. Although he maintained absolute power over the land, he granted fiefs to landholders who served as stewards, paying fees and providing military services. During the [[Hundred Years War]] in the 14th century, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] used the Crown's right of [[purveyance]] for massive expropriations. Chapter 28 of [[Magna Carta]] required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations. As the king's power was broken down in the ensuing centuries, tenants were regarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over their land. In 1427, a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in [[Lincolnshire]] the power to take land without compensation. After the early 16th century, however, Parliamentary takings of land for roads, bridges, etc. generally did require compensation. The common practice was to pay 10% more than the assessed value. However, as the voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners, the bonus was eliminated. In spite of contrary statements found in some American law, in the United Kingdom, compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried to juries well into the 20th century, such as [[Attorney-General v De Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd]] (1919).

In [[England and Wales]], and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of [[English law]], the related term '''compulsory purchase''' is used. The landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person. Where agreement on price cannot be achieved, the value of the taken land is determined by the [[Upper Tribunal]]. The operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law. The principal Acts are the [[Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845]], the [[Land Compensation Act 1961]], the [[Compulsory Purchase Act 1965]], the [[Land Compensation Act 1973]], the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, part IX of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]], the [[Planning and Compensation Act 1991]], and the [[Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004]].

===Germany===
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] states in its Article 14 (3) that "an expropriation is only allowed for the public good"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/14.html |title=Art. 14 GG |website=Dejure.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and just compensation must be made. It also provides for the right to have the amount of the compensation checked by a court.

===Italy===
[[File:Espropria graffiti in Turin October 2016.jpg|thumb|''Espropria'', "expropiate". Protest graffiti in [[Turin]]]]
''Esproprio'', or more formally ''espropriazione per pubblica utilità'' (literally "expropriation for public utility") in [[Italy]] takes place within the frame of [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], as an expression of the ''potere ablatorio'' (ablative power). The law regulating expropriation is the D.P.R. n.327 of 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/01325dla.htm |title=D.P.R. 327/2001 |website=Camera.it |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; amended by D.Lgs. n.302 of 2002;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/02302dl.htm |title=Dlgs 302/2002 |website=Parlamento.it |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it supersedes the old expropriation law, the Royal Decree n.2359 of 1865. Also other national and regional laws may apply, not always giving a full compensation to the owner.&lt;ref&gt;In other countries (France, Germany, Great Britain, Germany) is provided fair compensation according to the free market value both for regular expropriations or for absolutely unlawful occupations: {{cite journal |last1=Buonomo |first1=Giampiero |title=Occupazione acquisitiva: nodo irrisolto nonostante le modifiche al Testo unico |journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2003 |url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89339045}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expropriation can be total (the whole property is expropriated) or partial; permanent or temporary.

The article 42 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] and the article 834 of the [[Law of Italy|Italian Civil Code]] state that a private good can be expropriated for public utility. Furthermore, the article 2 of the Constitution binds Italian citizens to respect their ''mandatory duties of political, economical and social solidarity''.

The implementation of the eminent domain follows two principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manuale pratico dell'espropriazione|last=Assini, N.-Tescaroli, N.|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=Padua|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* legality: a public institution can exporpriate private goods only in the cases law allowes it and respecting its procedures (following the article 23 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]]);
* compensation: (art. 42/III) the State must provide a certain amount of money as compensation, which is determined by the law. According to the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]], this compensation is not required to be equal to the market value of the expropriated good, although this sum must not be merely symbolic.
''Nazionalizzazione'' ("nationalization"), instead, is provided for by article 43 of the Constitution; it transfers to governmental authority and property a whole industrial sector, if it is deemed to be a natural or de facto [[monopoly]], and an essential service of public utility. The most famous nationalization in Italy was the [[Enel|1962 nationalization of the electrical power sector]].

===Spain===
Article 33.3 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] allows forced expropriation ("expropiación forzosa") only where justified on the grounds of public utility or social interest and subject to the payment of appropriate compensation as provided for in law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=33&amp;tipo=2 Constitución Española de 1978 Art 33 part 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Expropriation. The right of state or municipality to buy property when it is determined to be of "particular public interest", is regulated in Expropriationslagen (1972:719).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lagen.nu/1972:719 |title=Expropriationslag (1972:719) (ExprL) |publisher=Lagen.nu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government purchases the property at an estimated market value plus a 25% compensation. The law also states that the property owner shall not suffer economic harm because of the expropriation.

==Australia==
{{Main|Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution}}

In Australia, section 51(xxxi) of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] permits the [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]] to make laws with respect to "the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411044012/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been construed as meaning that just compensation may not always include monetary or proprietary recompense, rather it is for the court to determine what is just. It may be necessary to imply a need for compensation in the interests of justice, lest the law be invalidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1941/20.html/ |title=''Andrews v Howell'' (1941) 65 CLR 255 |website=Austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property subject to resumption is not restricted to real estate as authority from the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] has extended the states' power to resume property to any form of physical property.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} For the purposes of section 51(xxxi), money is not property that may be compulsorily acquired.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} (The following is cited by a dead link) A statutory right to sue has been considered "property" under this section.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Commonwealth must also derive some benefit from the property acquired, that is, the Commonwealth can "only legislate for the acquisition of Property for particular purposes".&lt;ref&gt;Australian Constitutional Commission, ''Final Report of the Constitutionali Commission'' vol 1 (Canberra: Australian Government Publishing Service, 1988): 600. {{ISBN|0-644-06897-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the power does not extend to allow legislation designed merely to seek to extinguish the previous owner's title.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The states and territories' powers of resumption on the other hand are not so limited. The section 43(1) of the Lands Acquisition Act 1998 (NT) grants the Minister the power to acquire land 'for any purpose whatever'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/laa192/s43.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423143837/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/laa192/s43.html |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court of Australia interpreted this provision literally, relieving the Territory government of any public purpose limitation on the power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2008/20.html/ |title=Griffiths v Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment [2008&amp;#93; HCA 20 (15 May 2008) |website=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding permitted the Territory government to acquire land subject to Native Title, effectively extinguishing the Native Title interest in the land. Kirby J in dissent, along with a number of commentators, viewed this as a missed opportunity to comment on the exceptional nature of powers of resumption exercised in the absence of a public purpose limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reale |first=Andreana |title=Assisted Theft: Compulsory land acquisition for private benefit in Australia and the US |journal=Alternative Law Journal |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=147–51 |publisher=Legal Service Bulletin Co-operative Ltd |location=Melbourne |year=2009 |url=http://www.altlj.org/index.php?option=Articles&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;artid=69#1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''resumption'' is a reflection of the fact that, as a matter of Australian law, all land was originally owned by [[the Crown]] before it was sold, leased or granted&lt;ref&gt;Samantha J. Hepburn, ''Principles of Property Law'', 2nd ed. (Newport, NSW: Cavendish, 2001):45-46. {{ISBN|1-876905-08-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, through the act of compulsory acquisition, the Crown is "resuming" possession.

The expropriated party may protest the legality of the expropriation action before the ordinary courts of justice and shall, at all times, have the right to indemnification for patrimonial harm actually caused, to be fixed by mutual agreement or by a sentence pronounced by said courts in accordance with the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Chile.pdf |title=Chile |website=Confinder.richmond.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama===
In Panama, the government must pay a fair amount of money to the owner of the property to be expropriated.

==Asia==

===India===
{{Main|Land Acquisition in India|The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013}}
The Constitution originally provided for the [[right to property]] under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to 'acquire, hold and dispose of property'. Article 31 provided that "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law." It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property had been 'taken possession of or acquired' for public purposes. In addition, both the state government as well as the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the "acquisition or requisition of property" (Schedule VII, Entry 42, List III). It is this provision that has been interpreted as being the source of the state's 'eminent domain' powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openarchive.in/judis/1119.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180417/http://openarchive.in/judis/1119.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th [[Constitution of India#Amendment|amendment]] act of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights.&lt;ref name="44amact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm |title=The Constitution (Amendment) |website=Indiacode.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new article, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution to provide, "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law." Thus, if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, it will not be unconstitutional. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens.&lt;ref name="pgA33"&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Land acquisition in India is currently governed by [[The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013]], which came into force from 1 January 2014.&lt;ref name=LARR2011&gt;{{cite web |title=The Land Acquisition, Rehabilation and Resettlement Bill, 2011 – Full Text of Bill |publisher=Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India |url=http://rural.nic.in/latest/bill_chapter_07092011_E.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2013, land acquisition in India was governed by [[Land Acquisition Act, 1894|Land Acquisition Act of 1894]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=Debjani |title=The history of eminent domain in colonial thought and legal practice, Special Section Artic… 9 Pages The history of eminent domain in colonial thought and legal practice |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |date=2015 |volume=50 |issue=50 |url=https://www.academia.edu/17572189/The_history_of_eminent_domain_in_colonial_thought_and_legal_practice_Special_Section_Article_Economic_and_Political_Weekly_Vol._L_No.50_December_2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the new LARR (amendment) ordinance 31 December 2014 diluted many clauses of the original act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Ordinances/RTFCTLARR%20Ordinance%202014.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Amendment) Ordinance |date=2014 |website=Prsindia.irg |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The liberalisation of the economy and the Government's initiative to set up special economic zones have led to many protests by farmers and have opened up a debate on the reinstatement of the fundamental right to private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Should-right-to-property-return/articleshow/4202212.cms |work=The Times Of India |first1=Dhananjay |last1=Mahapatra |title=Should right to property return? |date=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
Under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the government has the power to compulsorily acquire private land at the prevailing market rate for public purposes such as roads, highways, railways, dams, airports, etc.

==Other countries==
Many countries recognize eminent domain to a much lesser extent than the English-speaking world or do not recognize it at all. [[Japan]], for instance, has very weak eminent domain powers, as evidenced by the high-profile opposition to the expansion of [[Narita International Airport]], and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave, one well-known recent case being that of [[Roppongi Hills]].

There are other countries such as the [[People's Republic of China]] that practice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures. [[Singapore]] practices eminent domain under the Land Acquisitions Act, which allows it to carry out its [[Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme]] for urban renewal. The [[Amendments to the Land Titles Act]] allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not. Thus, eminent domain often invokes concerns of [[majoritarianism]].

In the Bahamas, the Acquisition of Land Act operates to permit the acquisition of land where it is deemed likely to be required for a public purpose. The land can be acquired by private agreement or compulsory purchase (s7 of the Act). Under section 24 of the Acquisition of Land Act, the purchaser may purchase the interest of the mortgagee of any land acquired under the Act. To do so, the purchaser must pay the principal sum and interest, together with costs and charges plus 6 months’ additional interest.

Since the 1990s, the [[Zimbabwe]]an government under [[Robert Mugabe]] has seized a great deal of land and homes of mainly white farmers in the course of the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform movement in Zimbabwe]]. The government argued that such land reform was necessary to redistribute the land to Zimbabweans dispossessed of their lands during [[colonialism]] – these farmers were never compensated for this seizure.&lt;ref&gt;Dancaescu, Nick. Note. Land reform in Zimbabwe. 15 Fla. J. Int'l L. 615 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8492">In [[philosophy of mind]] and [[consciousness]], the '''explanatory gap''' is the difficulty that [[physicalism|physicalist]] theories have in explaining how physical properties give rise to the way things feel when they are experienced. It is a term introduced by philosopher [[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]].&lt;ref name=Levine1983 /&gt; In the 1983 paper in which he first used the term, he used as an example the sentence, "Pain is the firing of [[C fibers]]", pointing out that while it might be valid in a physiological sense, it does not help us to understand how pain feels.

The explanatory gap has vexed and intrigued [[philosopher]]s and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] researchers alike for decades and caused considerable debate. Bridging this gap (that is, finding a satisfying mechanistic explanation for experience and [[qualia]]) is known as "[[Hard problem of consciousness|the hard problem]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[David Chalmers]], [http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf ''Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness''], [http://www.imprint.co.uk/hardprob.html JCS, 2 (3), 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514060312/http://www.imprint.co.uk/hardprob.html |date=2011-05-14 }}, pp. 200-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

To take an example of a phenomenon in which there is no gap, imagine a modern computer: as marvelous as these devices are, their behavior can be fully explained by their circuitry. By contrast, it is thought by many [[Mind-body dualism|mind-body dualists]] (e.g. [[René Descartes]], [[David Chalmers]]) that ''subjective conscious experience'' constitutes a separate effect that demands another cause that is either outside the physical world (dualism) or due to an as yet unknown physical phenomenon (see for instance [[quantum mind]], [[indirect realism]]).

Proponents of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] claim that the [[mind]] is substantially and qualitatively different from the [[brain]] and that the existence of something [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] extra-physical is required to "fill the gap".  Similarly, some argue that there are [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts of the world—about conscious experience. For example, they argue that [[qualia|what it is like]] to experience seeing red does not follow logically from the physical facts of the world.

The nature of the explanatory gap has been the subject of some debate.  For example, some consider it to simply be a limit on our current explanatory ability.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. C. 1991. Consciousness Explained. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that future findings in neuroscience or future work from philosophers could close the gap.  However, others have taken a stronger position and argued that the gap is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities as humans—no amount of further information will allow us to close it.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, C. 1989. “Can we solve the mind-body problem?” Mind, 98: 349-66&lt;/ref&gt;  There has also been no consensus regarding what metaphysical conclusions the existence of the gap provides.  Those wishing to use its existence to support dualism have often taken the position that an epistemic gap—particularly if it is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities—necessarily entails a metaphysical gap.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, D. 1996. The Conscious Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Levine and others have wished to either remain silent on the matter or argue that no such metaphysical conclusion should be drawn.&lt;ref name=Levine1983&gt;Levine, J. 1983. “Materialism and qualia: the explanatory gap”. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 64: 354-361.&lt;/ref&gt;  He agrees that conceivability (as used in the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie]] and [[inverted spectrum]] arguments) is flawed as a means of establishing metaphysical realities; but he points out that even if we come to the ''metaphysical'' conclusion that qualia are physical, they still present an ''explanatory'' problem.
&lt;blockquote&gt;While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, such an [[epistemological]] or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, even if not proven by conceivability arguments is far from ruled out.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the end, we are right back where we started. The explanatory gap argument doesn't demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of nature. Of course a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature. But so long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter, we have to look elsewhere for an explanation of the former.&lt;ref&gt;J. Levine, "Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap" in  Stuart R. Hameroff, Alfred W. Kaszniak and David Chalmers (eds.), ''Towards a Science of Consciousness III: The Third Tucson Discussions and Debates'', The MIT Press, 1999,. pp 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the core of the problem, according to Levine, is our lack of understanding of what it means for a qualitative experience to be fully comprehended. He emphasizes that we don't even know to what extent it is appropriate to inquire into the nature of this kind of experience. He uses the laws of gravity as an example, which laws seem to explain gravity completely yet do not account for the gravitational constant. Similarly to the way in which gravity appears to be an inexplicable brute fact of nature, the case of qualia may be one in which we are either lacking essential information or in which we're exploring a natural phenomenon that simply is not further apprehensible. Levine suggests that, as qualitative experience of a physical or functional state may simply be such a brute fact, perhaps we should consider whether or not it is really necessary to find a more complete explanation of qualitative experience.

Levine points out that the solution to the problem of understanding how much there is to be known about qualitative experience seems even more difficult because we also lack a way to articulate what it means for actualities to be knowable in the manner that he has in mind. He does conclude that there are good reasons why we wish for a more complete explanation of qualitative experiences. One very significant reason is that consciousness appears to only manifest where mentality is demonstrated in physical systems that are quite highly organized. This, of course, may be indicative of a human capacity for reasoning that is no more than the result of organized functions. Levine expresses that it seems counterintuitive to accept this implication that the human brain, so highly organized as it is, could be no more than a routine executor. He notes that although, at minimum, Materialism appears to entail reducibility of anything that is not physically primary to an explanation of its dependence on a mechanism that can be described in terms of physical fundamentals, that kind of reductionism doesn't attempt to reduce psychology to physical science. However, it still entails that there are inexplicable classes of facts which are not treated as relevant to statements pertinent to psychology.

{{Fiji Expeditions}}

The '''First Fiji Expedition''' undertaken by the [[United States]] occurred in October 1855 during the [[civil war]] on the islands. In response to the alleged [[arson]] attacks on the American [[commercial agent]] in [[Lautoka]], [[Viti Levu]], the navy sent a warship to demand compensation for the attack from [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], the [[Vunivalu of Bau]] and self-proclaimed [[Tui Viti]] (King of Fiji).&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Casualties: U.

==Expedition==
The first incident that led to the American expedition was in 1849 when the house owned by agent [[John Brown Williams]] was hit by [[cannon]] fire and burned. The Fijians were allegedly celebrating [[Fiji Day|Independence Day]]{{Clarify|date=January 2017}} when cannonballs fell on the building. The second incident happened the same year as the expedition when, again, fire was to interrupt John Williams's duties. After another accidental fire on [[Nukulau]] destroyed his store and some Fijians looted it. {{USS|John Adams|1799|2}}, under [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Edward B. Boutwell]], was sent to monitor the unrest in October and her crew were landed on more than one occasion to protect American interests. When Commander Boutwell heard of the incidents involving William's house and store, he demanded [[United States dollar|US$]]5,000 in compensation from King Cakobau. This initial claim was supplemented by further claims totalling $45,000. The natives received a deadline saying if they failed to pay, a landing party of [[United States Marine Corps|marine]]s and [[United States Navy|sailor]]s would be sent ashore to capture the king in the island's village. Fijian [[warrior]]s put up some resistance and one American service man was killed and two were wounded. Ultimately the men of ''John Adams'' were successful in routing a contingent of natives from Lautoka but Cakobau and the survivors escaped capture.

Cakobau's claim to be King of Fiji was by no means universally recognized by his fellow-[[ratu|chiefs]], who jealously guarded the independence of their fiefdoms. His dilemma was that if he acknowledged the debt, he did not have sufficient funds to pay it, but that if he disclaimed it by saying that it fell under the jurisdiction of another chief, he would jeopardize his claim to the kingship, which he wanted foreign powers to recognize. He decided to bide his time, hoping that the Americans were only bluffing.

A second [[Second Fiji Expedition|expedition]] in 1858, involving the crew of {{USS|Vandalia|1828|2}}, achieved clearer results but in the end, Cakobau never paid the debt.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=State/&gt;&lt;ref name=cooney&gt;{{cite book| title=A Chronology of the U.

==Properties==

The proposed megastructure would incorporate all of Earth's matter. Sunlight would enter through two large windows, and [[gravity]] would be simulated by the [[centrifugal effect]]. Humans would live on two vast regions that face each other and that are connected through the empty center. The [[hydrosphere]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] would be retained on its inside. The ecosphere would be restricted to the [[equator]]ial zones, while at the low-gravity [[Tropics|tropic]] zones a thin atmosphere would allow only for plantations. The [[polar region]]s would have neither gravity nor atmosphere and would therefore be used for storage of raw materials and microgravity production processes.

===Geometric structure===
Globus Cassus has the [[shape|form]] of a compressed [[geodesic dome|geodesic]] [[icosahedron]] with two diagonal openings. Along the edges of the icosahedron run the skeleton beams, the gaps between the beams contain a shell and, where there are windows, inward-curving domes.

===Building material===
Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[Planetary core|core]] are gradually excavated, transported outwards and then transformed to larger strength and reduced density. While the crust is mined from open pits in the continents' centers, [[magma]] and the liquid mantle are pumped across transfer hoses. The core is dismantled from the surface.

===Planetary scale===
Since the stationary cables would stay clear inside the [[moon]]'s trajectory, the construction of Globus Cassus would not alter the Earth-Moon system. However, on a planetary scale the proportions would be altered, with Globus Cassus being only slightly smaller than [[Saturn]], the [[Solar System|Solar System's]] second-largest planet.

==Construction process==
Starting at four precisely defined points in the [[geostationary orbit]], four [[space elevators]] are built. Eventually they become massive towers, each measuring several hundred kilometers in diameter and extending to a length of about 165,000&amp;nbsp;km. The towers contain elevators which are used to transport silicate building material to the construction sites at geostationary orbit.

===Skeleton and shell===
The building material is converted into vacuum-porous aggregate and used to form the skeleton. It is built retaining constant [[symmetry]] and balance at every moment and will ultimately span around all sides of the earth. Then [[magma]] is pumped towards the skeleton, where it is used to form thin shells in the skeletal openings. Eight of these openings are fitted with large, inward-curving window domes made out of silicon glass.

===The Great Rains===
Having been used up to a large degree, the Earth has shrunk, the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth's mass and therefore [[gravity]] has declined. This leads to the sudden loss of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[hydrosphere]], which wander outwards towards the new World. Globus Cassus' equator zones are equipped with a system of trenches and moulds that will become [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[sea]]s as soon as the water has settled. The transfer process of atmosphere and hydrosphere is called "The Great Rains".

===Colonization===
The moment the Great Rains start, the Earth becomes uninhabitable. Along with massive amounts of seed for all existing plants, the regions of high cultural value, that need to be conserved and reapplied on Globus Cassus have been stored in the skeleton nodes which touch the towers. Humans and animals rise in the towers to await the end of the rains and start settling on the two equator regions.

===Plant growth===
The remaining Earth core is dismantled to build the shells that lie in the pole regions. During this process, the massive heat radiation of the core accelerates plant growth and therefore aids the process of establishing a functioning [[biosphere]].

In [[physics]], '''Hamilton's principle''' is [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s formulation of the [[principle of stationary action]] (see that article for historical formulations). It states that the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a physical system is determined by a [[calculus of variations|variational problem]] for a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] based on a single function, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], which contains all physical information concerning the system and the forces acting on it. The variational problem is equivalent to and allows for the derivation of the ''[[differential equation|differential]]'' [[equations of motion]] of the physical system.  Although formulated originally for [[classical mechanics]], Hamilton's principle also applies to classical [[field (physics)|fields]] such as the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[gravity|gravitational]] [[field (physics)|fields]], and plays an important role in [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]] and criticality theories.

Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | page = 474|isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Mathematical formulation==

Hamilton's principle states that the true evolution '''q'''(''t'') of a system described by ''N'' [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) between two specified states '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at two specified times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[stationary point]] (a point where the [[Calculus of variations|variation]] is zero), of the [[action (physics)|action]] [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  
\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\dot{\mathbf{q}}(t),t)\, dt 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] for the system.  In other words, any ''first-order'' perturbation of the true evolution results in (at most) ''second-order'' changes in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.  The action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]], i.e., something that takes as its input a [[function (mathematics)|function]] and returns a single number, a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]].  In terms of [[functional analysis]], Hamilton's principle states that the true evolution of a physical system is a solution of the functional equation

{{Equation box 1

\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta \mathbf{q}(t)}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

===Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the action integral===

Requiring that the true trajectory '''q'''(''t'') be a [[stationary point]] of the action functional &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a set of differential equations for '''q'''(''t'') (the '''Euler–Lagrange equations'''), which may be derived as follows.

Let '''q'''(''t'') represent the true evolution of the system between two specified states '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at two specified times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and let '''ε'''(''t'') be a small perturbation that is zero at the endpoints of the trajectory

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_1) = \boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  0
&lt;/math&gt;

To first order in the perturbation '''ε'''(''t''), the change in the action functional &lt;math&gt;\delta\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; would be
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \mathcal{S} = 
\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\;
\left[ L(\mathbf{q}+\boldsymbol\varepsilon,\dot{\mathbf{q}} +\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}})- L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}}) \right]dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; \left(
\boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} + 
\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}} \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}}  \right)\,dt      
&lt;/math&gt;

where we have expanded the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L'' to first order in the perturbation '''ε'''(''t'').

Applying [[integration by parts]] to the last term results in

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \mathcal{S} = 
\left[ \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}}\right]_{t_1}^{t_2} + 
\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; 
\left( \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}}
- \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right)\,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_1) = \boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  0
&lt;/math&gt; causes the first term to vanish

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathcal{S} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

Hamilton's principle requires that this first-order change &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is zero for all possible perturbations '''ε'''(''t''), i.e., the true path is a [[stationary point]] of the action functional &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; (either a minimum, maximum or saddle point).  This requirement can be satisfied if and only if

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''[[Euler–Lagrange equations]]'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are called the Euler–Lagrange equations for the variational problem.

===Canonical momenta and constants of motion===

The '''conjugate momentum''' ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a generalized coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;p_k \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k}&lt;/math&gt;.

An important special case of the Euler–Lagrange equation occurs when ''L'' does not contain a generalized coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_k}=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d p_k}{dt} = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the conjugate momentum is a ''constant of the motion''.

In such cases, the coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called a '''cyclic coordinate'''.  For example, if we use polar coordinates ''t, r, θ'' to describe the planar motion of a particle, and if ''L'' does not depend on ''θ'', the conjugate momentum is the conserved angular momentum.

===Example: Free particle in polar coordinates===

Trivial examples help to appreciate the use of the action principle via the Euler–Lagrange equations. A free particle (mass ''m'' and velocity ''v'') in Euclidean space moves in a straight line. Using the Euler–Lagrange equations, this can be shown in [[coordinates (elementary mathematics)|polar coordinates]] as follows. In the absence of a potential, the Lagrangian is simply equal to the kinetic energy 
:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{1}{2} mv^2= \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
in orthonormal (''x'',''y'') coordinates, where the dot represents differentiation with respect to the curve parameter (usually the time, ''t''). Therefore, upon application of the Euler–Lagrange equations,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow  \qquad m\ddot{x} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

And likewise for ''y''. Thus the Euler–Lagrange formulation can be used to derive Newton's laws.

In polar coordinates (''r'', φ) the kinetic energy and hence the Lagrangian becomes

:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\varphi}^2 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The radial ''r'' and ''φ'' components of the Euler–Lagrange equations become, respectively

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} = 0  \qquad
\Rightarrow  \qquad \ddot{r} -  r\dot{\varphi}^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\varphi}}  \right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi} = 0  \qquad
\Rightarrow  \qquad \ddot{\varphi} + \frac{2}{r}\dot{r}\dot{\varphi} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The solution of these two equations is given by

:&lt;math&gt; r = \sqrt{(a t + b)^2 + c^2} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{a t + b}{c} \right) + d &lt;/math&gt;

for a set of constants ''a, b, c, d'' determined by initial conditions.
Thus, indeed, ''the solution is a straight line'' given in polar coordinates: ''a'' is the velocity, ''c'' is the distance of the closest approach to the origin, and ''d'' is the angle of motion.

==Applied to deformable bodies==
Hamilton's principle is an important variational principle in [[Linear elasticity|elastodynamics]]. As opposed to a system composed of rigid bodies, deformable bodies have an infinite number of degrees of freedom and occupy continuous regions of space; consequently, the state of the system is described by using continuous functions of space and time. The extended Hamilton Principle for such bodies is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left[ \delta W_e + \delta T - \delta U \right]dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the kinetic energy, ''U'' is the elastic energy, ''W&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the work done by
external loads on the body, and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the initial and final times. If the system is conservative, the work done by external forces may be derived from a scalar potential ''V''. In this case,

: &lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left[ T - (U + V) \right]dt = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This is called Hamilton's principle and it is invariant under coordinate transformations.

==Comparison with Maupertuis' principle==

Hamilton's principle and [[Maupertuis' principle]] are occasionally confused and both have been called (incorrectly) the [[principle of least action]].  They differ in three important ways: 
* ''their definition of the [[action (physics)|action]]...'' 
:Maupertuis' principle uses an integral over the [[generalized coordinates]] known as the '''abbreviated action''' or [[reduced action]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; 
:where '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') are the conjugate momenta defined above.  By contrast, Hamilton's principle uses &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] over [[time]].

*''the solution that they determine...''
:Hamilton's principle determines the trajectory '''q'''(''t'') as a function of time, whereas Maupertuis' principle determines only the shape of the trajectory in the generalized coordinates.  For example, Maupertuis' principle determines the shape of the ellipse on which a particle moves under the influence of an inverse-square central force such as [[gravitation|gravity]], but does not describe ''per se'' how the particle moves along that trajectory.  (However, this time parameterization may be determined from the trajectory itself in subsequent calculations using the [[conservation of energy]]).  By contrast, Hamilton's principle directly specifies the motion along the ellipse as a function of time.

*''...and the constraints on the variation.''
:Maupertuis' principle requires that the two endpoint states ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be given and that energy be conserved along every trajectory (same energy for each trajectory). This forces the endpoint times to be varied as well. By contrast, Hamilton's principle does not require the conservation of energy, but does require that the endpoint times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be specified as well as the endpoint states ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Action principle for fields==

===Classical field theory===

{{main|Classical field theory}}

The '''action principle''' can be extended to obtain the [[equations of motion]] for [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]] or [[Einstein–Hilbert action|gravity]].

The [[Einstein equation]] utilizes the ''[[Einstein–Hilbert action]]'' as constrained by a [[variational principle]].

The path of a body in a gravitational field (i.e. free fall in space time, a so-called geodesic) can be found using the action principle.

===Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory===

{{main|Quantum field theory}}

In [[quantum mechanics]], the system does not follow a single path whose action is stationary, but the behavior of the system depends on all imaginable paths and the value of their action. The action corresponding to the various paths is used to calculate the [[Path integral formulation|path integral]], that gives the [[probability amplitude]]s of the various outcomes.

Although equivalent in classical mechanics with [[Newton's laws]], the '''action principle''' is better suited for generalizations and plays an important role in modern physics.  Indeed, this principle is one of the great generalizations in physical science. In particular, it is fully appreciated and best understood within [[quantum mechanics]]. [[Richard Feynman]]'s [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics is based on a stationary-action principle, using path integrals. [[Maxwell's equations]] can be derived as conditions of stationary action.

[[File:USDAHardiness 2012-2015 Scale.jpg|alt=(See table below)|thumb|Temperature scale used to define USDA hardiness zones. These are '''annual''' '''extreme minimums''' (an area is assigned to a zone by taking the lowest temperature recorded there in a given year). As shown, the USDA uses a GIS dataset averaged over 1976 to 2005 for its United States maps.]]
A '''hardiness zone''' is a geographic area defined to encompass a certain range of climatic conditions relevant to plant growth and survival.

The original and most widely-used system, developed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) as a rough guide for landscaping and gardening, defines 13 zones by annual extreme minimum temperature. It has been adapted by and to other countries (such as Canada) in various forms.

Unless otherwise specified, "hardiness zone" or simply "zone" usually refers to the USDA scale. For example, a plant may be described as "hardy to zone 10": this means that the plant can withstand a minimum temperature of -1&amp;nbsp;°C (30.2&amp;nbsp;°F) to 3.9&amp;nbsp;°C (39.0&amp;nbsp;°F).

Other hardiness rating schemes have been developed as well, such as the UK Royal Horticultural Society and US Sunset Western Garden Book systems.

==United States hardiness zones (USDA scale)==
{{anchor|USDA hardiness zones}}
The USDA system was originally developed to aid gardeners and landscapers in the United States.

State-by-state maps, along with an electronic system that allows finding the zone for a particular zip code, can be found at the [http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Default.aspx USDA Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) website.]

In the United States, most of the warmer zones (zones 9, 10, and 11) are located in the deep southern half of the country and on the southern coastal margins. Higher zones can be found in [[Hawaii]] (up to 12) and [[Puerto Rico]] (up to 13). The middle portion of the mainland and central and northern coastal areas are in the middle zones (zones 8, 7, and 6). The far northern portion on the central interior of the mainland have some of the coldest zones (zones 5, 4, and small area of zone 3) and often have much less consistent range of temperatures in winter due to being more continental, and thus the zone map has its limitations in these areas. Lower zones can be found in [[Alaska]] (down to 1). The low latitude and often stable weather in [[Florida]], the [[Gulf Coast]], and southern [[Arizona]] and [[California]], are responsible for the few episodes of severe cold relative to normal in those areas. The [[Pacific Ocean]] keeps the [[Pacific Northwest#Climate|Pacific Northwest]] in warmer zones than nearby inland areas.  The warmest zone in the [[Contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]] is the [[Florida Keys]] (11b) and the coldest is in north-central [[Minnesota]] (3a).

===History===
The first attempts to create a geographical hardiness zone system were undertaken by two researchers at the [[Arnold Arboretum]] in [[Boston]]: the first was published in 1927 by Alfred Rehder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernald|first=M. L.|date=1927|editor-last=Rehder|editor-first=Alfred|title=Rehder's Manual of Cultivated Trees and Shrubs|jstor=23298457|journal=Rhodora|volume=29|issue=339|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second by Donald Wyman in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hedges_Screens_Windbreaks.html?id=IXPZAAAAMAAJ|title=Hedges, Screens &amp; Windbreaks: Their Uses, Selection and Care|last=Wyman|first=Donald|date=1938|publisher=McGraw-Hill|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arnold map was subsequently updated in 1951, 1967, and finally 1971, but eventually fell out of use completely.

The modern USDA system began at the [[United States National Arboretum|US National Arboretum]] in [[Washington, DC|Washington]]. The first map was issued in 1960, and revised in 1965. It used uniform 10 degree Fahrenheit ranges, and gradually became widespread among American gardeners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.plantdelights.com/blogs/articles/plant-hardiness-zone-maps|title=History of Plant Hardiness Zone Maps - The Rest of the Story|work=Plant Delights Nursery|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Del Tredici|first=Peter|date=1990|title=The New USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/1990-50-3-the-new-usda-plant-hardiness-zone-map.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=50 |issue=3|pages=16–20|via=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDA map was revised and reissued in 1990 with freshly available climate data, this time with 5-degree distinctions dividing each zone into new "a" and "b" subdivisions.

In 2003, the [[American Horticultural Society]] (AHS) produced a draft revised map, using temperature data collected from July 1986 to March 2002. The 2003 map placed many areas approximately a half-zone higher (warmer) than the USDA's 1990 map. Reviewers noted the map zones appeared to be closer to the original USDA 1960 map in its overall zone delineations. Their map purported to show finer detail, for example, reflecting [[urban heat island]]s by showing the downtown areas of several cities (e.g., [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]) as a full zone warmer than outlying areas. The map excluded the detailed a/b half-zones introduced in the USDA's 1990 map, an omission widely criticized by horticulturists and gardeners due to the coarseness of the resulting map. The USDA rejected the AHS 2003 draft map and created its own map in an interactive computer format, that the [[American Horticultural Society]] now uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://ahsgardening.org/gardening-resources/gardening-maps/hardiness-map|publisher=American Horticultural Society|accessdate=8 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208070740/http://ahsgardening.org/gardening-resources/gardening-maps/hardiness-map|archivedate=8 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Arbor Day Foundation]] released an update of U.S. hardiness zones, using mostly the same data as the AHS. It revised hardiness zones, reflecting generally warmer recent temperatures in many parts of the country, and appeared similar to the AHS 2003 draft. The Foundation also did away with the more detailed a/b half-zone delineations.&lt;ref name="Arbor Day Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arborday.org/media/zonechanges2006.cfm |title=New arborday.org Hardiness Zone Map reflects warmer climate : Latest hardiness zones, based on most current temperature data available, suggest up-to-date choices for best trees to plant |accessdate=2007-12-27 |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228234728/http://www.arborday.org/media/zonechanges2006.cfm |archivedate=2007-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the USDA updated their plant hardiness map based on 1976–2005 weather data, using a longer period of data to smooth out year-to-year weather fluctuations.&lt;ref name="USDA"&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map, 2012|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov|website=Agricultural Research Service|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=7 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024112311/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two new zones were added to better define and improve information sharing on tropical and semitropical plants, they also appear on the maps of Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  The map has a higher resolution than previous ones, and is able to show local variations due to things such as elevation or large bodies of water.  Many zone boundaries were changed as a result of the more recent data, as well as new mapping methods and additional information gathered.  Many areas were a half zone warmer than the previous 1990 map.&lt;ref name="USDAWhatsNew"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's New &amp;#124; USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/AboutWhatsNew.aspx|website=Agricultural Research Service|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=7 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019072431/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/AboutWhatsNew.aspx|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 map was created [[Geographic information system|digitally]] for the internet, and includes a [[ZIP Code]] zone finder and an interactive map.&lt;ref name="planthardiness.ars.usda.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/About.aspx|title=About {{!}} USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=planthardiness.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weekendgardener.net/garden-plants/history.of.usda.hardiness.zones.htm|title=History of USDA Hardiness Zones|website=www.weekendgardener.net|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
As the USDA system is based entirely on average annual extreme minimum temperature in an area, it is limited in its ability to describe the climatic conditions a gardener may have to account for in a particular area: there are many other factors that determine whether or not a given plant can survive in a given zone.

Zone information alone is often not adequate for predicting winter survival, since factors such as frost dates and frequency of snow cover can vary widely between regions. Even the extreme minimum itself may not be useful when comparing regions in widely different [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]]. As an extreme example, most of the United Kingdom is in zones 8-9, while in the US, zones 8-9 include regions such as the subtropical coastal areas of the [[southeastern US]] and [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] and [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]] inland deserts, thus an American gardener in such an area may only have to plan for several days of cold temperatures per year, while their British counterpart may have to plan for several months.

In addition, the zones do not incorporate any information about summer temperature or [[insolation]]; thus sites which may have the same mean winter minima, but markedly different summer temperatures, will be accorded the same hardiness zone. For example, zone 8 covers coastal, high latitude, cool summer  locations like [[Seattle]] and [[London]],  as well as lower latitude, hot summer climates like [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Madrid, Spain|Madrid]]. Farmers, gardeners, and landscapers in the former two must plan for entirely different growing seasons from those in the latter.

In the colder zones, another issue is that the hardiness scales do not take into account the reliability of snow cover. Snow acts as an insulator against extreme cold, protecting the root system of hibernating plants. If the snow cover is reliable, the actual temperature to which the roots are exposed will not be as low as the hardiness zone number would indicate. As an example, [[Quebec City]] in Canada is located in zone 4, but can rely on a significant snow cover every year, making it possible to cultivate plants normally rated for zones 5 or 6. But, in [[Montreal]], located to the southwest in zone 5, it is sometimes difficult to cultivate plants adapted to the zone because of the unreliable snow cover.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Another problem is that many plants may survive in a locality but will not flower if the day length is insufficient or if they require [[vernalization]] (a particular duration of low temperature).

There are many other climate parameters that a farmer, gardener, or landscaper may need to take into account as well, such as humidity, precipitation, storms, rainy-dry cycles or monsoons, and site considerations such as soil type, soil drainage and water retention, water table, tilt towards or away from the sun, natural or manmade protection from excesssive sun, snow, frost, and wind, etc. The annual extreme minimum temperature is a useful indicator, but ultimately only one factor among many for plant growth and survival.&lt;ref name="planthardiness.ars.usda.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenney|first=Daniel W.|last2=Pedlar|first2=John H.|last3=Lawrence|first3=Kevin|last4=Campbell|first4=Kathy|last5=Hutchinson|first5=Michael F.|date=2007-12-01|title=Beyond Traditional Hardiness Zones: Using Climate Envelopes to Map Plant Range Limits|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/57/11/929/234249|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=57|issue=11|pages=929–937|doi=10.1641/B571105|issn=1525-3244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
An alternative means of describing plant hardiness is to use "indicator plants". In this method, common plants with known limits to their range are used.

''[[Sunset Magazine|Sunset]]'' publishes a series that breaks up climate zones more finely than the USDA zones, identifying 45 distinct zones in the US, incorporating ranges of temperatures in all seasons, precipitation, wind patterns, elevation, and length and structure of the growing season.&lt;ref name="sunset"&gt;''Sunset National Garden Book''. Sunset Books Inc. Menlo Park, California (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the [[Köppen climate classification|Koppen climate classification system]] can be used as a more general guide to growing conditions when considering large areas of the Earth's surface or attempting to make comparisons between different continents.

=== Climate change projections ===
Recent research suggests that USDA plant hardiness zones will shift northward under climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Lauren E.|last2=Abatzoglou|first2=John T.|date=2016|title=Projected changes in cold hardiness zones and suitable overwinter ranges of perennial crops over the United States|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/11/i=3/a=034001|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=034001|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/034001|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European hardiness zones==

===Ireland and UK===
[[File:UK zonemap.png|thumb|Britain and Ireland's hardiness zones]]
Owing to the moderating effect of the [[North Atlantic Current]] on the Irish and British [[temperate]] [[maritime climate]], Britain, and Ireland even more so, have milder winters than their northerly position would otherwise afford. This means that the hardiness zones relevant to Britain and Ireland are quite high, from 7 to 10, as shown below.

*7. In Scotland the [[Grampian Mountains|Grampians]], Highlands and locally in the [[Southern Uplands]], in England the [[Pennines]], and in Wales the highest part of [[Snowdonia]].
*8. Most of England, Wales and Scotland, parts of central Ireland, and [[Snaefell]] on the [[Isle of Man]].
*9. Most of western and southern England and Wales, western Scotland, also a very narrow coastal fringe on the east coast of Scotland and northeast England (within {{convert|5|km}} of the [[North Sea]]), London, the West Midlands Urban Area, most of Ireland, and most of the Isle of Man.
*10. Very low-lying coastal areas of the southwest of Ireland and the [[Isles of Scilly]].

USDA zones do not work particularly well in the UK as they are designed for a continental climate.&lt;ref name=crawford2010 /&gt; The cooler UK summers must be considered. New growth may be insufficient or fail to [[Cold hardening|harden off]] affecting winter survival.&lt;ref name=crawford2010&gt;{{cite book |author1=Martin Crawford |title=Creating a forest garden : working with nature to grow edible crops |date=2010 |publisher=Green Books |isbn=9781900322621 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOt_QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012 the United Kingdom's Royal Horticultural Society introduced new hardiness ratings for plants, from H7, the hardiest (tolerant of temperatures below {{convert|-20|°C}}) to H1a (needing temperatures above {{convert|15|°C}}).&lt;ref name=RHS&gt;{{cite web|title=RHS hardiness rating|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/trials-awards/award-of-garden-merit/rhs-hardiness-rating|website=RHS hardiness rating|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=24 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925021320/https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/trials-awards/award-of-garden-merit/rhs-hardiness-rating|archivedate=25 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RHS hardiness ratings are based on absolute minimum winter temperatures (in °C) rather than the long-term average annual extreme minimum temperatures that define USDA zones.&lt;ref name=RHS /&gt;

===Scandinavia===
Scandinavia lies at the same latitude as Alaska or Greenland, but the effect of the warm [[North Atlantic Current]] is even more pronounced here than it is in Britain and Ireland. Save for a very small spot near [[Karasjok]], Norway, which is in zone 2, nowhere in the Arctic part of Scandinavia does it get below zone 3. The [[Faroe Islands]], at 62–63°N are in zone 8, as are the outer [[Lofoten Islands]] at 68°N. [[Tromsø]], a coastal city in Norway at 70°N, is in zone 7, and even [[Longyearbyen]], the northernmost true city in the world at 78°N, is still in zone 5. All these coastal locations have one thing in common, though, which are cold, damp summers, with temperatures rarely exceeding {{convert|20|C}}, or {{convert|15|C}} in Longyearbyen. This shows the importance of taking heat zones into account for better understanding of what may or may not grow.

[[File:Osterlengarden.jpg|thumb|A garden in [[Simrishamn]], southern [[Sweden]].]]

In Sweden and Finland generally, at sea level to {{convert|500|m}}, zone 3 is north of the Arctic Circle, including cities like [[Karesuando]], [[Pajala]], and [[Rovaniemi]]. [[Kiruna]] is the major exception here, which being located on a hill above frost traps, is in zone 5. Zone 4 lies between the Arctic Circle and about 64–65°N, with cities such as [[Oulu]] and [[Jokkmokk]], zone 5 (south to 61–62°N) contains cities such as [[Tampere]], [[Umeå]], and [[Östersund]]. Zone 6 covers the south of mainland Finland, Sweden north of 60°N, and the high plateau of [[Småland]] further south. Here one will find cities such as [[Gävle]], [[Örebro]], [[Sundsvall]], and [[Helsinki]]. The [[Åland Islands]], as well as coastal southern Sweden, and the [[Stockholm]] area are in zone 7. The west coast of Sweden ([[Gothenburg]] and southwards) enjoys particularly mild winters and lies in zone 7, therefore being friendly to some hardy exotic species (found, for example, in the [[Gothenburg Botanical Garden]]), the southeast coast of Sweden has a colder winter due to the absence of the Gulf Stream.

Denmark is in zones 9a, 8b, and 8a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-denmark-plant-hardiness-zone-map-celsius.php|title=Denmark Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|author=|date=|website=www.plantmaps.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011101638/http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-denmark-plant-hardiness-zone-map-celsius.php|archivedate=11 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe===
Central Europe is a good example of a transition from an [[oceanic climate]] to a [[continental climate]], which can be noticed immediately when looking at the hardiness zones, which tend to decrease mainly eastwards instead of northwards. Also, the plateaux and low mountain ranges in this region have a significant impact on how cold it might get during winter. Generally speaking, the hardiness zones are high considering the latitude of the region, although not as high as in the Shetland Islands where zone 9 extends to over 60°N. In Central Europe, the relevant zones decrease from zone 8 on the Belgian, Dutch, and German [[North Sea]] coast, with the exception of some of the [[Frisian Islands]] (notably [[Vlieland]] and [[Terschelling]]), the island of [[Helgoland]], and some of the islands in the [[Rhine]]-[[Scheldt]] estuary, which are in zone 9, to zone 5 around [[Suwałki]], [[województwo podlaskie|Podlachia]] on the far eastern border between [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]]. Some isolated, high elevation areas of the [[Alps]] and [[Carpathians]] may even go down to zone 3 or 4. An extreme example of a cold sink is [[Funtensee]], [[Bavaria]] which is at least in zone 3 and maybe even in zone 1 or 2. Another notable example is [[Waksmund]], a small village in the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Carpathians]], which regularly reaches {{convert|-35|C}} during winter on calm nights when cold and heavy airmasses from the surrounding [[Gorce Mountains|Gorce]] and [[Tatra Mountains]] descend down the slopes to this low-lying valley, creating extremes which can be up to {{convert|10|°C}}  colder than nearby [[Nowy Targ]] or [[Białka Tatrzańska]], which are both higher up in elevation. Waksmund is in zone 3b while nearby [[Kraków]], only {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} to the north and {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} lower is in zone 6a. These examples prove that local topography can have a pronounced effect on temperature and thus on what is possible to grow in a specific region.

===Southern Europe===
The southern European marker plant for climate as well as cultural indicator is the [[olive tree]], which cannot withstand long periods below freezing so its cultivation area matches the cool winter zone.  The [[Mediterranean Sea]] acts as a temperature regulator, so this area is generally warmer than other parts of the continent; except in mountainous areas where the sea effect lowers, it belongs in zones 8–10; however, southern Balkans (mountainous Western and Eastern [[Serbia]], continental [[Croatia]], and [[Bulgaria]]) are colder in winter and are in zones 6–7. The Croatian ([[Dalmatia]]n) coast, [[Albania]], and northern [[Greece]] are in zones 8–9, as are central-northern [[Italy]] (hills and some spots in [[Po Valley]] are however colder) and southern [[France]]; Central [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] is 8–9 (some areas are slightly colder). The [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Atlantic coast, most of [[Andalusia]] and [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], almost all the [[Valencian Community]], a part of [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], southwestern [[Sardinia]], most of [[Sicily]], coastal southern Italy, and southwestern Greece are in zone 10. The islands of [[Malta]] and [[Lampedusa]] belong to zone 11a.

==Australian hardiness zones==

The USDA hardiness zones are in use in Australia, but in addition the Australian National Botanic Gardens have devised another system more in keeping with Australian conditions.&lt;ref name="Australian National Botanic Gardens"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/gardens/research/hort.research/zones.html |title=Plant Hardiness Zones for Australia |accessdate=2010-11-11 |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210130241/http://anbg.gov.au/gardens/research/hort.research/zones.html |archivedate=2010-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are numerically about 6 lower than the USDA system. For example, Australian zone 3 is roughly equivalent to USDA zone 9. The higher Australian zone numbers have no US equivalents.

There are problems with classifications of this type: the spread of weather stations is insufficient to give clear zones and too many places with different climates are lumped together. Only 738 Australian stations have records of more than ten years (one station per {{convert|98491|ha|disp=or}}), though more populated areas have relatively fewer hectares per station. Local factors such as aspect, altitude, proximity to the sea also complicate the matter. For example, [[Mount Isa]] has three climatic stations with more than a ten-year record. One is in zone 4a, one in zone 4b, and the other is in zone 5a. Likewise, Sydney residents are split between zones 3a and 4b. Most other cities have similar problems. Different locations in the same city are suitable for different plants, making it hard to draw a meaningful map without publishing a list of weather stations and their zone classification to allow best use of local conditions.

==Canadian hardiness zones==

Climate variables that reflect the capacity and detriments to plant growth are used to develop an index that is mapped to Canada's Plant Hardiness Zones.&lt;ref name="Natural Resources Canada Plant Hardiness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Resources Canada - Plant Hardiness of Canada|url=http://www.planthardiness.gc.ca/|website=Natural Resources Canada - Plant Hardiness of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629173949/http://www.planthardiness.gc.ca/|archivedate=29 June 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This index comes from a formula originally developed by Ouellet and Sherk in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Ouellet, C.E., Sherk, L.C. 1967a. Woody ornamental plant zonation I. Indices of winter hardiness. Can J. Plant Sci. 47:231-238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ouellet, C.E., Sherk, L.C. 1967b. Woody ornamental plant zonation. II. Suitability indices of localities. Can J. Plant Sci. 47: 339-349.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ouellet, C.E., Sherk, L.C. 1967c. Woody ornamental plant zonation III. Suitability map for the probable winter survival of ornamental trees and shrubs. Can J. Plant Sci. 47: 351-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula used:

Y = -67.62 + 1.734X₁ + 0.1868X₂ + 69.77X₃ + 1.256X₄ + 0.006119X₅ + 22.37X₆ - 0.01832X₇

where: 
Y = estimated index of suitability 
X₁ = monthly mean of the daily minimum temperatures (°C) of the coldest month
X₂ = mean frost free period above 0&amp;nbsp;°C in days
X₃ = amount of rainfall (R) from June to November, inclusive, in terms of R/(R+a) where a=25.4 if R is in millimeters and a=1 if R is in inches
X₄ = monthly mean of the daily maximum temperatures (°C) of the warmest month
X₅ = winter factor expressed in terms of (0&amp;nbsp;°C - X₁)Rjan where Rjan represents the rainfall in January expressed in mm
X₆ = mean maximum snow depth in terms of S/(S+a) where a=25.4 if S is in millimeters and a=1 if S is in inches
X₇ = maximum wind gust in (km/hr) in 30 years.

For practical purposes, Canada has adopted the American hardiness zone classification system.  The 1990 version of the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map included Canada and Mexico, but they were removed with the 2012 update to focus on the United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="USDAWhatsNew" /&gt;

==American Horticultural Society heat zones==

In addition to the USDA Hardiness zones there are [[American Horticultural Society]] (AHS) heat zones.

The criterion is the average number of days per year when the temperature exceeds {{convert|30|C}}. The AHS Heat Zone Map for the US is available on the American Horticultural Society website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahsgardening.org/gardening-resources/gardening-maps/heat-zone-map|title=AHS Plant Heat Zone Map|publisher=American Horticultural Society|accessdate=2017-05-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516031634/http://ahsgardening.org/gardening-resources/gardening-maps/heat-zone-map|archivedate=2017-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Hamilton Gardener''' (1853–1925), born Alice Chenoweth, was an American author, [[rationalism|rationalist]] [[public intellectual]], [[political activist]], and government functionary. Gardener produced many lectures, articles, and books during the 1880s and 1890s and is remembered today for her role in the [[freethought]] and [[women's suffrage]] movements and for her place as a pioneering female in the top echelon of the American [[civil service]].

==Biography==

===Early years===

Alice Chenoweth, best remembered by her [[pseudonym|pen name]], Helen Hamilton Gardener, was born near [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], [[Virginia]], on January 21, 1853. She was the youngest of six children born to Rev. Alfred Griffith Chenoweth, an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] minister who had become a [[Methodist]] [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]], and his wife, the former Katherine A. Peel.&lt;ref name=NAW&gt;Adelaide Washburn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;lpg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=helen+h.+gardener+suffragette+1853+1925&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m9CKnMR9ek&amp;sig=zqMO_AohHgfUu2F_nE42nBiv69Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=paPRTP-mPIK8lQeo_KDzDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=helen%20h.%20gardener%20suffragette%201853%201925&amp;f=false "Helen Hamilton Gardener,"] in Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, and Paul S. Boyer (eds.), ''Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 2.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1974; pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chenoweth family traced its American antecedents back to a certain Arthur Chenoweth who had arrived in the fledgling [[Province of Maryland]] in 1635 to receive a grant of land for honorable service to [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]].&lt;ref name=NCAB&gt;"Helen Hamilton Gardener," in ''The National Cyclopaedia of America Biography: Volume 9.'' New York: James T. White and Co., 1899; pg. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chenoweth family subsequently made their way to [[Virginia]], where Alice's father had inherited [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; As objectors to the institution of slavery, the Chenoweths [[manumission|manumitted]] their slaves in 1853 over the existing legal obstacles to that course of action.&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; The family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; This was followed in 1855 by a move to [[Greencastle, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], Chenoweth's father served the Federal cause, returning to the enemy state of Virginia to serve as a guide for Union troops there.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;

Alice Chenoweth received an excellent education and showed an interest in and aptitude for science and [[sociology]].&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; She associated with older people as a girl and read extensively on serious themes.&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; She studied with [[tutors]] and attended various local schools, moving to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in her late teen years, where she graduated high school.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; After leaving high school Chenoweth enrolled in the [[Cincinnati Normal School]], from which she graduated in June 1873.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;

Chenoweth worked as a schoolteacher for two years, giving up the profession (as was generally the case in the day) when she married in 1875.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; Her first husband, Charles Selden Smart, was nearly two decades her senior and served at the time as Ohio State School Commissioner.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; The couple moved to [[New York City]] in 1880, where Charles entered the [[insurance]] business while Alice attended [[biology]] courses at [[Columbia University]], albeit not in pursuit of a degree.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; Chenoweth-Smart also lectured on sociology as part of the [[adult education]] program at the [[Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]] and tried her hand at writing for local newspapers under a variety of masculine pseudonyms.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;

===Literary career===
During her first years in New York City Chenoweth-Smart made the acquaintance of [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], the leading  [[rationalism|rationalist]] orator of the day.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; At Ingersoll's persistent request in January 1884 Alice Chenoweth-Smart began herself to deliver a series of public lectures,&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; talks dealing with such skeptical themes as "Men, Women, and Gods," "Historical Facts and Theological Fictions," "By Divine Right," and "Rome or Reason."&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; Many of these were collected into her first book, ''Men, Women, and Gods, and Other Lectures,'' which was issued in hard covers by the radical [[freethought]] publication, ''[[The Truth Seeker]].''&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; Chenoweth-Smart published this book under the pen name "Helen Hamilton Gardener" — a pseudonym which she would use professionally for the rest of her life, eventually adopting this as her own legal name.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;

A number of short stories and essays by Gardener followed over the second half of the 1880s, pieces which were published in a number of leading magazines of the day.&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; Throughout the period, Gardener's interest in [[feminism]] grew.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; Gardener's initial public lectures attempted particularly to demonstrate a linkage between [[Christianity]] and the subjugation of women and in 1887 the published views of former [[Surgeon General of the United States]] [[William A. Hammond]] attesting a neurological basis for female inferiority moved Gardener to even greater concern with the topic.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;

Gardener began working with [[neurologist]] [[Edward C. Spitzka]] to refute Hammond's thesis of inherent inferiority of the female brain.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; Gardener ultimately produced a paper entitled "Sex in Brain" that was read to the 1888 convention of the [[International Council of Women]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; In this work, Gardener argued that no connection between brain weight and intellectual capacity had been established and challenged Hammond's methodology of comparing the prized specimen brains of leading men with those of indigent women.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; Gardener emerged from the Hammond controversy as a leading public speaker for women's rights. In 1893 she would deliver three more scholarly papers on feminist themes to the [[Congress of Representative Women]] held in [[Chicago]] in conjunction with the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;

During the early 1890s, Gardener emerged as a novelist. A pair of books were written which together dealt with the theme of the [[double standard]] of morality between the sexes — ''Is This Your Son, My Lord?'' (1891) and ''Pray You Sir, Whose Daughter?''&lt;ref name=NCAB /&gt; Both were published by a leading liberal political magazine of the day, [[The Arena (American magazine)|''The Arena'']]. ''Is This Your Son, My Lord?'' was sharply critical of the low [[age of consent]] then in force and the ruin of innocence by the lustful desires of outwardly respectable men.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; The book sold an impressive 25,000 copies in its first five months after publication and elicited shocked commentary from critics and readers alike.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;
[[File:Helen H. Gardener (1894).png|thumb|Helen H. Gardener (1894)]]
In 1894, Gardener published a slightly fictionalized account of her father's life entitled ''An Unofficial Patriot.''&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; The book's protagonist, patterned after her father, represented a positive male character at variance with those which dominated Gardener's earlier books.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; The book was critically well received and served as the basis for an 1899 play by [[playwright]] [[James A. Herne]], ''The Reverend Griffith Davenport.''.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;

===Political career===
[[File:Gardener-Catt-1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Helen Hamilton Gardener (left) exiting the White House with American feminist leader [[Carrie Chapman Catt (1920)]].]]
In 1907, Gardener returned to Washington, D.C., where she took up the [[suffrage]] cause. In 1913 she was appointed a position to the Congressional Committee of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], becoming, six years later, its vice-chairwoman; she was elected as one of NAWSA's vice-presidents as chief liaison under the [[Woodrow Wilson]] administration, in 1917.

In 1920, Wilson appointed her to the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], the first woman to occupy such a high federal position.

===Death and legacy===

Gardener died in July 1925 in [[Washington, D.C.]] of chronic [[myocarditis]].&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt; Keeping with her interest in the topic, Gardener's brain was donated for scientific study before her body was [[cremation|cremated]] and its ashes interred at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] beside the grave of her second husband.&lt;ref name=NAW /&gt;

Gardener's papers are housed at the [[Schlesinger Library]] of [[Harvard University]] at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] as part of its Woman's Rights Collection. An online finding aid of this material, which is encompassed in eight archival folders, is available.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch01023 Helen H.

Gardener's brain is part of the [[Wilder Brain Collection]] at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10083">[[File:MorinSurfaceAsSphere'sInsideVersusOutside.PNG|thumb|The homotopy principle generalizes such results as Smale's proof of [[sphere eversion]].]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''homotopy principle''' (or '''h-principle''') is a very general way to solve [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs), and more generally [[partial differential relation]]s (PDRs).  The h-principle is good for [[underdetermined system|underdetermined]] PDEs or PDRs, such as occur in the [[immersion problem]], [[isometric immersion problem]], fluid dynamics, and other areas.

The theory was started by [[Yakov Eliashberg]], [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]] and [[Anthony V. Phillips]]. It was based on earlier results that reduced partial differential relations to [[homotopy]], particularly for immersions. The first evidence of h-principle appeared in the [[Whitney–Graustein theorem]]. This was followed by the Nash-Kuiper Isometric &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; embedding theorem and the Smale-Hirsch Immersion theorem.

==Rough idea==

Assume we want to find a function ''&amp;fnof;'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; which satisfies a partial differential equation of degree ''k'', in co-ordinates &lt;math&gt;(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m)&lt;/math&gt;. One can rewrite it as

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m, J^k_f)=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J^k_f&lt;/math&gt; stands for all partial derivatives of ''&amp;fnof;'' up to order&amp;nbsp;''k''. Let us exchange every variable in &lt;math&gt;J^k_f&lt;/math&gt; for new independent variables &lt;math&gt;y_1,y_2,\dots,y_N.&lt;/math&gt;
Then our original equation can be thought as a system of

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{}_{}(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_N)=0&lt;/math&gt;

and some number of equations of the following type 
:&lt;math&gt;y_j={\partial^k f\over \partial u_{j_1}\ldots\partial u_{j_k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A solution of

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{}_{}(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_N)=0&lt;/math&gt;

is called a '''non-holonomic solution''', and a solution of the system (which is a solution of our original PDE) is called a '''holonomic solution'''.

In order to check whether a solution exists, first check if there is a non-holonomic solution (usually it is quite easy and if not then our original equation did not have any solutions).

A PDE ''satisfies the h-principle'' if any non-holonomic solution can be [[homotopy|deformed]] into a holonomic one in the class of non-holonomic solutions. Thus in the presence of h-principle, a differential topological problem reduces to an algebraic topological problem. More explicitly this means that apart from the topological obstruction there is no other obstruction to the existence of a holonomic solution. The topological problem of finding a ''non-holonomic solution'' is much easier to handle and can be addressed with the obstruction theory for topological bundles.

Many underdetermined partial differential equations satisfy the h-principle. However, the falsity of an h-principle is also an interesting statement, intuitively this means the objects being studied have non-trivial geometry that cannot be reduced to topology. As an example, embedded [[Lagrangian submanifold|Lagrangians]] in a symplectic manifold do not satisfy an h-principle, to prove this one needs to find invariants coming from [[Pseudoholomorphic curve|pseudo-holomorphic curves]].

== Simple examples ==

=== Monotone functions ===
Perhaps the simplest partial differential relation is for the derivative to not vanish: &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt; Properly, this is an ''ordinary'' differential relation, as this is a function in one variable. 

A holonomic solution to this relation is a function whose derivative is nowhere vanishing.  I.e., a strictly monotone differentiable functions, either increasing or decreasing.  The space of such functions consists of two disjoint [[convex set]]s: the increasing ones and the decreasing ones, and has the homotopy type of two points.

A non-holonomic solution to this relation would consist in the data of two functions, a differentiable function f(x), and a continuous function g(x), with g(x) nowhere vanishing.  A holonomic solution gives rise to a non-holonomic solution by taking g(x) = f'(x).  The space of non-holonomic solutions again consists of two disjoint convex sets, according as g(x) is positive or negative.  

Thus the inclusion of holonomic into non-holonomic solutions satisfies the h-principle. 

[[File:Winding Number Around Point.svg|thumb|The [[Whitney–Graustein theorem]] shows that immersions of the circle in the plane satisfy an h-principle, expressed by [[turning number]].]]
This trivial example has nontrivial generalizations:
extending this to immersions of a circle into itself classifies them by order (or [[winding number]]), by lifting the map to the [[universal covering space]] and applying the above analysis to the resulting monotone map – the linear map corresponds to multiplying angle: &lt;math&gt;\theta \mapsto n\theta&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;z \mapsto z^n&lt;/math&gt; in complex numbers). Note that here there are no immersions of order 0, as those would need to turn back on themselves. Extending this to circles immersed in the plane – the immersion condition is precisely the condition that the derivative does not vanish – the [[Whitney–Graustein theorem]] classified these by [[turning number]] by considering the homotopy class of the [[Gauss map]] and showing that this satisfies an h-principle; here again order 0 is more complicated.

Smale's classification of immersions of spheres as the homotopy groups of [[Stiefel manifold]]s, and Hirsch's generalization of this to immersions of manifolds being classified as homotopy classes of maps of [[frame bundle]]s are much further-reaching generalizations, and much more involved, but similar in principle – immersion requires the derivative to have rank ''k,'' which requires the partial derivatives in each direction to not vanish and to be linearly independent, and the resulting analog of the Gauss map is a map to the Stiefel manifold, or more generally between frame bundles.

=== A car in the plane ===
As another simple example, consider a car moving in the plane. The position of a car in the plane is determined by three parameters: two coordinates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; for the location (a good choice is the location of the midpoint between the back wheels) and an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which describes the orientation of the car. The motion of the car satisfies the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\dot x \sin\alpha=\dot y\cos \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
since a non-skidding car must move in the direction of its wheels. In [[robotics]] terms, not all paths in the task space are [[holonomic (robotics)|holonomic]].

A non-holonomic solution in this case, roughly speaking, corresponds to a motion of the car by sliding in the plane. In this case the non-holonomic solutions are not only [[homotopic]] to holonomic ones but also can be arbitrarily well approximated by the holonomic ones (by going back and forth, like parallel parking in a limited space) – note that this approximates both the position and the angle of the car arbitrarily closely. This implies that, theoretically, it is possible to parallel park in any space longer than the length of your car. It also implies that, in a contact 3 manifold, any curve is &lt;math&gt;C^0&lt;/math&gt;-close to a [[Legendrian knot|Legendrian]] curve.
This last property is stronger than the general h-principle; it is called the &lt;math&gt;C^0&lt;/math&gt;-'''dense h-principle'''.

While this example is simple, compare to the [[Nash embedding theorem]], specifically the [[Nash–Kuiper theorem]], which says that any [[short map|short]] smooth (&lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;) embedding or immersion of &lt;math&gt;M^m&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{m+1}&lt;/math&gt; or larger can be arbitrarily well approximated by an isometric &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt;-embedding (respectively, immersion). This is also a dense h-principle, and can be proven by an essentially similar "wrinkling" – or rather, circling – technique to the car in the plane, though it is much more involved.

==Ways to prove the h-principle==
*[[Removal of Singularities]] technique developed by Gromov and Eliashberg
*[[Sheaf technique]] based on the work of Smale and Hirsch.
*[[Convex integration]] based on the work of Nash and Kuiper

==Some paradoxes==

Here we list a few counter-intuitive results which can be proved by applying the 
h-principle:

*'''Cone Eversion'''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Fuchs, S. Tabachnikov, ''Mathematical Omnibus: Thirty Lectures on Classic Mathematics''&lt;/ref&gt; Let us consider functions ''f'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; without origin ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''x''|. Then there is a continuous one-parameter family of functions &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_0=f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_1=-f&lt;/math&gt; and for any &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{grad}(f_t)&lt;/math&gt; is not zero at any point.
*Any open manifold admits a (non-complete) Riemannian metric of positive (or negative) curvature.
*[[Sphere eversion]] without creasing or tearing can be done using &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; isometric embedding of &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Nash embedding theorem]]

[[File:Bas Jan Ader - I'm too sad to tell you.jpg|thumb|''I'm too sad to tell you'' (1970), 27.7 x 35.5 cm, gelatin silver print&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/collection/works/109497&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''''I'm too sad to tell you''''' (1970–71) is a [[mixed media]] art work by [[conceptual art]]ist [[Bas Jan Ader]].&lt;ref name = "Bomb"&gt;[http://bombmagazine.org/article/5672/bas-jan-ader-please-don-t-leave-me-in-search-of-the-miraculous-bas-jan-ader-discovery-file   Nato Thompson, “Bas Jan Ader Please Don't Leave Me”, [[Bomb (magazine)]], Summer 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The work includes a three-minute black-and-white silent film, still photographs and a post card all related to him crying for an unknown reason.  The photographs include both a short hair version and a long hair version.&lt;ref name = "NPR"&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/20/transcript [[Ira Glass]], “This American Life 20: From a Distance”, [[NPR]] radio transcript, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; The post cards were mailed to his friends with the inscription “I'm too sad to tell you”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectiveexperience.org/cindy/ader.html Cindy Loehr, “Bas Jan Ader: Retrospective”, ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was an original, now lost, version of the film called ''Cry Claremont''.  It was shown in the [[Pomona College|Pomona College Gallery]] in [[Claremont, California]] in 1971-72.&lt;ref name="MOMA"&gt;Christophe Cherix, ''In &amp; Out of Amsterdam: Travels in Conceptual Art, 1960-1976'', MOMA, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-87070-753-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for his sadness is never stated in the work.&lt;ref name="Dumbadze"/&gt;

==Composition and history==
The work's original form was a silent black and white movie shot outdoors in 1970 apparently in front of Ader's house.  The movie was shown in Claremont college, but has since been lost.&lt;ref name = MOMA/&gt;  A still from the movie, however, was extracted and made into a post card.  It shows Ader with his head in his hand crying.  The back of the post card had the written inscription “I'm too sad to tell you”.  It was dated September 13, 1970.  The card was mailed to a number of Ader's friends. The image has also been reproduced in a photographic version with the inscription written in the lower right hand corner.  The post card and photograph have become iconic of the work and a symbol that many artists have emulated (see Influence below).  
	
A second version of the film was made in Amsterdam in 1971.  This was more of a performance with Ader appearing to be calm before the shooting and rubbing his eyes during the filming to produce tears and build emotional intensity.  Ten minutes of film was shot with the final version edited to about three and a half minutes.  The edited version captures Ader at his most anguished.  His face is framed closely.  There is no introduction or conclusion, no reason given and no relief from the anguish that is presented.  Critics have said that it is hard not to be affected by the film, with its offering of “raw passion to anyone willing to watch”.&lt;ref name = "Dumbadze"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDouV4K9cEC&amp;pg=PA152 Alexander Dumbadze, “Bas Jan Ader: Death is Elsewhere”, University of Chicago Press, 2013, p 152 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical interpretation==
The work has inspired many critical interpretations and analysis.

There seems to be an overall tension between the sincerity of the artist's captured emotions and performance aspects of the works.  Artists James Roberts and [[Collier Schorr]], for example, feel the works are at once intensely personal and yet very arbitrary.  There was a true reason for Ader's sadness, but that is not shared with us.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/bas_jan_ader/ James Roberts and Collier Schorr, “Bas Jan Ader”, ''frieze'' (magazine), June 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruce Hainley, contributing editor to [[Artforum]], thinks the reasons for his sadness are beside the point.  In his view, Ader walks a fine line between sincerity (the sadness is real) and melodrama (the work is staged multiple times).&lt;ref name = "Hainley"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Legend+of+the+fall.-a054169956 Bruce Hainley, "Legend of the fall." Artforum International , Vol. 37, No. 7, March 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jörg Heiser, coeditor of [[Frieze (magazine)]], views the work as an ironic statement of the artist taking on all of the embarrassment of the expressed emotion while leaving it open as to whether or not the viewer takes on the embarrassment as well.&lt;ref name = "Heiser"&gt;[http://www.artandresearch.org.uk/v2n1/heiser.html , “All of a Sudden: Things that Matter in Contemporary Art”, Art &amp; Research, A Journal of Ideas, Contexts, and Methods, Summer 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women reviewers have been more critical.  Jennifer Doyle in her book ''Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art'' feels the work may be seen as real due to the tradition of the “melancholy white male artist”. She sees this in contrast to how a woman would have been perceived as either acting or in hysterics.&lt;ref name = "Doyle"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j-8DAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=%22I%27m+too+sad+to+tell+you%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9e_zU7STHoj_yQTCu4LQDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%27m%20too%20sad%20to%20tell%20you%22&amp;f=false Jennifer Doyle, ''Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art'',  Duke University Press, 12 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  Journalist Betty van Garrel goes so far as to say (in translation) "Ader is a sentimental loser, a romantic softie, a problem case and not even original in that."&lt;ref name = "LAS"&gt;[http://www.lostatsea.net/feature.phtml?fid=2150744464607d6c85df96 Samuel Klaus, "Bas Jan Ader, Lost at Sea", ''LAS Magazine'', 7 September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''I'm too sad to tell you'' has influenced a large number of artists, with many composing interpretations and [[homage (arts)|homages]] to the work.  These include:
*Alexander Brandt on his goal of imitating Ader's pose in his own self-portrait: 
::''“My appropriation of this visual has a strategic aim. I myself do not fit the cliché of a tragic artist.... It is the reactions it will produce with the audience that interest me.”'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feipingguo.com/sad0.html Alexander Brandt "I'm too sad to tell you" (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[David Horvitz]] on the influence for his book ''Sad Depressed People'':
::''"If you look at my book, all the images are with people's hands to their faces...this was actually a direct reference to Ader's image."'' &lt;ref name="andreview"&gt;[http://chertberlin.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/david_andreview.pdf Rachel Peddersen “In conversation with David Horvitz”, Andreview, Fall &amp; Winter 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|m|ər}}; May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994), also known as the '''Milwaukee Cannibal''' or the '''Milwaukee Monster''', was an American [[serial killer]] and [[sex offender]], who committed the [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[dismemberment]] of 17 men and boys from 1978 to 1991. Many of his later murders involved [[necrophilia]],&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 136"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]], and the permanent preservation of body parts — typically all or part of the [[skeleton]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by [[Christopher Scarver]], a fellow inmate at the [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]].

==Early life==

=== Early childhood ===
Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer was born at the Evangelical Deaconess Hospital in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May 21, 1960, the first of two sons born to Joyce Annette (née Flint) and Lionel Herbert Dahmer. Dahmer's mother worked as a [[Teleprinter|teletype machine]] instructor,&lt;ref name=murder1/&gt; and his father was a student at [[Marquette University]], working towards a degree in chemistry. His father was of [[German Americans|German]] and [[Welsh Americans|Welsh]] ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother was of [[Norwegian Americans|Norwegian]] and [[Irish Americans|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Charles |last= Klotsche| title= The Silent Victims: The Aftermath of Failed Children on Their Mothers' Lives  |publisher=[[Pan American Press]] |location=Los Angeles, California|year= 1995|isbn= 0-9673890-2-X |pages= 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that Dahmer was deprived of attention as an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Willem |last=Martens |title=Sadism Linked to Loneliness: Psychodynamic dimensions of the Sadistic Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer |journal=[[Psychoanalytic Review]] |publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|location=New York City|date=August 2011 |volume=98|issue=4|pages=493–514 |doi= 10.1521/prev.2011.98.4.493 |pmid=21864144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dahmer's mother found the routine of [[breastfeeding]] exhausting and irritating, she refused to feed her son in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, suggest that Dahmer was doted upon as an infant and toddler by both parents, although his mother was known to be tense, greedy for attention, and argumentative with her husband and their neighbors.&lt;ref name="MiM-p11" /&gt;

As her son entered first grade, Joyce Dahmer began to spend an increasing amount of her time in bed recovering from weakness. Lionel's university studies kept him away from home much of the time; when he was home, his wife demanded constant attention. She reportedly worked herself into a state of anxiety over trivial matters simply to appease her husband. On one occasion, Joyce Dahmer attempted suicide from an overdose of the [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] pills to which she had become addicted.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 32"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, neither parent devoted much time to their son.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahmer has been described as being an "energetic and happy child" until he became notably subdued after undergoing a [[Inguinal hernia surgery|double hernia]] surgery, which was performed shortly before his fourth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeffrey Dahmer|url=https://www.biography.com/people/jeffrey-dahmer-9264755|website=[[Biography.com]]|publisher=[[A&amp;E Networks]]|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled his early years of family life as being of "extreme tension" which he noted between his parents, whom he observed to be constantly arguing with each other. At elementary school, he was regarded as both quiet and timid by his peers. On his first grade report card, one teacher described Dahmer as a reserved child whom she sensed felt neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This teacher did note that this sense of neglect seemed to stem from his mother's illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, although largely reserved and uncommunicative in grade school, Dahmer did have a small number of friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in animals. Friends later recalled Dahmer initially collected large insects, dragonflies, and butterflies, which he placed inside jars. Later, he collected animal carcasses from the roadside, occasionally accompanied by one or more of his few friends; he dismembered these animals either at home or in an expanse of woodland behind the family home. According to one friend, Dahmer dismembered these animals and stored the parts in jars in the family's wooden toolshed, always explaining that he was curious as to how each animal "fitted together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, he [[decapitation|decapitated]] the carcass of a dog before nailing the animal's body to a tree. He later impaled the skull of this dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon a stake beside a wooden cross in woodland behind his house.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=80}} Dahmer's fascination with dead animals might have begun when, at the age of four, he noted his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel Dahmer, his son was "oddly thrilled" by the sound the bones made, and instantly developed a fixation for playing with and collecting animal bones. He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones. With live animals, he explored their bodies to discover where their bones were located.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 32" /&gt;

The Dahmer family relocated to [[Doylestown, Ohio]], in October 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Joyce Dahmer was pregnant with her second child. When she gave birth to a baby boy on December 18, 1966, Jeffrey was allowed to choose the name of the baby. He chose the name David for his younger brother.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=61}} The same year, Lionel Dahmer achieved his degree and subsequently obtained employment as an [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]] in the city of [[Akron, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Donald A.|last=Davis|title=The Jeffrey Dahmer Story: An American Nightmare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSXCEA7LpjsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=lionel+dahmer+analytical+chemist#v=onepage&amp;q=lionel%20dahmer%20analytical%20chemist|date=November 15, 1991|publisher=[[St. Martin's Paperbacks]]|location=New York City|ISBN=978-0312928407|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the family relocated to [[Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio|Bath, Ohio]]. Two years later, over a family meal of chicken, Dahmer asked his father what would happen if the bones of the chicken were to be placed in a bleach solution.&lt;ref name="Shrine-p39"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Dahmer was, by this stage, concerned as to his elder son's placid and [[lethargy|lethargic]] attitude and his solitary existence; therefore, he was delighted at the initiative displayed by his son towards what he believed to be scientific curiosity.&lt;ref name="Shrine-p39" /&gt; He willingly demonstrated to his son how to safely bleach and (later) preserve animal bones. This knowledge regarding the cleansing and preserving of bones was used by Dahmer on many of the animal remains which he continued to avidly collect.&lt;ref name=stoughton&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence and high school===
From his freshman year at [[Revere High School (Ohio)|Revere High School]], Dahmer was seen by his peers as an [[outcast (person)|outcast]] with few friends.{{refn|group=n|It has been suggested, in a 2002 paper by Silva, Ferrari and Leong published in the ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', that Dahmer may have suffered from [[Asperger syndrome]].{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}} Many of Dahmer's classmates later recollected being disturbed by the fact that he drank both beer and [[distilled beverage|hard alcohol]], which he smuggled into school inside the lining of his army fatigue jacket&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concealed in his locker. This drinking occurred before, during, and after school, and was first noted when Dahmer was 14. On one occasion, a classmate observed Dahmer consuming a cup of [[gin]] and asked him why he was drinking liquor in class, to which Dahmer casually replied, "It's my medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=James|last1=Barron |first2=Mary B. W.|last2=Tabor |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JTUdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oKUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6988,582043 |title=Dahmer spent years crying out for attention |newspaper=[[Tuscaloosa News]] |publisher=New Media Investment Group, Inc.|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|date=August 3, 1991 |accessdate=August 24, 2017|pages=1A, 6A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in his freshman year at Revere High School, Dahmer, although largely uncommunicative, was observed by staff to be a polite student who was known to be highly intelligent. He initially achieved only average grades, which staff attributed to his [[apathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known to have been a keen tennis player and to have briefly played in the high school band.&lt;ref name="Shrine-p42"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jeffrey Dahmer HS Yearbook.jpg|140px|thumb|Dahmer at age 17, photographed for the 1977 Revere High School yearbook.]]

When he reached puberty, Dahmer discovered he was [[Homosexuality|homosexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents. In his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his later admission, he began sexually fantasizing about dominating and controlling a completely submissive male partner. These fantasies gradually became intertwined with [[dissection]]. On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a [[rape fantasy]] of rendering a particular male jogger he found attractive [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] and then making sexual use of his unconscious body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the jogger took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for him to run by. The jogger did not pass by on that particular day, however. Although Dahmer never attempted to implement this plan again,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; he later stated this was his first attempt to attack another individual.

Despite being regarded as a loner and an oddball among his peers at Revere High School, Dahmer became something of a [[wikt:class clown|class clown]] among some students due to the pranks he regularly staged—some of which were done to amuse his classmates, others apparently to simply attract attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pranks became known as "Doing a Dahmer" and included bleating, simulating [[epileptic seizure]]s or [[cerebral palsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first= John |last=Backderf|title= My Friend Dahmer |publisher= [[Abrams ComicArts]] |location=New York City|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-4197-0217-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knocking over items at school and at local stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977, Dahmer's grades had declined, owing to his alcohol abuse and his continuing apathy toward academic and social interactions.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=76–79}} His parents hired a private tutor for their son, but the tutor only had limited success. The same year, Dahmer's parents attended counseling sessions to try to resolve personal differences and thus save their marriage. The counseling was ultimately unsuccessful, and they decided to divorce. Although initially on amicable grounds, both of Dahmer's parents began to quarrel frequently in the presence of their sons and, in early 1978, Lionel Dahmer moved out of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1978, Dahmer graduated from high school. A few weeks before his graduation, one of his teachers observed Dahmer sitting close to the school parking lot, drinking several cans of beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the teacher threatened to report the matter, Dahmer informed him he was experiencing "a lot of problems" at home and that the school's [[school counselor|guidance counselor]] was aware of them. Shortly after this incident, Joyce was awarded [[child custody|custody]] of her younger son and vacated the family residence, moving in with family members of hers; Dahmer, having just turned 18, was legally an adult and therefore not subject to court custodial considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late teens and early 20s ==

===First murder and Army service===
Dahmer committed his first murder in the summer of 1978 at the age of 18, just three weeks after his graduation. At the time, he was living alone in the family home. Owing to his recent divorce from Dahmer's mother, Dahmer's father temporarily lived in a nearby motel and his mother had relocated to [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his younger brother David. On June 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks who was four days shy of his 19th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Robert J.|last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary B.W.|last=Taylor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/12/us/sorrow-and-frustration-on-trails-of-the-missing.html |title=Sorrow and Frustration On Trails of the Missing|work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 12, 1991|access-date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer lured the youth to his house on the pretext of the two young men drinking alcohol together. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert in Lockwood Corners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed to accompany Dahmer to his house. According to Dahmer, after several hours' drinking and listening to music, Hicks "wanted to leave and [I] didn't want him to."&lt;ref name="PurcellArrigo2006"&gt;{{cite book |first2=Bruce |last2= A. Arrigo |first= Catherine E. |last= Purcell |title= The Psychology of Lust Murder: Paraphilia, Sexual Killing, and Serial Homicide|url= https://books.google.com/?id=ScBmlAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 |year= 2006 |publisher= Academic Press |location=New York City|isbn= 978-0-12-370510-5 |page= 77 |chapter= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Dahmer bludgeoned him with a 10&amp;nbsp;lb. [[dumbbell]]. Dahmer later stated he struck Hicks twice from behind&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the dumbbell as Hicks sat upon a chair. When Hicks fell unconscious, Dahmer [[strangulation|strangled]] him to death with the bar of the dumbbell, then stripped the clothes from Hicks' body before [[masturbating]] as he stood above the corpse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The following day,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer dissected Hicks' body in his [[crawl space (basement)|crawl space]]; he later buried the remains in a shallow grave in his backyard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jody M.|last=Roy|title=''Love to Hate''|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York City|year=2002|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; before, several weeks later, unearthing the remains and [[paring knife|paring]] the flesh from the bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dissolved the flesh in acid before flushing the solution down the toilet; he crushed the bones with a [[sledgehammer]] and scattered them in the woodland behind the family home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert J.|last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title=Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders|year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |pages= 43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six weeks after the murder of Hicks, Dahmer's father and his fiancée returned to his home where they discovered Jeffrey living alone at the house. That August, Dahmer enrolled at [[the Ohio State University]], hoping to major in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert J. Dvorchak|author2=Lisa Holewa |title=Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer's sole term at Ohio State University was completely unproductive, largely because of his persistent alcohol abuse throughout the majority of the term. He received failing grades in Introduction to Anthropology, Classical Civilizations, and Administrative Science. The only course Dahmer was successful at was Riflery, having received a B- grade. His overall GPA was 0.45/4.0.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=105}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=103–104}} On one occasion, Lionel Dahmer paid a surprise visit to his son, only to find his room strewn with empty liquor bottles. Despite his father having paid in advance for the second term, Dahmer dropped out of university after just three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his father's urging, Dahmer enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]],{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=107}} where he trained as a medical specialist at [[Fort Sam Houston]] in San Antonio, Texas. On July 13, 1979, he was stationed in [[Baumholder]], [[West Germany]], where he served as a combat medic in [[68th Armor Regiment|2nd Battalion, 68th Armored Regiment]], [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=James |last1=Barron |first2=Mary B.

On March 24, 1981, Dahmer was sent to [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], South Carolina, for debriefing and provided with a plane ticket to travel anywhere in the country. Dahmer later told police he felt he could not return home to face his father, so he opted to travel to [[Miami Beach, Florida]], both because he was "tired of the cold"&lt;ref name="adamWalsh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisn.com/news/10903529/detail.html |title=Did Dahmer Have One More Victim? |work=The Milwaukee Channel |accessdate=February 5, 2007 |date=February 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222031507/http://www.wisn.com/news/10903529/detail.html |archivedate=February 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an attempt to live on his own means. In Florida, Dahmer found employment at a [[delicatessen]] and rented a room in a nearby motel. Dahmer spent most of his salary on alcohol, and was soon evicted from the motel for non-payment. He initially spent his evenings on the beach as he continued to work at the sandwich shop until phoning his father and asking to return to Ohio in September of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Ohio and relocation to West Allis, Wisconsin===
After his return to Ohio, Dahmer initially resided with his father and stepmother and insisted on being delegated numerous chores to occupy his time while he looked for work. However, he continued to drink heavily and, just two weeks after his return, Dahmer was arrested for [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly conduct]],{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=114}} for which he was fined $60 and given a [[suspended sentence|suspended 10-day jail sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer's father tried unsuccessfully to wean his son off alcohol. In December 1981, Dahmer's father and stepmother sent him to live with his grandmother in [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]], Wisconsin. Dahmer's grandmother was the only family member to whom he displayed any affection;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; they hoped that her influence, plus the change of scenery, might inspire Dahmer to refrain from alcohol, find a job, and live responsibly.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=115}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=117}} Initially, Dahmer's living arrangements with his grandmother were harmonious: he accompanied her to church; willingly undertook chores; actively sought work; and abided by most of her house rules (although he did continue to drink and smoke).{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=83}} This new influence in his life initially brought results and, in early 1982, Dahmer found employment as a [[phlebotomy|phlebotomist]] at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. He held this job for a total of 10 months before being laid off.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; He remained unemployed for over two years, during which he lived upon whatever money his grandmother gave him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeffrey-dahmer.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Mug shot of Jeffrey Dahmer, taken in 1982 after his arrest for [[indecent exposure]]]]
Shortly before losing his job, Dahmer was arrested for [[indecent exposure]]. On August 7, 1982, at [[Wisconsin State Fair Park]], Dahmer was observed to expose himself to a crowd of 25 women and children. For this incident, he was convicted and fined $50 plus [[court costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1985, Dahmer was hired as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights per week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after Dahmer found this employment, an incident occurred in which he was propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform [[fellatio]] upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incident stirred in his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's [[gay bar]]s, bookstores and [[gay bathhouse]]s. He is also known to have stolen a male [[mannequin]] from a store,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=119–120}} which he briefly used for sexual stimulation before his grandmother, having discovered the item stowed in a closet, demanded that he discard it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1985, he had begun to regularly frequent the bathhouses, which he later described as being "relaxing places",&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; but during his sexual encounters, he became frustrated at his partners' moving during the sexual act. Following his arrest, he stated: "I trained myself to view people as objects of pleasure instead of [as] people".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; For this reason, beginning in June 1986, he administered [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]] to his partners, giving them liquor laced with the sedatives, then raping their unconscious bodies. After approximately 12 such instances, the bathhouses' administration revoked Dahmer's membership, and he began to use hotel rooms to continue this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his membership of the bathhouses was revoked,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer read a report in a newspaper regarding the upcoming funeral of an 18-year-old male; he conceived the idea of stealing the freshly interred corpse and taking it home.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book |last= Schwartz |first= Anne E |title= The Man Who Could Not Kill Enough: The Secret Murders of Milwaukee's Jeffrey Dahmer |date= June 1992 |publisher= Citadel |isbn= 978-1-55972-117-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dahmer, he attempted to dig the coffin from the ground, but found the soil too hard, before abandoning the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1986,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=131}} Dahmer was arrested for masturbating in front of two 12-year-old boys as he stood close to the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic River]].&lt;ref name="Bardsley-7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer initially admitted the offense and was again charged with indecent exposure, but quickly changed his story and claimed he had merely been urinating, unaware that there were witnesses. The charge was changed to [[disorderly conduct]] and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced to one year's [[probation]], with additional instructions he was to undergo counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 20s and early 30s: subsequent murders==

===Ambassador Hotel===
On November 20, 1987, Dahmer—at the time residing with his grandmother in West Allis, Wisconsin—encountered a 25-year-old man from [[Ontonagon, Michigan]] named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, he had no intention of murdering Tuomi, but simply intended to drug and rape him as he lay unconscious. The following morning, however, he awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest "crushed in" and "black and blue" with bruises. Blood was also seeping from the corner of his mouth, and Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had absolutely no memory of having killed Tuomi,&lt;ref name="Bardsley-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris 1992 141"&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later informed investigators that he simply "could not believe this had happened." To dispose of Tuomi's body, he purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later,&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 110"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso,&lt;ref name="Norris 1992 141"/&gt; then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. He then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 110"/&gt; He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into [[splinter]]s with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to complete, and he disposed of all of Tuomi's remains—excluding the severed head&lt;ref name="autogenerated111"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in the trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a total of two weeks following Tuomi's murder, Dahmer retained the victim's head wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head in a mixture of Soilex (an [[alkalinity|alkali]]-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull was rendered too brittle by this bleaching process, so Dahmer pulverized and disposed of it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated111"/&gt;

===Intermediate incidents===
Following the murder of Tuomi, Dahmer began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or close to gay bars, and whom he typically lured to his grandmother's home. There, he drugged them before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once he had rendered the victim unconscious with sleeping pills, he killed them by strangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jody M.|last=Roy|title=Love to Hate|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York City|date=2002|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after the murder of Steven Tuomi, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old Native American [[male prostitute]] named James Doxtator; Dahmer lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. He boiled the skull, and initially retained it before pulverizing it. On March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old [[bisexuality|bisexual]] man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him;&lt;ref name="autogenerated121"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a leather strap, with Dahmer then performing [[oral sex]] upon the corpse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated121"/&gt; Guerrero's body was dismembered within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of his murder, with the remains again disposed of in the trash and the skull again retained before being pulverized several months later.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, Dahmer lured another young man to his house; however, after giving the victim a drugged coffee, both he and the victim heard Dahmer's grandmother call, "Is that you, Jeff?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dahmer replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, his grandmother did observe that Dahmer was not alone. Because of this, Dahmer opted not to kill this particular victim, instead waiting until he had become unconscious before taking him to the County General Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19920208&amp;id=4OgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yjIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3993,4435325 |title=Teen describes escape from Dahmer |work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|location=Lodi, California|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 8, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1988, Dahmer's grandmother asked him to move out of her house because of his habit of bringing young men to her house late at night and the foul smells emanating from both the basement and the garage. Dahmer found a one-bedroom apartment on North 25th Street and moved into his new residence on September 25.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=132}} The following day, Dahmer was arrested for drugging and [[child sexual abuse|sexually fondling]] a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=133–135}} In January 1989, Dahmer was convicted of second-degree [[sexual assault]] and of enticing a child for immoral purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing for the assault was suspended until May 1989.&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Robert J. |last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|year= 1992 |page= 63|isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer commenced a 10-day Easter absence from work, during which he moved back into his grandmother's home.

Two months after his conviction and two months prior to his sentencing for the sexual assault, Dahmer murdered his fifth victim. He was a [[mixed-race]] 24-year-old aspiring model named Anthony Sears, whom Dahmer met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before [[last call (bar term)|closing time]] that evening, Sears "just started talking to me". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears. The following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to [[flaying|flay]] the corpse.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 136"/&gt; He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which were again disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears "exceptionally attractive", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in [[acetone]]&lt;ref name="Bardsley-8" /&gt; and stored them in his work locker. When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 1989,&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"/&gt; Dahmer was sentenced to five years' probation and one year in the House of Correction, with [[work release]] permitted in order that he be able to keep his job; he was also required to register as a [[sex offender]].{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=138}}

Two months before his scheduled release from the work camp, Dahmer was paroled from this regime. (His five years' probation imposed in 1989 began at this point.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; On release, Dahmer temporarily moved back to his grandmother's home in West Allis{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=143–144}} before, in May 1990, moving into the Oxford Apartments, located on North 25th Street in Milwaukee. Although located in a high crime area, the apartment was close to his workplace, was furnished and, at $300 per month inclusive of all bills excluding electricity, was economical.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===924 North 25th Street===

==== 1990 killings ====
On May 14, 1990, Dahmer moved out of his grandmother's house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Anthony Sears' skull, scalp, and painted genitals with him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt; Within one week of his moving into his new apartment, Dahmer had killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom Dahmer lured to Apartment 213 with the promise of $50 for sex.&lt;ref name="autogenerated141"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Dahmer's apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills and manually strangled him. The following day, Dahmer purchased a Polaroid camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilex, which allowed him to then rinse the bones in his sink;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; he dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton—excluding the skull—in a container he filled with acid. He spray-painted Smith's skull and placed it alongside the skull of Anthony Sears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert J. Dvorchak|author2=Lisa Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately one week after the murder of Raymond Smith, on or about May 27, Dahmer lured another young man to his apartment. On this occasion, however, Dahmer himself accidentally consumed the drink laden with sedatives intended for consumption by his guest. When he awoke the following day, he discovered his intended victim had stolen several items of his clothing, $300, and a watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer never reported this incident to the police, although on May 29, he divulged to his probation officer that he had been robbed.

In June 1990, Dahmer lured a 27-year-old acquaintance named Edward Smith to his apartment. He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching (which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle), Dahmer placed Smith's skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated146"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim would be acidified several months later. Dahmer accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry—a process that caused the skull to explode.&lt;ref name="autogenerated146"/&gt; Dahmer himself was to later inform police he had felt "rotten" about Smith's murder as he had been unable to retain any parts of his body.&lt;ref name="autogenerated146"/&gt;

Less than three months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: "That'll cost you extra,"&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. On this occasion, however, he had had only two sleeping pills to give his victim; therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his [[carotid artery]] with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated154"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body.&lt;ref name="autogenerated154" /&gt; He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a "jelly-like substance" using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, he placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24&amp;nbsp;hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks after the murder of Ernest Miller, on September 24, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old man named David Thomas at the [[Shops of Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue Mall]] and persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer stated that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body—intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. Nonetheless, he did photograph the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which later aided in Thomas's subsequent identification.&lt;ref name="autogenerated217"&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of David Thomas, Dahmer did not kill anyone for almost five months, although on a minimum of five occasions between October 1990 and February 1991, he unsuccessfully attempted to lure men to his apartment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"/&gt; He is also known to have regularly complained of feelings of both [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and depression to his probation officer throughout 1990; with frequent references to his sexuality, his solitary lifestyle, and financial difficulties. On several occasions, he is also known to have referred to harboring suicidal thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1991 killings ====
In February 1991, Dahmer observed a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter standing at a bus stop near [[Marquette University]]. According to Dahmer, he lured Straughter into his apartment with an offer of money for posing for nude photos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the added incentive of sexual intercourse. Dahmer drugged and strangled Straughter with a leather strap, then dismembered him, with Dahmer retaining the youth's skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process. Less than two months later, on April 7, Dahmer encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey&lt;ref name="Bardsley-10" /&gt;{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} walking to get a key cut. Lindsey was heterosexual. Dahmer lured Lindsey to his apartment, where he drugged him, drilled a hole in his skull and poured [[hydrochloric acid]] into it. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which Dahmer had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: "I have a headache. What time is it?"{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=128}}&lt;ref&gt;Killers, issue 5, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Dahmer again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull; he then flayed Lindsey's body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, Dahmer disposed of Lindsey's skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1991, fellow residents of the Oxford Apartments had repeatedly complained to the manager of the Oxford Apartments, Sopa Princewill, of the foul smells emanating from Apartment 213, in addition to the sounds of falling objects and the occasional sound of a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Alex|last=Prud'Homme|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973550-1,00.html |title=The Little Flat of Horrors|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=August 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princewill did contact Dahmer in response to these complaints on several occasions, although Dahmer initially excused the odors emanating from his apartment as being caused by his freezer breaking, causing the contents to become "spoiled". On later occasions, he informed Princewill that the reason for the resurgence of the odor was that several of his tropical fish had recently died, and that he would take care of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of May 26, 1991, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old named Konerak Sinthasomphone on Wisconsin Avenue; he approached the youth with an offer of money to accompany him to his apartment to pose for Polaroid pictures. According to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone—the younger brother of the boy whom he had molested in 1988—was initially reluctant to the proposal, before changing his mind and accompanying Dahmer to his apartment, where the youth posed for two pictures in his underwear before Dahmer drugged him into unconsciousness and performed oral sex on him. On this occasion, Dahmer drilled a single hole into Sinthasomphone's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the [[frontal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Sinthasomphone fell unconscious, Dahmer led the boy into his bedroom, where the nude body of 31-year-old Tony Hughes, whom Dahmer had killed three days earlier, lay naked on the floor.&lt;ref name="Norris 1992 235"&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dahmer, he "believed [that Sinthasomphone] saw this body," yet did not react to seeing the bloated corpse—likely because of the effects of the sleeping pills he had ingested and the hydrochloric acid Dahmer had injected through his skull. Sinthasomphone soon became unconscious, whereupon Dahmer drank several beers while lying alongside Sinthasomphone before leaving his apartment to drink at a bar, then purchase more alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning hours of May 27, Dahmer returned toward his apartment to discover Sinthasomphone sitting naked on the corner of 25th and State, talking in [[Lao Language|Laotian]], with three distressed young women standing near him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Crocker| last=Stephenson|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oLUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wBIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3124,5920894 |title=2 women say police failed to aid 14-year-old |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |date=July 26, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer approached the trio and explained to the women that Sinthasomphone (whom he referred to by an [[pseudonym|alias]]) was his friend, and attempted to lead him to his apartment by the arm. The three women dissuaded Dahmer, explaining they had phoned 911.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=7}} Upon the arrival of two officers named [[John Balcerzak]] and Joseph Gabrish, Dahmer's demeanor relaxed: he informed the officers that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, that he had drunk too much following a quarrel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/26/us/officer-defends-giving-boy-back-to-dahmer.html |title=Officer Defends Giving Boy Back to Dahmer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 26, 1991|access-date=December 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he frequently behaved in this manner when [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]. The three women were exasperated and when one of the trio attempted to indicate to one of the officers that Sinthasomphone was bleeding from his buttocks and that he had seemingly struggled against Dahmer's attempts to walk him to his apartment, the officer harshly informed her to "butt out,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Barron |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/27/us/milwaukee-police-once-queried-suspect.html |title=Milwaukee Police Once Queried Suspect |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 27, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "shut the hell up"&lt;ref name="autogenerated179"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to not interfere, adding the incident was "[[domestic violence|domestic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anne E.|last=Schwartz|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4DcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,3131596|title=Suspended officers say the public doesn't know the whole story |work=The Milwaukee Journal |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=July 28, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the protests of the three women, the officers simply covered Sinthasomphone with a towel and walked him to Dahmer's apartment where, in an effort to verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, Dahmer showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of the youth the previous evening. The officers later reported having noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment (this odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Imrie |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xe0eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bCQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5153,134140 |title=Officers were in Dahmer's apartment |agency=Associated Press|work=The Times-News |publisher=[[New Media Investment Group]]|location=Burlington, North Carolina|date=August 2, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer stated that to investigate this, one officer simply "peeked his head around the bedroom but really didn't take a good look." The officers then left, with a departing remark that Dahmer "take good care" of Sinthasomphone.&lt;ref name="autogenerated179"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had they conducted a background check on Dahmer, it would have revealed that he was a convicted [[child molestation|child molester]] under probation.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-3" /&gt; Upon the departure of the two police officers from his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain; on this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes. He retained both victims' skulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Having left Sinthasomphone in the company of Dahmer, the patrol unit which had responded to the women's 911 call then radioed their dispatch unit.

On June 30 Dahmer traveled to Chicago, where he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner at a bus station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner accepted Dahmer's offer to travel to Milwaukee for a [[photo shoot|professional photo shoot]]. At Dahmer's apartment, Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered Turner and placed his head and internal organs in separate plastic bags in the freezer. Turner was not reported missing. Five days later, on July 5, Dahmer lured 23-year-old Jeremiah Weinberger from a Chicago bar to his apartment on the promise of spending the weekend with him. He drugged Weinberger and twice injected boiling water through his skull, sending him into a coma from which he died two days later.&lt;ref name="autogenerated188"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, Dahmer encountered 24-year-old&lt;ref name="Robert J. Dvorchak 1992 181"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Robert J.|last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Lacy at the corner of 27th and Kilbourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive; after unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with [[chloroform]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended. After strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer.&lt;ref name="Robert J. Dvorchak 1992 181"/&gt; Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed these sheets to find the head covered in maggots, whereupon he decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Robert J.|last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On July 22, 1991, Dahmer approached three men with an offer of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; drink beer and simply keep him company.&lt;ref name="autogenerated192"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, "What's happening?" Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=151}} then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures. While inside the bedroom, Edwards noted nude male posters on the wall and that a [[videotape]] of ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' was playing;&lt;ref name="autogenerated192"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL-SFva4Oko |title=The Trial of Jeffrey Dahmer - Documentary Part 12 of 16 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also noted a blue [[drum (container)|57-gallon drum]] in the corner, from which a strong odor emanated.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=152}}

Dahmer then brandished a knife and informed Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and [[chant]]ing before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and that he was not going to run away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=153–154}}

At 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers at the corner of North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist,&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 2"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=154}} whereupon Edwards explained to the officers that a "freak" had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 2"/&gt; When the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had indeed placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Rolf Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser in the bedroom. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to himself retrieve the key, whereupon the second officer present, Robert Rauth, informed him to "back off".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bedroom, Mueller noted there was indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into the living room to show them to his partner,&lt;ref name="Bardsley-4" /&gt; uttering the words, "These are for real."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: "For what I did I should be dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more detailed search of the apartment, conducted by the Criminal Investigation Bureau, revealed a total of four severed heads in Dahmer's kitchen. A total of seven skulls—some painted, some bleached—were found in Dahmer's bedroom and inside a closet.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=157}} In addition, investigators discovered collected blood drippings upon a tray at the bottom of Dahmer's refrigerator, plus two human hearts{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=158}} and a portion of arm muscle, each wrapped inside plastic bags upon the shelves. In Dahmer's freezer, investigators discovered an entire torso, plus a bag of human organs and flesh stuck to the ice at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in Apartment 213, investigators discovered two entire skeletons, a pair of severed hands, two severed and preserved penises, a mummified scalp and, in the 57-gallon drum, three further dismembered torsos dissolving in the acid solution. A total of 74 Polaroid pictures detailing the dismemberment of Dahmer's victims were found.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-5" /&gt; In reference to the recovery of body parts and artifacts at 924 North 25th Street, the [[coroner|chief medical examiner]] later stated: "It was more like dismantling someone's museum than an actual crime scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.medicineatmichigan.org/magazine/2009/spring/limelight/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821014601/http://www.medicineatmichigan.org/magazine/2009/spring/limelight/ |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |work=Medicine at Michigan |title=Limelight |date=Spring 2009 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession===
Beginning in the early hours of July 23, 1991, Dahmer was questioned by Detective Patrick Kennedy as to the murders he had committed and the evidence found at his apartment. Over the following two weeks, Kennedy and, later, Detective Patrick Murphy conducted numerous interviews with Dahmer which, when combined, totalled over 60 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer [[waiver|waived]] his right to have a lawyer present throughout his interrogations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding he wished to confess all as he had "created this horror and it only makes sense I do everything to put an end to it."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He readily admitted to having murdered 16 young men in Wisconsin since 1987, with one further victim—Steven Hicks—killed in Ohio back in 1978.

Most of the victims had been rendered unconscious prior to their murder, although some had died as a result of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. (As he had no memory of the murder of Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Steven Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart from his chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions—typically with the chest thrust outwards—prior to dismemberment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"/&gt; He readily admitted to performing [[necrophilia]] with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their [[viscus|viscera]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, Dahmer first removed their internal organs, then suspended the torso so the blood drained into his bathtub, before [[dicing]] any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bones he wished to dispose of were pulverized or acidified, with Soilex and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. In addition, he confessed to having consumed the hearts, livers, biceps, and portions of thighs of several victims killed within the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the increase in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, he stated he had been "completely swept along"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his compulsion to kill, adding: "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked as to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated he had been in the process of constructing a private [[altar]] of victims' skulls which he had intended to adorn upon the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims. This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. [[Incense|Incense sticks]] were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair.&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"/&gt; When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: "Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home." He further described his intended altar as a "place for [[meditation]]," from where he believed he could draw a sense of power,&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"/&gt; adding: "If this [his arrest] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found."&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"/&gt;

===Indictment===

===Trial===
The trial of Jeffrey Dahmer began on January 30, 1992.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=207}} He was tried in Milwaukee for the 15 counts of murder before Judge Laurence Gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; By pleading guilty on January 13 to the charges brought against him, Dahmer had waived his rights to an initial trial to establish guilt (as defined in Wisconsin law).&lt;ref name="autogenerated215"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue debated by opposing [[counsel]]s at Dahmer's trial was to determine whether he suffered from either a [[mental disorder|mental]] or a [[personality disorder]]:&lt;ref name="autogenerated215"/&gt; the prosecution claiming that any disorders did not deprive Dahmer of the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to deprive him of the ability to resist his [[Impulse (psychology)|impulses]]; the defense arguing that Dahmer suffered from a mental disease&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was driven by obsessions and impulses he was unable to control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defense experts argued that Dahmer was insane due to his necrophilic drive - his compulsion to have sexual encounters with corpses. Defense expert Dr. [[Fred Berlin]] testified that Dahmer was unable to conform his conduct at the time that he committed the crimes because he was suffering from [[Paraphilia]] or, more specifically, necrophilia. Dr. Judith Becker, a professor of Psychiatry and Psychology, was the second expert witness for the defense; Becker also diagnosed Dahmer with necrophilia. The final defense expert to testify, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Carl Wahlstrom, diagnosed Dahmer with [[borderline personality disorder]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]], necrophilia, [[alcohol dependence]], and a [[psychosis|psychotic disorder]].&lt;ref name="RD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diagnosis"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Steve |last=Bogira |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-inner-life-of-a-psycho-killer/Content?oid=880359 |title=The inner life of a psycho killer |work=[[Chicago Reader]]|date=August 27, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E&amp;M"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Charles Patrick |last1= Ewing|first2=Joseph T. |last2= McCann |title= Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology |year= 2006 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, England|isbn= 978-0-19-518176-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution rejected the defense's argument that Dahmer was insane. Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick testified that Dahmer did not suffer from primary necrophilia because he preferred live sexual partners as evidenced by his efforts to create unresistant, submissive sexual partners devoid of rational thought and to whose needs he did not have to cater.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.

He described Dahmer as a calculating and cunning individual, able to differentiate between right and wrong, with the ability to control his actions.&lt;ref name="Deseret News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/209110/PSYCHIATRIST-SAYS-DAHMER-WAS-SICK-BUT-NOT-INSANE.html |title=Psychiatrist Says Dahmer Was Sick But Not Insane |work=[[Deseret News]]|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|date=February 10, 1992 |accessdate=September 10, 2010|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fosdel did state his belief that Dahmer suffered from paraphilia, his conclusion was that Dahmer was not a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final witness to appear for the prosecution, forensic psychiatrist [[Park Dietz]], began his testimony on February 12. Dietz testified that he did not believe Dahmer to be suffering from any mental disease or defect at the time that he committed the crimes, stating: "Dahmer went to great lengths to be alone with his victim and to have no witnesses."&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 262"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that there was ample evidence that Dahmer prepared in advance for each murder, therefore, his crimes were not impulsive.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Feb. 12, 1992"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Stingl|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dSohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4n4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4713,3624402 |title=Dahmer knew what he was doing, expert says|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=February 12, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013|via=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dietz did concede any acquisition of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice,&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 262"/&gt; he also stated his belief that Dahmer's habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant, stating: "If he had a compulsion to kill, he would not have to drink alcohol. He had to drink alcohol to overcome his inhibition, to do the crime which he would rather not do."&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Feb. 12, 1992"/&gt; Dietz also noted that Dahmer strongly identified with evil and corrupt characters from both ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' and ''The Exorcist III''; particularly the level of power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on Dahmer's psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that Dahmer occasionally viewed scenes from these films before searching for a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Park Dietz | year = 1992 | title = At the movies with Jeffrey Dahmer | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98bRbgQpcGE | accessdate = 28 April 2017 | quote = | ref = DahmerTrialVideo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietz diagnosed Dahmer with [[substance use disorder]], paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Haycock (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two court-appointed mental health professionals—testifying independently of either prosecution or defense—were forensic psychiatrist George Palermo and clinical psychologist Samuel Friedman. Palermo stated that the murders were the result of a "pent-up aggression within himself [Dahmer]. He killed those men because he wanted to kill the source of his homosexual attraction to them. In killing them, he killed what he hated in himself." Palermo concluded that Dahmer was a sexual sadist with [[antisocial personality disorder]], but legally sane.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing (2006), 151&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman testified that it was a longing for companionship that caused Dahmer to kill. He stated, "Mr. Dahmer is not [[psychosis|psychotic]]." He spoke kindly of Dahmer, describing him as "Amiable, pleasant to be with, courteous, with a sense of humor, conventionally handsome, and charming in manner. He was, and still is, a bright young man."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Solomon M.|last1=Fulero|first2=Lawrence Samuel|last2=Wrightsman |title= Forensic Psychology |year= 2008 |publisher= Cengage Learning |location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn= 978-0-495-50649-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He diagnosed Dahmer with a [[personality disorder not otherwise specified]] featuring borderline, [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], and [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] traits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19920206&amp;id=Z7UcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CGQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2548,3262701&amp;hl=en''The Pittsburgh Press'' Feb. 6, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial lasted two weeks.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} On February 14, both counsels delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury. Each counsel was allowed to speak for two hours. Defense attorney Gerald Boyle argued first.

McCann further argued that by pleading guilty but insane to the charges, Dahmer was seeking to escape responsibility for his crimes.

On February 15, the court reconvened to hear the verdict: Dahmer was ruled to be sane and not suffering from a mental disorder at the time of each of the 15 murders for which he was tried,&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 272"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in each count, two of the 12 jurors signified their [[dissent]].&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 272"/&gt; On the first two counts, Dahmer was sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975527,00.html "Guilty!"], ''Time'' magazine, May 18, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; with the remaining 13 counts carrying a [[mandate (criminal law)|mandatory]] sentence of life imprisonment plus 70 years. The death penalty was not an option for Judge Gram to consider at the penalty phase as the State of Wisconsin had abolished capital punishment in 1853.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-21" /&gt;

Upon hearing of Jeffrey's sentencing, his father Lionel and stepmother Shari requested to be allowed a ten-minute private meeting with their son before he was transferred to the [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]] in [[Portage, Wisconsin|Portage]] to begin his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This request was granted and the trio exchanged hugs and well-wishes before Dahmer was escorted away to begin his sentence.

Three months after his conviction for 15 murders in Milwaukee, Dahmer was [[extradition|extradited]] to Ohio to be tried for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=241}} In a court hearing lasting just 45 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=M.

With Dahmer's consent, after one year in solitary confinement, he was transferred to a less secure unit, where he was assigned a two-hour daily work detail cleaning the toilet block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abc7chicago.com/news/jeffrey-dahmers-killer-explains-why-he-did-it/688971/|title=Jeffrey Dahmer's Killer Explains Why He Did It|access-date=July 21, 2017|newspaper=ABC7 Chicago|date=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after completing his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Patrick Murphy that he be given a copy of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated215"/&gt; This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to [[Christianity]] and became a [[born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]]. On his father's urging, he also read [[creationist]] books from the [[Institute for Creation Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnf1j4hRbjU Lionel &amp; Shari Dahmer on Larry King Live (mentioned at around 37:35)]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1994, Dahmer was [[baptism|baptized]] by [[Roy Ratcliff]], a minister in the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]] and a graduate of [[Oklahoma Christian University]], in the prison whirlpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JYZhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TbUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4821,6803994 |title=Dahmer found religion, played pranks in prison |work=[[The Beaver County Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 28, 1994 |accessdate=December 5, 2013|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bardsley-22" /&gt; Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited Dahmer on a weekly basis up until November 1994.

According to Dahmer's family, he had long been ready to die, and accepted any punishment which he might endure in prison. In addition to his father and stepmother retaining regular contact, Dahmer's mother, Joyce, retained regular contact with her son (although prior to his arrest, the two had not seen each other since Christmas 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce Dahmer related that in her weekly phone calls, whenever she expressed concerns for her son's physical well-being, Dahmer responded with comments to the effect of: "It doesn't matter, Mom. I don't care if something happens to me."&lt;ref name="peoplemag1994" /&gt;

===Death===
On the morning of November 28, 1994, Dahmer left his cell to conduct his assigned work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates: [[Jesse Anderson]] and [[Christopher Scarver]].

In this renewed account of events, Scarver claimed that the two had laughed at him when he had turned around in response before Dahmer and Anderson each walked to separate rooms to begin their cleaning duty, with Scarver following Dahmer toward the staff locker room.

Scarver alleges that immediately before murdering Dahmer, he had cornered him, presented a newspaper article detailing Dahmer's crimes, and demanded that Dahmer answer whether the account was true.&lt;ref name="NYP" /&gt; Scarver further alleged he had been revolted by Dahmer's crimes and that Dahmer had been openly unrepentant; that Dahmer taunted prison employees and fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into imitations of severed limbs, complete with ketchup to simulate blood spattering; and that prison staff, knowing of Scarver's hatred for Dahmer, had deliberately left the two men unsupervised so that he could kill him.&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jamie|last1=Schram|title=Why I killed Jeffrey Dahmer|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/28/meet-the-prisoner-who-murdered-killer-cannibal-jeffrey-dahmer/|accessdate=April 29, 2015|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp.]]|location=New York City|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Scarver stated that Dahmer was so disliked by fellow inmates that he required a personal escort of at least one [[prison guard|guard]] whenever he was out of his cell to prevent inmates from attacking him.

===Aftermath===
Dahmer's [[estate (law)|estate]] was awarded to the families of 11 of his victims who had sued for damages.

==Known murder victims==
Jeffrey Dahmer is known to have killed 17 young men between 1978 and 1991. Of these victims, 12 were killed in his North 25th Street apartment. Three further victims were murdered and dismembered at his grandmother's West Allis residence, with his first and second victims being murdered at his parents' home in Bath, Ohio, and at the Ambassador Hotel in Wisconsin respectively. A total of 14 of Dahmer's victims were from various ethnic minority backgrounds, with nine victims being black. Dahmer was adamant that the race of his victims was incidental to him and that it was the body form of a potential victim that attracted his attention.&lt;ref name="Mind p. 36"/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Despite Dahmer's insistence the race of his victims was incidental to him, some theorize the majority of his murders may have held a racial motive.&lt;ref&gt;''Erasing Racism: The Survival of the American Nation'' {{ISBN|978-1-615-92527-8}} p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth-Century Murder'' {{ISBN|978-1-858-91390-2}} p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, his victim selection may have simply been a result of his living in an ethnically mixed area, and the [[demography|demographics]] of the districts of Milwaukee and Chicago where he typically selected his victims.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}}

Most of Dahmer's victims were killed by strangulation after being drugged with sedatives, although his first victim was killed by a combination of bludgeoning and strangulation and his second victim was battered to death, with one further victim killed in 1990, Ernest Miller, dying of a combination of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] and blood loss due to his carotid artery being cut.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of Dahmer's victims killed in 1991 had holes bored into their skulls through which Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid or, later, boiling water, directly into the brain&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to induce a permanent, submissive, unresistant state. On at least three occasions, this proved fatal although on none of these occasions was this Dahmer's intention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated188"/&gt;

Last seen hitchhiking to a rock concert in [[Chippewa Lake Park]] in Bath, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Dahmer's admission, what caught his attention to Steven Hicks hitchhiking was the fact that the youth was bare-chested. He was bludgeoned with a dumbbell and strangled to death with this instrument before being dismembered. Remains pulverized and scattered in woodland behind Dahmer's childhood home.

===1987===
*'''November 20''': Steven Tuomi, 25. Killed in a rented room at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee. Dahmer claimed to have no memory of murdering Tuomi, yet stated he must have battered him to death in a drunken stupor. His body was dismembered in the basement of Dahmer's grandmother's house and the remains discarded in the trash. No remains were ever found.

Dahmer strangled Doxtator and kept his body in the basement for a week before dismembering him and discarding the remains in the trash. No remains were ever found.
*'''March 24''': Richard Guerrero, 22. Drugged and strangled in Dahmer's bedroom at West Allis. Dahmer dismembered Guerrero's corpse in the basement, dissolved the flesh in acid and disposed of the bones in the trash. He bleached and retained the skull for several months before disposing of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; No remains were ever found.

*'''May 20''': Raymond Smith, 32. The first victim to be killed at Dahmer's North 25th Street apartment. Smith was a male prostitute whom Dahmer encountered at a tavern.

A known acquaintance of Dahmer who was last seen in his company at a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer acidified Smith's skeleton; his skull was destroyed unintentionally when placed in the oven in an effort to remove moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; No remains were ever found.
*'''September 2''': Ernest Miller, 22. Miller was a dance student whom Dahmer encountered outside a bookstore. According to Dahmer, he was especially attracted to Miller's [[physical attractiveness|physique]].

*'''September 24''': David Thomas, 22. Encountered Dahmer near the Grand Avenue Mall; he was lured to Dahmer's apartment on the promise of money for posing nude. Once a laced drink had rendered Thomas unconscious, Dahmer decided he "wasn't my type." Nonetheless, Dahmer strangled Thomas, taking Polaroid photos of the dismemberment process. No remains were ever found.&lt;ref name="autogenerated217"/&gt;

===1991===
*'''February 18''': Curtis Straughter, 17. Approached by Dahmer as he waited at a bus stop near Marquette University.

*'''April 7''': Errol Lindsey, 19. The first victim upon whom Dahmer practiced what he later described to investigators as his "drilling technique," a procedure in which he drilled holes into the victim's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the brain. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this practice, after which he was again rendered unconscious with a drink laced with sedatives, then strangled to death. Dahmer flayed Lindsey's body and retained the skin for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His skull was found following Dahmer's arrest.
*'''May 24''': Tony Hughes, 31. Hughes was a [[deaf-mute]] whom Dahmer lured to his apartment upon the promise of posing nude for photographs.

His skull was retained and identified from dental records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert J.

*'''May 27''': Konerak Sinthasomphone, 14. The younger brother of the boy Dahmer had assaulted in 1988. Sinthasomphone was drugged and had hydrochloric acid injected into his brain before Dahmer left the youth unattended as he left the apartment to purchase beer. When he returned, he discovered Sinthasomphone naked and disoriented in the street, with three distressed young women attempting to assist him. When police arrived, Dahmer persuaded them he and Sinthasomphone were lovers and that the youth was simply intoxicated. When police left Sinthasomphone with Dahmer in his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain, and this proved fatal. His head was retained in the freezer and his body dismembered.
*'''June 30''': Matt Turner, 20. On June 30, Dahmer attended the [[Chicago Pride Parade]]. At a bus stop, he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner and persuaded him to accompany him to Milwaukee to pose for a photo shoot.

His head and internal organs were put in the freezer and his torso subsequently placed in the 57-gallon drum Dahmer purchased on July 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''July 5''': Jeremiah Weinberger, 23. Met Dahmer at a gay bar in Chicago and agreed to accompany him to Milwaukee for the weekend. Dahmer drilled through Weinberger's skull and injected boiling water into the cavity. He later recalled Weinberger's death to be exceptional, as he was the only victim who died with his eyes open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberger's decapitated body was kept in the bathtub for a week before being dismembered; his torso was placed in the 57-gallon drum.

*'''July 19''': Joseph Bradehoft, 25. Dahmer's last victim. Bradehoft was a father of three children from [[Minnesota]] who was looking for work in Milwaukee at the time of his murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19910726&amp;id=3jcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4914,2602947 |title=Milwaukee Journal Jul. 26, 1991 |publisher=Google News |date=July 26, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was left on Dahmer's bed for two days following his murder before, on July 21, being decapitated.

'''Jens Galschiøt''', (Born 4 June 1954), is a Danish [[sculpture|sculptor]] best known for the [[Pillar of Shame]]. Galschiøt moved to [[Odense]] in 1973, and in 1985 he opened a 2000 square metre combined foundry, studio, [[Gallery Galschiøt]] and sculpture park.&lt;ref name=askart&gt;{{cite web | title =Jens Galschiot (1954 - )| work =The Artists' Bluebook - Worldwide Edition | publisher =AskART | url =http://www.askart.com/AskART/G/Jens_Galschiot/Jens_Galschiot.aspx?searchtype=SUMMARY&amp;artist=11101977 | accessdate =2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Galschiøt, [[Erik Mortensen]] and [[Jean Voigt]], created the sculpture ''The Ringwearer's Jacket'', which was commissioned by the Clothing Industry’s Union of Denmark for Queen [[Margrethe II]]’s 50th birthday. Galschiøt contributed work to the [[Seville Expo '92]].

Jens Galschiot is a very complex artist, who moves around in the main distributing frame as, [[Installation art]] , [[Conceptual art]], [[Happening]], [[Performance art]] and [[Street art|Street Art]] with clear references to "social sculptures" (Joseph Beuys), [[Symbolisme (stilperiode)|Symbolism]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. Jens Galschiot mainly works with sculptures to fight the injustice in the world, and puts them up in big squares and cities all around the world. The sculptures are mainly made in [[bronze]] and paid for with his own money.

In 1997, he created the [[Pillar of Shame]] in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Indie1997"&gt;{{cite news

In 2008, Galschiøt started ''The Color Orange'' campaign against human rights violations in China. He was denied entry to Hong Kong, where he had intended to paint the [[Pillar of Shame]] orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Pan | first =Aaron | title =Hong Kong Hosts Torch Relay Amid Support, Criticism | work =News - Asia | publisher =Bloomberg | date =2 May 2008 | url =https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=aXX_8VM2uAZ4&amp;pid=20601080 | accessdate =2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pillar was later moved to a site at the entrance of the village of [[Acteal]] in [[Chiapas]], where 45 unarmed indigenous people were killed by a paramilitary group on 22 December 1997. The re-erection of the sculpture was attended by hundreds of local people. On 22 December 2003, plates in the local language [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]] were donated to the inhabitants of Acteal. The original plates on the Pillar were in Spanish and English - languages that many indigenous people do not understand.

===Brazil===

On 17 April 2000, a [[Pillar of Shame]] was erected in front of the Brazilian Parliament in [[Brasília]] to commemorate 19 landless peasants who were killed by the military police in the northern state of Pará on

The Minister of Justice said that: "This sculpture will never be set up in front of the Brazilian Parliament."{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} On 1 May, the [[Pillar of Shame]] was permanently erected in [[Belém]], capital of the northern
state of Pará, where the [[Eldorado dos Carajás massacre|Eldorado massacre]] had taken place in connection with a land occupation. Mayor [[Edmilson Rodrigues]] declared at the inauguration: "Despite of resistance from the elite, we stick to our promise of setting up the [[Pillar of Shame]] as a symbol opposing oppression and violence that is taking a toll of lives and depriving people of
their rights".{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Cocoon==

''The Cocoon'' is a sculpture group made for the Danish exhibition in the Art Pavilion at the World Exhibition,
[[Seville Expo '92]], Spain. The Cocoon consists of 22 steel shields, each measuring
1.5 metres x 4 meters.&lt;ref name="nak_gym"&gt;{{cite web

The exhibition was arranged in cooperation with The Mobile Gallery in Kolding that had received a 76-metre-long submarine as a gift from Gorbatjev.&lt;ref&gt;Folkebladet Sydjylland, 4. oct 1991, 23. May 1992&lt;/ref&gt; French artist [[:fr:Jean Dewasne|Jean Dewasne]] was responsible for the outside ornamentation, Galschiot for the inside fitting up of the submarine.

The purpose was, in an untraditional way, to focus on the increasing violence, intolerance, [[racism]] and persecution of minorities, that Europe is witnessing these years. In November 1993, the twenty sculptures of [[my inner beast]] were erected within 55 hours without the knowledge of the authorities. The sculptures created a lot of commotion and debate in political circles, in the press&lt;ref&gt;Berlingske Tidende, Jyllandsposten, Aalborg stiftstidende, Jydske vestkysten, fyens stiftstidende, Det fri aktuelt, 8. nov 1993 - 17. nov 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and in the public. In several places, a permanent position has been found for my inner beast that was a gift to each city. More than 100 volunteers contributed to the happening.

===The Beast - 10 years after===
On the occasion of the 10th anniversary, Jens Galschiot and his staff initiated a search to find
out what has happened to each of the 20 sculptures. The fate of the Beasts varies quite a lot. In some cities the statue has been hidden away or even destroyed. In other cities the Beast has found a prominent site.&lt;ref&gt;Herning Folkeblad, 8. dec 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In Bonn it has even been incorporated in the German state’s art collection, and the statue also found a permanent place in Copenhagen, Milano,&lt;ref name="aidoh_links"&gt;{{cite web

Fattest and 14 Hunger Boys.

== The Children of Abraham ==
[[The Children of Abraham]] is a dialogue project created by Jens Galschiøt, which highlights the three monotheistic religions: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The project consists of the sculpture [[Fundamentalism (sculpture)|Fundamentalism]], where 600 quotes from the [[Torah]], the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]] are displayed on the sculpture. The sculpture consists of letters forming the word “Fundamentalism”, and the letters are 3,5 meters tall and the sculpture is 9 meters in diameters.

Galschiot has also created “Pillars of Scriptures” for the project, where the 600 quotes are displayed on monitors. The project has been exhibited at [[Silkeborg Bad]] in January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silkeborgbad.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/filer/information/KunstCentretSilkeborgBadogAbrahamsBoernENG.pdf|title=Silkeborg Bad|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is going to be exhibited at the festival Heavenly Days in [[Copenhagen]] in 2016.

==Gallery==
Galshiøt maintains a workshop and gallery in northern Odense. It includes an exhibition hall containing Galschiøt's sculptures and art, along with painting exhibitions by artists associated with the workshop. There is also a gallery with room for more than 300 guests, which is also used for concerts, debates and conferences. In addition to the gallery there is a small shop with small sculptures and jewellery cast in the workshop, a TV production company, an art school, a willow weaver workshop and a sculpture park. Entrance is free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallerigalschiot.dk/info_en.html|title=Gallery Galshciot - Info - Gallery &amp; Museum, Meeting Center, Sculpture Studio|website=www.gallerigalschiot.dk|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skulpturparkbillund.dk/en/the-artists/jens-galschioet.html|title=skulpturpark-billund.dk: Jens Galschiøt|website=www.skulpturparkbillund.dk|access-date=2016-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323215640/http://www.skulpturparkbillund.dk/en/the-artists/jens-galschioet.html#|archive-date=2016-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galschiøt's foundry works with bronze and silver castings from a few grams, up to 400&amp;nbsp;kg. It is presently one of the few places in Denmark where precious metal casters are educated.

In the 1960s, the buildings were built for the Næsby Car Body Factory and served for many years as one of the largest garages at [[Funen]], but in the context of the economic crisis in the late 1990s the factory closed, and the buildings stood empty for five years. In 1994 Galschiøt bought the factory complex along with several of the surrounding buildings and adjoining land so that the area now is about 10,000 square metres.

Accessed 10 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- note to English reviewers - the name is not a hoax, see citation provided. --&gt; Kang's activism in civil rights (religious and political freedoms) began in 2003 when he was a student. Kang went on a hunger strike from 11 August to 25 September and from 16 October to 25 October 2004. In 2008, Kang joined a [[peace movement]] and in August 2008, staged a naked protest at the Armed Forces Day of [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/05/117_88230.html "Two conscientious objectors convicted."] ''[[The Korea Times]]'' 2 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Kang became a [[conscientious objector]].

== Biography ==
Kang was born in [[Dongdaemun]] in [[Seoul]], [[Republic of Korea]]. He was educated at the Sungil middle school and the Daekwang high school. Kang was enrolled in the [[Seoul National University]] school of law from March 2005 to 2007 but did not complete his studies.&lt;ref name="Hosik (2011)"/&gt;

== Student activism ==
In 2004, Kang refused to attend his high school chapel services, preferring private worship. On 8 July 2004, Kang was expelled. From 11 August to 25 September 2004, Kang went on an hunger strike, receiving support from some teachers, civic groups and 32 congressmen. Kang returned to school in October 2004 but held a further hunger strike from 17 to 21 October. This won religious rights for students and in taking legal action against his school and the government of [[Seoul]] Kang was compensated.&lt;ref name="Hosik (2011)"/&gt;

As a student of law, Kang promoted the rights of student minorities and on 1 October 2008, made a nude protest against compulsory military service at the 60th Armed Forces Day anniversary parade on Teheran road, Samseong-dongin, Seoul. He ran naked into the parade carrying a gun shaped cookie. He blew on the cookie before eating it. He said,
:"Being nude is a symbol of peace and disarmament. It represents being actively involved in a nonviolent movement for peace. The distribution of gun-shaped cookies implies that a world without arms is sweet and peace is delicious...It would only cost $1.5 trillion to solve worldwide poverty and cure all diseases. We are spending over $1.7 trillion in Korea for our military budget. It caused the killing of innocent citizens in Geochang, Gwangju, and Jeju, and the overthrow of the democratic government of Korea at the same time. Recent military actions include depriving citizens of their homes and taking violent action against candlelit rallies...First I thought recruiting soldiers could be okay. But later I thought we do not need a military system at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2013/07/117_32016.html "Activist detained for streaking at military parade."] ''[[The Korea Times]]'' 1 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kang was detained by police and taken to Suseo police station.

=== Conscientious objector ===
In December 2010, Kang received a notice to appear for military duty from the Military Manpower Administration. He refused to attend and was charged with refusing to perform mandatory military duty. Kang commented,
:"Whatever ruling the court comes out with, I have no plan to appeal the decision to a higher court. If it rules against me, I will go to prison and do my time. I think it is worthwhile contemplating what I am going to do after serving my sentence, rather than wasting time by filing an appeal to a higher court...I would like to spend my time in a productive manner. From now on, I will only think about what I am going to do after getting out of jail.”&lt;ref name="Hosik (2011)"/&gt;

Kwon Ki-moon, a judge of the Seoul central district court sentenced Kang to eighteen months in prison for violating the conscription law. Kang was taken to prison immediately after the ruling with his mother watching in the courtroom. The judge said,
:"With the military confrontation between the two Koreas in place, the freedom of conscience can be restricted for the sake of national security.

== Felonious criminal ==
On June 2008, Kang committed a felony over heads and other body parts of policemen and their bus. The Seoul Central District Court ordered a heavy penalty including a heavy fine.&lt;ref name="촛불집회서 `거친 행동' 강의석씨 벌금 600만원"/&gt;

== Prison activist ==
On 14 September and 27 January 2011, Kang began periods of hunger strike of seven days to promote the rights of prisoners. His efforts were interrupted on 8 February 2011 by fainting and hospital admissions.

'''''l''-diversity''' is a form of group based anonymization that is used to preserve privacy in data sets by reducing the granularity of a data representation. This reduction is a trade off that results in some loss of effectiveness of data management or mining algorithms in order to gain some privacy. The ''l''-diversity model is an extension of the [[k-anonymity|''k''-anonymity]] model which reduces the granularity of data representation using techniques including generalization and suppression such that any given record maps onto at least ''k-1'' other records in the data.   The ''l''-diversity model handles some of the weaknesses in the ''k''-anonymity model where protected identities to the level of ''k''-individuals is not equivalent to protecting the corresponding sensitive values that were generalized or suppressed, especially when the sensitive values within a group exhibit homogeneity. The ''l''-diversity model adds the promotion of intra-group diversity for sensitive values in the anonymization mechanism.

==Attacks on ''k''-anonymity==

While ''k''-anonymity is a promising approach to take for group based anonymization given its simplicity and wide array of algorithms that perform it, it is however susceptible to many attacks. When background knowledge is available to an attacker, such attacks become even more effective. Such attacks include:

* '''Homogeneity Attack''': This attack leverages the case where all the values for a sensitive value within a set of ''k'' records are identical. In such cases, even though the data has been ''k''-anonymized, the sensitive value for the set of ''k'' records may be exactly predicted.
* '''Background Knowledge Attack''': This attack leverages an association between one or more quasi-identifier attributes with the sensitive attribute to reduce the set of possible values for the sensitive attribute. For example, Machanavajjhala, Kifer, Gehrke, and Venkitasubramaniam (2007) showed that knowing that heart attacks occur at a reduced rate in Japanese patients could be used to narrow the range of values for a sensitive attribute of a patient's disease.

==Formal definition==

Given the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred for ''k''-anonymity data, the ''l''-diversity method was created to further ''k''-anonymity by additionally maintaining the diversity of sensitive fields.

A table has entropy ''l''-diversity when for every equivalent class ''E'', ''Entropy''(''E'') ≥ log(''l'').
# '''Recursive (''c''-''l'')-diversity''' – A compromise definition that ensures the most common value does not appear too often while less common values are ensured to not appear too infrequently.

Aggarwal and Yu (2008) note that when there is more than one sensitive field the ''l''-diversity problem becomes more difficult due to added dimensionalities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">In [[category theory]], a discipline within mathematics, the '''nerve''' ''N''(''C'') of a [[small category]] ''C'' is a [[simplicial set]] constructed from the objects and morphisms of ''C''. The [[geometric realization]] of this simplicial set is a [[topological space]], called the '''classifying space of the category''' ''C''. These closely related objects can provide information about some familiar and useful categories using [[algebraic topology]], most often [[homotopy theory]].

==Motivation==

The nerve of a category is often used to construct topological versions of [[moduli space]]s. If ''X'' is an object of ''C'', its moduli space should somehow encode all objects isomorphic to ''X'' and keep track of the various isomorphisms between all of these objects in that category. This can become rather complicated, especially if the objects have many non-identity automorphisms. The nerve provides a combinatorial way of organizing this data. Since simplicial sets have a good homotopy theory, one can ask questions about the meaning of the various homotopy groups &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''(''C'')). One hopes that the answers to such questions provide interesting information about the original category ''C'', or about related categories.

The notion of nerve is a direct generalization of the classical notion of [[classifying space]] of a discrete group; see below for details.

==Construction==

Let ''C'' be a small category.  There is a 0-simplex of ''N''(''C'') for each object of ''C''. There is a 1-simplex for each morphism ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''y'' in ''C''. Now suppose that ''f'': ''x'' &amp;rarr; ''y'' and ''g''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; &amp;nbsp;''z'' are morphisms in&amp;nbsp;''C''. Then we also have their composition ''gf''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''z''. [[Image:Nerve-2-simplex.png|thumb|right|A 2-simplex.]] The diagram suggests our course of action: add a 2-simplex for this commutative triangle. Every 2-simplex of ''N''(''C'') comes from a pair of composable morphisms in this way. The addition of these 2-simplices does not erase or otherwise disregard morphisms obtained by composition, it merely remembers that this is how they arise.

In general, ''N''(''C'')&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the ''k''-tuples of composable morphisms

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 \to A_1 \to A_2 \to \cdots \to A_{k-1} \to A_k&lt;/math&gt;

of ''C''. To complete the definition of ''N''(''C'') as a simplicial set, we must also specify the face and degeneracy maps. These are also provided to us by the structure of ''C'' as a category. The face maps

:&lt;math&gt;d_i \colon N(C)_k\to N(C)_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

are given by composition of morphisms at the ''i''th object (or removing the ''i''th object from the sequence, when ''i'' is 0 or ''k'').&lt;ref&gt;The ''i''th face of the simplex is then the one missing the ''i''th vertex.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; sends the ''k''-tuple

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 \to \cdots \to A_{i-1} \to A_i \to A_{i+1} \to \cdots \to A_k&lt;/math&gt;

to the (''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 \to \cdots \to A_{i-1} \to A_{i+1} \to \cdots \to A_k.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the map ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; composes the morphisms ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; into the morphism ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding a (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple for every ''k''-tuple.

Similarly, the degeneracy maps

:&lt;math&gt;s_i:N(C)_k\to N(C)_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;

are given by inserting an identity morphism at the object ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Simplicial sets may also be regarded as [[functors]] &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''Set''', where &amp;Delta; is the category of totally ordered finite sets and order-preserving morphisms. Every partially ordered set ''P'' yields a (small) category ''i''(''P'') with objects the elements of ''P'' and with a unique morphism from ''p'' to ''q'' whenever ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''q'' in ''P''. We thus obtain a functor ''i'' from the category &amp;Delta; to the category of small categories. We can now describe the nerve of the category ''C'' as the functor &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''Set'''

:&lt;math&gt;N(C)(?) = \mathrm{Fun}(i(?),C). \, &lt;/math&gt;

This description of the nerve makes functoriality transparent; for example, a functor between small categories ''C'' and ''D'' induces a map of simplicial sets ''N''(''C'') &amp;rarr; ''N''(''D''). Moreover, a natural transformation between two such functors induces a homotopy between the induced maps. This observation can be regarded as the beginning of one of the principles of [[higher category theory]]. It follows that [[adjoint functor]]s induce [[homotopy equivalence]]s. In particular, if ''C'' has an [[initial object|initial]] or [[final object]], its nerve is contractible.

==Examples==
The primordial example is the classifying space of a discrete group ''G''. We regard ''G'' as a category with one object whose endomorphisms are the elements of ''G''. Then the ''k''-simplices of ''N''(''G'') are just ''k''-tuples of elements of ''G''. The face maps act by multiplication, and the degeneracy maps act by insertion of the identity element. If ''G'' is the group with two elements, then there is exactly one nondegenerate ''k''-simplex for each nonnegative integer ''k'', corresponding to the unique ''k''-tuple of elements of ''G'' containing no identities. After passing to the geometric realization, this ''k''-tuple can be identified with the unique ''k''-cell in the usual [[CW complex|CW]] structure on infinite-dimensional [[real projective space]]. The latter is the most popular model for the classifying space of the group with two elements. See (Segal 1968) for further details and the relationship of the above to Milnor's join construction of ''BG''.

===Most spaces are classifying spaces===
Every "reasonable" topological space is homeomorphic to the classifying space of a small category. Here, "reasonable" means that the space in question is the geometric realization of a simplicial set. This is obviously a necessary condition; it is also sufficient. Indeed, let ''X'' be the geometric realization of a simplicial set ''K''. The set of simplices in ''K'' is partially ordered, by the relation ''x'' &amp;le; ''y'' if and only if ''x'' is a face of ''y''. We may consider this partially ordered set as a category. The nerve of this category is the [[barycentric subdivision]] of ''K'', and thus its realization is homeomorphic to ''X'', because ''X'' is the realization of ''K'' by hypothesis and barycentric subdivision does not change the homeomorphism type of the realization.

===The nerve of an open covering===
{{Main|Nerve of an open covering}}

If ''X'' is a topological space with open cover ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[nerve of an open covering|nerve of the cover]] is obtained from the above definitions by replacing the cover with the category obtained by regarding the cover as a partially ordered set with relation that of set inclusion. Note that the realization of this nerve is not generally homeomorphic to ''X'' (or even homotopy equivalent).

===A moduli example===
One can use the nerve construction to recover mapping spaces, and even get "higher-homotopical" information about maps. Let ''D'' be a category, and let ''X'' and ''Y'' be objects of ''D''. One is often interested in computing the set of morphisms ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''. We can use a nerve construction to recover this set. Let ''C'' = ''C''(''X'',''Y'') be the category whose objects are diagrams

:&lt;math&gt;X \longleftarrow U \longrightarrow V \longleftarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;

such that the morphisms ''U''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''V'' are isomorphisms in ''D''. Morphisms in ''C''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') are diagrams of the following shape:

: [[Image:Mappings-as-moduli.png]]

Here, the indicated maps are to be isomorphisms or identities. The nerve of ''C''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is the [[moduli space]] of maps ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''. In the appropriate [[model category]] setting, this moduli space is weak homotopy equivalent to the simplicial set of morphisms of ''D'' from ''X'' to&amp;nbsp;''Y''.

'''''Nonkilling Global Political Science''''' is a 2002 book written by [[political scientist]] [[Glenn D. Paige]]. In his book, Paige challenges the violence-accepting assumptions of the discipline of political science as a whole. Paige introduces the concept of [[Nonkilling]], which refers to the absence of killing, threats to kill, and conditions conducive to killing in human society.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn D. Paige, ''Nonkilling Global Political Science.'' Center for Global Nonkilling, 2002; 3rd ed. 2009, page 1.[http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009 the book was being translated into 34 languages [http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18] and had led to convening the First Global Nonkilling Leadership Forum in [[Honolulu]], Hawai‘i, 1–4 November 2007.&lt;ref name="GNKLconf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Nonkilling Leadership |year=2009 |url=http://www.nonkilling.org/pdf/forum1.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manmingongdongheo was first held on 1896. On March 10, 1897, criticizing an intervention of Russia. Ten thousand Seoul citizens attended the congress. Within ten days, the Korean Empire government agreed the decisions of Manmingongdonghoe and Russia conceded to Korean order. The congress grew more and more, and insisted on various rights of people and protection of concessions from the great Powers.

On October 12, the congress succeed in founding a reform-minded government composed of innovative officials such as [[Mihn Yong-hwan]] and [[Park Jeong-yang]]. The new government agreed to establish a [[national assembly]]. However pro-Russians and conservatives who hated Manmingongdonghoe, spread a rumor that the congress will revolt and expel [[Emperor Gojong]].&lt;ref name="bisops"&gt;[http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=237092&amp;v=43 People's joint association] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411110936/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=237092&amp;v=43 |date=2013-04-11 }} {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gojong surprised and ordered the troops to dissolve the congress.&lt;ref name="bisops"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''periodic sequence''' (sometimes called a '''cycle''') is a [[sequence]] for which the same [[term (logic)|terms]] are repeated over and over:

:''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ...

The number ''p'' of repeated terms is called the '''period''' ([[frequency|period]]).

==Definition==
A periodic sequence is a sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... satisfying

:''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

for all values of ''n''.  If we regard a sequence as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is the set of [[natural number]]s, then a periodic sequence is simply a special type of [[periodic function]].

==Examples==
The sequence of digits in the [[decimal]] expansion of 1/7 is periodic with period 6:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857\,142857\,142857\,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the sequence of digits in the decimal expansion of any [[rational number]] is eventually periodic (see below).

The sequence of powers of &amp;minus;1 is periodic with period two:

:&lt;math&gt;-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the sequence of powers of any [[root of unity]] is periodic.  The same holds true for the powers of any element of finite [[order (group theory)|order]] in a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

A [[periodic point]] for a function {{math|''f'' : ''X'' → ''X''}} is a point {{mvar|x}} whose [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]

:&lt;math&gt;x,\, f(x),\, f(f(x)),\, f^3(x),\, f^4(x),\, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

is a periodic sequence.  Here, &lt;math&gt;f^n(x)&lt;/math&gt; means the {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-fold}} [[Function composition|composition]] of {{mvar|f}} applied to {{mvar|x}}. Periodic points are important in the theory of [[dynamical systems]].  Every function from a [[finite set]] to itself has a periodic point; [[cycle detection]] is the algorithmic problem of finding such a point.

==Periodic 0, 1 sequences==

Any periodic sequence can be constructed by element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of periodic sequences consisting of zeros and ones. Periodic zero and one sequences can be expressed as sums of trigonometric functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{1} \cos (-\pi\frac{(k-1)}{1})/1 = 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{2} \cos (2\pi\frac{(k-1)}{2})/2 = 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{3} \cos (2\pi\frac{(k-1)}{3})/3 = 0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{N} \cos (2\pi\frac{(k-1)}{N})/N = 0,0,0...,1 \text{  sequence with period  } N &lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
A sequence is '''eventually periodic''' if it can be made periodic by dropping some finite number of terms from the beginning.  For example, the sequence of digits in the decimal expansion of 1/56 is eventually periodic:

: 1 / 56 = 0 . 0 1 7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 5 7 1 4 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 5 7 1 4 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 5 7 1 4 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...

A sequence is '''asymptotically periodic''' if its terms approach those of a periodic sequence.  That is, the sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... is asymptotically periodic if there exists a periodic sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... for which

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} x_n - a_n = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the sequence

:1 / 3,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 / 3,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 / 4,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 / 4,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 / 5,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 / 5,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...

is asymptotically periodic, since its terms approach those of the periodic sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ....

In [[complex geometry]], the term ''positive form'' refers to several classes of real [[differential form]]s of [[Hodge decomposition#Hodge decomposition|Hodge type]] ''(p, p)''.

== (1,1)-forms ==
Real (''p'',''p'')-forms on a complex manifold ''M'' are forms which are of type (''p'',''p'') and real, that is, lie in the intersection :&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{p,p}(M)\cap \Lambda^{2p}(M,{\Bbb R}).&lt;/math&gt; A real (1,1)-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is called '''positive''' if any of the following equivalent conditions hold

#&lt;math&gt;-\omega&lt;/math&gt; is an imaginary part of a positive (not necessarily positive definite) [[Hermitian form]].
#For some basis &lt;math&gt;dz_1, ... dz_n&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{1,0}M&lt;/math&gt; of (1,0)-forms, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}\omega&lt;/math&gt; can be written diagonally, as &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{-1}\omega = \sum_i \alpha_i dz_i\wedge d\bar z_i,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; real and non-negative.
#For any (1,0)-tangent vector &lt;math&gt;v\in T^{1,0}M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-\sqrt{-1}\omega(v, \bar v) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;
#For any real tangent vector &lt;math&gt;v\in TM&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega(v, I(v)) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I:\; TM\mapsto TM&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Complex manifold|complex structure]] operator.

== Positive line bundles ==

In algebraic geometry, positive (1,1)-forms arise as curvature forms of [[ample line bundle]]s (also known as ''positive line bundles''). Let ''L'' be a holomorphic Hermitian line bundle on a complex manifold,

:&lt;math&gt; \bar\partial:\; L\mapsto L\otimes \Lambda^{0,1}(M)&lt;/math&gt;

its complex structure operator. Then ''L'' is equipped with a unique connection preserving the Hermitian structure and satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^{0,1}=\bar\partial&lt;/math&gt;.

This connection is called ''the [[Hermitian connection|Chern connection]]''.

The curvature &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;  of a Chern connection is always a
purely imaginary (1,1)-form. A line bundle ''L'' is called ''positive'' if

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}\Theta&lt;/math&gt;

is a positive definite (1,1)-form. The [[Kodaira embedding theorem]] claims that a positive line bundle is ample, and conversely, any [[ample line bundle]] admits a Hermitian metric with &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}\Theta&lt;/math&gt; positive.

== Positivity for ''(p, p)''-forms ==

Positive (1,1)-forms on ''M'' form a [[convex cone]]. When ''M'' is a compact [[complex surface]], &lt;math&gt;dim_{\Bbb C}M=2&lt;/math&gt;, this cone is [[Convex cone#Dual cone|self-dual]], with respect to the Poincaré pairing :&lt;math&gt; \eta, \zeta \mapsto \int_M \eta\wedge\zeta&lt;/math&gt;

For ''(p, p)''-forms, where &lt;math&gt;2\leq p \leq dim_{\Bbb C}M-2&lt;/math&gt;, there are two different notions of positivity. A form is called
'''strongly positive''' if it is a linear combination of products of positive forms, with positive real coefficients. A real ''(p, p)''-form &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; on an ''n''-dimensional complex manifold ''M'' is called '''weakly positive''' if for all strongly positive ''(n-p, n-p)''-forms ζ with compact support, we have &lt;math&gt;\int_M \eta\wedge\zeta\geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

Weakly positive and strongly positive forms form convex cones. On compact manifolds these cones are [[Convex cone#Dual cone|dual]] with respect to the Poincaré pairing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12556">'''Postnaturalism''' is the theory of the '''postnatural''', a term coined to describe organisms that have been intentionally and heritably altered by humans. Postnaturalism is a cultural process whereby organisms are bred to satisfy a specific cultural purpose. It can be used to read these organisms, which serve as insights into our culture by reflecting desires and beliefs prevalent at the time of breeding. This has direct implications for the [[evolution]]ary path of these organisms,&lt;ref name="CPNH"&gt;{{cite web | title =About | work = | publisher =Center for PostNatural History | date = | url =http://www.postnatural.org/About | accessdate = April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whittling down undesirable traits to leave only those culturally sought out. Postnaturalism argues that in so doing, humans have and continue to actively alter the evolutionary path of a postnatural organism to suit our cultural desires. The agricultural practice of [[monoculture]], for instance, is just one example of postnatural organisms who have been bred to such an extent that the modern-day species look nothing like their pre-[[Neolithic Revolution|neolithic]] counterparts. The breeding of these species for this purpose can be seen to be reflected in notable diet changes during this period,&lt;ref name ="Nutrition"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richards | first=MP | date=2002 | title=A brief review of the archaeological evidence for Palaeolithic and Neolithic subsistence | url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v56/n12/pdf/1601646a.pdf | journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 56 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601646 | access-date = May 5, 2015 | pmid=12494313 | pages=16 p following 1262}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proliferated during ensuing sedentism and urbanisation.&lt;ref name ="Nutrition"/&gt;

Postnaturalism is a highly selective process. For every organism that has become used in our society, there are countless more that have remained non-postnatural for whatever reason ranging from a perceived lack of future use from them or traits that make them too difficult to farm. One such example is the golden orb-weaver spider which produces a strong, light and useful silk, however they are known to be cannibalistic and thus impossible to farm on a large scale.&lt;ref name="SpiderSilk"&gt;{{cite web | author = Ferguson, Cat | title = Mixing Spider DNA and Goat Embryos Produces Milk With a Side of Silk  | work = | publisher = takepart | date = April 10, 2014 | url = http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/04/10/gmo-goats | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postnatural History==
Postnatural history is defined as the "study of the origins, habitats, and evolution of organisms that have been ''intentionally'' and ''heritably'' altered by humans", which serves as a "record of the influence of human culture on evolution".&lt;ref name="CPNH" /&gt; So termed to differentiate it from traditional [[natural history]] studies, it is the subject of a storefront in [[Pittsburgh]], United States called the [[Center for PostNatural History]], which builds on this concept to produce an array of displays of organisms which are all postnatural.&lt;ref name="CPNH" /&gt;

==Domestication==
The commencement of the postnatural can be considered to date back to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] civilisation's early interaction with wild species. Here, [[domestication]] occurred as a way of adapting the environment around prehistoric people to suit their needs and desires through a gradual process of refinement. Domestication succeeds through the heritable continuation of an organism's [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]] allowing each generation to continue on from their previous generation. In its simplest terms, domestication alters a species through survival to a change in habitat, food source, or other significant change. These changes can be sought for a variety of different reasons including physical attributes, behavioural characteristics, lifespan, and adaptability to a change in environment.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond|first= Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond| year=1999|title=[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]|publisher= New York: Norton Press|isbn= 0-393-31755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective breeding==
Postnatural practices include [[selective breeding]], a process by which humans purposefully breed certain organisms for particular biological traits. The practice was known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Buffum, Burt C. |title=Arid Agriculture; A Hand-Book for the Western Farmer and Stockman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rmbur_Am8vgC&amp;pg=PA232|date=2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4086-6710-1|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been commonly used continuing to this day. [[Michael Pollan]] argues that [[Charles Darwin]] saw this process and considered it artificial, rather than natural, selection, but in terms of evolutionary progress this distinction becomes irrelevant to the species; the change is irreversible all the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pollan, Michael |title=The Botany of Desire: A Plants-Eye View of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_L_2yTfOEEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+botany+of+desire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hlg5VdavMYmKNsbUgNAH&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA|date=2001|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|isbn=0-375-76039-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simply because evolution is understood to be unable to 'undo' previous changes, but, particularly in proteins,&lt;ref name="EvolutionProgression"&gt;{{cite web | author=Coghlan, Andy | title =For proteins, evolution can't go backwards  | work = | publisher =New Scientist | date = September 23, 2009| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17841-for-proteins-evolution-cant-go-backwards.html#.VUvzE_lVikp | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; continues along in a progression of its biological structure depending on what traits are required for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rush, J.H. |title=The Dawn of Life|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Dawn-Life-J-Rush/dp/0451021924|date=1962|publisher=Signet, First Printing Edition|isbn=0-451-02192-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Huxley, Julian | editor-last=Newman | editor-first=James Roy | title=What is Science?

==Induced Mutation==
Induced mutation in the context of postnaturalism is the process whereby a specific genetic mutation - usually a rare occurrence - is selectively isolated by people and encouraged to reproduce in future offspring. This differs from the general understanding of a mutation that was induced by treatment from a particular chemical agent in a living species.&lt;ref name="InducedMutation"&gt;{{cite web | title =induced mutation  | work = | publisher =The Free Dictionary by Farlex | date = | url =http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/induced+mutation | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of this is the albino rat which possesses, in the wild a notoriously fatal genetic make-up&lt;ref name="AlbinoRat"&gt;{{cite web | author = Royer, Nichole | title =The Pink-Eyed White Rat  | work = | publisher =American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association | date = October 12, 2014 | url =http://www.afrma.org/pewrats.htm | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it much easier to identify to predators, a coat which drew interest in breeders so as to distinguish them from their more unhygienic-looking sewer counterparts prevalent in major cities in the 1800s. So numerous were rats in industrial cities, they became the subject of a sport based on their extermination, [[rat-baiting]].&lt;ref name="Rat-baiting"&gt;{{cite web | title =Rats II: Man vs Vermin  | work = | publisher =History House Inc | date = | url =http://www.historyhouse.com/in_history/rats_2/ | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The albino rat thus became distinguished from the regular unsightly sewer rat and even became sold as pets, the owning of one as a child allegedly the basis for Beatrix Potter's book ''Samuel Whiskers''.&lt;ref name="AlbinoRat"/&gt;

==Genetic Engineering==
[[Genetic Engineering]] can be considered to be the purposeful alteration of the genetic makeup of an organism through the introduction of genes from sources not belonging to that organism. The isolation of a particular gene and introduction of another is often achieved through the use of [[biotechnology]] more broadly.&lt;ref name = "GEng"&gt;{{cite web | author = MacDonald Glenn, Linda | title = Ethical Issues in Genetic Engineering and Transgenics | work = | publisher = American Institute of Biological Sciences | date = November 2013 | url = http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotechnology/glenn.html | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Genetic engineering is a contentious topic and even in searching for a definition, there are several alternatives available highlighting the variation in perceptions around what is considered to be the goal and process of genetic engineering.&lt;ref name ="GEng1"&gt;{{cite web | title = What is genetic engineering and how does it work? | work = | publisher = University of Nebraska, Lincoln | date = | url = http://agbiosafety.unl.edu/basic_genetics.shtml | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng2"&gt;{{cite web | title = What Is Genetic Engineering? | work = | publisher = Union of Concerned Scientists | date = | url = http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/our-failing-food-system/genetic-engineering/what-is-genetic-engineering.html#.VVpOqhFFDIU | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng3"&gt;{{cite web | title = genetic engineering | work = | publisher = Tech Target | date = | url = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/genetic-engineering | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng4"&gt;{{cite web | author = Melina, Remy | title = What's Genetic Engineering | work = | publisher = Live Science | date = June 15, 2010 | url = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/genetic-engineering | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, genetic engineering embodies much of what is considered postnatural, but doing so with the next level of technology than used in previous methods such as those mentioned in the above sections. Increased use of advanced technology allows for improved precision and accuracy of methods, and carrying out of transgenics, whilst the use of laboratories as settings is designed to prevent the release of experimented organisms into the wild unless cleared with the relevant protocols and regulations beforehand.

==Concerns over postnaturalism's proliferation in monoculture==
The current agricultural practice of monoculture is intricately connected with postnaturalism, particularly now much of common contemporary agricultural practice has become mechanised. This mechanisation sometimes requires universality to comply with existing tools, machines and practices, such as the breeding of chickens to be a uniform size to ensure they fit into [[Chicken harvester|chicken harvesting]] machines.&lt;ref name = "Chicken-catchingMachines"&gt;{{cite web | author = Free From Harm Staff Writers | title = 17 Chicken Facts the Industry Doesn’t Want You to Know | work = | publisher = Free From Harm | date = August 28, 2014 | url = http://freefromharm.org/animalagriculture/chicken-facts-industry-doesnt-want-know/ | accessdate = June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions rather than breed a particular species to a uniform size, some parts of organisms have been so heavily bred and altered that [[dystocia]] can regularly occur, such as with the [[Belgian Blue]] cattle whose birth canal regularly becomes constricted or even entirely blocked due to the birth canal's reduced size and the increased size of calves.&lt;ref name = "Cheville256" /&gt; The result is the routine scheduling of [[Caesarian section]]s.&lt;ref name="Cheville256"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cheville, Norman F. |title=Introduction to veterinary pathology| date=1999| publisher=Wiley-Blackwell| isbn=978-0-8138-2496-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-OF4rmihIUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Educational Vet Video|title=Video of Cow Caesarean Section|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2HJNAgoels|work=VetPulse TV in Practice|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power politics''' (or, in [[German language|German]], '''''Machtpolitik''''') is a theory in [[international relations]], which contains the idea that distributions of power and interests, or changes to those distributions, are fundamental causes of war and of system stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lemke |first1=Douglas |title=Power Politics and Wars without States |journal=American Journal of Political Science |date=October 2008 |volume=52 |issue=Midwest Political Science Association |page=774 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25193849 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The concept of power politics provides a way of understanding systems of [[international relations]]: in this view, nations compete for the world's limited [[resources]] and it is to an individual nation's advantage to be manifestly able to harm others.  Power politics prioritizes [[national interest | national self-interest]] over the interests of other nations or the [[international community]], and thus may include threatening one another with [[military]], [[economic]] or [[political]] aggression to protect one nation's own interest.  

Techniques of power politics include:

* [[deterrence theory]]
* conspicuous [[weapons development | weapons-development]] (including [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] development)
* [[pre-emptive strike]]
* [[blackmail]]
* the massing of military units on a border, whether for stationing or for [[military exercise | exercises]]
* the imposition of [[tariff]]s or [[economic sanction]]s
* [[proxy war | proxy warfare]]
* [[bait and bleed]] and "bloodletting"
* [[balancing in international relations|hard]] and [[soft balancing]]
* [[buck passing]]
* [[covert operation]]s
* [[shock and awe]]
* [[asymmetric warfare]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6867">In the [[law]] of [[evidence]], a '''presumption''' of a particular fact can be made without the aid of proof in some situations. The invocation of a presumption shifts the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from one party to the opposing party in a court trial.

There are two types of presumption: [[rebuttable presumption]] and [[conclusive presumption]]. A rebuttable presumption is assumed true until a person proves otherwise (for example the [[presumption of innocence]]). In contrast, a conclusive (or irrebuttable) presumption cannot be refuted in any case (such as [[defense of infancy]] in some legal systems).

Presumptions are sometimes categorized into two types: presumptions without basic facts, and presumptions with basic facts. In the United States, mandatory presumptions are impermissible in criminal cases, but permissible presumptions are allowed.

An example of presumption without basic facts is [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the presumption of innocence is not a presumption, but rather is a rhetorical expression that emphasizes that the prosecution bears the burden of proof in a criminal case. The accused has no obligation to adduce evidence in their favor and is automatically acquitted unless the prosecution proves guilt [[beyond a reasonable doubt]]. See [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of presumption ''with'' basic facts is [[Declared death in absentia]], e.g., the law says if a person has been missing for seven years or more (basic fact), that person is presumed dead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==History==

The ancient Jewish law code, the [[Talmud]], included reasoning from presumptions (''hazakah''), propositions taken to be true unless there was reason to believe otherwise, such as "One does not ordinarily pay a debt before term."&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept was found in ancient [[Roman law]], where, for example, if there was doubt as to whether a child was really the issue of someone who had left money in a will, the presumption was in favour of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Roman and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] graded presumptions according to strength: light, medium or probable, and violent.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; These gradings and many individual presumptions were taken over into [[English law]] in the seventeenth century by [[Edward Coke]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific presumptions==
A number of presumptions are found in most [[common law]] jurisdictions.  Examples of these presumptions include:
*The [[presumption of death]].  A person who has been absent for seven years without explanation and "gone to parts unknown" is presumed dead at common law.&lt;ref&gt;''Prudential Insurance Comp. v. Moore'', 197 Ind. 50, 149 N.E. 718 (Ind. 1925)&lt;/ref&gt;  The time period it takes for the presumption to arise has often been modified by statute.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 29-2-5-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of sanity]]. A person who faces criminal trial is presumed sane until the opposite is proved.  Similarly, a person is presumed to have testamentary capacity until there is evidence to undermine that presumption.
*The [[presumption of innocence]], which holds that the prosecution bears the burden of proof in a criminal case with the result that the accused may be acquitted without putting forward any evidence.
*The [[presumption of legitimacy]] or [[presumption of paternity]], which presumes that a husband is the [[biological father]] of a child born to his wife during the marriage, or within nine months after the marriage is ended by death, [[legal separation]], or [[divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 31-14-7-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some jurisdictions also hold that a presumption of paternity arises when a father accepts a child into his home, or publicly represents that he is the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 31-14-7-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[presumption of survivorship]] has referred to a number of different presumptions.  The term is sometimes used to refer to presumptions that one or another of two persons lived the longer when [[simultaneous death|they died together in the same accident]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (5th. ed., 1979; West Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-8299-2041-2}}), p. 1068, "Presumption of survivorship"&lt;/ref&gt;  The presumption that two or more people who establish a [[joint account]] intend for the survivors to have the assets put into the fund upon the death of one of the joint account holders has also been called the "presumption of survivorship".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''Matter of Estate of Banko'', 622 N.E.2d 476 (Ind. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of mailing]] presumes that a properly addressed letter delivered to the post office or a [[common carrier]] was in fact delivered and received by the addressee.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''U-Haul Co. of Indiana, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of State Revenue'', 896 N.E.2d 1253 (Ind.Tax 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The presumption of [[fraud]] or [[undue influence]] arises where a person in a position of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] over another, such as a [[guardianship|guardian]] or the holder of a [[power of attorney]] applies the other person's assets to his or her own benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Estate of Compton'', 919 N.E.2d 1181, (Ind.Ct.App. 2010), trans. denied&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of validity]] is another way of expressing a burden of proof: the official acts of courts are presumed valid, and those who would challenge them must overcome this presumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Monon Corp. v. Townsend, Yosha, Cline &amp; Price'', 678 N.E.2d 807, 809 (Ind.Ct.App. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; This is also termed the [[presumption of regularity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Simon &amp; Murphy, Peter &amp; Beaumont, John. Cases &amp; Materials on Evidence. Fourth Edition. Oxford University Press. 1994. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of advancement]] in relation to transfers from husbands to wives and from fathers to children.
*In the law of the United States, the [[presumption of constitutionality]] presumes that all statutes are drafted in accordance with [[Constitution of the United States|Federal]] and [[State constitution (United States)|state]] constitutional requirements.  The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proof, and any doubts are resolved against that party. If there are two reasonable interpretations of a statute, one of which is constitutional and the other not, the courts choose the path that permits upholding the statute.&lt;ref&gt;''Boehm v. Town of St. John'', 675 N.E.2d 318 (Ind.1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''price signal''' is [[information]] conveyed to [[consumer]]s and [[production (economics)|producer]]s, via the price charged for a [[commodity|product or service]], which provides a signal to increase or decrease supply or demand. The information carried by prices is an essential function in the fundamental coordination of an economic system, coordinating things such as what has to be produced, how to produce it and what resources use in its production. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Perfect competition==
In [[neoclassical economics|mainstream (neoclassical) economics]], under [[perfect competition]] [[relative prices]] signal to producers and consumers what [[production (economics)|production]] or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] decisions will contribute to [[allocative efficiency]].

== Pricing power ==
Alternative theories include that prices reflect relative [[pricing power]] of producers and consumers. A [[monopoly]] may set prices so as to maximize [[monopoly profit]], while a [[cartel]] may engage in [[price fixing]]. Conversely, on the consumer side, a [[monopsony]] may negotiate or demand prices that do not reflect the cost of production.

== Value ==
{{main|Theory of value (economics)}}
A long thread in economics (from [[Aristotle]] to [[classical economics]] to the present) distinguishes between [[exchange value]], [[use value]], price, and (sometimes) intrinsic [[Value (economics)|value]]. It is frequently argued that the connection between price and other types of value is not as direct as suggested in the theory of price signals, other considerations playing a part.

== Speculation ==
Financial [[speculation]], particularly buying or selling assets with borrowed money, can move prices away from their [[fundamental analysis|economic fundamentals]]. [[Credit bubble]]s can sometimes distort the price signal mechanism, causing large-scale malinvestment and [[financial crises]]. Adherents of the [[Austrian economics]] attribute this phenomenon to the interference of [[central bank]]ers, which they propose to eliminate by introducing [[full-reserve banking]]. [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian economists]], such as [[Hyman Minsky]], have described it as a fundamental flaw of [[capitalism]], corrected by [[financial regulation]]. Both schools have been the subject of renewed attention in the Western world since the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]].{{cn|date=December 2015}}

== Price discrimination ==
Firms use [[price discrimination]] to increase profits by charging different prices to different consumers or groups of consumers. Price discrimination may be regarded as an unfair practice used to drive out competitors

'''Privacy by design''' is an approach to [[systems engineering]] initially developed by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and formalized in a joint report on [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] by a joint team of the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] (Canada), the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hes|first=R|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/10000/184530.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hustinx|first=Peter|title=Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12394-010-0061-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy by design framework was published in 2009&lt;ref name=7principles/&gt; and adopted by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities in 2010.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt; Privacy by design calls for [[privacy]] to be taken into account throughout the whole engineering process. The concept is an example of [[value sensitive design]], i.e., to take human values into account in a well-defined manner throughout the whole process and may have been derived from this.

Cavoukian's approach to privacy has been criticized as being vague&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to enforce its adoption&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to apply to certain disciplines&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as prioritizing corporate interests over consumers' interests&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; and placing insufficient emphasis on minimizing data collection&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;.

The European [[GDPR]] regulation incorporates privacy by design.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==History and background==
The privacy by design framework was developed by Dr. [[Ann Cavoukian]], [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]], following her joint work with the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;
In 2009, the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] co-hosted an event, ''Privacy by Design: The Definitive Workshop'', with the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the 31st International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioner (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Conference 2009 Fifth Plenary Session – Privacy by Design|url=http://www.privacyconference2009.org/program/Programa_detallado/index-iden-idweb.html#sesion5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the State of PbD to the 33rd International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/PbDReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the framework achieved international acceptance when the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities unanimously passed a resolution on privacy by design&lt;ref name=foreword&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: the definitive workshop. A foreword by Ann Cavoukian, Ph.D|url=https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12394-010-0062-y.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognising it as an international standard at their annual conference.&lt;ref name=report2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Privacy by Design’ approach gains international recognition |url=https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/video-rewind-privacy-by-design-approach-gains-international-recognition/15626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Landmark Resolution passed to preserve the Future of Privacy|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108031015/http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/Resources/News-Releases/News-Releases-Summary/?id=992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resolution&gt;{{cite web|title=32nd International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners Jerusalem, Israel 27-29 October, 2010 Resolution on Privacy by Design|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/10-10-27_jerusalem_resolutionon_privacybydesign_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other commitments, the commissioners resolved to promote privacy by design as widely as possible and foster the incorporation of the principle into policy and legislation.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt;

The principles have been cited in over five hundred articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10949576998236199397|title=Citations for ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice''|publisher=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice'' white paper by [[Ann Cavoukian]].&lt;ref name=pbdLawPolicyPracitice&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/25008/312239.pdf|title="Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice – A White Paper for Regulators, Decision-makers and Policy-makers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundational principles in detail ===
====Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial==== 
The privacy by design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. Privacy by design does not wait for privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred — it aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, privacy by design comes before-the-fact, not after.
&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-implement-7found-principles.pdf|title=The 7 Foundational Principles Implementation and Mapping of Fair Information Practices|date=January 2011|publisher=Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-primer.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – Primer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdce/seven-foundational-principles/The-7-Foundational-Principles.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – The 7 Foundational Principles|publisher=Privacy and Big Data Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy as the default====
Privacy by design seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy — it is built into the system, by default.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Privacy embedded into design====
Privacy by design is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems as well as business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum====
Privacy by design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by design avoids the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy versus security, demonstrating that it is possible to have both.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection====
Privacy by design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved — strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, privacy by design ensures cradle-to-grave, secure lifecycle management of information, end-to-end.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Visibility and transparency – keep it open====
Privacy by design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. Its component parts and operations remain visible and transparent, to users and providers alike. Remember, trust but verify.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric====
Above all, privacy by design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. Keep it user-centric.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

==Design and standards==
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved the Committee on Consumer Policy (COPOLCO) proposal for a new ISO standard: ''Consumer Protection: Privacy by Design for Consumer Goods and Services'' (ISO/PC317).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard will aim to specify the design process to provide consumer goods and services that meet consumers’ domestic processing privacy needs as well as the personal privacy requirements of data protection. The standard has the UK as secretariat with thirteen participating members&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Participating Members|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html?view=participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twenty observing members.&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members/&gt;

The Standards Council of Canada (SCC) is one of the participating members, and has established a mirror Canadian committee to ISO/PC317.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCC ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.scc.ca/en/standards/committees/iso-pc-317-consumer-protection-privacy-design-for-consumer-goods-and-services}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE) TC|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=pbd-ses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical Committee provides a specification to operationalize privacy by design in the context of software engineering. Privacy by design, like security by design, is a normal part of the software development process and a risk reduction strategy for software engineers. The PbD-SE specification translates the PbD principles to conformance requirements within software engineering tasks, and helps software development teams to produce [[artifact (software development)|artifact]]s as evidence of PbD principle adherence. Following the specification facilitates the documentation of privacy requirements from software conception to retirement, thereby providing a plan around adherence to privacy by design principles, and other guidance to privacy best practices, such as NIST’s 800-53 Appendix J (NIST SP 800-53) and the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) (PMRM-1.0).&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt;

==Relationship to privacy-enhancing technologies == 
Privacy by design originated from [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] (PETs) in a joint 1995 report by Ann Cavoukian and John Borking.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; In 2007 the [[European Commission]] provided a memo on PETs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-07-159_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the British Information Commissioner's Office commissioned a report titled ''Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies|url=http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/projects/surveillance/docs/pbd_pets_paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many facets to privacy by design, including software and systems engineering as well as administrative elements (e.g. legal, policy, procedural), other organizational controls and operating contexts. Privacy by design evolved from early efforts to express fair information practice principles directly into the design and operation of information and communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|title=Privacy by Design : Origins, Meaning, and Prospects for Assuring Privacy and Trust in the Information Era)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289769458_Privacy_by_Design_Origins_meaning_and_prospects_for_assuring_privacy_and_trust_in_the_information_era}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publication ''Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises''&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"/&gt; [[Peter Hustinx]] acknowledges the key role played by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and [[John Borking]], then Deputy Privacy Commissioners, in the joint 1995 publication ''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: The Path to Anonymity''.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; This 1995 report focussed on exploring technologies that permit transactions to be conducted anonymously.

Privacy-enhancing technologies allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information (PII) provided to (and handled by) services or applications. Privacy by design evolved to consider the broader systems and processes in which PETs were embedded and operated. The U.S. Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) in ''The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy''&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy|url=https://cdt.org/insight/the-role-of-privacy-by-design-in-protecting-consumer-privacy-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes PET from privacy by design noting that “PETs are most useful for users who already understand online privacy risks. They are essential user empowerment tools, but they form only a single piece of a broader framework that should be considered when discussing how technology can be used in the service of protecting privacy.”&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers/&gt;

== Criticism and recommendations==
The privacy by design framework attracted academic debate, particularly following the 2010 International Data Commissioners resolution, these provide criticism of privacy by design with suggestions by legal and engineering experts to better understand how to apply the framework into various contexts.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Privacy by design has been critiqued as "vague"&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|last=van Rest|first=Jeroen|title=Designing Privacy by Design|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54069-1_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving "many open questions about their application when engineering systems".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Privacy by Design|url=http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1542.pdf|work=Seda Gurses, Carmela Troncoso, and Claudia Diaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, researchers at K.U. Leuven published ''Engineering Privacy by Design'' noting that “The design and implementation of privacy requirements in systems is a difficult problem and requires translation of complex social, legal and ethical concerns into systems requirements”. The authors claim that their statement regarding that the principles of privacy by design "remain vague and leave many open questions about their application when engineering systems", may be viewed as criticism. However, the purpose of the paper is to propose that "starting from data minimization is a necessary and foundational first step to engineer systems in line with the principles of privacy by design". The objective of their paper is to provide an "initial inquiry into the practice of privacy by design from an engineering perspective in order to contribute to the closing of the gap between policy makers’ and engineers’ understanding of privacy by design".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt; 

It has also been pointed out that privacy by design is similar to [[voluntary compliance]] schemes in industries impacting the environment, and thus lacks the teeth necessary to be effective, and may differ per company. In addition, the evolutionary approach currently taken to the development of the concept will come at the cost of privacy infringements because evolution implies also letting unfit phenotypes (privacy-invading products) live until they are proven unfit.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; Some critics have pointed out that certain business models are built around customer surveillance and data manipulation and therefore voluntary compliance is unlikely.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: A Counterfactual Analysis of Google and Facebook Privacy Incidents|ssrn=2128146|work=Ira Rubinstein and Nathan Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Danish National It and Telecom Agency published as discussion paper on "New Digital Security Models" the publication references "Privacy by Design" as a key goal in creating a security model that is compliant with "Privacy by Design". This is done by extending the concept to "Security by Design" with an objective of balancing anonymity and surveillance by eliminating identification as much as possible.&lt;ref name="New Digital Security Models"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Digital Security Models|url=https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/896495/artefact/NewDigitalSecurityModels.pdf?artefact=true&amp;PID=1792137|work=Danish National It and Telecom Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Rubenstein and Good used [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] privacy incidents to conduct a counterfactual analysis in order to identify lessons learned of value for regulators when recommending privacy by design. The first was that “more detailed principles and specific examples” would be more helpful to companies. The second is that “usability is just as important as engineering principles and practices”. The third is that there needs to be more work on “refining and elaborating on design principles–both in privacy engineering and usability design”. including efforts to define international privacy standards. The final lesson learned is that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Another criticism is that current definitions of privacy by design do not address the methodological aspect of systems engineering, such as using decent system engineering methods, e.g. those which cover the complete system and data life cycle. The concept also does not focus on the role of the actual data holder but on that of the system designer. This role is not known in privacy law, so the concept of privacy by design is not based in law. This, in turn, undermines the trust by data subjects, data holders and policy-makers.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;

The advent of [[GDPR]] with its maximum fine of 4% of global turnover now provides a balance between business benefit and turnover, and addresses the [[voluntary compliance]] criticism and requirement from Rubenstein and Good that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt; Rubenstein and Good also highlighted that privacy by design could result in applications that exemplified Privacy by Design and their work was well received.&lt;ref name=CorporateHotness&gt;{{cite web|title=Why 'Privacy By Design' Is The New Corporate Hotness|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/28/why-privacy-by-design-is-the-new-corporate-hotness|work=Kashmir Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

The May 2018 [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]]'s paper ''Preliminary Opinion on Privacy by Design'' states, "While privacy by design has made significant progress in legal, technological and conceptual development, it is still far from unfolding its full potential for the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals. The following sections of this opinion provide an overview of relevant developments and recommend further efforts".&lt;ref name=Opinion&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Opinion on privacy by design|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-05-31_preliminary_opinion_on_privacy_by_design_en_0.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The executive summary makes the following recommendations to EU institutions:
* To ensure strong privacy protection, including privacy by design, in the ePrivacy Regulation.
* To support privacy in all legal frameworks which influence the design of technology, increasing incentives and substantiating obligations, including appropriate liability rules,
* To foster the roll-out and adoption of privacy by design approaches and PETs in the EU and at the member states’ level through appropriate implementing measures and policy initiatives,
* To ensure competence and resources for research and analysis on privacy engineering and privacy enhancing technologies at EU level, by ENISA or other entities,
* To support the development of new practices and business models through the research and technology development instruments of the EU,
* To support EU and national public administrations to integrate appropriate privacy by design requirements in public procurement,
* To support an inventory and observatory of the “state of the art” of privacy engineering and PETs and their advancement.

The EDPS will:
* Continue to promote privacy by design, where appropriate in cooperation with other data protection authorities in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB),
* Support coordinated and effective enforcement of Article 25 of the GDPR and related provisions,
* Provide guidance to controllers on the appropriate implementation of the principle laid down in the legal base, and
* Together with the DPAs of Austria, Ireland and Schleswig-Holstein, award privacy friendly apps in the mobile health domain.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==Implementing privacy by design==
The [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]] set out the requirement to implement privacy by design in his article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design - Privacy Engineering|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-01-25_privacy_by_design_privacy_engineering_cpdp_en_3.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] (ENISA) provided a detailed report ''Privacy and Data Protection by Design – From Policy to Engineering'' on implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Data Protection by Design – from policy to engineering|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design/at_download/fullReport|work=ENISA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer School on real-world crypto and privacy provided a tutorial on "Engineering Privacy by Design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering privacy by design|url=https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/2017/slides/Engineering%20privacy%20by%20design.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks Project] for web applications that gives hints on how to implement privacy by design in practice. The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt; offers a privacy extension/complement to OMG’s Unified Modeling Language (UML) and serves as a complement to OASIS’ eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language (XACML) and Privacy Management Reference Model (PMRM).

{{Split|Property (philosophy)|Property (mathematics)|date=June 2018}}
In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]], a '''property''' is a characteristic of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]]; a red object is said to have the property of redness. The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be [[instantiation principle|instantiated]], and often in more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept of [[class (set theory)|class]] by not having any concept of [[extensionality]], and from the philosophical concept of [[class (philosophy)|class]] in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the [[problem of universals]]. The terms '''attribute''' and [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] have similar meanings.

==Metaphysical Debates about the Nature of Properties==
In modern [[analytic philosophy]] there are several debates about the fundamental nature of properties. These center around questions such as: Are properties real? Are they categorical or dispositional? Are properties physical or mental?
===Realism vs. Anti-Realism&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/#DisTer&lt;/ref&gt;=== 
A realist about properties asserts that properties have genuine existence. One way to spell this out is in terms of exact, repeatable, instantiations known [[universals]]. The other realist position asserts that properties are particulars(tropes), which are unique instantiations in individual objects that merely resemble one another to various degrees.

The anti-realist position, often referred to as [[nominalism]] claims that properties are names we attach to particulars. The properties themselves have no existence.

===Categoricalism vs. Dispositionalism&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/#CatProVsCauPow&lt;/ref&gt;=== 
According to the categoricalist, dispositions reduce to causal bases. The fragility of a wine glass, for example, is not a property that exists in the glass. Rather it can be explained by the categorical property of the glass's micro-structural composition.

Dispositionalism, in turn, asserts that a property is nothing more that a set of causal powers.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/#CatDisLawNat&lt;/ref&gt; Fragility, according to this view, identifies a real property of the glass (e.g. to shatter when dropped on a sufficiently hard surface).

Several intermediary positions exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/#CatDisLawNat&lt;/ref&gt; The Identity view that states that properties are both categorical(qualitative) and dispositional, they are just two ways of viewing the same property. One hybrid view claims that some properties are categorical and some are dispositional. A second hybrid view claims that properties have both a categorical(qualitative) and dispositional part, but that these are distinct ontological parts.

===Physicalism, Idealism, and Property dualism===
{{Main|Physicalism}}
{{Main|Idealism}}
{{Main|Property dualism}}
[[Image:Property dualism.jpg|thumb|Property dualism: the exemplification of two kinds of property by one kind of substance]] Property dualism describes a category of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]] which hold that, although the world is constituted of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]]—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical substances (namely brains).

This stands in contrast to physicalism and idealism. Physicalism claims that all properties, include mental properties, ultimately reduce to, or supervene on, physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical Idealism, by contrast, claims that "something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality."&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/idealism/#Int&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essential and accidental properties==
In classical [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] terminology, a ''property'' (Greek: ''idion'', Latin: ''proprium'') is one of the [[predicables]]. It is a non-[[essence|essential]] quality of a species (like an [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]), but a quality which is nevertheless characteristically present in members of that species. For example, "ability to laugh" may be considered a special characteristic of human beings. However, "laughter" is not an ''essential'' quality of the species ''human'', whose Aristotelian definition of "rational animal" does not require laughter. Therefore, in the classical framework, ''properties'' are characteristic qualities that are not truly required for the continued existence of an entity but are, nevertheless, possessed by the entity.

==Determinate and determinable properties==
A property may be classified as either determinate or determinable. A determinable property is one that can get more specific. For example, color is a determinable property because it can be restricted to redness, blueness, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinate-determinables/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy ''Determinate and Determinable Properties'']&lt;/ref&gt; A determinate property is one that cannot become more specific. This distinction may be useful in dealing with issues of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lovely and suspect qualities==
[[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes between ''lovely'' properties (such as loveliness itself), which, although they
require an observer to be recognised, exist latently in perceivable objects; and ''suspect'' properties which have no existence at all until attributed by an observer (such as being suspected of a crime)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/lovely&amp;s.htm|title=Lovely and Suspect Qualities|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and predicates==
The ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] to a [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as [[Russell's paradox]] and the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]]. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates "..weighs more than 1.9 kilos", "..weighs more than 1.8 kilos", etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as "is an individual", or "has some properties" are uninformative or vacuous. There is some resistance to regarding such so-called '''"[[Cambridge_change|Cambridge properties]]"''' as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/existence/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Michael|last=Nelson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrinsic and extrinsic properties==
{{main|Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)}}
An '''intrinsic''' property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context.  An '''extrinsic''' (or '''relational''') property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. The latter is sometimes also called an '''attribute''', since the value of that property is ''given'' to the object via its relation with another object. (See the [[etymology]] of the word on [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attribute Wiktionary].) For example, [[mass]] is a physical intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas [[weight]] is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the [[respect]]ive object is placed. other examples are the ''name'' of a person (an attribute given by the person's parents) and the weight or mass of the person.

==Relations==
A relation is often considered{{by whom|date=March 2011}} to be a more general case of a property. Relations are true of several particulars, or shared amongst them. Thus the relation ".. is taller than .." holds "between" two individuals, who would occupy the two ellipses ('..'). Relations can be expressed by N-place predicates, where N is greater than 1.

It is widely accepted{{by whom|date=March 2011}} that there are at least some apparent relational properties which are merely derived from non-relational (or 1-place) properties. For instance "A is heavier than B" is a relational ''predicate'', but it is derived from the two non relational properties: the mass of A and the mass of B. Such relations are called external relations, as opposed to the more genuine internal relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hume.ucdavis.edu/mattey/phi156/moore.pdf [[G. E. Moore|George Moore]], ''External and Internal Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe that all relations are external, leading to a scepticism about relations in general, on the basis that external relations have no fundamental existence.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

{{refimprove|article|date=January 2018}}
'''Property dualism''' describes a category of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]] which hold that, although the world is composed of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]]—[[Materialism|the physical kind]]—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in or [[Supervenience|supervene]] upon certain physical substances (namely [[Human Brain|brains]]). 

[[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Substance dualism]], on the other hand, is the view that there exist in the universe two fundamentally different kinds of substance: physical ([[matter]]) and non-physical ([[mind]] or [[consciousness]]), and subsequently also two kinds of properties which adhere in those respective substances. Substance dualism thus has a much harder time with the [[mind-body problem]]. Both substance and property dualism are opposed to [[reductive physicalism]].

==Emergent materialism==
{{main|Emergent materialism}}

[[Emergentism]] is the idea that increasingly complex structures in the world give rise to the "emergence" of new properties that are something over and above (i.e. cannot be reduced to) their more basic constituents. The concept of [[emergence]] dates back to the late 19th century. [[John Stuart Mill]] notably argued for an emergentist conception of science in his 1843 ''System of Logic''.

Applied to the mind/body relation, [[emergent materialism]] is another way of describing the non-reductive physicalist conception of the mind that asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e., organized in the way that living human bodies are organized), [[mental properties]] emerge.

==Non-reductive physicalism==
{{Main|Physicalism#Non-reductive_physicalism|l1=Non-reductive physicalism}}

Non-reductive physicalism is the predominant contemporary form of property dualism according to which mental properties are mapped to [[neurobiological]] properties, but are not [[reduction (philosophy)|reducible]] to them. Non-reductive physicalism asserts that mind is not ontologically reducible to matter, in that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between the properties of mind and matter. It asserts that while mental states are physical in that they are caused by physical states, they are not ontologically reducible to physical states. No mental state is the same one thing as some physical state, nor is any mental state composed merely from physical states and phenomena. 

===Anomalous monism===
{{main|Anomalous monism}}

Most contemporary non-reductive physicalists subscribe to a position called [[anomalous monism]] (or something very similar to it). Unlike epiphenomenalism, which renders mental properties causally redundant, anomalous monists believe that mental properties make a causal difference to the world. The position was originally put forward by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] in his 1970 paper ''Mental Events'', which stakes an identity claim between mental and physical tokens based on the notion of supervenience.

=== Biological naturalism===
{{main|Biological naturalism}}
[[File:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|right|Biological Naturalism states that [[consciousness]] is a higher level function of the [[human brain]]'s physical capabilities.]]
Another argument for non-reductive physicalism has been expressed by [[John Searle]], who is the advocate of a distinctive form of physicalism he calls biological naturalism. His view is that although mental states are not [[ontology|ontologically]] reducible to physical states, they are causally reducible (see [[causality]]). He believes the mental will ultimately be explained through neuroscience. This worldview does not necessarily fall under ''property dualism'', and therefore does not necessarily make him a "property dualist". He has acknowledged that "to many people" his views and those of property dualists look a lot alike. But he thinks the comparison is misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John (1983) "Why I Am Not a Property Dualist", {{cite web |url=http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/132/PropertydualismFNL.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210160023/http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/132/PropertydualismFNL.doc |archivedate=2006-12-10 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epiphenomenalism ==
{{main|Epiphenomenalism}}

[[Epiphenomenalism]] is a doctrine about mental-physical causal relations which holds that one or more mental states and their properties are the by-products (or [[epiphenomena]]) of the states of a closed physical system, and are not causally reducible to physical states (do not have any influence on physical states). According to this view mental properties are as such real constituents of the world, but they are causally impotent; while physical causes give rise to mental properties like [[wikt:sensation|sensation]]s, [[volition (psychology)|volition]], [[idea]]s, etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further - they are causal dead ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harnvb|Churchland|1984|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Turner - Rain, Steam and Speed - National Gallery file.jpg|thumb|Huxley explained mental properties as like the steam on a locomotive]]
The position is credited to English biologist [[Thomas Huxley]] (Huxley 1874), who analogised mental properties to the whistle on a steam locomotive. The position found favour amongst scientific [[behaviourists]] over the next few decades, until [[behaviourism]] itself fell to the [[cognitive revolution]] in the 1960s. Recently, epiphenomenalism has gained popularity with those struggling to reconcile non-reductive physicalism and [[mental causation]].
===Epiphenomenal qualia===
In the paper ''Epiphenomenal Qualia'' and later ''What Mary Didn't Know'' [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] made the so-called [[knowledge argument]] against physicalism. The [[thought experiment]] was originally proposed by Frank Jackson as follows:

{{Quotation|Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the [[neurophysiology]] of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like 'red', 'blue', and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the [[central nervous system]] the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence 'The sky is blue'. [...] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a [[color television]] monitor? Will she learn anything or not?&lt;ref name="p130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson|1982|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Panpsychist property dualism==
{{Main|Panpsychism}}

Panpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since
it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules &amp;mdash; as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [[complexity|complex]] structure in a compound object. So long as the ''reduction'' of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not strictly a form of property dualism; otherwise it is. 
===Thomas Nagel===
[[Thomas Nagel]] posed the question [[What is it like to be a bat?]] [[Daniel Dennett]], a critic of Nagel's argument, nevertheless called this paper "the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness."&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=[[Consciousness Explained]]|date=1991|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|441}}

{{Quotation|If physicalism is to be defended, the phenomenological features must themselves be given a physical account. But when we examine their subjective character it seems that such a result is impossible. The reason is that every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view.}}

===David Chalmers===
In more recent work, [[David Chalmers]] has revisited his formerly negative views concerning [[Quantum mind|quantum-theories of consciousness]], and expressed sympathy towards the idea that consciousness be identified with the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]].

===Saul Kripke===
Kripke has a well-known argument for some kind of property dualism. Using the concept of [[rigid designator]]s, he states that if dualism is logically possible, then it is the case.
{{Quotation|Let 'Descartes' be a name, or rigid designator, of a certain person, and let 'B' be a rigid designator of his body. Then if Descartes were indeed identical to B, the supposed identity, being an identity between two rigid designators, would be necessary.}}

== History ==
The "Rats Dungeon", or "Dungeon of the Rats", was a feature of the [[Tower of London]] alleged by [[Roman Catholic]] writers from the [[Elizabethan era]]. "A cell below high-water mark and totally dark" would draw in rats from the [[River Thames]] as the tide flowed in. Prisoners would have their "alarm excited", and in some instances have "flesh ... torn from the arms and legs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Dutch Revolt]], [[Diederik Sonoy]], an ally of [[William the Silent]], is documented to have used a method where a [[pottery]] bowl filled with rats was placed open side down on the naked body of a prisoner. When hot [[charcoal]] was piled on the bowl, the rats would "gnaw into the very bowels of the victim" in an attempt to escape the heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Rat torture appears in the famous case study of a patient of [[Sigmund Freud]]. The [[Rat Man]] obsessed that his father and lady friend would be subjected to this torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=More about Rats and Rat People|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|volume=52|pages=277–288|author=Leonard Shengold|year=1971|pmid=5106163|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rat torture was allegedly used in [[Brazil]] during the [[Brazilian military government|military regime]] of 1964-1985,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} in [[Chile]] during the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|regime of Augusto Pinochet]] (1973–1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Elizabeth|title=Torture Under Pinochet's Regime|year=2009|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Argentina]] during the period of the [[National Reorganization Process]] (1976–1983).&lt;ref name="CONADEP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nunca Más (Never Again); Report of CONADEP|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons|CONADEP]] in Argentina detailed the use of a torture method known as "the recto-scope" (reserved primarily for Jewish prisoners) which consisted of inserting living rats into a victim's [[rectum]] or [[vagina]] through a tube.&lt;ref name="CONADEP"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] documented the case of a woman tortured by the Chilean CNI (National Intelligence Agency) in 1981, who described being kept in a room full of live rats during interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Chile: Evidence of torture: an Amnesty International Report. London (Amnesty International Publications) 1983, pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2010, in [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey]], [[David Wax]] was alleged to have threatened kidnap victim Yisrael Bryskman with rat torture unless he agreed to give his wife a [[get (divorce document)|get]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaer, Matthew (September 2, 2014) [https://www.gq.com/story/epstein-orthodox-hit-squad "Epstein Orthodox Hit Squad"], ''GQ''&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for assisting in a kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;(January 13, 2016) [http://www.timesofisrael.com/nj-couple-sentenced-for-helping-jewish-divorce-ring/ "NJ Couple Sentenced For Helping Jewish Divorce Ring"], ''The Times of Israel''&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
[[File:Bizarre Museum 04.jpg|thumb|An erotic comic by [[Eric Stanton]] depicting rat torture]]
Rats are featured in the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] story ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]''. The narrator lies on [[the rack]], and can only watch as a [[scythe]] swings back and forth, approaching closer each time, as rats swarm over his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-521-79727-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator later manages to make the rats eat through the straps.

An account similar to the Sonoy torture appears in the 1899 [[Octave Mirbeau]] novel ''[[The Torture Garden (novel)|The Torture Garden]]'', and psychologist Leonard Shengold has identified this as the possible source of the story that the Rat Man told Freud. Part of the book, an imaginary dialog between a torturer and a beautiful woman who is sexually excited by the accounts, is set in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The threat of rat torture occurs in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2027067|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=85| issue =  3|author=Christopher Boorse, Roy A.

The ministry imprisons him in [[Room 101]]. Here Winston must face his greatest fear: rats. A cage filled with hungry rats is placed over his head, their only source of food or escape being by eating their way through Winston's face. At this point Winston breaks and begs that the method actually be used on his lover Julia, a sign that he has finally been broken.

A '''recycling bin''' (or '''recycle bin''') is a container used to hold recyclables before they are taken to [[Materials recovery facility|recycling center]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECYCLER|url=http://ecycler.com/recycle-bin|work=sustainability|accessdate=23 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815113155/http://ecycler.com/recycle-bin|archivedate=15 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling bins exist in various sizes for use inside and outside [[home]]s, [[office]]s, and large public facilities. Separate containers are often provided for [[paper]], [[tin]] or [[aluminum]] [[Tin can|cans]], and [[glass]] or [[plastic bottle]]s, or may be commingled.

Many recycling bins are designed to be easily recognizable, and are marked with slogans promoting recycling on a blue or green background along with the universal [[recycling]] symbol. Others are intentionally unobtrusive. Bins are sometimes in different colors so that user may differentiate between the types of materials to be placed in them. While there is no universal standard, the color blue is commonly used to indicate a bin is for recycling in public settings.

Recycling bins or cans, or carts are a common element of municipal [[kerbside collection]] programs, which frequently distribute the bins to encourage participation.

More formally, the rule of sum is a fact about [[set theory]].  It states that sum of the sizes of a finite collection of pairwise [[disjoint sets]] is the size of the union of these sets.  That is, if &lt;math&gt;S_{1}, S_{2},..., S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint sets, then we have:

:&lt;math&gt;|S_{1}|+|S_{2}|+\cdots+|S_{n}| = |S_{1} \cup S_{2} \cup \cdots \cup S_{n}| &lt;/math&gt;

== Simple example ==

A woman has decided to shop at one store today, either in the north part of town or the south part of town. If she visits the north part of town, she will shop at either a mall, a furniture store, or a jewelry store (3 ways). If she visits the south part of town then she will shop at either a clothing store or a shoe store (2 ways).

Thus there are 3+2=5 possible shops the woman could end up shopping at today.

== Inclusion–exclusion principle ==

{{main|Inclusion–exclusion principle}}

The inclusion–exclusion principle can be thought of as a generalization of the rule of sum in that it too enumerates the number of elements in the union of some sets (but does not require the sets to be disjoint). It states that if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are finite sets, then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\biggl|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr| &amp; {} =\sum_{i=1}^n\left|A_i\right|
-\sum_{i,j\,:\,1 \le i &lt; j \le n}\left|A_i\cap A_j\right| \\
&amp; {}\qquad +\sum_{i,j,k\,:\,1 \le i &lt; j &lt; k \le n}\left|A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k\right|-\ \cdots\ + \left(-1\right)^{n-1} \left|A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n\right|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Sectarian violence''' and/or '''sectarian strife''' is a form of [[communal violence]] inspired by [[sectarianism]], that is, between different [[sect]]s of one particular mode of ideology or religion within a nation/community. [[Religious segregation]] often plays a role in sectarian violence.

== Concept ==
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute:
{{Quote|Traditionally, sectarian violence implies a symmetrical confrontation between two or more non-state actors representing different population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=SIPRI Yearbook 2008: Armaments, Disarmament, and International Security |publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sectarian violence differs from the concept of [[List of ethnic riots|race riot]]. It may involve the dynamics of [[social polarization]], the [[balkanization]] of a geographic area along the lines of self-identifying groups, and [[protracted social conflict]].

Some of the possible enabling environments for sectarian violence include power struggles, political climate, social climate, cultural climate, and economic landscape.
*[[Economy|Economic conflict]]: [[capitalism|capitalist]] versus [[collectivism|collectivist]]
*[[Politics|Political conflict]]: [[Communism|communist]] versus [[Nationalism|nationalist]]
*Interreligious conflict: [[Christians]] and/or [[Catholics]] versus [[Jews]]&lt;br&gt;[[Muslim]] versus [[Christian]]&lt;br&gt;[[Muslim]] versus [[Buddhist]] 
*[[Christianity|Christian conflict]]: [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] versus [[Protestantism|Protestant]]
*[[Islam|Islamic conflict]]: [[Shia Islam|Shia]] versus [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]

{{see also|Fourth Crusade}}
Although the First Crusade was initially launched in response to an appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos for help in repelling the invading [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]] from [[Anatolia]], one of the lasting legacies of the Crusades was to "further separate the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity from each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The genealogy of violence: reflections on creation, freedom, and evil |first=Charles K.|last=Bellinger |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2001 |page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjBW2JsNPPcC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Crusades+Christianity+Orthodox+violence#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Hussite Wars}}
[[File:Schlacht am Weißen Berg C-K 063.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] in [[Bohemia]] (1620)—one of the decisive battles of the [[Thirty Years War]]]]
Following the onset of the [[Protestant Reformation]], a series of wars were waged in Europe starting [[circa]] 1524 and continuing intermittently until 1648. Although sometimes unconnected, all of these wars were strongly influenced by the religious change of the period, and the conflict and rivalry that it produced. According to [[Miroslav Volf]], the [[European wars of religion]] were a major factor behind the "emergence of secularizing modernity".

In the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] followers of the Roman Catholic Church killed up to 30,000 [[Huguenot]]s (French Protestants) in mob violence. The massacres were carried out on the national day celebrating [[Bartholomew the Apostle]]. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] sent the leader of the massacres a [[Golden Rose]], and said that the massacres "gave him more pleasure than fifty [[Battle of Lepanto|Battles of Lepanto]], and he commissioned [[Giorgio Vasari]] to paint frescoes of it in the Vatican".&lt;ref name="gilmour"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terrorism review|author1=Ian Gilmour |author2=Andrew Gilmour |journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=17|issue=2|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|page=136|doi=10.1525/jps.1988.17.3.00p0024k}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings have been called "the worst of the century's religious massacres",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=H.G. Koenigsberger|author2=George L. Mosse|author3=G.Q. Bowler|title=Europe in the Sixteenth Century, Second Edition|publisher=Longman|year=1989|isbn=0-582-49390-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the start of the ''fourth war'' of the [[French Wars of Religion]].

===Northern Ireland===
{{Further|The Troubles|Politics of Northern Ireland}}
Since the 16th century there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. This religious sectarianism is connected to a degree with nationalism. [[Northern Ireland]] has seen inter-communal conflict for more than four centuries and there are records of religious ministers or clerics, the agents for [[absentee landlord]]s, aspiring politicians, and members of the [[landed gentry]] stirring up and capitalizing on sectarian hatred and violence back as far as the late 18th century.

[[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|William E.H. Lecky]], an Irish historian, wrote in 1892 that, "If the characteristic mark of a healthy Christianity be to unite its members by a bond of fraternity and love, then there is no country where Christianity has more completely failed than Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Edward Hartpole Lecky|title=A History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Bruce, a sociologist, wrote;{{Quote|The Northern Ireland conflict is a religious conflict. Economic and social considerations are also crucial, but it was the fact that the competing populations in Ireland adhered and still adhere to competing religious traditions which has given the conflict its enduring and intractable quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Bruce|title=God Save Ulster|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986|page=249|isbn=0-19-285217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|249}} Reviewers agreed "Of course the Northern Ireland conflict is at heart religious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The English Historical Review|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=104|issue=413|date=October 1989|title=God Save Ulster: The Religion and Politics of Paisleyism by Steve Bruce (review)|author=David Harkness}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Hickey wrote;{{Quote|Politics in the North is not politics exploiting religion. That is far too simple an explanation: it is one which trips readily off the tongue of commentators who are used to a cultural style in which the politically pragmatic is the normal way of conducting affairs and all other considerations are put to its use. In the case of Northern Ireland the relationship is much more complex. It is more a question of religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion. It is a situation more akin to the first half of seventeenth century England than to the last quarter of twentieth‑century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hickey|title=Religion and the Northern Ireland Problem|publisher=Gill and Macmillan|year=1984|page=67|isbn=0-7171-1115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The period from 1969-98 is known as "[[The Troubles]]", a period of frequent violence and tense relations between Northern Ireland's communities. About one in eight females and one in five males in Northern Ireland identified themselves as belonging to no religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Background/RELIGION.html ''NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015'' results on religion], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, people of no religion and non-Christian faiths are still considered {{bywhom|date=September 2016}} as belonging to one of the two "sects" along with churchgoers. People of no religion are less likely to support the main, constitution-oriented main political parties, or more likely to support a more neutral political party such as the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=NILT1&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/POLPART2.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on political party support], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

About two thirds of people with no religion tend to think of themselves as neither [[British unionism|unionist]] or [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]], although a much higher percentage of those with no religion tend to think of themselves as unionist than nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/UNINATID.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on political identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

For people who describe themselves as Protestant or Roman Catholic, a small majority of them appear to favour one of the two main political parties on either side: the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] or the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] for Protestants; and [[Sinn Féin]] or the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] for Roman Catholics. In each case, the percentage in the ''Northern Irish Life &amp; Times Survey'' in 2015 was 57%.&lt;ref name=NILT1/&gt; Roman Catholics are more likely to reject the label British (59%) than Protestants are to reject the label Irish (48%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/IRBRIT.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Protestants are more likely to consider the British identity as the 'best' single way to describe themselves, at 67%, with Roman Catholics close behind at 63% who consider the best single way to describe themselves as Irish. There is an equal level of support for the more neutral Northern Irish identity, with 25% of people from each religion likely to choose that label as the best description. Over a third of people with no religion prefer to be described as Northern Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Community_Relations/NINATID.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on best identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are organizations dedicated to the reduction of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. The [[Corrymeela Community]] (in [[Ballycastle, County Antrim]]), operates a retreat centre on the northern coast of Northern Ireland to bring Catholics and Protestants together to discuss their differences and similarities. The [[Ulster Project]] works with teenagers from Northern Ireland and the United States to provide safe, [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational]] environments to discuss sectarianism in Northern Ireland. These organizations are attempting to bridge the gap of historical prejudice between the two religious communities.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Although [[Education in Northern Ireland|state schools]] in Northern Ireland are non-denominational, most Catholic parents still send their children to specifically Catholic schools or Irish-language medium schools, thus ensuring that state school students are almost wholly Protestant. There are some integrated schools and the [[Society of Friends]] (Quakers) have long been an advocate of co-education in terms of religion, operating the [[Friends' School, Lisburn|Friends' School]] in Lisburn (first established in 1774).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Yugoslav wars===
{{main|Yugoslav Wars}}
Howard Goeringer criticizes both the "Catholic Pope and the Orthodox Patriarch" for failing to condemn the "deliberate massacre of men, women and children in the name of 'ethnic cleansing' as incompatible with Jesus' life and teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haunts of Violence in the Church|first=Howard|last=Goeringer|year=2005|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rwandan genocide===
{{Main|Rwandan Genocide}}
{{Further|Religion in Rwanda}}

The [[Demographics of Rwanda|majority of Rwandans]], and [[Tutsi]]s in particular, are Catholic, so shared religion did not prevent genocide. Miroslav Volf cites a Roman Catholic bishop from Rwanda as saying, "The best cathechists, those who filled our churches on Sundays, were the first to go with machetes in their hands".&lt;ref name=SocialMeaning&gt;{{cite journal |first=Miroslav |last=Volf |title=The Social Meaning of Reconciliation |journal=Transformation: An International Journal of Holistic Mission Studies |date = January 1999|volume=16|number=1 |pages=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Linden asserts that "there is absolutely no doubt that significant numbers of prominent Christians were involved in sometimes slaughtering their own church leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Linden, I. (1997). The Church and Genocide. Lessons from the Rwandan Tragedy. In G. Baum (Ed.), The Reconciliation of Peoples. Challenge to the Churches (pp. 43–55). Geneva: WCC Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Volf, "what is particularly disturbing about the complicity of the church is that Rwanda is without doubt one of Africa’s most evangelized nations. Eight out of ten of its people claimed to be Christians."&lt;ref name=SocialMeaning /&gt;

When the Roman Catholic [[Missionary|missionaries]] came to Rwanda in the late 1880s, they contributed to the "[[Hamitic]]" [[Scientific racism|theory of race origins]], which taught that the Tutsi were a superior race. The Church has been considered to have played a significant role in fomenting racial divisions between [[Hutu]] and Tutsi, in part because they found more willing converts among the majority Hutu.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Genocide'', Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs, p. 380, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-34644-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) report on the genocide states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the colonial era, under German and then Belgian rule, Roman Catholic missionaries, inspired by the overtly racist theories of 19th century Europe, concocted a destructive ideology of ethnic cleavage and racial ranking that attributed superior qualities to the country's Tutsi minority, since the missionaries ran the colonial-era schools, these pernicious values were systematically transmitted to several generations of Rwandans…&lt;ref name=OAU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/OCHA-64DEEY?OpenDocument|title=Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide|publisher=Organization of African Unity|date=7 July 2000|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church argues that those who took part in the genocide did so without the sanction of the Church.&lt;ref name="wf"/&gt; Although the genocide was ethnically motivated and religious factors were not prominent, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that a number of religious authorities in Rwanda, particularly Roman Catholic, failed to condemn the genocide publicly at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno4-7-03.htm#P893_245534|title=Rwandan Genocide: The Clergy|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Christian leaders have been convicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] for their roles in the genocide.&lt;ref name="wf"&gt;''Dictionary of Genocide"'', Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs, p. 380, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-34644-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Rwandan Roman Catholic priests and nuns as well as a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] pastor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/791907.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Rwandan bishop cleared of genocide|date=15 June 2000|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
{{See also|Sectarianism in Glasgow}}
Scotland, which is very close to Northern Ireland, suffers from a spill-over of sectarianism, largely owing to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland as many people, particularly in the West of Scotland, have links to Northern Ireland by genealogy or immigration. 

Scotland's two largest and best supported football clubs -- [[Rangers F.C.|Glasgow Rangers]], which, for many generations, has largely been identified with Protestants and unionism, and [[Celtic F.C.|Glasgow Celtic]], which, since its founding in the late 19th century, has been identified with Roman Catholics and Irish nationalism or republicanism -- both subscribe, with varying degrees of success, to government initiatives and charities like the [[Nil by Mouth (charity)|Nil by Mouth]] campaign are working in this area.

Celtic previously sent letters to every season ticket holder reminding supporters that no form of sectarianism is welcome at [[Celtic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eticketing.co.uk/celtic/staticpages/termsandconditions.aspx|title=Celtic F.C.'s Terms &amp; Conditions of sale - eTickets|author=|date=|website=www.eticketing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers' anti-sectarian policy is called ''Follow With Pride''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hymns of hatred at Ibrox Park|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/08/hymnsofhatredatibroxpark|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2010|date=8 August 2007|location=London, UK|first=Mike|last=Small}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among Muslims==
{{main|Sectarian violence among Muslims}}
Sectarian violence between the two major sects of Islam, Shia and Sunni, has occurred in countries like Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Lebanon etc. This violent conflict has roots in the political turmoil arising out of differences over the [[succession to Muhammad]]. [[Abu Bakr]], a [[Sahabah|companion of Muhammad]], was nominated by [[Umar]] and elected as the first Sunni [[Rashidun|Rightly Guided Caliph]]. However another group felt that [[Ali]], the cousin and son-in-law of [[Muhammad]], had been designated by Muhammad and is considered by Shia as the first [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]].

According to Sunnis, Abu Bakr was followed by Umar as [[caliph]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], then by [[Uthman ibn Affan]] and finally by Ali. Ali's right to rule was challenged by [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah bin Abu Sufian]], governor of Syria, who believed{{fact|date=October 2016}} that Ali should have acted faster against the murderers of Uthman. The situation deteriorated further when many of those responsible for the death of Uthman rallied behind Ali. However, later on, both the parties agreed to have some one as a judge between them. This led to the separation of an extremist group known as [[Kharijites]] from Ali's army, which pronounced the judgement belonged to [[God in Islam|God]] alone. A member of this group later assassinated Ali. By breaching, [[Hasan-Muawiyah Treaty]], Muawiyah appointed his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]] as his successor. The credentials and rule of Yazid were challenged by Ali's son [[Hussein ibn Ali]] (and grandson of Muhammad). A [[Battle of Karbala|battle at Karbala]] in Iraq led to the martyrdom of Hussein and dozens of others from ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'' (the members of the family of Muhammad).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

This tragic incident created deep fissures in the Muslim society. The conflict that had started at a political plane intervened with the dogma and belief systems.{{fact|date=October 2016}} Those who consider Ali to be the true heir to the [[Muhammad]] are known as "Shia" referring to Shian-e-Ali. The other Muslims are known as "Sunni" meaning "followers of the Traditions of The Prophet".{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===In Iraq===
{{main|Civil war in Iraq (2006–07)|Sectarian violence in Iraq}}
In February 2006, more than 100 people were killed across Iraq, when violence between the two Muslim rival sects erupted. It has left over a hundred people dead and dozens of mosques and homes destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/23/AR2006022300216.html|work=The Washington Post|first1=Jonathan|last1=Finer|first2=Bassam|last2=Sebti|title=Sectarian Violence Kills Over 100 in Iraq|date=24 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Pakistan===
{{main|Sectarian violence in Pakistan}}
In Pakistan sectarianism exhibited its first organized nature in early 1980 when two rival organizations were established: [[Tehrik-e-Jafaria]] (TFJ) (Organization of the Jafri (Shia) Law) represented Shia communities, and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]] (SSP) (Guardian of the Companions of the Prophet) representing Sunnis. The first major incident of this sectarian violence was killing of the [[Arif Hussain Hussaini]], founding leader of TFJ in 1986. 

In retaliation [[Haq Nawaz Jhangvi]], founder of the (SSP) was murdered. Since then internecine bloody vendetta has ensued. The focus of this violence has been [[Kurram Valley|Kurram]], [[Hangu District, Pakistan|Hangu]], [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Bahawalpur District|Bahawalpur]], [[Jhang District|Jhang]], [[Quetta District|Quetta]],Gigit- Baltistan and [[Karachi]].

The transformation of the sectarian conflict to a violent civil war in Pakistan coincided{{fact|date=October 2016}} with the establishment of the [[Islamic republic]] in Iran and promotion of the Sunni religion and its incorporation in the state institutions by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], regime in Pakistan.

The [[Iranian Revolution]] was led by Shia clerics, and it influenced Shia communities all over the world. In Pakistan Tehrik-e-Jafaria was established with the demands of enforcing the Sharia Law. {{fact|date=October 2016}} This demand was viewed as detrimental by the Sunni religious leaders. In response SSP was established by the Sunni extremist clerics. Many of these clerics had a background in the sectarian strife against the Ahmadis (a heterodox sect considered non-Muslim by majority of the Orthodox Schools)

===In Somalia===
[[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] is a [[Somali people|Somali]] paramilitary group consisting of [[Sufism|Sufis]] and moderates opposed to the radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]]. They are fighting in order to prevent [[Wahhabi]]sm from being imposed on Somalia and to protect the country's Sunni-Sufi traditions and generally moderate religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8077725.stm |work=BBC News | title=Somali rage at grave desecration | date=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Syria===
{{main|Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian Civil War}}
The [[Syrian civil war]] gradually shifted towards a more sectarian nature. Pro-Assad militant groups are largely{{fact|date=October 2016}} Shia, while anti-Assad militant groups are non-secular, fundamentalist Sunni.

'''Self-destructive behavior''' is any behavior that is harmful or potentially harmful towards the person who engages in the behavior. 

Self-destructive behaviors exist on a continuum, with [[suicide]] at one extreme end of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Aaron T.; Kovacs, Maria; Weissman, Arlene. Assessment of suicidal intention: The Scale for Suicide Ideation. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, Vol 47(2), Apr 1979, 343–352. https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.47.2.343&lt;/ref&gt; Self-destructive actions may be deliberate, born of impulse, or developed as a [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. The term however tends to be applied toward self-destruction that either is [[Death|fatal]], or is potentially habit-forming or [[Behavioral addiction|addictive]] and thus potentially fatal. Self-destructive behavior is often associated with mental illnesses such as [[borderline personality disorder]]&lt;ref&gt;Anthony W. Bateman, Roy Krawitz (2013).

Acts of "self-destruction" may be merely metaphorical ("[[social suicide]]") or literal ([[suicide]]). &lt;!--It can take a variety of forms, and be undertaken for a variety of reasons. It is most visible in young adults and adolescents, but it may affect people of any age.--&gt; 

==Types of self-destructive behavior==
* [[Suicide]]
* [[Self-harm]]
* [[Eating disorder]]s{{mcn|date=March 2014}}
* [[Substance abuse]]

==Forms==
{{unreferenced section|small=y|date=August 2018}}
Self-destructive behavior may be used as a [[coping mechanism]] when one is overwhelmed. For example, faced with a pressing scholastic assessment, someone may choose to sabotage their work rather than cope with the stress. This would make submission of (or passing) the assessment impossible, but remove the worry associated with it.

Self-destructive behavior may also manifest itself in an active attempt to drive away other people. For example, they may fear that they will "mess up" a relationship. Rather than deal with this fear, socially self-destructive individuals engage in annoying or alienating behavior, so that others will reject them first.

More obvious forms of self-destruction are [[eating disorder]]s, [[alcohol abuse]], [[drug addiction]]s, [[sex addiction]], [[self-injury]], and [[suicide attempt]]s.

An important aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of [[self-confidence]] – for example in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible ("there is no way I can complete all my work on time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting [[personal boundaries]]. As a result, they tend to feel that showing they are incompetent is the only way to untangle themselves from demands.

Successful individuals may self-destructively sabotage their own achievements; this may stem from a feeling of anxiety, unworthiness, or from an impulsive desire to repeat the "climb to the top."

Self-destructive behavior is often considered to be synonymous with self-harm, but this is not accurate. Self-harm is an extreme form of self-destructive behavior, but it may appear in many other guises.

==Causes==

'''Sensory processing disorder''' ('''SPD'''; also known as [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|'''sensory integration dysfunction''')]] describes a condition in which [[multisensory integration]] is not adequately processed in order to provide appropriate responses to the demands of the environment.

[[Sensory integration]] was defined by occupational therapist [[Anna Jean Ayres]] in 1972 as "the neurological process that organizes sensation from one's own body and from the environment and makes it possible to use the body effectively within the environment".&lt;ref name="Ayres 1972"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayres, A.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms may vary according to the disorder's type and subtype present. SPD can affect one sense or multiple senses. While many people can present one or two symptoms, sensory processing disorder has to have a clear functional impact on the person's life:

''Signs of over-responsivity'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hulle|first=Carol Van|last2=Lemery-Chalfant|first2=Kathryn|last3=Goldsmith|first3=H.

''Signs of under-responsivity'', including sluggishness and lack of responsiveness; and 
''Sensory cravings,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Sarika U.|last2=Horowitz|first2=Lucia|last3=Barbieri-Welge|first3=Rene|last4=Taylor|first4=Julie Lounds|last5=Hundley|first5=Rachel J.|date=2012-02-01|title=Longitudinal follow-up of autism spectrum features and sensory behaviors in Angelman syndrome by deletion class|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02455.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=152–159|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02455.x|issn=1469-7610}}&lt;/ref&gt; including, for example, fidgeting, impulsiveness, and/or seeking or making loud, disturbing noises; ''Sensorimotor-based problems'', including slow and uncoordinated movements or poor handwriting.

''Sensory discrimination problems'', that might manifest themselves in behaviors such as things constantly dropped.

Critics have noted that what proponents claim are symptoms of SPD are both broad and, in some cases, represent very common, and not necessarily abnormal or atypical, childhood characteristics.  The checklist of symptoms on the website of the [https://www.spdstar.org/ SPD Foundation], for example, includes such warning signs as “My infant/toddler has problems eating,” “My child has difficulty being toilet trained,” “My child is in constant motion,” and “My child gets in everyone else's space and/or touches everything around him.” -- "symptoms" which read much like the day-to-day complaints of an average parent.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=Brian |title=Get Ready for the Next Big Medical Fight Is sensory processing disorder a real disease? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/02/sensory_processing_disorder_the_debate_over_whether_spd_is_a_real_disease.html |website=Slate |publisher=Slate |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where I get concerned is labeling that as a separate disorder.”&lt;ref name="Child Mind" /&gt;

Two studies have provided preliminary evidence suggesting that there may be measurable neurological differences between children diagnosed with SPD and control children classified as neurotypical &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Julia|last2=Marco|first2=Elysa|last3=Desai|first3=Shivani|last4=Fourie|first4=Emily|last5=Harris|first5=Julia|last6=Hill|first6=Susanna|last7=Arnett|first7=Anne|last8=Mukherjee|first8=Pratik|title=Abnormal white matter microstructure in children with sensory processing disorders|journal=NeuroImage: Clinical|date=June 17, 2013|volume=2|pages=844–853|doi=10.1016/j.nicl.2013.06.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000776|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or children diagnosed with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Yi-Shin|last2=Owen|first2=Julia|last3=Desai|first3=Shivani|last4=Hill|first4=Susanna|last5=Arnett|first5=Anne|last6=Harris|first6=Julia|last7=Marco|first7=Elysa|last8=Mukherjee|first8=Pratik|title=Autism and Sensory Processing Disorders: Shared White Matter Disruption in Sensory Pathways but Divergent Connectivity in Social-Emotional Pathways|journal=PLOS ONE|date=July 2014|volume=9|issue=7|pages=1–17|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0103038|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103038|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this evidence, the fact that SPD researchers have yet to agree on a proven, standardized diagnostic tool undermines researchers’ ability to define the boundaries of the disease and makes correlational studies, like the ones about structural brain abnormalities, less convincing.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt;

== Causes ==
The exact cause of SPD is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sensory Processing Disorder |url=https://health.howstuffworks.com/pregnancy-and-parenting/childhood-conditions/sensory-processing-disorder1.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |publisher=InfoSpace Holdings LLC |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is known that the mid-brain and brain stem regions of the central nervous system are early centers in the processing pathway for multisensory integration; these brain regions are involved in processes including coordination, attention, arousal, and autonomic function.&lt;ref name="Stein 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Barry E. Stein|Stein BE]], Stanford TR, Rowland BA |title=The neural basis of multisensory integration in the midbrain: its organization and maturation |journal=Hear.

Damage in any part of the brain involved in multisensory processing can cause difficulties in adequately processing stimuli in a functional way.

=== Research ===
Current research in sensory processing is focused on finding the genetic and neurological causes of SPD.  [[EEG]]&lt;ref name="Davies 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies PL, Gavin WJ |title=Validating the diagnosis of sensory processing disorders using EEG technology |journal=Am J Occup Ther |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=176–89 |year=2007 |pmid=17436840 |doi=10.5014/ajot.61.2.176  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and measuring [[event-related potential]] (ERP) are traditionally used to explore the causes behind the behaviors observed in SPD. Some of the proposed underlying causes by current research are:

* Differences in tactile and auditory over responsivity show moderate genetic influences, with tactile over responsivity demonstrating greater heritability.

* Studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) in children with the sensory over responsivity subtype found atypical neural integration of sensory input. Different neural generators could be activated at an earlier stage of sensory information processing in people with SOR than in typically developing individuals. The automatic association of causally related sensory inputs that occurs at this early sensory-perceptual stage may not function properly in children with SOR. One hypothesis is that multisensory stimulation may activate a higher-level system in frontal cortex that involves attention and cognitive processing, rather than the automatic integration of multisensory stimuli observed in typically developing adults in auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Brett-Green 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brett-Green BA, Miller LJ, Schoen SA, Nielsen DM |title=An exploratory event-related potential study of multisensory integration in sensory over-responsive children |journal=Brain Res |volume=1321 |issue= |pages=393–407 |date=June 2010 |pmid= |pmc= |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2010.01.043 |url=http://spdfoundation.net/pdf/Brett-Green_et_al%20article_2010.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024223121/http://spdfoundation.net/pdf/Brett-Green_et_al%20article_2010.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Although sensory processing disorder is accepted in the [[Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood]] (DC:0-3R), it is not recognized as a [[mental disorder]] in medical manuals such as the [[ICD-10]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://priory.com/psych/ICD.htm ICD 10]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[DSM-5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spdfoundation.net/sensory-processing-blog/2012/12/05/final-decision-for-dsm-v/ | title=Final Decision for DSM-V | publisher=Sensory Processing Disorder Foundation | access-date=3 October 2013 | author=Lucy Jane Miller | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214132/http://spdfoundation.net/sensory-processing-blog/2012/12/05/final-decision-for-dsm-v/ | archivedate=4 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis is primarily arrived at by the use of standardized tests, standardized questionnaires, expert observational scales, and free play observation at an [[occupational therapy]] gym. Observation of functional activities might be carried at school and home as well.

Depending on the country, diagnosis is made by different professionals, such as [[occupational therapist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, learning specialists, [[Physical therapy|physiotherapists]] and/or [[Speech-language pathology|speech and language therapists]].&lt;ref name="Sensory Integration Network Course"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sensoryintegration.org.uk/course-information-and-booking |title=Course information and booking |work=Sensory Integration Network |access-date=23 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610111334/http://www.sensoryintegration.org.uk/course-information-and-booking |archivedate=10 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries it is recommended to have a full psychological and neurological evaluation if symptoms are too severe.

SMD consists of three subtypes: 

# Sensory over-responsivity.
# Sensory under-responsivity
# Sensory craving/seeking.

''Sensory-based motor disorder (SBMD)''
According to proponents, sensory-based motor disorder shows motor output that is disorganized as a result of incorrect processing of sensory information affecting [[Fear of falling#Postural control|postural control]] challenges, resulting in postural disorder, or [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name="Miller 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bair 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bair WN, Kiemel T, Jeka JJ, Clark JE |title=Development of multisensory reweighting is impaired for quiet stance control in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=e40932 |year=2012 |pmid=22815872 |pmc=3399799 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0040932 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SBMD subtypes are:

# Dyspraxia
# Postural disorder

''Sensory discrimination disorder (SDD)''

Sensory discrimination disorder involves the incorrect processing of sensory information.&lt;ref name="Miller 2007" /&gt;  The SDD subtypes are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3437&amp;context=honors_theses|title=An overview of sensory processing disorder|last1=Lonkar|first1=Heather|website=ScholarWorks at Western Michigan University|publisher=Western Michigan University|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tire Swing.JPG|thumb|Vestibular system is stimulated through hanging equipment such as tire swings]]
The main form of sensory integration therapy is a type of occupational therapy that places a child in a room specifically designed to stimulate and challenge all of the [[sense]]s.

During the session, the therapist works closely with the child to provide a level of sensory stimulation that the child can cope with, and encourage movement within the room. Sensory integration therapy is driven by four main principles:

* Just right challenge (the child must be able to successfully meet the challenges that are presented through playful activities)
* Adaptive response (the child adapts his behavior with new and useful strategies in response to the challenges presented)
* Active engagement (the child will want to participate because the activities are fun)
* Child directed (the child's preferences are used to initiate therapeutic experiences within the session)

''Sensory processing therapy''
This therapy retains all of the above-mentioned four principles and adds:&lt;ref name="spdfoundation jan 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spdfoundation.net/files/2714/2430/1254/Jan-Feb2013_sensorysolutions.pdf|title=The "So What?" of Sensory Integration Therapy: Joie de Vivre|format=pdf|work=Sensory Solutions|date=2013|author1-last=Miller|author1-first=Lucy Jane|author2-last=Collins|author2-first=Britt|accessdate=11 January 2016|publisher=[[Sensory Processing Disorder Foundation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081554/http://spdfoundation.net/files/2714/2430/1254/Jan-Feb2013_sensorysolutions.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Intensity (person attends therapy daily for a prolonged period of time)
* Developmental approach (therapist adapts to the developmental age of the person, against actual age)
* Test-retest systematic evaluation (all clients are evaluated before and after)
* Process driven vs. activity driven (therapist focuses on the "Just right" emotional connection and the process that reinforces the relationship)
* Parent education (parent education sessions are scheduled into the therapy process)
* "joie de vivre" (happiness of life is therapy's main goal, attained through social participation, self-regulation, and self-esteem)
* Combination of best practice interventions (is often accompanied by integrated listening system therapy, floor time, and electronic media such as Xbox Kinect, Nintendo Wii, Makoto II machine training and others)

The treatments themselves may involve a variety of activities and interventions (for example, [[Corrective lenses|prism lenses]]). Children with hypo-reactivity may be exposed to strong sensations such as stroking with a brush, vibrations or rubbing. Play may involve a range of materials to stimulate the senses such as play dough or finger painting.  Children with hyper-reactivity, on the other hand, may be exposed to peaceful activities including quiet music and gentle rocking in a softly lit room. Treats and rewards may be used to encourage children to tolerate activities they would normally avoid.  While occupational therapists using a sensory integration frame of reference work on increasing a child's ability to adequately process sensory input, other OTs may focus on environmental accommodations that parents and school staff can use to enhance the child's function at home, school, and in the community.&lt;ref name="Peske 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nancy Peske |author2=Lindsey Biel |title=Raising a sensory smart child: the definitive handbook for helping your child with sensory integration issues |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-14-303488-X |oclc=     56420392 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sensorysmarts.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sensorysmarts.com/sensory-checklist.pdf |title=Sensory Checklist |format= |work=Raising a Sensory Smart Child |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include selecting soft, tag-free clothing, avoiding fluorescent lighting, and providing ear plugs for "emergency" use (such as for fire drills).

''Evaluation of treatment effectiveness''

Some of these treatments (for example, sensorimotor handling) have a questionable rationale and no empirical evidence. Other treatments (for example, [[Corrective lenses|prism lenses]], [[Physical therapy|physical exercise]], and [[auditory integration training]]) have had studies with small positive outcomes, but few conclusions can be made about them due to methodological problems with the studies.&lt;ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

It has been estimated by proponents that up to 16.5% of elementary school aged children present elevated SOR behaviors in the tactile or auditory modalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=A.

Proponents have also claimed that adults may also show signs of sensory processing difficulties and would benefit for sensory processing therapies,&lt;ref name="Urwin 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Urwin R, Ballinger C |title= The Effectiveness of Sensory Integration Therapy to Improve Functional Behaviour in Adults with Learning Disabilities: Five Single-Case Experimental Designs |journal= Brit.

== Controversy ==
There are concerns regarding the validity of the diagnosis. SPD is not included in the [[DSM-5]] or [[ICD-10]], the most widely used diagnostic sources in healthcare. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that there is no universally accepted framework for diagnosis and recommends caution against using any "sensory" type therapies unless as a part of a comprehensive treatment plan. In fact, in a 2012 statement, the AAP states that "Because there is no universally accepted framework for diagnosis, sensory processing disorder generally should not be diagnosed." When an occupational therapist does recommend sensory integration therapy, the AAP instructs that the therapist is aware that, "parents should be informed that the amount of research regarding the effectiveness of sensory integration therapy is limited and inconclusive." As such, most health insurance considers sensory integration therapy to be "investigational" and will not cover it. In the United States and UK, sensory processing disorder is not likely to qualify an individual for disability benefits, so the supporters of sensory processing disorder recommend having a child diagnosed for a related disorder that will qualify them for disability insurance.  As was noted above, a 2015 review of research on Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) concluded that SIT is "ineffective and that its theoretical underpinnings and assessment practices are unvalidated", that SIT techniques exist "outside the bounds of established evidence-based practice", and that SIT is "quite possibly a misuse of limited resources".&lt;ref name="Fads" /&gt;

=== Manuals ===
SPD is in [[Stanley Greenspan]]'s ''Diagnostic Manual for Infancy and Early Childhood'' and as '''Regulation Disorders of Sensory Processing''' part of ''The Zero to Three's Diagnostic Classification''. but is not recognized in the manuals [[ICD-10]] or in the recently updated [[DSM-5]]. However, unusual reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects is included as a possible but not necessary criterion for the diagnosis of autism.

=== Misdiagnosis ===
Some state that sensory processing disorder is a distinct diagnosis, while others argue that differences in sensory responsiveness are features of other diagnoses and it is not a standalone diagnosis. The neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] has proposed that SPD may be a form of [[synesthesia]], a perceptual condition in which the [[Sense|senses]] are blended.Specifically, Eagleman suggests that instead of a sensory input "connecting to [a person's] color area [in the brain], it's connecting to an area involving pain or aversion or nausea".

Researchers have described a treatable inherited [[Hypokalemic sensory overstimulation|sensory overstimulation disorder]] that meets diagnostic criteria for both attention deficit disorder and sensory integration dysfunction.

=== Distinguishing SPD from Autism ===
Recent studies have helped to physiologically differentiate typically developing children from children with SPD, and from children with autism. Approximately 1% of the United States child population has been diagnosed with autism, while approximately 5-16% of children have been found to have difficulty processing sensory input. In a recent study performed by Owen et al., diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to exam white matter tracts in a group of children with sensory processing disorder compared to a group of typically developing children. Results of the study showed less white matter microstructure, particularly in the posterior cerebrum, in the children with SPD compared to the typically developing children. This finding illustrates a physiological variation in an area of the brain that involves sensory processing and integration, which may help to explain some of the challenges children with SPD have. This particular study suggested that DTI may be used in the diagnosis and differentiation of SPD and autism.

In a follow-up study pertaining to differentiation of SPD from autism, Chang et al. examined white matter tract differences in a group of children with SPD compared to a group of children with autism, and also in relation to a group of typically developing children. The results of this study showed significantly less white matter connectivity between the parietal and occipital lobes in the children with SPD and ASD compared to the typically developing children. As stated above, these connections play a large part in sensory perception and integration. However, the study only found reduced connectivity in the temporal lobe of the group of children with ASD. This area of the brain contributes to social-emotional processing. These findings reveal a significant association between white matter circuitry and cognitive progressing, particularly in the areas of auditory integration, social skills, memory, and attention. These findings may help guide treatment and provide more personalized interventions for children with SPD, ASD, and other diagnoses. However, more research needs to be done with larger groups and more attention to other neural circuitry changes. 

== Society ==
The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) supports the use of a variety of methods of sensory integration for those with sensory processing disorder. The organization has supported the need for further research to increase insurance coverage for related therapies. They have also made efforts to educate the public about sensory integration therapy. The AOTA's practice guidelines currently support the use of sensory integration therapy and interprofessional education and collaboration in order to optimize treatment for those with sensory processing disorder. The AOTA provides several resources pertaining to sensory integration therapy, some of which includes a fact sheet, new research, and continuing education opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sensory Integration|url=https://www.aota.org/practice/children-youth/si.aspx|website=The American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc.|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sensory processing disorder as a specific form of atypical functioning was first described by occupational therapist [[Anna Jean Ayres]] (1920–1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sensory integration and the child : understanding hidden sensory challenge 25th Anniversary Edition|last1=Ayres|first1=A. Jean.|last2=Robbins|first2=Jeff|publisher=WPS|year=2005|isbn=978-0-87424-437-3|location=Los Angeles, CA|oclc=63189804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Original model''

Ayres's theoretical framework for what she called Sensory Integration Dysfunction was developed after six factor analytic studies of populations of children with learning disabilities, perceptual motor disabilities and normal developing children.&lt;ref name="Bundy Lane 2002"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sensory integration, Theory and practice|last1=Bundy|first1=Anita. C.|last2=Lane|first2=J. Shelly|last3=Murray|first3=Elizabeth A.|publisher=FA Davis Company|year=2002|isbn=0-8036-0545-5|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ayres created the following [[nosology]] based on the patterns that appeared on her factor analysis: 
*Dyspraxia: poor [[motor planning]] (more related to the vestibular system and proprioception)
*Poor bilateral integration: inadequate use of both sides of the body simultaneously 
*Tactile defensiveness: negative reaction to tactile stimuli
*Visual perceptual deficits: poor form and space perception and visual motor functions
*Somatodyspraxia: poor motor planning (related to poor information coming from the tactile and proprioceptive systems)
*Auditory-language problems

Both visual perceptual and auditory language deficits were thought to possess a strong cognitive component and a weak relationship to underlying sensory processing deficits, so they are not considered central deficits in many models of sensory processing.

In 1998, Mulligan found a similar pattern of deficits in a confirmatory factor analytic study.&lt;ref name="Mulligan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulligan|first1=Shelley|date=1998|title=Patterns of Sensory Integration Dysfunction: A Confirmatory Factor Analysis|url=https://ajot.aota.org/article.aspx?articleid=1862615|journal=American Journal of Occupational Therapy|volume=52|issue=November/December|pages=819–828|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith Roley|first=Susanne|author2=Zoe Mailloux|author3=Heather Miller-Kuhaneck|author4=Tara Glennon|date=September 2007|title=Understanding Ayres Sensory Integration|url=http://www.pediatrictherapy.com/images/content/208.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=OT PRACTICE|series=17|volume=12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824070724/http://www.pediatrictherapy.com/images/content/208.pdf|archivedate=24 August 2014|accessdate=19 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Quadrant model''

Dunn's nosology uses two criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Winnie|date=April 1997|title=The Impact of Sensory Processing Abilities on the Daily Lives of Young Children and Their Families: A Conceptual Model|url=http://journals.lww.com/iycjournal/abstract/1997/04000/the_impact_of_sensory_processing_abilities_on_the.5.aspx|journal=Infants &amp; Young Children: April 1997|volume=9|issue=4|id=|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; response type (passive vs active) and [[sensory threshold]] to the stimuli (low or high) creating 4 subtypes or quadrants:&lt;ref name="Dunn 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunn W|year=2001|title=The sensations of everyday life: empirical, theoretical, and pragmatic considerations|url=|journal=Am J Occup Ther|volume=55|issue=6|pages=608–20|doi=10.5014/ajot.55.6.608|pmid=12959225}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* High neurological thresholds
  
#Low registration: high threshold with passive response.

#Sensation seeking: high threshold and active response. Those who actively seek out a rich sensory filled environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

* Low neurological threshold
#Sensitivity to stimuli: low threshold with passive response. Individuals who become distracted and uncomfortable when exposed to sensation but do not actively limit or avoid exposure to the sensation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
#Sensation avoiding: low threshold and active response. Individuals actively limit their exposure to sensations and are therefore high self regulators.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''Sensory processing model''

In Miller's nosology  "sensory integration dysfunction" was renamed into "Sensory processing disorder" to facilitate coordinated research work with other fields such as  neurology since "the use of the term sensory integration often applies to a neurophysiologic cellular process rather than a behavioral response to sensory input as connoted by Ayres."&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"/&gt;

A '''shareholder rights plan''', colloquially known as a "'''poison pill'''", is a type of defensive tactic used by a [[corporation]]'s [[board of directors]] against a [[takeover]]. Typically, such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company's shares. The plan could be triggered, for instance, if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company's shares, at which point every shareholder (except the one who possesses 20%) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount. If every other shareholder is able to buy more shares at a discount, such purchases would dilute the bidder's interest, and the cost of the bid would rise substantially. Knowing that such a plan could be activated, the bidder could be disinclined to take over the corporation without the board's approval, and would first negotiate with the board in order to revoke the plan.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of a standard rights plan, see [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]], ''The Share Purchase Rights Plan'' in Ronald J. Gilson &amp; Bernard S. Black, The Law and Finance of Corporate Acquisitions (2d ed. Supp. 1999) at 10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan can be issued by the board of directors as an "[[option (finance)|option]]" or a "[[warrant (finance)|warrant]]" attached to existing shares, and only be revoked at the discretion of the board.

In the field of [[mergers and acquisitions]], shareholder rights plans were devised in the early 1980s as a way to prevent takeover bidders from negotiating a price for sale of shares directly with shareholders, and instead forcing the bidder to negotiate with the board.

==History==
The poison pill was invented by [[mergers and acquisitions]] lawyer [[Martin Lipton]] of [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]] in 1982, as a response to tender-based [[hostile takeovers]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School, Case Study 9-496-037, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Poison pills became popular during the early 1980s in response to the wave of takeovers by [[corporate raid]]ers such as [[Carl Icahn]]. The term "poison pill" derives its original meaning from a [[suicide pill|poison pill]] physically carried by various [[Espionage|spies]] throughout history, a pill which was taken by the spies when they were discovered to eliminate the possibility of being interrogated by an enemy.

It was reported in 2001 that since 1997, for every company with a poison pill which successfully resisted a hostile takeover, there were 20 companies with poison pills that accepted takeover offers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3001307/2/c_3046510?f=insidecfo Poison Pill Popping - CFO Magazine - October 2001 Issue - CFO.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend since the early 2000s has been for shareholders to vote against poison pill authorization, since poison pills are designed to resist takeovers, whereas from the point of view of a shareholder, takeovers can be financially rewarding.

Some have argued that poison pills are detrimental to shareholder interests because they perpetuate existing management. For instance, [[Microsoft]] originally made an unsolicited bid for [[Yahoo!]], but subsequently dropped the bid after Yahoo! CEO [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] threatened to make the takeover as difficult as possible unless Microsoft raised the price to US$37 per share. One Microsoft executive commented, "They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place." Yahoo has had a shareholders rights plan in place since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo weighs up options|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6445d618-d293-11dc-8636-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts suggested that Microsoft's raised offer of $33 per share was already too expensive, and that Yang was not bargaining in good faith, which later led to several shareholder lawsuits and an aborted proxy fight from [[Carl Icahn]].&lt;ref name="msft_withdrawl1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Withdraws Proposal to Acquire Yahoo!|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-03letter.mspx|publisher=''[[Microsoft]]''|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft's Failed Yahoo Bid Risks Online Growth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/technology/05soft.html?_r=4&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=2008-05-06 | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo's stock price plunged after Microsoft withdrew the bid, and Jerry Yang faced a backlash from stockholders that eventually led to his resignation.

==Overview==
In publicly held companies, "poison pills" refer to various methods to deter [[takeover]] bids.  Takeover bids are attempts by a bidder to obtain control of a target company, either by [[proxy fight|soliciting proxies]] to get elected to the board or by acquiring a controlling block of shares and using the associated votes to get elected to the board.  Once in control of the board, the bidder can manage the target. As discussed below, targets have various takeover defenses available, and several types of defense have been called "poison pills" because they harm not only the bidder, but the target (or its shareholders) as well. Currently, the most common type of takeover defense is a shareholder rights plan.

Because the [[board of directors]] of the company can redeem or otherwise eliminate a standard poison pill, it does not typically preclude a [[proxy fight]] or other takeover attempts not accompanied by an acquisition of a significant block of the company's stock.  It can, however, prevent shareholders from entering into certain agreements that can assist in a proxy fight, such as an agreement to pay another shareholder's expenses.  In combination with a [[staggered board of directors]], however, a shareholder rights plan can be a defense.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Bebchuk |first=Lucian |authorlink=Lucian Bebchuk |author2=Coates, John C. |author3=Subramanian, Guhan  |year=2002 |title=The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards: Theory, Evidence, and Policy |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=887–951  |jstor= 1229689|doi=10.2307/1229689 |publisher=Stanford Law Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a shareholder rights plan is to force a bidder to negotiate with the target's board and not directly with the shareholders. The effects are twofold:&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Corporate Finance (6th ed.), Editions McGraw-Hill Ryerson, §23: Mergers and Acquisitions&lt;/ref&gt;

* It gives management time to find competing offers that maximize selling price.
* Several studies indicate that companies with poison pills (shareholder rights plans) have received higher takeover premiums than companies without poison pills. This results in increased shareholder value. The theory is that an increase in the negotiating power of the target is reflected in higher acquisition premiums.

===Common types of poison pills===
==== Preferred stock plan ====
The target issues a large number of new shares, often [[preferred stock|preferred shares]], to existing shareholders. These new shares usually have severe redemption provisions, such as allowing them to be converted into a large number of common shares if a takeover occurs. This immediately dilutes the percentage of the target owned by the acquirer, and makes it more expensive to acquire 50% of the target's stock.

==== Flip-in ====
A “flip-in” permits shareholders, except for the acquirer, to purchase additional shares at a discount. This provides investors with instantaneous profits. Using this type of poison pill also dilutes shares held by the acquiring company, making the takeover attempt more expensive and more difficult.

==== Flip-over ====
A “flip-over” enables stockholders to purchase the acquirer’s shares after the merger at a discounted rate. For example, a shareholder may gain the right to buy the stock of its acquirer, in subsequent mergers, at a two-for-one rate.

==== Back-end rights plan ====
Under this scenario, the target company re-phases all its employees' stock-option grants to ensure they immediately become vested if the company is taken over. Many employees can then exercise their options and then dump the stocks. With the release of the "golden handcuffs", many discontented employees may quit immediately after having cashed in their stock options. This poison pill is designed to create an exodus of talented employees, reducing a corporate value as a target. In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented human resources may result in a diluted or empty shell being left behind for the new owner.

For instance, [[PeopleSoft]] guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival Oracle, and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses. While the acquisition ultimately prevailed, the hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;The Register, "Oracle chokes on PeopleSoft's poison pill", https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/11/oracle_chokes_on_peoplesofts_poison/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Voting plan ====
In a [[voting plan]], a company will charter preferred stock with superior voting rights over that of common shareholders. If an unfriendly bidder acquired a substantial quantity of the target firm's voting common stock, it then still would not be able to exercise control over its purchase. For example, [[ASARCO]] established a voting plan in which 99% of the company's common stock would only harness 16.5% of the total voting power.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Malatesta (University of Washington) and Ralph A. Walking (Ohio State University), "Poison Pill Securities: Stockholder Wealth, Profitability, and Ownership Structure," Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 20, January/March 1988, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these pills, a "dead-hand" provision allows only the directors who introduce the poison pill to remove it (for a set period after they have been replaced), thus potentially delaying a new board’s decision to sell a company.

===Constraints and legal status===
The legality of poison pills had been unclear when they were first put to use in the early 1980s. However, the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] upheld poison pills as a valid instrument of takeover defense in its 1985 decision in [[Moran v. Household International, Inc.]]  However, many jurisdictions other than the U.S. have held the poison pill strategy as illegal, or place restraints on their use.

In Canada, almost all shareholders rights plans are "chewable," meaning they contain a permitted bid concept such that a bidder who is willing to conform to the requirements of a permitted bid can acquire the company by take-over bid without triggering a flip-in event.  Shareholder rights plans in Canada are also weakened by the ability of a hostile acquirer to petition the provincial securities regulators to have the company's pill overturned.  Generally, the courts will overturn the pill to allow shareholders to decide whether they want to tender to a bid for the company.  However, the company may be allowed to maintain it for long enough to run an auction to see if a [[white knight (business)|white knight]] can be found. A notable Canadian case before the securities regulators in 2006 involved the poison pill of [[Falconbridge Ltd.]] which at the time was the subject of a friendly bid from [[Vale Inco|Inco]] and a hostile bid from [[Xstrata]] plc, which was a 20% shareholder of Falconbridge.  Xstrata applied to have Falconbridge's pill invalidated, citing among other things that the Falconbridge had had its pill in place without shareholder approval for more than nine months and that the pill stood in the way of Falconbridge shareholders accepting Xstrata's all-cash offer for Falconbridge shares. Despite similar facts with previous cases in which securities regulators had promptly taken down pills, the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] ruled that Falconbridge's pill could remain in place for a further limited period as it had the effect of sustaining the auction for Falconbridge by preventing Xstrata increasing its ownership and potentially obtaining a blocking position that would prevent other bidders from obtaining 100% of the shares.

In the United Kingdom, poison pills are not allowed under the [[Takeover Panel]] rules. The rights of public shareholders are protected by the Panel on a case-by-case, principles-based regulatory regime. One disadvantage of the Panel's prohibition of poison pills is that it allows bidding wars to be won by hostile bidders who buy shares of their target in the marketplace during "raids". Raids have helped bidders win targets such as [[BAA Limited|BAA]] plc and [[AWG plc]] when other bidders were considering emerging at higher prices. If these companies had poison pills, they could have prevented the raids by threatening to dilute the positions of their hostile suitors if they exceeded the statutory levels (often 10% of the outstanding shares) in the rights plan. The [[London Stock Exchange]] itself is another example of a company that has seen significant stakebuilding by a hostile suitor, in this case the [[NASDAQ]]. The LSE's ultimate fate is currently up in the air, but NASDAQ's stake is sufficiently large that it is essentially impossible for a third party bidder to make a successful offer to acquire the LSE.

Takeover law is still evolving in continental Europe, as individual countries slowly fall in line with requirements mandated by the [[European Commission]]. Stakebuilding is commonplace in many continental takeover battles such as [[Scania AB]]. Formal poison pills are quite rare in continental Europe, but national governments hold [[golden shares]] in many "strategic" companies such as telecom monopolies and energy companies. Governments have also served as "poison pills" by threatening potential suitors with negative regulatory developments if they pursue the takeover. Examples of this include Spain's adoption of new rules for the ownership of energy companies after [[E.ON]] of Germany made a hostile bid for [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] and France's threats to punish any potential acquiror of [[Groupe Danone]].

===Other takeover defenses===
Poison pill is sometimes used more broadly to describe other types of takeover defenses that involve the target taking some action.  Although the broad category of takeover defenses (more commonly known as "shark repellents") includes the traditional shareholder rights plan poison pill.  Other anti-takeover protections include:

*Limitations on the ability to call special meetings or take action by written consent.
*Supermajority vote requirements to approve mergers.
*Supermajority vote requirements to remove directors.
*The target adds to its charter a provision which gives the current shareholders the right to sell their shares to the acquirer at an increased price (usually 100% above recent average share price), if the acquirer's share of the company reaches a critical limit (usually one third). This kind of poison pill cannot stop a determined acquirer, but ensures a high price for the company.
* The target takes on large [[debt]]s in an effort to make the debt load too high to be attractive—the acquirer would eventually have to pay the debts.
* The company buys a number of smaller companies using a [[stock swap]], diluting the value of the target's stock.
* The target grants its employees [[stock options]] that immediately vest if the company is taken over.  This is intended to give employees an incentive to continue working for the target company at least until a merger is completed instead of looking for a new job as soon as takeover discussions begin.  However, with the release of the "[[golden handcuffs]]", many discontented employees may quit immediately after they've cashed in their stock options. This poison pill may create an exodus of talented employees.  In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented [[human resources]] often means an [[Shell (corporation)|empty shell]] is left behind for the new owner.
* [[PeopleSoft]] guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival [[Oracle Corporation]], and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses.  The hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion. PeopleSoft allowed the guarantee to expire in April 2004. If PeopleSoft had not prepared itself by adopting effective takeover defenses, it is unclear if Oracle would have significantly raised its original bid of $16 per share. The increased bid provided an additional $4.1 billion for PeopleSoft's shareholders.
* Classified boards with staggered elections for the [[board of directors]]. For example, if a company had nine directors, then three directors would be up for re-election each year, with a three-year term. This would present a potential acquirer with the position of having a hostile board for at least a year after the first election. In some companies, certain percentages of the board (33%) may be enough to block key decisions (such as a full merger agreement or major asset sale), so an acquirer may not be able to close an acquisition for years after having purchased a majority of the target's stock. As of December 31, 2008, 47.05% of the companies in the S&amp;P Super 1500 had a classified board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.SharkRepellent.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shareholder input===
An increasing number of companies are giving shareholders a say on poison pills. As of June 15, 2009, 21 companies that had adopted or extended a poison pill had publicly disclosed they plan to put the poison pill to a shareholder vote within a year. That was up from 2008's full year total of 18, and was the largest number ever reported since the early 1980s, when the pill was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laide|first=John|title=Shareholder Input on Poison Pills|url=https://www.sharkrepellent.net/request?an=dt.getPage&amp;st=1&amp;pg=/pub/rs_20090615.html&amp;Shareholder_Input_on_Poison_Pills&amp;rnd=674362|publisher=SharkRepellent.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''software language'' is an artificial language used in the development of software systems. The term is more general than [[programming language]] and also includes [[modelling language]]s, [[query language]]s, [[transformation language]]s, [[software interface]]s, [[database schema]]ta, [[domain-specific language]]s, [[markup language]]s, etc.

'''Solar conjunction''' occurs when a [[planet]] or other [[solar system]] object is on the opposite side of the [[sun]] from the [[Earth]].  From an Earth reference, the sun will pass between the Earth and the object. Communication with any [[spacecraft]] in solar conjunction will be severely limited due to the sun's interference on radio transmissions from the spacecraft.&lt;ref name=lat20130405&gt;
{{cite news |last=Khan|first=Amina |title=NASA Mars Curiosity rover gets to work on 'spring break' chores|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-mars-curiosity-working-conjunction-spring-break-20130405,0,2992673.story |accessdate=2013-04-07 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in reference to Satellite Communications, solar conjunction occurs when the sun is directly in line with an orbiting Satellite and the terrestrial receiving station.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Spacecraft-related issues==
There is also a risk that an antenna equipped with auto-tracking will begin following the sun's movements instead of the satellite once they are no longer inline with each other. This is because the Sun acts as a large electromagnetic noise generator which creates a signal much stronger than the satellite's tracking signal{{Citation needed|reason=UNdue weight - this would only make sense if using a dumb max-signal tracker. May not be valid with modern systems|date=April 2013}}.
A recent example of limitations caused by the solar conjunction occurred when the [[NASA]]-[[JPL]] team put the [[Curiosity rover]] on [[Mars|Mars']] surface in [[autonomous]] operation mode for 25 days during the conjunction. In autonomous mode [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]] suspends all movements and active science operations but retain communication-independent experiments (e.g. record atmospheric and radiation data).

The term can also refer to the passage of the line of sight to an interior planet ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] or [[Venus]]) being very close to the solar disk. If the planet passes directly in front of the sun, a [[Astronomical transit|solar transit]] occurs.

==Biography==

==={{anchor|Parentage}}Parents===
Ashraf traces his lineage to a family of Syeds in Kachhauchha Sharif, a small town in the district of [[Ambedkar Nagar]], eastern Uttar Pradesh. He was born on 4 February 1933, the third child of librarian Syed Habeeb Ashraf and Syeda Saeeda. Habeeb worked in the village library; although he was enrolled at Firangi Mahal, a madrasa in Lucknow, he did not complete his education due to the death of his father. He was well-versed in Ilmul Jafar and Ilmul Ramal (Islamic [[geomancy]]). Habeeb wrote to his eldest son, [[Syed Amin Ashraf]] (who was stationed in Aligarh), six months before his death asking him to be home on 3 February 1972 for his burial.

Syeda Saeeda was the daughter of a [[Unani]] doctor in the village. Before her marriage, she assisted her father in the preparation of drugs in his dispensary and acquired a knowledge of Unani medicine (particularly diseases of women and children).

=== Siblings ===
Habeeb and Syeda had four sons and three daughters. The two elder sons were Syed Amin Ashraf and Syed Hameed Ashraf. The youngest son (and their fifth child) was Syed Ashraf. Their daughters were Syeda Mahmooda, Syeda Masooda and Syeda Raheen. Syed Amin Ashraf received his PhD in English literature from Aligarh Muslim University, and later taught in the same department. Amin Ashraf is regarded as an accomplished poet in Urdu [[ghazal]]s. He has compiled three poetic collections – ''Jadae Shab'', ''Bahare Ijaad'' and ''Qafase Rang'' – and a collection of his papers in a book, ''Bargo Bar''. He has received{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} awards from [[Ghalib Academy, New Delhi]] and Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy in Lucknow. Several critical essays about his poetry have been published. Their second son, Syed Hameed Ashraf (who died in 1993), studied [[Shariah]] at [[Al Jamiatul Ashrafia | Al Jamiatul Ashrafia Mubarakpur]] and [[Darul Uloom Deoband]], received B.A., M.A. and M.Phil degrees in Arabic literature from [[Aligarh Muslim University]] and taught at a number of Indian [[madrasa]]s. Syed Waheed Ashraf learned Islamic theology from his brother, Syed Hameed Ashraf.

=== Education ===
Ashraf received his primary education from the village madrasa and graduated from middle school in [[Baskhari]], a small town near his home, in 1948. He received his high-school certificate from Mohd. Hasan Inter College in Jaunpur District. After high school, Ashraf suspended his studies for seven years due to poor health. He then earned his undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral degrees (1965) from Aligarh Muslim University.

=== Professional career ===
After receiving his PhD, Ashraf was a temporary lecturer at Punjabi University in Patiala for a year before returning to Aligarh University as a UGC senior research fellow. In 1971, he received a permanent faculty position as a lecturer at M.S. University of Baroda in Gujarat. In 1977, Ashraf joined the University of Madras as a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in Persian. He became a professor in 1982, and retired as head of the department of Arabic, Persian and Urdu at the University of Madras in 1993.

=== Spiritual odyssey ===
Ashraf was devoted to Sufi literature. After completing his education at Aligarh Muslim University, he gave spiritual allegiance (''baith'') to Syed Qadeer Ahmad Ashrafiul Jilani in Kichaucha Sharif. He was initiated into the Ashrafiya order, and Jilani made him his successor (''khalifa''). Ashraf delivered lectures on Masnavi Maulan Rum at his home in Baroda.

A purpose that is imposed by a human use, such as that of a fork, is called ''[[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|extrinsic]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Natural teleology, common in [[classical philosophy]] but controversial today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ |last=Allen |first=Colin |title=Teleological Notions in Biology |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2003}}]&lt;/ref&gt; contends that natural entities also have ''intrinsic'' purposes, irrespective of human use or opinion. For instance, Aristotle claimed that an acorn's intrinsic ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' is to become a fully grown oak tree.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1050a9–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Though ancient [[atomist]]s rejected the notion of natural teleology, teleological accounts of non-personal or non-human nature were explored and often endorsed in ancient and medieval philosophies, but fell into disfavor during the modern era (1600–1900). In the late 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] used the concept of telos as a regulative principle in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''. Teleology was also fundamental to the speculative philosophy of [[Georg Hegel]].

Contemporary philosophers and scientists are still discussing whether teleological axioms are useful or accurate in proposing modern philosophies and scientific theories. For instance, in 2012, [[Thomas Nagel]] proposed a non-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] account of [[evolution]] that incorporates impersonal and natural teleological laws to explain the existence of life, [[consciousness]], [[rationality]], and objective value.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nagel, ''[[Mind and Cosmos]]'', Oxford University Press: 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the accuracy can also be considered independently from the usefulness: it is a common experience in [[pedagogy]] that a minimum of apparent teleology can be useful in thinking about and explaining Darwinian evolution even if there is no true teleology driving evolution. Thus it is easier to say that evolution "gave" wolves sharp [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] because those teeth "serve the purpose of" [[predation]] regardless of whether there is an underlying nonteleologic reality in which evolution is not an actor with intentions. In other words, because human [[cognition]] and [[learning]] often rely on the narrative structure of stories (with actors, goals, and proximal rather than distal causation), some minimal level of teleology might be recognized as useful or at least tolerable for practical purposes even by people who reject its [[cosmology|cosmologic]] accuracy. 

==Etymology==
The word ''teleology'' builds on the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:τέλος|τέλος]], ''telos'' (root: τελε-, "end, purpose")&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xA9dxrhfa5kC&amp;dq= ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English''], Routledge, 1977, p. 4187.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], ''logia'', "a branch of learning". The German philosopher [[Christian von Wolff]] coined the term (in the Latin form "''teleologia''") in 1728 in his work ''Philosophia rationalis, sive logica''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Historical overview==
In western philosophy, the term and concept of teleology originated in the writings of  [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle's [[Four Causes]] give special place to each thing's telos or "final cause." In this, he followed Plato in seeing purpose in both human and sub-human nature.

===Platonic===
In the ''[[Phaedo]]'', [[Plato]] through [[Socrates]] argues that true explanations for any given physical phenomenon must be teleological. He bemoans those who fail to distinguish between a thing's necessary and sufficient causes, which he identifies respectively as [[Four causes#Material cause|material]] and [[Four causes#Final cause|final]] causes (''Phaedo'' 98–99):

{{quote|Imagine not being able to distinguish the real cause, from that without which the cause would not be able to act, as a cause. It is what the majority appear to do, like people groping in the dark; they call it a cause, thus giving it a name that does not belong to it. That is why one man surrounds the earth with a vortex to make the heavens keep it in place, another makes the air support it like a wide lid. As for their capacity of being in the best place they could be at this very time, this they do not look for, nor do they believe it to have any divine force, but they believe that they will some time discover a stronger and more immortal Atlas to hold everything together more, and they do not believe that the truly good and 'binding' binds and holds them together.|Plato, ''Phaedo'' 99}}

Plato here argues that while the materials that compose a body are necessary conditions for its moving or acting in a certain way, they nevertheless cannot be the ''sufficient'' condition for its moving or acting as it does. For example (given in ''Phaedo'' 98), if Socrates is sitting in an Athenian prison, the elasticity of his tendons is what allows him to be sitting, and so a physical description of his tendons can be listed as ''necessary conditions'' or ''auxiliary causes'' of his act of sitting (''[[Phaedo]]'' 99b; ''[[Timaenus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 46c9–d4, 69e6). However, these are only necessary conditions of Socrates' sitting. To give a physical description of Socrates' body is to say ''that'' Socrates is sitting, but it does not give us any idea why ''it came to be'' that he was sitting in the first place. To say why he was sitting and not ''not'' sitting, we have to explain what it is about his sitting that is ''good'', for all things brought about (i.e., all products of actions) are brought about because the actor saw some good in them. Thus, to give an explanation of something is to determine what about it is good. Its goodness is its ''actual cause''—its purpose, ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or "reason for which" (''Timaeus'' 27d8–29a).

===Aristotelian===
[[Aristotle]] argued that [[Democritus]] was wrong to attempt to reduce all things to mere necessity, because doing so neglects the aim, order, and "final cause", which brings about these necessary conditions:

{{quote|[[Democritus]], however, neglecting the final cause, reduces to necessity all the operations of nature. Now, they are necessary, it is true, but yet they are for a final cause and for the sake of what is best in each case. Thus nothing prevents the teeth from being formed and being shed in this way; but it is not on account of these causes but on account of the end....|Aristotle, ''[[Generation of Animals]]'' V.8, 789a8–b15}}

In the ''Physics'' Aristotle rejected Plato's assumption that the universe was created by an intelligent designer using eternal [[Platonic form|forms]] as his model. For Aristotle, natural ends are produced by "natures" (principles of change internal to living things), and natures, Aristotle argued, do not deliberate: 
{{quote|"It is absurd to suppose that ends are not present [in nature] because we do not see an agent deliberating." |Aristotle, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 2.8, 199b27-9;&lt;ref name="AristotleOrganon&amp;c2.8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=The Organon and Other Works| editor=| publisher= Opensource collection. Translated under the editorship of W.D. Ross.

These Platonic and Aristotelian arguments ran counter to those presented earlier by [[Democritus]] and later by [[Lucretius]], both of whom were supporters of what is now often called [[Accidentalism (philosophy)|accidentalism]]:

{{quote|Nothing in the body is made in order that we may use it. What happens to exist is the cause of its use.|Lucretius, ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (On the Nature of Things), IV, 833; cf. 822–56.}}

==Disfavor==
Since the ''[[Novum Organum]]'' of [[Francis Bacon]], teleological explanations in physical science tend to be deliberately avoided in favor of focus on material and efficient explanations. Final and formal causation came to be viewed as false or too subjective.&lt;ref name="aristotle"&gt;"The received intellectual tradition has it that, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, revolutionary philosophers began to curtail and reject the teleology of the medieval and scholastic Aristotelians, abandoning final causes in favor of a purely mechanistic model of the Universe." {{Citation|last=Ransom Johnson|first=Monte|title=Aristotle on Teleology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008}} pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some disciplines, in particular within evolutionary biology, continue to use language that appears teleological when they describe natural tendencies towards certain end conditions; although some argue that these arguments ought to be, and practicably can be, rephrased in non-teleological forms, others hold that teleological language cannot always be ''easily'' expunged from descriptions in the life sciences, at least within the bounds of practical [[pedagogy]]. This is [[#Biology|discussed further below]].

==Economics==
A teleology of human aims played a crucial role in the work of [[Ludwig von Mises]] especially in the development of his science of [[praxeology]]. More specifically he believed that human action, i.e. purposeful behavior, is teleological based on the presupposition that an individual's action is governed or caused by the existence of their chosen ends. Or in other words an individual selects what they believe to be the most appropriate means to achieve a sought after goal or end. Mises however also stressed that teleology with respect to human action was by no means independent of causality as he states "no action can be devised and ventured upon without definite ideas about the relation of cause and effect, teleology presupposes causality"&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/library/ultimate-foundation-economic-science&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern and postmodern philosophy==
Historically, teleology may be identified with the philosophical tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. The rationale of teleology was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his Critique of Judgement and, again, made central to speculative philosophy by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and in the various neo-Hegelian schools{{snd}} proposing a history of our species some consider to be at variance with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], as well as with the [[dialectical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], and with what is now called [[analytic philosophy]]{{snd}} the point of departure is not so much formal logic and scientific fact but 'identity'. (In [[Hegelianism|Hegel's]] terminology: 'objective spirit'.)

Individual human [[consciousness]], in the process of reaching for autonomy and freedom, has no choice but to deal with an obvious reality: the collective identities (such as the multiplicity of world views, ethnic, cultural and national identities) that divide the human race and set (and always have set) different groups in violent conflict with each other. Hegel conceived of the 'totality' of mutually antagonistic world-views and life-forms in history as being 'goal-driven', that is, oriented towards an end-point in history. The 'objective contradiction' of 'subject' and 'object' would eventually 'sublate' into a form of life that leaves violent conflict behind. This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the 'historical process as a whole' is present in a variety of 20th-century authors, although its prominence declined drastically after the [[Second World War]].

In contrast, teleological based "[[grand narrative]]s" are eschewed by the [[postmodern]] attitude&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[The Postmodern Condition|''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'']] (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and teleology may be viewed as reductive, exclusionary and harmful to those whose stories are diminished or overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead, Judy (2000). ''Postmodern Music/Postmodern Thought'', p. 6. ({{ISBN|0-8153-3820-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this postmodern position, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has argued that a narrative understanding of oneself, of one's capacity as an independent reasoner, one's dependence on others and on the social practices and traditions in which one participates, all tend towards an ultimate good of liberation. Social practices may themselves be understood as teleologically oriented to internal goods, for example practices of philosophical and scientific inquiry are teleologically ordered to the elaboration of a true understanding of their objects. MacIntyre's book ''[[After Virtue]]'' famously dismissed the naturalistic teleology of Aristotle's 'metaphysical biology', but he has cautiously moved from that book's account of a sociological teleology toward an exploration of what remains valid in a more traditional teleological naturalism.

==Ethics==
Teleology informs the study of [[ethic]]s.

===Business ethics===
{{Main article|Business ethics}}
Business people commonly think in terms of purposeful action as in, for example, [[management by objectives]]. Teleological analysis of business ethics leads to consideration of the full range of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in any business decision, including the management, the staff, the customers, the shareholders, the country, humanity and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Business &amp; Professional Ethics for Directors, Executives &amp; Accountants |author=Leonard J. Brooks, Paul Dunn |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9x5Yj3nApN4C&amp;pg=PT169 |page=149 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-324-59455-3 |date=2009-03-31 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical ethics===
{{Main article|Medical ethics}}
Teleology provides a moral basis for the professional ethics of medicine, as physicians are generally concerned with outcomes and must therefore know the ''telos'' of a given treatment paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5a0nza21ZMC&amp;pg=PA78 |title=Methods in medical ethics |author=Jeremy Sugarman, Daniel P. Sulmasy |page=78 |publisher=Georgetown University Press |isbn=978-0-87840-873-3 |year=2001 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequentialism===
{{Main article|Consequentialism}}

The broad spectrum of consequentialist ethics, of which [[utilitarianism]] is a well-known example, focuses on the end result or consequences, with such principles as [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s "the greatest good for the greatest number", or the Principle of Utility. Hence, this principle is teleological, but in a broader sense than is elsewhere understood in philosophy. In the classical notion, teleology is grounded in the inherent natures of things themselves, whereas in consequentialism, teleology is imposed on nature from outside by the human will. Consequentialist theories justify inherently what most people would call evil acts by their desirable outcomes, if the good of the outcome outweighs the bad of the act. So, for example, a consequentialist theory would say it was acceptable to kill one person in order to save two or more other people. These theories may be summarized by the maxim "the ends can justify the means."

Consequentialism stands in contrast to the more classical notions of [[deontological ethics]], such as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Categorical Imperative]], and [[Aristotle]]'s [[virtue ethics]] (although formulations of virtue ethics are also often consequentialist in derivation). In deontological ethics, the goodness or badness of individual acts is primary and a desirable larger goal is insufficient to justify bad acts committed on the way to that goal, even if the bad acts are relatively minor and the goal is major (like telling a small lie to prevent a war and save millions of lives). In requiring all constituent acts to be good, deontological ethics is much more rigid than consequentialism, which varies by circumstances.

Practical ethics are usually a mix of the two.  For example, Mill also relies on deontic maxims to guide practical behavior, but they must be justifiable by the principle of utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Liberty_and_Other_Essays.html?id=m6cQfXCETnIC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=John Stuart Mill On Liberty And Other Essays |author=John Gray, Ed. |page=ix |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-283384-7 |year=1998 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{See also|Four causes#The four causes in modern science}}

In modern science, explanations that rely on teleology are often, but not always, avoided, either because they are unnecessary or because whether they are true or false is thought to be beyond the ability of human perception and understanding to judge.&lt;ref name="aristotle"/&gt; But using teleology as an explanatory style, in particular within evolutionary biology, is still controversial.&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2004 |author=Hanke, David |chapter=Teleology: The explanation that bedevils biology |pages=143–155 |title=Explanations: Styles of explanation in science |editor=John Cornwell |place=Oxford &amp; New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860778-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWpq14vS7WQC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=%22biology+is+sick+%22&amp;q=%22biology%20is%20sick%20%22 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
{{Main article|Teleology in biology}}

Apparent teleology is a recurring issue in [[evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, M., &amp; Travis, J. (Eds.) (2009). ''Evolution: The First Four Billion Years''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; much to the consternation of some writers.&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"/&gt;

Statements which imply that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something "in order to" achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid. Usually, it is possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology even if that is not the intention. These issues have recently been discussed by John Reiss.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, John O. (2009) ''Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker''. Berkeley, California: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed| date=September 2011}} He argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of such teleology by rejecting the analogy of natural selection as a [[watchmaker analogy|watchmaker]]; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1987) ''The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design''. New York: W W Norton &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, like [[James G. Lennox|James Lennox]], have argued that Darwin was a teleologist,&lt;ref&gt;[[James G. Lennox|Lennox, James G.]] (1993). "Darwin was a Teleologist" ''Biology and Philosophy'', 8, 409-21.&lt;/ref&gt; while others like Michael Ghiselin described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and being teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00850377 | last1 = Ghiselin | first1 = Michael T. |  year = 1994 | title = Darwin's language may seem teleological, but his thinking is another matter | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/l1324662n645244w/| journal = Biology and Philosophy | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 489–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist philosopher [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] has argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of.&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala, Francisco]] (1998). "Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology." ''Nature's purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Neander]] has argued that the modern concept of biological 'function' is dependent upon selection. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence without going through a process of selection has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection and function cannot be defined in the manner advocated by Reiss and Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Neander|Neander, Karen]] (1998). "Functions as Selected Effects: The Conceptual Analyst's Defense," in C. Allen, M. Bekoff &amp; G. Lauder (Eds.), ''Nature's Purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology'' (pp. 313–333). Cambridge, MA; London, UK: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Mayr]] states that "adaptedness... is an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' result rather than an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' goal-seeking."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst W.]] (1992). "The idea of teleology" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 53, 117–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand. For example, S. H. P. Madrell writes that "the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements" for the sake of saving space, but that this "should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;Madrell SHP (1998) Why are there no insects in the open sea? ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''201''':2461–2464.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] said, "Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public."&lt;ref&gt;Hull, D., Philosophy of Biological Science, Foundations of Philosophy Series, Prentice&amp;ndash;Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N. J., 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1974) Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Volume XIV, pp. 91–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected-effects accounts, like the one Neander suggests, face objections due to their reliance on etiological accounts, which some fields lack the resources to accommodate. Many such sciences, which study the same traits and behaviors regarded by evolutionary biology, still correctly attribute teleological functions without appeal to selection history. [[Gualtiero Piccinini]] and Corey J. Maley are a proponent of one such account which focuses instead on goal-contribution. With the objective goals of organisms being survival and inclusive fitness, Piccinini and Maley define teleological functions to be “a stable contribution by a trait (or component, activity, property) of organisms belonging to a biological population to an objective goal of those organisms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maley|first=Corey J.|last2=Piccinini|first2=Gualtiero|date=2018-01-18|title=A Unified Mechanistic Account of Teleological Functions for Psychology and Neuroscience|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199685509.001.0001/oso-9780199685509-chapter-11|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|language=en|doi=10.1093/oso/9780199685509.003.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cybernetics===
[[Julian Bigelow]], [[Arturo Rosenblueth]], and [[Norbert Wiener]] have conceived of [[feedback]] mechanisms as lending a teleology to machinery. Wiener, a mathematician, coined the term '[[cybernetics]]' to denote the study of "teleological mechanisms."&lt;ref&gt;Cybernetics, or control and communication in the animal and machine' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Cybernetics is the study of the [[communication]] and [[control theory|control]] of regulatory feedback both in living beings and machines, and in combinations of the two. In the cybernetic classification presented in "Behavior, Purpose and Teleology", teleology is feedback controlled purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenblueth |first1=Arturo |last2=Wiener |first2=Norbert |last3=Bigelow |first3=Julian |title=Behavior, Purpose and Teleology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21 |date=Jan 1943 |language=|jstor=184878 |doi=10.1086/286788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conway |first=Patrick |title=Development of volitional competence |publisher=MSS Information Corp |year=1974 |pages=60 |isbn=0-8422-0424-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification system underlying cybernetics was criticized by [[Frank Honywill George]], who cited the need for an external observability to the purposeful behavior in order to establish and validate the goal-seeking behavior. In this view, the purpose of observing and observed systems is respectively distinguished by the system's subjective [[autonomy]] and objective control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=George| first=Frank Honywill |authorlink=Frank Honywill George|author2=Johnson, Les |title=Purposive behavior and teleological explanations |publisher=Gordon and Breach |url=https://www.amazon.com/Purposive-Behaviour-Teleological-Explanations-Cybernetics/dp/2881241107/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1320201377&amp;sr=1-1 |pages=xII |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Imaginary''' order is one of a triptych of terms in the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], along with the [[The Symbolic|symbolic]] and the [[The Real|real]].  Each of the trio of terms emerged gradually over time, and underwent an evolution during the development of Lacan's thought.  "Of these three terms, the 'imaginary' was the first to appear, well before the Rome Report of 1953 ... [when t]he notion of the 'symbolic' came to the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, looking back at his intellectual development from the vantage point of the 1970s, Lacan epitomised it as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I began with the Imaginary, I then had to chew on the story of the Symbolic ... and I finished by putting out for you this famous Real.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Seminar 22, quoted in James M. Mellard, ''Beyond Lacan'' (Albany 2006) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, "Lacan's work is often divided into three periods: the Imaginary (1936–1953), the Symbolic (1953–1963), and the Real (1963–1981)".&lt;ref&gt;D. Hoens and Ed Pluth, in Mellard, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first of these, "Lacan regarded the 'imago' as the proper study of psychology and identification as the fundamental psychical process.  The imaginary was then the ...  dimension of images, conscious or unconscious, perceived or imagined";&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in the decade or two following his delivery of ''Le stade du miroir'' at Marienbad in 1936 that Lacan's concept of the Imaginary was most fully articulated.

==The Imaginary order==
The basis of the Imaginary order is the formation of the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego]] in the "[[mirror stage]]"; by articulating the ego in this way "the category of the imaginary provides the theoretical basis for a long-standing polemic against ego-psychology"&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; on Lacan's part. Since the ego is formed by identifying with the counterpart or specular image, "[[Identification (psychology)|identification]]" is an important aspect of the imaginary. The relationship whereby the ego is constituted by identification is a locus of "alienation", which is another feature of the imaginary, and is fundamentally [[Narcissism|narcissistic]]: thus Lacan wrote of "the different phases of imaginary, narcissistic, specular identification - the three adjectives are equivalent"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book I'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; which make up the ego's history.

If "the Imaginary, the Symbolic and the Real are an unholy trinity whose members could as easily be called Fraud, Absence and Impossibility",&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bowie, ''Lacan'' (London 1991) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; then the Imaginary, a realm of surface appearances which are inherently deceptive, is "Fraud".

==The fragmented body==
For Lacan, the driving-force behind the creation of the ego as mirror-image was the prior experience of the phantasy of the fragmented body.  "Lacan was not a Kleinian, though he was the first in France ... to decipher and praise her work",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller, "Microscopia", in Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p.xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; but "the threatening and regressive phantasy of 'the body-in-pieces' ... is explicitly related by Lacan to [[Melanie Klein]]'s paranoid position".&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, "Introduction", Lacan, ''Four'' p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;  Klein's "specific phantasy ... that something inside the person is seeking to pull him apart and render him dead by dismemberment"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; fuelled for Lacan "the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image ... to the assumption of the armour of an alienating identity"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; — to the ego as other-identification, as "Fraud".

==The Symbolic==
With the increasing prominence of the Symbolic in Lacan's thought after 1953, the Imaginary becomes viewed in a rather different light, as structured by the [[The Symbolic|symbolic order]]. It is still the case that "the body in pieces finds its unity in the image of the other ... [or] its own specular image" but no longer does "analysis consist in the imaginary realisation of the subject ... to make it well-rounded, this ego, to ... have definitely integrated all its disjointed fragmentary states, its scattered limbs, its pregenital phases, its partial drives".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 54 and p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, "one finds a guide beyond the imaginary, on the level of the symbolic plane".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar Of Jacques Lacan: Book I'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

It also became apparent that the imaginary involves a linguistic dimension: whereas the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]] is the foundation of the symbolic, the "signified" and "signification" belong to the imaginary. Thus language has both symbolic and imaginary aspects: "words themselves can undergo symbolic lesions and accomplish imaginary acts of which the patient is the subject. ... In this way speech may become an imaginary, or even real object".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'' p. 87-8&lt;/ref&gt;

To the Lacan of the fifties, "the entire analytic experience unfolds, at the joint of the imaginary and the symbolic",&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar I'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter as the central key to growth: "the goal in analysizing neurotics is to eliminate the interference in symbolic relations created by imaginary relations ... dissipating imaginary identifications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Fink (psychoanalyst)|Bruce Fink]], ''The Lacanian Subject'' (Princeton 1997) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  The Imaginary was the problem, the Symbolic the answer, so that "an entire segment of the analytic experience is nothing other than the exploration of blind alleys of imaginary experience".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar I'' p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is "in the disintegration of the imaginary unity constituted by the ego that the subject finds the signifying material of his symptoms",&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; the "identity crisis ... [when] the false-self system disintegrates".&lt;ref&gt;D. Freshwater and C. Robertson, ''Emotions and Needs'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the late Lacan==
Just as the early predominance of the Imaginary was eclipsed after the Rome Report, so too by the end of the Sixties the Symbolic in turn  would increasingly come to play second fiddle to the Real, as from "this point on, Lacan downplays the Oedipus complex, seen as a mythical – and so imaginarized – version of unconscious organization".&lt;ref&gt;V. Voruz and B Wolf eds., ''The Later Lacan: An Introduction'' (Albany 2007) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Lacan could still claim that the "objective of my teaching ... is to dissociate ... what belongs to the imaginary and ... what belongs to the symbolic".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Encore", in Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose, ''Female Sexuality'' (New York 1982) p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Borromean rings|Borromean knots]], he considered he had found a possible topological counterpart to the interconnections of Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real.  "Lacan's seminar was at times now little more than a silent demonstration of the properties of the interlocking knots which illustrated the imbrication of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary".&lt;ref&gt;Macey, ''Four'' p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==French culture==&lt;!-- This section is linked from 'Cornelius Castoriadis' and 'Henri Lefebvre'--&gt;
Use of "the adjective [imaginary] as a noun can ... be traced to the works of the novelist [[André Gide]] ... [and] was probably given greater currency by [Sartre's] ''[[The Imaginary (Sartre)|L'Imaginaire]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Macey, ''Four'' p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  In Lacan's hands, the Imaginary came close to being an omnivorously colonising interpretive machine: thus [[René Girard]] regretted that "To the Lacanian, whatever I call mimetic must correspond to ... 'capturé par l'imaginaire'".&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''To Double Business Bound: Essays on Literature, Mimesis, and Anthropology'' (Baltimore 1988) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[post-Lacanian]] fissiparous tendencies of his "schools", the term can perhaps return to the general culture, as when the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] defines the imaginary "by games of mirroring, of duplication, of reversed identification and [[Psychological projection|projection]], always in the mode of the double",&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1972, 172)&lt;/ref&gt; or when [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] defines the imaginary as the capacity humans have to create other forms of individual and social existence.&lt;ref&gt;"''[L]'apparition chez les humains de l'imaginaire aussi bien au niveau de l'être humain singulier (imagination) qu'au niveau social (imaginaire social ou imaginaire instituant)''." (C. Castoriadis, ''La société et vérité dans le monde social-historique. Séminaires 1986-1987. La création humaine I'', Paris, Seuil, 1996, p. 20; as quoted in: Sophie Klimis, Laurent Van Eynde, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ya6xExymbegC&amp;pg= ''L'imaginaire selon Castoriadis: thèmes et enjeux''], Publications Fac St Louis, 2006, p. 70)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6864">'''Wonderbag''' is a stand-alone, non-electric insulated bag designed to reduce the amount of [[fuel]] required in the [[cooking]] of food in [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt; Instead of being placed on a [[stove]] for the duration of the cooking period, food is instead heated to a hot enough temperature then transferred to the Wonderbag, which uses the principle of [[thermal insulation]] to continue cooking, and keeps food warm without needing additional fire or heat.&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;  Working on the principle of [[thermal cooking]], the Wonderbag is estimated to save up to 30% of the total fuel costs associated with cooking with [[Kerosene]] ("paraffin") alone. In developing countries there are numerous advantages for the product, as it immediately helps ease [[deforestation]] of natural reserves, and it frees up those who would spend their time gathering the extra wood for fire fuel.&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;

Designed by [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]-based entrepreneur Sarah Collins of Natural Balance, and [[poverty]] activist Moshy Mathe, the Wonderbag is aimed at societies where fuel is expensive or time-consuming to gather.

As of January 2012, over 150,000 Wonderbags were in use in South Africa, with the manufacturers and partners such as [[Unilever]] intending to promote the use of the device worldwide.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt; {{As of|January 2013}} over 650,000 have been distributed in "South Africa, [[Rwanda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Syria]]n refugee camps in [[Jordan]]."&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;

== History ==
Sarah Collins developed the idea for the Wonderbag during power outages in South Africa in 2008.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

Anna Pearce describes in her book "Simply Living - The Story of the Compassion and the Wonderbox" from 1989 how the old idea of the hayboxes turned into polystyrene filled cushions - The Wonderbox - to cook in South Africa ({{ISBN|1 85421 048 3}}) Wonderboxes were also distributed beginning as early as 1976, while not a new invention, the wonderbag is an innovative take on an old design.

The original Wonderbox was designed and produced by Shirley Buys (nee' Woodbridge) in Durban in 1976, based upon the Hay Box design used in her childhood in war-time England. Shirley trained as a patternmaker and designed the inverted oversized 'beanbag' containing recycled polystyrene chips in a polyester-cotton fabric bag and lid within a corrugated cardboard box and personally marketed it across Zululand between 1976 and 1980. Compassion of South Africa, a non-sectarian Christian action group opposing Apartheid, and the particular assistance from Brigid Oppenheimer facilitated Shirley's design and marketing and published a comprehensive recipe book &lt;ref&gt;https://thermalcooker.wordpress.com/2008/07/26/wonder-box-recipe-booklet/&lt;/ref&gt;with a lot of graphics to help illiterate users follow the recipes.&lt;ref&gt;http://foodstorageandsurvival.com/building-a-wonderbox-style-insulated-cooking-box&lt;/ref&gt; The design was deliberately not patented and Compassion of South Africa asked to be recognised in the sharing of the recipe book.  Shirley manufactured the Wonderbox in her workshop in her Morningside Durban home for over 3 years before Compassion established several other manufacturing facilities across South African, and shared the design freely. 

== Design ==
The Wonderbag consists of an inner layer of insulation containing recycled [[polystyrene]] balls, with an outer, [[drawstring]]&lt;ref name="Metro" /&gt; covering of polyester-cotton blend textiles.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt; The manufacturers expect that in time the polystyrene (which is non-[[Biodegradation|biodegradeable]]) will be replaced with a [[polyurethane]] blend.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

== Use ==
To use the Wonderbag, first a [[Cookware and bakeware|cooking pot]] is heated as normal on a stove until it reaches the required cooking temperature. At this point, the pot is removed from the stove and placed in the bag, where due to the insulation the receptacle remains near the stovetop temperature for an extended period. Rice, for instance, may be cooked by heating in a pot of water for two minutes until the water boils and then placing in the Wonderbag for another hour, while for a meat dish the stovetop time is twenty minutes and the bag time five hours.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt;

== Fuel savings ==
Due to the reduction in fuel used, the Wonderbag is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to half a ton per year if used three times a week.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

== Retail and production ==
The Wonderbag is available in the United States.
