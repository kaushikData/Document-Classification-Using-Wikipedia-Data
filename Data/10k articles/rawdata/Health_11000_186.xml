      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29123">'''Abortion in [[Spain]]''' is legal with some restrictions. Abortion during the first trimester is legal upon request. However, abortion during the second trimester is legal only for serious risk to the health of the woman or fetal defects.

Abortion legislation in Spain has a varied history. During the 1930s, abortion law was liberalized in the [[Second Republic of Spain|area controlled by the Republicans]], but this was short-lived, as the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] with support of the [[Catholic Church]], outlawed abortion again. The laws were relaxed in 1985, and were further liberalized in 2010. Abortion remains a controversial political issue in Spain, and regular attempts to restrict it occur but they have failed to get enough traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/spain-abandons-plan-introduce-tough-new-abortion-laws|publisher=The Guardian|title=Spain abandons plan to introduce tough new abortion laws |date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In recent years, abortion rates have been falling, as better access to [[emergency contraception]] has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.es/20141230/abortion-numbers-continue-to-fall-in-spain&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy Induced Abortion in Spain is regulated under Title II of the Organic Law 2/2010 of sexual and reproductive health and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630050651/http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2010-3514 Ley Orgánica 2/2010 de salud sexual y reproductiva y de la interrupción voluntaria del embarazo].&lt;/ref&gt; This law legalizes the practice of [[abortion]] during the first 14 weeks of [[pregnancy]]. The law came into force on 5 July 2010.&lt;ref name=ley22010/&gt; The previous regulation - Organic Law 9/1985&lt;ref name="Ley Orgánica 9/1985"&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630075111/http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=1985/14138 Ley Orgánica 9/1985]&lt;/ref&gt; - decriminalized abortion on several points. The conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in June 2010 filed an action against several provisions of law to the Constitutional Court, which has not yet been pronounced. In the electoral program for the general election held on 20 November 2011, the People's Party included modifying the law on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/PP/llevara/Constitucional/futura/ley/plazos/aborto/elpepusoc/20090212elpepusoc_12/Tes El PP llevará al Constitucional la futura ley de plazos del aborto], [[El País]], 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Constitucional/admite/recurso/PP/ley/aborto/elpepusoc/20100630elpepusoc_4/Tes El Constitucional admite el recurso del PP contra la ley del aborto], [[El País]], 30 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, induced abortion has been a practice totally banned, illegal and punishable {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} except for a period of the Second Republic and from the 9/1985 and the last 2/2010 law acts which, to varying degrees, have decriminalized abortion.

For authors such as Ibáñez and García Velasco, prohibition and criminalization of abortion did not prevent about 100,000 abortions from happening a year.&lt;ref&gt;Ibáñez y García Velasco&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, punishment would not solve the problem, as hiding contributed decisively in the death of women who practiced abortion in conditions of illegality and legal and sanitary uncertainty. In 1976, according to the Supreme Court, between 200 and 400 women died from illegal abortions.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Moreover, advocates of legally induced abortion argue that the problem of hiding mainly affects poor women with fewer economic resources, as women in a better social position would have resorted to the activity known as "abortion tourism", meaning they travel to other countries to get an abortion.&lt;ref name=GarciaGallego&gt;[http://www.pensamientocritico.org/fragar0708.html Francisca García Gallego, La práctica del aborto en España, Página Abierta, 194, julio de 2008], Francisca García Gallego es ginecóloga y miembro de ACAI (Asociación de Clínicas Acreditadas para la Interrupción del Embarazo).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the point of view presented as being against abortion, the arguments offered for banning it include that it is a criminal and murderous practice.&lt;ref name="GerardoHR"&gt;{{Cite book |title=El aborto en España: análisis de un proceso socio-político |pages=73 and ss |author=Gerardo Hernández Rodríguez |work=Universidad Pontificia de Comillas |isbn=84-87840-15-9 |accessdate=23 July 2012 |quote=Por lo que se refiere a las razones esgrimidas para rechazar el aborto [...] las expresiones [...] "homicidio", "crimen", "asesinato" son ampliamente utilizadas.; Asimismo, las razones dadas, basándose en la salvaguarda de la vida, son abundantes en ambos sectores. Unos a favor de la vida del nuevo ser y oytros pensando en la vida de la madre. [...] En lo que coinciden prácticamente todos, [...] es en la necesidad de una permanente toma de conciencia frente al problema por parte de la Administración [...]. La II República Española legalizé el aborto siendo ministra de Sanidad Federica Montseny. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH5ma5EyKHsC&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;ots=Kh6aMEG1Ag&amp;dq=aborto%20federica%20montseny&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=aborto%20federica%20montseny&amp;f=false|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, both the supporters of legalization, as well as its detractors, put the bulk of their argument in defense of life, firstly in the life of the mother, secondly in the life of the unborn child.

In both cases, virtually all the Spanish people interviewed, have been in favor of more social awareness on abortion and the need for government to regulate its intervention.&lt;ref name="GerardoHR" /&gt;

== Second Spanish Republic ==
On 25 December 1936, in [[Catalonia]], free abortion was legalized during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy with a decree signed by {{lang|ca|[[Josep Tarradellas]]|italic=no}} and published on 9 January 1937 ({{lang|ca|Diari Oficial de la Generalitat de Catalunya, núm.9}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.publico.es/especiales/memoriapublica/502228/la-segunda-republica-despenalizo-el-aborto-con-la-ley-mas-avanzada-de-europa |title=La Segunda República despenalizó el aborto con la ley más avanzada de Europa |work=[[Público (España)|Público]] |author=[[Patricia Campello]] |deadurl= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062133/http://www.publico.es/especiales/memoriapublica/502228/la-segunda-republica-despenalizo-el-aborto-con-la-ley-mas-avanzada-de-europa |date=15 February 2014 |archivedate=22 February 2014 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgtburgos.org/accion-sindical-social/social/nosotras-decidimos/699-1937-la-ley-del-aborto-mas-progresista-de-europa.html |title=Decreto de Regulación de la Interrupción Artificial del Embarazo |trans-title=Decree on the Regulation of the Artificial Interruption of Pregnancy |publisher=CGT Burgos }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/pdf.raw?query=parent%3A0002440164+type%3Apress%2Fpage&amp;name=Mundo+gr%C3%A1fico.+12-5-1937 |author=[[José María Garat]] |work=[[Mundo Gráfico]] |date=12 May 1937 |via=[[National Library of Spain]] |title=En Cataluña existe ya el aborto legal |trans-title=In Catalonia there is already legal abortion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area loyal to the Republic during the [[Spanish Civil War]], in 1937, the Minister for Health being the Catalan anarchist ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]) [[Federica Montseny]] in the socialist [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) government headed by [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] legalized the practice of abortion, but its effect was short-lived, as the Franco side repealed.

== Organic Law 9/1985 ==
In the [[Organic Law]] 9/1985, adopted on 5 July 1985, induced abortion was legalized in three cases: serious risk to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman (supposedly therapeutic), rape (supposedly criminology), and malformations or defects, physical or mental, in the fetus (supposedly eugenics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ley Orgánica 9/1985, del 5 de julio, de reforma del Artículo 417 bis del Código Penal |url=http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=1985/14138 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630075111/http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=1985/14138 |archive-date=30 June 2012 |language=Spanish |publisher=[[Boletín Oficial del Estado]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this law, the mother could terminate the pregnancy in public or private health centres in the first 12 weeks for reasons related to criminology, in the first 22 weeks in eugenics, and at any time during pregnancy for therapeutic reasons.
In the second and third cases, a medical report was required to certify compliance with the conditions laid down by law, in cases of rape, it was necessary to take the relevant prior police report. In these three cases, abortion was not punishable if undertaken by a doctor, or under their supervision, in a medical establishment approved for abortions, whether public or private, with the express consent of the woman. In other cases, the Penal Code provided various terms of imprisonment for both the mother and the doctors who performed abortions outside of the law.

== Organic Law 2/2010 ==
On 3 March 2010, the Organic Law 2/2010 of sexual and reproductive health and abortion was promulgated. This law is to ensure fundamental rights in the field of sexual and reproductive health established by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), regulating the conditions of abortion and establishing the corresponding obligations of public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/populatin/icpd.htm ICPD Program of Action] ver [https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/populatin/icpd.htm#chapter7 ChapterVII, Reproductive Rights and Reproductive Health]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/ |title=WHO: Reproductive health |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icmer.org/RHO/html/definition_.htm |title=Definición de Salud Reproductiva de la OMS, en RHO |access-date=2012-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106033031/http://www.icmer.org/RHO/html/definition_.htm |archive-date=2009-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into force on 5 July 2010.

In Title II, Articles 13 and 14, the decriminalization of the practice of abortion during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy is specified. During this time, the woman can take a free and informed decision on the termination of her pregnancy. There will be no third party intervention in the decision.

Article 15 describes that the term of the possibility of abortion increases up to 22 weeks in cases of "serious risks to life or health of the mother or fetus". From the twenty-second week, pregnancy may be interrupted only on two assumptions: that "fetal anomalies incompatible with life are detected" or that "an extremely serious and incurable disease is detected within the fetus at the time of diagnosis and is confirmed by a clinical committee".&lt;ref name=ley22010/&gt;

== Articles 13 and 14 of Title II of Law 2/2010 ==
'''Article 13. Common requirements.'''
These are the requirements of the voluntary termination of pregnancy:
# It is practiced by a physician or under ones supervision.
# It takes place in an accredited public or private health center.
# It is done with the express written consent of the pregnant woman or, where appropriate, the legal representative, in accordance with the provisions of Law 41/2002, Basic Regulating Patient Autonomy and Rights and Obligations regarding information and clinical documentation. Express consent may be waived in the case provided for in Article 9.2.b) of that Act
# For women aged 16 to 17 years, consent to the abortion lies exclusively with them in accordance with the general arrangements for older women. At least one of the legal representatives, parent, people with parental or guardian of women between these ages must be informed of the decision of the women.
This information may be dispensed with when the minor reasonably claims that this will cause a serious conflict, manifested in certain danger of family violence, threats, coercion, abuse, or a situation of homelessness.

'''Article 14. Termination of pregnancy at the request of the woman.'''

Pregnancy can be terminated within the first fourteen weeks of gestation at the request of the pregnant woman, provided that these requirements have been followed:

a) the pregnant woman has been informed on the rights, benefits and public aid to mothers, on the terms set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 17 of this Act

b) the pregnant woman has completed a period of at least three days, from the moment the information was given to her mentioned in the previous paragraph to the realization of the intervention.&lt;ref name=ley22010&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630050651/http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2010-3514 Ley Orgánica 2/2010 de salud sexual y reproductiva y de la interrupción voluntaria del embarazo]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approval process of the new law ==
In 2009, a reform of the 1985 law that regulated abortion was processed based on three cases delimited by a new law that would permit, under any circumstances, intervention during the first 14 weeks of gestation, and until week 22 if there is serious risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman or risk of serious abnormalities to the fetus. In case of detection of fetal anomalies incompatible with life, there would be no time limit for abortion. The new law would also allow young people between 16 and 17 to have an abortion without requiring parental consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.es/20090926/nacional-politica/aborto-reforma-200909260937.html |title=Aprobada la reforma de la ley que permite el aborto libre las primeras 14 semanas |author=Erika Montañés / EP |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 July 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

This reform, supported by the Spanish Socialist Party and endorsed by the Council of State, drew criticism from the conservative People's Party, the [[Catholic Church]] and anti-abortion groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publico.es/espana/252867/aborto/ley/consejo/estado/anteproyecto/ley/constitucional |title=El Consejo de Estado avala la ley del aborto |author=P. Rafael y S. García |work=[[Público (Spain)|Público]] |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publico.es/espana/268879/iglesia/quiere/excomulgar/voten/ley/aborto |title=La Iglesia quiere excomulgar a quienes voten la Ley del Aborto |author=Jesús Bastante |work=Público |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20091027/enmienda-ley-del-aborto-porque-desprotege-las-menores-nonato/297995.shtml |title=El PP enmienda la Ley del Aborto porque "desprotege" a las menores y al nonato |author=EFE |work=[[RTVE]] |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law 2/2010 of sexual and reproductive health and abortion was finally passed by 184 votes in favor, 158 against and one abstention. The law was supported by PSOE, the ruling party of Spain led by [[Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]] and the Minister for Equality [[Bibiana Aido]]. The parties that supported the government were the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV), [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC), [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU), [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] (ICV), [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG), [[Nafarroa Bai]], and two members of [[Convergence and Union]] (CiU).

The People's Party was the only party that opposed the adoption of the new law. It was also opposed by some members of other parties such as the [[Canarian Coalition]], [[Navarrese People's Union]] (UPN), [[Union, Progress and Democracy]] (UPyD) and seven MPs from CiU. Outside parliament civil society organizations also expressed their rejection: representatives of the Spanish Episcopal Conference of the Catholic Church, [[Pro Life]] Associations and the Institute for Family Policies (IPF). In 2009, a survey on Spanish youth conducted by the Sociological Research Center or [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas]] indicated that 55% of young people felt that it was only the woman who should decide the issue, one in four believed that society should place certain limits, while 15% objected to abortion in all cases.

== The proposed amendments to the law of 2010 by the new PP government of Mariano Rajoy ==
[[Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón]], Minister of Justice for the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] government led by [[Mariano Rajoy]] announced at his first appearance in parliament in January 2012, shortly after taking office, his intention to reform the [[Abortion Act]] passed by the Socialist government led by [[Rodriguez Zapatero]], which is a law based on a time-limit model favoured by most European countries but was contested by the [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Catholic Church in Spain]] and the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (especially on the issue of whether minors between 16 and 18 may abort regardless of their parents' consent), to return to the model of the 1982 Act, in which women had to argue the grounds for their decision to abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rajoy juega a la Contrarreforma |url=http://elpais.com/diario/2012/02/05/espana/1328396412_850215.html |work=El País |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2013, the [[Government of Spain]] published its final [[Abortion debate|draft law]] of [[Abortion#Induced|abortion]]: Women undergoing abortion were to be considered "[[blame|victims]]", and the practice would only be lawful in the case of [[rape]] or when there was a serious (but as yet undefined) health risk to the mother or the fetus. The likelihood of a child being born with disabilities would not be an acceptable justification for abortion.

Under the new law, women under 18 would require parental consent and parental accompaniment during relevant consultations. Those seeking abortion in Spain would need approval from two independent doctors who would not be permitted to participate in the actual procedure.

The Spanish Association of Accredited Abortion Clinics estimated that about 100,000 of the 118,000 abortions carried out in 2012 would be illegal under the new legislation. The revision was part of the 2011 election manifesto of the Party Popular, which, strongly influenced by the Roman [[Catholic church]], was vigorously opposed by most opposition parties and women's groups, who saw it as an attack on women's rights.

In September 2014, PM [[Mariano Rajoy]] announced that the government would abandon the draft law due to lack of consensus, and that the only reform to the 2010 law that the government will seek is that 16 and 17-year-old women will require parental consent to have an abortion. As a result of this withdrawal, Minister of Justice [[Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón]] announced his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29322561|publisher=BBC News|title=Spain abortion: Rajoy scraps tighter law |date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number of abortions in Spain ==
In 2009, the number of abortions was 112,000, about 4000 less than the previous year (115,812), the first time it had decreased since 1997. According to [[Trinidad Jimenez]], then Minister for Health and Social Policy of Spain, the decline was due to over-the-counter sales in pharmacies for the so-called [[morning-after pill]] which was liberalized in late September 2009.&lt;ref name=baja&gt;[http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/812654/0/abortos/espana/baja/ El número de abortos baja en España por primera vez desde su legalización, en 1985, 20 minutos, 13/9/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.unileon.es/dp/dfh/holycross/aulaele/docs/sociedad/EMILY_abortos.pdf Emily Thigpen, 3 de abril de 2009, Datos concretos sobre las interrupciones voluntarias del embarazo en España]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, the evolution of the number of abortions, according to statistics from the Ministry of Health,&lt;ref name=MinisterioSanidadIVE&gt;[http://www.msc.es/profesionales/saludPublica/prevPromocion/embarazo/tablas_figuras.htm#Tabla%202 Ministerio de Sanidad, España, Estadísticas IVE]&lt;/ref&gt; is as follows:

== Surgical and medical abortions in Spain ==
Induced abortion or termination of unwanted pregnancy can be performed by two methods:

[[Medical abortion]] - Using drugs or medications such as [[mifepristone]] and [[misoprostol]].

[[Surgical abortion]] - Clinic or hospital intervention : aspiration, dilation and [[curettage]].

In [[Europe]] the use of medical abortion is generally broad, although its use varies according to countries, such as in [[Portugal]]: 67% of induced abortions, 49% in [[France]], in [[England]] 40% and [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Finland]] 70%.&lt;ref name=gervas&gt;[http://www.actasanitaria.com/actasanitaria/frontend/desarrollo_noticia.jsp?idCanal=23&amp;idContenido=21241 Gérvas J.

== Other information ==
Abortion was available in a restricted form from July 5, 1985.&lt;ref name="ley"&gt;[http://spain.angloinfo.com/countries/spain/abortion.asp Termination of Pregnancy &amp; Abortion in Spain]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the previous law it was only allowed under the following conditions: to preserve the [[mental health]] of the mother (in which case two specialists have to approve); if the pregnancy was a byproduct of [[rape]] or [[incest]] reported to the police (the abortion must be performed in the first twelve weeks); if the [[fetus]] would suffer from deformities or mental handicaps upon birth (two specialists had to agree on the findings); or if the mother's physical health was in immediate danger (in which case an abortion could be performed without the consent of the woman's [[family physician]] or the woman herself).&lt;ref name="ley" /&gt;

Under the previous law, the threshold of "endangering the mother's mental health" was reported to be very low, making it a loophole for abortions on-demand.&lt;ref name="demand"&gt;[http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/oct/17/huge-crowd-protests-easing-spains-abortion-law/ Huge crowd protests easing Spain's abortion law]&lt;/ref&gt; The abortion rate has more than doubled from 54,000 in 1998 to 112,000 in 2007.&lt;ref name="rate"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/12/17/spain.abortion.bill/index.html Spanish Parliament approves abortion bill, sends to Senate]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Socialist government started to liberalize current abortion laws, sending a new law through the lower house of Parliament which would allow abortion on-demand for pregnancies through the fourteenth week.&lt;ref name="rate" /&gt; The government almost succeeded in lowering the age of consent for abortions to 16, but in the end the bill states that girls aged 16 and 17 must inform their parents (but do not need parental consent) for an abortion except if the girl comes from an abusive household and such news will cause more strife.&lt;ref name="rate" /&gt; An estimated one million protesters turned to the streets of [[Madrid]] in protest of the proposed abortion law changes.&lt;ref name="demand" /&gt; The law won final approval on February 24, 2010&lt;ref name="approval"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35565952/ns/world_news-europe/ Spain OKs new abortion law]&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force on July 5, 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3396">An '''anthroponotic disease''', or '''anthroponosis''', is an [[infectious disease]] in which a [[disease agent|disease causing agent]] carried by humans is transferred to other animals.&lt;ref name="MillerHurley2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Lila|last2=Hurley|first2=Kate|title=Infectious Disease Management in Animal Shelters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q228yywFP-0C&amp;pg=PA349|accessdate=21 August 2011|date=2009-08-24|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-8138-1379-0|pages=349–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may cause the same disease or a different disease in other animals.  Since humans do not generally inflict bite wounds on other animals, the method of transmissions is always a "soft" contact such as skin to skin transmission.  An example is [[chytridiomycosis]] which can be spread by humans with the fungus on their skin handling frogs with bare hands.

The reverse situation, a disease transmitted from animals to humans, is known as [[zoonotic]].

It can also be defined as a human-to-human infection with no animal vector.&lt;ref name="Health2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Health|first=National Research Council (U.S.).

== Known anthroponotic diseases ==
Many human diseases can be transmitted to other [[primate]]s, due to their extensive biological similarities. As a result, centers that hold, treat, or involve close proximity to primates and some other kinds of animals (for example [[zoo]]s, [[research]]ers, and [[animal hospital]]s), often take steps to ensure animals are not exposed to human diseases they can catch. In some cases animals are routinely [[immunization|immunized]] with the same [[vaccine]]s given to humans.

Because the grouping is based solely on symptomatics, it is not [[monophyletic]].

== Included species ==
Depending on the author, the group can include between 100–250 species of [[Ascomycetes]] and [[Deuteromycetes]]. They are usually divided into three different groups:&lt;ref name="schmidt" /&gt;
# Ascomycetes fungi from the genera [[Ceratocystis]], [[Ophiostoma]], [[Ceratocystiopsis]], [[Grosmannia]]. These are usually transmitted between trees by bark beetles of the subfamily [[Scolytinae]].
# Several [[Black yeast|Black yeasts]] like [[Hormonema dematioides]], [[Aureobasidium pullulans]], [[Rhinocladiella atrovirens]], and [[Phialophora]] species.
# Several dark molds like [[Alternaria alternata]], [[Cladosporium sphaerospermum]] and [[Cladosporium cladosporioides|C. cladosporioides]].

== Economic importance ==
The major economic damage caused by the blue stain fungi is aesthetic because of the usually undesirable discoloration of wood. Some of the fungi have also been shown to have detrimental effects on the strength properties of infected wood.&lt;ref name="zabel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zabel|first1=Robert|title=Wood Microbiology.

'''Béla Bicsérdy''' ([[Budapest|Pest]], March 20, 1872 - [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Montana]], December 7, 1951) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] pioneer in health culture, lifestyle reformer, [[alternative medicine]] advocate, lecturer, author of many books, athlete, supporter of [[raw foodism|rawism]], [[fasting]] and [[holistic therapies]].

==Life and career==

According to Bicsérdy, after doctors couldn't cure him from his illnesses, he became a raw foodist and took long fasts.{{fact|date=September 2013}} Bicsérdy claimed that he cured himself from all his illnesses, and his hair and lost teeth grew back.&lt;ref&gt;Bicsérdy: Az élet könyve&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Bicsérdy inspired a great many people in [[Transylvania]] and [[Hungary]] promoting a regime of a [[raw veganism|raw vegan]] diet (mostly fruits with some bread and raw milk), regular fasting, sunbathing, daily outdoor exercising and regular water-cure.&lt;ref name=koltay&gt;[http://www.orvostortenet.hu/tankonyvek/tk-05/pdf/4.25/2004_188_189_koltay_erika_history_of.pdf "History of Altnerative Medicine in Hungary in 19th and Early 20th Century"], Erika Koltay. In ''Orvostörténeti Közlemények: Communicationes de historia artis medicinae, Volumes 188-189'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that any person who followed his regime will be cured of illness and will live hundreds of years, just as known possible from ancient times (the Bible for example reported many long-lived people).&lt;ref&gt;Bicsérdy Béla: A halál legyőzése &lt;/ref&gt;

Bicsérdy delivered lectures throughout Transylvania where he had his greatest following.&lt;ref name=koltay/&gt; The method became known as ''bicsérdism'' and by 1925 he had 120 to 150 thousand followers in Transylvania alone.&lt;ref name=koltay/&gt; He wrote a popular book on the subject which was inspired by [[mazdaznan]] philosophy, and in which he compared his own beliefs with the [[Zoroastrian]] ''[[Zend_Avesta#The_Zend|Zend Avesta]]''.&lt;ref name=koltay/&gt; In addition to the book there was a periodical that was first published in 1925, as ''On Behalf of Mankind'' and later under the title ''Bicsérdism''.&lt;ref name=koltay/&gt; After a few people died due to long fasting he received serious criticism.{{fact|date=September 2013}} At the end of the 1920s, he withdrew from public life.{{fact|date=September 2013}} By the mid 1940s, ''bicsérdism'' had largely been forgotten.&lt;ref name=koltay/&gt; 

At the end of the [[World War II]] he moved to [[Germany]], and then in 1951 to the USA, where he died in the same year, at the age of 79.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/03600/03628/html/b.htm#BicsérdyBéla Romániai Magyar Irodalmi Lexikon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thailand]], [[cannabis]], known by the name ''ganja'', is listed as a class-5 narcotic under the Narcotics Act, B.E. 2522 (1979). 

==History==
Cannabis appears to have been introduced to Thailand by the Indians, with the similarity of the Thai term ''kancha'' to the Indian term ''ganja'' cited as evidence.&lt;ref name="Rubin1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vera Rubin|title=Cannabis and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCRNRGOhNA4C&amp;pg=PA64|date=1 January 1975|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-081206-0|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1979, the possession, sale, and use of cannabis was criminalised by the Cannabis Act, B.E. 2477 (1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=พระราชบัญญัติกันชา พุทธศักราช ๒๔๗๗|journal=Royal Thai Government Gazette|date=5 May 1935|volume=52|pages=339–343|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2478/A/339.PDF|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
===Law===
Possession, cultivation, and transport (import/export) of up to 10&amp;nbsp;kg cannabis may result in a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison and/or a fine. Possession, cultivation, and transport of more than 10&amp;nbsp;kg is punishable by 2–15 years in prison and/or a fine. For the majority of people arrested for simple possession of small quantities of cannabis ("ganja") a fine, rather than prison time, is imposed. Narcotics police in Thailand currently view [[methamphetamine]]s (ice and "[[ya ba]]") as a more serious issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.thailawforum.com/history-of-marijuana-cannabis-thailand.html | author=Eric Blair | title=History of Marijuana Use and Anti-Marijuana Laws in Thailand | year=2001 | accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentence for crime'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.siam-legal.com/litigation/criminal-defence-drug-offences-in-thailand.php&lt;/ref&gt;:
* From 2-15 years imprisonment and a fine of 200,000 – 1,500,000 Baht for production, importation or exportation.
* From 2-10 years imprisonment or a fine of 40,000 – 200,000 Baht or both for disposal or possession for the purpose of disposal. If the quantity is over 10 kilograms, the penalty is increased to a maximum of 15 years and a fine of 200,000 – 1,500,000 Baht.
* Imprisonment not exceeding 5 years and or a fine not exceeding 100,000 Baht or both for possession.
* Imprisonment not exceeding 1 year and a fine of 100,000 – 1,000,000 Baht for consumption.

===Enforcement===
Cannabis can be found openly sold in bars and restaurants in certain parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stonercircle.net/2016/05/08/weed-in-thailand/|title= Best Places To Smoke Or Buy Weed In Thailand|website=stonercircle.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; In tourist heavy areas cannabis is commonly found, businesses openly sell "happy" goods which have cannabis in them. Cannabis dealers do sometimes work with police who shakedown customers and demand a bribe. Many tourists do end up in jail despite the relaxed attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/drugs-in-thailand-1458510 |title=Drugs in Thailand |website=tripsavvy.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clinical pharmaceutical scientist''' (or '''pharmacist-scientist''') is a licensed, practicing [[pharmacist]] who also functions as an independent researcher in the [[Pharmacy#Pharmaceutical_sciences|pharmaceutical sciences]]. Clinical pharmaceutical scientists are a type of clinician scientist, analogous to physician-scientists.{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|p=174}}

== Terminology ==
The term '''clinical pharmaceutical scientist''' is distinct from the term '''pharmaceutical scientist''', in that a clinical pharmaceutical scientist is a practicing clinical [[pharmacist]] involved in science relating to the [[Drug discovery|discovery]] and/or [[Drug development|development]] of [[pharmaceuticals]], the development of new knowledge improving the use of pharmaceuticals in [[Medicine#Clinical practice|clinical practice]], or any other subfield of [[Pharmacy#Pharmaceutical sciences|pharmaceutical science]] (e.g. [[pharmacoeconomics]], [[pharmacokinetics]], [[outcomes research]]), while a pharmaceutical scientist need not also be a [[clinician]] (pharmacist).&lt;ref name="AAPS Pharm Science"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Pharmaceutical Science|url=http://www.aaps.org/intropharmsci/|publisher=American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all clinical pharmaceutical scientists are pharmaceutical scientists, but not all pharmaceutical scientists are clinical pharmaceutical scientists. 

Clinical pharmaceutical scientists are both practicing pharmacists and [[Clinical pharmacology|clinical pharmacologists]].{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|p=174}}

== History ==

=== Modern conceptualization ===
Most sources attribute the origination of the term "clinical pharmaceutical scientist" to the 1973–1975 Millis Study Commission on Pharmacy (often referred to simply as the "Millis Commission").{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|p=174}}{{sfn|Blouin|Cloyd|Ludden|Kroboth|1991|p=257}} The Millis Commission was so-named after Dr. John (Jack) S. Millis, the commission's chairman.{{sfn|Millis Commission|pp=xv, xix}} The Millis Commission was tasked with examining the place of pharmacists in the [[Health care in the United States|American healthcare system]], the state of professional [[Pharmacy school|pharmacy education]] at the time, and the prevalence of [[Prescription drug|prescription]] [[drug misuse]].{{sfn|Millis Commission|p=2}} The Millis Commission recommended "training skilled pharmacy practitioners in research to increase the number and variety of clinical pharmacists,"{{sfn|Report of the Study Commission on Pharmacy|1975|pp=123–125}} who were "equally skilled and trained in a science and in pharmacy practice",{{sfn|Report of the Study Commission on Pharmacy|1975|pp=123–125}} but did not go as far as to explicitly define the term "clinical pharmaceutical scientist" or its educational requirements.{{sfn|Blouin|Cloyd|Ludden|Kroboth|1991|p=257}} Since the Millis Commission, multiple sources have conceptualized clinical pharmaceutical scientists.{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|p=176}} The 2003 edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Clinical Pharmacy'' defines the clinical pharmaceutical scientist as the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;A clinical pharmaceutical scientist is an independent investigator with education and training in pharmacotherapeutics who utilizes contemporary research approaches to generate new knowledge relevant to drug behavior in humans, to therapeutic interventions, and/or to patient outcomes.{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|p=174}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Notable clinical pharmaceutical scientists ===
{{Main|List of pharmacists#Botany and chemistry}}
The [[history of pharmacy]] contains numerous individuals that dabbled in both clinical pharmacy practice and pharmaceutical science. Many major scientific discoveries in pharmacology were by pharmacists, acting as clinical pharmaceutical scientists (although not necessarily recognized by that term). For example, [[Friedrich Sertürner]] was a [[Germans|German]] pharmacist who discovered and isolated the opiate [[morphine]] from [[opium]] in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friedrich Sertürner (1783–1841)|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/friedrichserturner|publisher=[[The Science Museum]]|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The American Pharmacy (1852–2002): A Collection of Historical Essays'' contains a comprehensive history of American pharmacy from the [[Modern history#Late modern period|late modern period]] to the [[contemporary era]]. In his essay ''The Pharmaceutical Sciences in America, 1852–1902'', John Parascandola writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unlike Europe, the United States has never produced practicing pharmacist-scientists of the caliber of [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele|Carl Scheele]] or [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier|Joseph Pierre Pelletier]], who made important discoveries in the laboratories associated with their pharmacies. It should be noted, however, that the sciences were becoming increasingly specialized by the second half of the 19th century, and the tradition of the apothecary-scientist was on the wane even in Europe by this time.&lt;ref name="1852-1902"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parascandola|first1=John|title=American Pharmacy (1852–2002): A Collection of Historical Essays|page=23|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Education and training ==
===Requirements===
A clinical pharmaceutical scientist must have education in both clinical pharmacy and research. Broadly, the clinical pharmaceutical scientist's clinical knowledge is centered around expertise pertaining to pharmacotherapy, with less emphasis on diagnostic skills and nonpharmacologic therapies (e.g. surgery). Clinical pharmaceutical scientists must possess expertise in the pharmaceutical sciences and in the management of drug therapy problems.{{sfn|Blouin|Cloyd|Ludden|Kroboth|1991|p=259}}

To achieve this expertise, clinical pharmaceutical scientists typically pursue education after their professional pharmacy degrees (in the United States, a [[Doctor of Pharmacy|PharmD]] is generally a prerequisite). This can involve a 2–3 year postdoctoral fellowship or pursuing graduate degrees (e.g. MS, PhD).{{sfn|Blouin|Cloyd|Ludden|Kroboth|1991|pp=259–260}} Postdoctoral programs tend to emphasize a specific area of pharmaceutical science for the scientist to specialize in, such as pharmacoepidemiology or pharmacogenetics.{{sfn|Blouin|Cloyd|Ludden|Kroboth|1991|p=261}}

Postdoctoral [[Pharmacy residency|residency]] training is generally recommended, though is not a prerequisite, for most fellowship programs.{{sfn|Blouin|Cloyd|Ludden|Kroboth|1991|p=261}}

Some programs offer combined PharmD-PhD training. While praised as convenient, time saving, and for growing clinical pharmaceutical science, there has also been concern that the intense requirements of graduate research may take precedence over the clinical curriculum and internship/clerkship opportunities of PharmD training.{{sfn|Blouin|Cloyd|Ludden|Kroboth|1991|p=261}} As one candidate wrote in ''Pharmacy Times'', the duration of combined PharmD-PhD programs can vary, usually lasting 7–8 years in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hefti|first1=Erik|title=PharmD PhD Dual-Degree Programs: A Candidate's Perspective on Potential Pitfalls|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/erik-hefti-pharmd-ms/2015/11/pharmd-phd-dual-degree-programs-a-candidates-perspective-on-potential-pitfalls|publisher=Pharmacy &amp; Healthcare Communications, LLC.|accessdate=24 May 2017|date=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Powell, PharmD, of the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] (a division of the [[FDA]]), pharmacists may serve as [[Principal investigator|principal investigators]] (PI's) on clinical trials for investigational [[New drug application|new drug applications]] in the United States, provided that they meet the same requirements that every other PI must meet.&lt;ref name="NIH Conference on Pharmacy Research"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pharm.D. Pathways to Biomedical Research|url=https://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/reports/archivedreports2006-2004/Pages/pharmd_12132006.aspx|publisher=[[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]]|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison===
There are multiple postdoctoral pathways to entering a career as a clinical pharmaceutical scientist. The pathways tend to vary by the time required and the depth of training, with programs of longer duration providing more extensive training.{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|pp=176–177}}

The shortest program is a [[graduate certificate]] in clinical pharmaceutical research, which tend to last one year. These programs provide graduates with the ability to conduct clinical research, though not necessarily design it as principal investigators. Due to the short duration of these programs, there is less time to develop independent research skills.{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|pp=176–177}}

[[Master's degree]] programs in clinical pharmaceutical research typically last 2–3 years, placing more emphasis on designing [[clinical trials]].{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|pp=176–177}}

Fellowship training can also last 2–3 years, though the training is thought to place more emphasis on independence. Because fellowship training can occur in non-academic environments, fellowships can also prepare individuals to begin careers in the [[pharmaceutical industry]] or with federal regulators. Fellowships do not have a [[Curriculum|didactic curriculum]], and can involve additional clinical responsibilities.{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|pp=176–177}}

The longest program is a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in clinical pharmaceutical research, which can last 4–5 years. The goals of PhD programs are the same as fellowship training, though the added time provides an even greater depth in a research area of interest, in addition to supplemental didactic curriculum. PhD programs generally do not mandate any clinical responsibilities,{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|pp=176–177}} though the [[University of Pittsburgh]] School of Pharmacy piloted the addition of a clinical component for their PhD clinical pharmaceutical scientist program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tortorici|first1=Michael A.|last2=Skledar|first2=Susan J.|last3=Zemaitis|first3=Michael A.|last4=Weber|first4=Robert J.|last5=Smith|first5=Randall B.|last6=Kroboth|first6=Patricia D.|last7=Poloyac|first7=Samuel M.|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|date=2007|volume=71|issue=2|title=A Model for Supporting and Training Clinical Pharmaceutical Scientist PhD Students|doi=10.5688/aj710232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Careers ==

===Industry===
Within the [[pharmaceutical industry]], clinical pharmaceutical scientists can pursue careers as "[[Clinical research associate|clinical research officers]]," also known as "project managers."&lt;ref name="Science - RPh in Industry"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hede|first1=Karyn|title=Behind the Scenes, Pharmacists Play Key Role in Clinical Research|journal=Science|date=June 15, 2007|doi=10.1126/science.caredit.a0700085|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2007/06/behind-scenes-pharmacists-play-key-role-clinical-research|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these roles, clinical pharmaceutical scientists are intimately involved with designing, conducting, and consulting on [[clinical trials]] by pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref name="Science - RPh in Industry" /&gt; Postdoctoral pharmacy fellowships with pharmaceutical industry sponsors are traditional gateways for pharmacists to enter the industry.&lt;ref name="Science - RPh in Industry" /&gt; Careers for clinical pharmaceutical scientists within the pharmaceutical industry often involve less clinical work, and are more business and/or research intensive.&lt;ref name="RPS Industry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page|first1=Emma|title=Getting started in the pharmaceutical industry|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/publications/tomorrows-pharmacist/getting-started-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry/20066290.article|publisher=[[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical pharmaceutical scientists work in the areas of drug discovery, drug formulation optimization and pharmacokinetics, pharmacoeconomics, labeling and regulatory compliance, and post-marketing research.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Academia===
Clinical pharmaceutical scientists working in academia must have expertise in what the [[American Pharmacists Association]] calls the "three legs" of academia: scholarship (research), teaching, and service (clinical practice and professional development activities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tran|first1=Deanna|title=Getting Into the .EDU: Tips for Entering Pharmacy Academia|url=https://www.pharmacist.com/getting-edu-tips-entering-pharmacy-academia|publisher=[[American Pharmaceutical Association]]|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical pharmaceutical scientists have expertise in both research and clinical pharmacy, which is conducive to a career that demands those skills. The Commission on the Future of Graduate Education in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, appointed in 1996 by the [[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy]] (AACP), has recommended that more American pharmacy schools develop combined PharmD/PhD programs to train clinical pharmaceutical scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Triggle|first1=David J.|last2=Miller|first2=Kenneth W.|title=Commission on the Future of Graduate Education in the Pharmaceutical Sciences: Final Report|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|date=1999|volume=63|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AACP Educating Clinical Scientists Task Force has recommended that clinical practice be combined with teaching assistantship for first-year students in clinical pharmaceutical science programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blouin|first1=Robert A.|last2=Bergstrom|first2=Richard F.|last3=Ellingrod|first3=Vicki L.|last4=Fletcher|first4=Courtney V.|last5=Leff|first5=Richard D.|last6=Morris|first6=Andrew|last7=Okita|first7=Richard T.|last8=Roberts|first8=Jeanette C.|last9=Tracy|first9=Timothy S.|last10=Sagraves|first10=Rosalie|last11=Miller|first11=Kenneth W.|title=Report of the AACP Educating Clinical Scientists Task Force|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|date=2007|volume=71|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would effectively prepare them for all three domains of academia identified by the American Pharmacists Association above.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Government===
In the United States, clinical pharmaceutical scientists can work as researchers for governmental agencies, such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the [[National Institute of Health]].&lt;ref name="UCI Pharm Science"&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the Pharmaceutical Sciences?|url=http://pharmsci.uci.edu/what-are-the-pharmaceutical-sciences/|publisher=[[University of California, Irvine]]|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private sector===
Clinical pharmaceutical scientists working in the community setting face unique challenges. The private sector is focused on individual profitability, rather than performing academic research and disseminating knowledge for the profession itself.&lt;ref name="PJ 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clinical scientists rather than researchers in pharmacy.|journal=The Pharmaceutical Journal|date=September 22, 2016|volume=297|issue=7893|doi=10.1211/PJ.2016.20201731|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/opinion/editorial/pharmacists-should-be-trained-to-become-clinical-scientists-rather-than-researchers-in-pharmacy/20201731.article|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to both (non-academic affiliated) hospital and community/retail pharmacy practice, where time and funding constraints limit opportunities for individual research.&lt;ref name="PJ 2016" /&gt;

== Research scope ==
The research scope of clinical pharmaceutical scientists can be broken into the fields of preclinical, clinical, outcomes, and translational research, with translation research representing the middle ground between preclinical and clinical research. Subjects of interest to clinical pharmaceutical scientists in their respective field may involve the following:{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|p=175}}
;Preclinical research
*[[Pharmacokinetics]]/[[pharmacodynamics]]/[[pharmacogenomics]]
*[[Drug delivery]]
*[[Drug development]] (''de novo'' drug development, as well as [[Drug repositioning|repurposing drugs]] for novel indications)
*[[Pharmacology]], including research aimed at elucidating [[Mechanism of action|mechanisms of action]]
*[[Assay]] development

;Clinical research
*Clinical research projects, including serving as [[Principal investigator|principal investigators]]
*Researching nuances in clinical practice

;Translational research
*"Translating" research, from "[[Translational research|bench to bedside]]"

;Outcomes research
*[[Pharmacoeconomics]]
*[[Public health]] outcomes
*[[Health policy]] research
*[[Pharmacy practice research]]

== Duties ==
The duties of clinical pharmaceutical scientists can be broadly divided into two categories: scientific and clinical duties:{{sfn|Kroboth|Poloyac|Matzke|2003|p=177}}
;Scientific duties
*[[Grant writing]]
*[[Research ethics]]
*Independent research
*[[Publishing|Dissemination of knowledge]]

In the [[United States]] [[criminal justice]] system, a '''competency evaluation''' is an assessment of the ability of a [[defendant]] to understand and rationally participate in a court process.

[[Competence (law)|Competency]] was originally established by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] as the evaluation of a defendant's competence to proceed to [[trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent ruling, the Court held that any [[prison]]er facing the [[death penalty]] must be evaluated as competent to be [[executed]], meaning that he must be capable of understanding why he has received the [[death penalty]] and the effect that the penalty will have.&lt;ref name="Ford v.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further rulings, competence was also enlarged to include evaluation of the defendant's competence to [[plea]]d guilty and competence to waive the [[right to counsel]].&lt;ref name="godinez"/&gt;

The [[American Bar Association]]'s Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards stated in 1994 that the issue of a defendant's current mental incompetence is the single most important issue in the criminal mental health field, noting that an estimated 24,000 to 60,000 forensic evaluations of a criminal defendant's [[Competence (law)|competency to stand trial]] were performed every year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A 1973 estimate put the number of competence evaluations at 25,000 to 36,000 each year.  There are indications that the number of  evaluations of criminal defendants is rising.  One comparison of estimates between 1983 and 2004 suggest the  annual number rose from  50,000 to  60,000 criminal competency evaluations respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Competence to proceed==
This standard is based on the Supreme Court decision ''[[Dusky v. United States]]''&lt;ref name="scdusky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2877494138671044176|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court affirmed a defendant's right to have a competency evaluation before proceeding to trial. Competence to proceed was defined by the court as the defendant's ability to consult rationally with an attorney to aid in his own defense and to have a rational and factual understanding of the charges.&lt;ref name="scdusky"/&gt;

In this case Dusky presented a petition of [[writ of certiorari]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] requesting that his conviction be reversed on the grounds that he was not competent to stand trial at the time of the proceeding. The court decided to grant the writ, based on a lack of recent evidence that the petitioner was competent at the time of the trial. The case was remanded to the [[United States district court|district court]] for a new hearing to evaluate Dusky's competence to stand trial, and for a new trial if he was found competent.&lt;ref name="scdusky"/&gt;

The case set the current standard for adjudicative competency in the United States. Although the statutes addressing competency vary from state to state in the United States, the two elements outlined in the ''Dusky v. United States'' decision are held in common. The defendant must understand the charges and have the ability to aid his attorney in his own defense.&lt;ref name="grisso"/&gt;

Competency to stand trial is generally determined via a pretrial  evaluation of the defendant's overall [[mental status]] and mental state at the time of the examination. This evaluation aims to provide sufficient information to allow a judge to rule on the competency of the defendant should a motion to that effect be made by either the prosecutor or defense attorney. A judge may also directly rule a defendant incompetent to stand trial without receiving a motion to that effect from counsel.&lt;ref name="grisso"&gt;{{cite book

Who is deemed qualified to conduct a competency evaluation varies from state to state. Originally competency evaluations included a range of tests and assessments. Recently the tendency is to simplify the process by relying upon an interview and, optionally, a [[psychological evaluation]]. There are a number of standardized screening devices that also may be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

A defendant who has been deemed incompetent to stand trial may be required to undergo mental health treatment, including court-ordered hospitalization and the administration of treatment against the defendant's wishes, in an effort to render the defendant competent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10071406451224631321|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Competence to Stand Trial|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-competence-stand-trial|website=ExpertLaw|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competence to be executed==
An additional evaluation is of the competence to be executed, that is the defendant must be capable of understanding why he is being executed and the effect execution will have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|year=1993

|accessdate=2007-10-03

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be competent to be executed  resulted from the outcome of a [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Ford v. Wainwright]]'', in which  a [[Florida]] inmate on [[death row]] took his case to the United States Supreme Court, declaring he was not competent to be executed. He had been evaluated as incompetent but the [[Governor of Florida]] made an [[executive branch]] decision and signed the [[execution warrant|death warrant]] anyway. The court ruled that a [[Forensic psychology|forensic]] professional must make that evaluation and, if the inmate is found incompetent, provide treatment to aid in the inmate gaining competency in order that the execution can take place.&lt;ref name="Ford v. Wainwright 477 U.S. 399"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Providing treatment to an individual to enable that person to become competent to be executed places mental health professionals in an [[ethical dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Medical Association]] takes the position that ethically it is a physician's duty to provide treatment, regardless of the patient's legal situation. Others feel that it unethical to treat a person in order to execute them. Most restorations of competency are accomplished through psychiatric medication.&lt;ref name="melton1997"&gt;{{cite book

==Competence to plead guilty==
It has been estimated that approximately 90 percent of all criminal cases in the United States are settled through guilty [[plea]]s, rather than a [[trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-11-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  ''[[Godinez v. Moran]]'', 1993,  the Supreme Court held that the competency standard for [[plead guilty|pleading guilty]] or waiving the right to [[counsel]] is the same as the competency standard for proceeding to trial as established in ''Dusky v. United States''. A higher standard of competency is not required.&lt;ref name="godinez"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feigning incompetence==
In ''[[United States v. Binion]]'' malingering or feigning illness during a competency evaluation was held to be [[obstruction of justice]] and led to an increased sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waiver of challenge to competency to stand trial==
Where a defendant does not raise the issue of mental competence before trial, the issue of competence may be deemed waived in the event of a conviction and appeal. For example, in ''United States v. Morin''&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Morin'' 338 F.3d 838 (8th Cir. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit]] upheld the defendant's conviction. The court rejected Mr. Morin’s argument, among others, that the district court violated his due process rights  by refusing to allow him to waive competency at trial.  The court held that since his competency to stand trial was never challenged, the issue of whether he was entitled to waive competency to stand trial was properly not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common principles==
Although ''Dusky v. United States''&lt;ref name="scdusky"/&gt; affirmed the right to a competency evaluation, the specifics of the evaluation remain ambiguous. Each evaluator must decide  what is meant by "sufficient present ability" and "has a rational as well as a factual understanding" as set forth in the Dusky decision. One common principle is clear in forensic evaluations, however. Forensic  evaluators cannot reach a finding independent of the facts of the case at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
In 1989, [[Kenneth L. Curtis|Kenneth Curtis]] of [[Stratford, Connecticut]] was initially found mentally incompetent to stand trial following the murder of his estranged girlfriend. But years later, as he had attended college and received good grades, this ruling was reversed, and he was ordered to stand trial.

Within [[agriculture]], '''convertible husbandry''', also known as '''alternate husbandry''', '''[[:wikt:ley|ley]] husbandry''' or '''up-and-down husbandry''', was a process used during the 16th century through the 19th century by "which a higher proportion of land was used to support increasing numbers of livestock in many parts of England."&lt;ref name=broad&gt;Broad, John, "Alternate Husbandry and Permanent Pasture in the Midlands, 1650 – 1800", ''[[The Agricultural History Review]]'', Vol. 28, No. 2, pg 77-78, [[British Agricultural Society]]; 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of historian Eric Kerridge, convertible husbandry consisted of "the floating of water-meadows, the substitution of up-and-down husbandry for permanent tillage and permanent grass or for shifting cultivation, the introduction of new fallow crops and selected grasses, [[marsh]] drainage, manuring, and stock breeding."&lt;ref&gt;Kerridge, Eric, ''The Agricultural Revolution'', Taylor and Francis US; 1967, pg 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Convertible husbandry is considered{{by whom|date=May 2018}} one of the most important changes of the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].

==Description==
Convertible husbandry was a process that consisted of "alternating arable and pasture on a given piece of land…[by doing so]… farmers almost eliminated the need for fallows between their grain crops and were able to control the quality of their pasture by sowing grass seeds."&lt;ref name=broad/&gt; Alternate husbandry has also been praised as the "best way to keep high fertility on both arable and pasture and to retain excellent soil texture and composition."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Slicher van Bath|Slicher van Bath, B.H.]], "Agrarian History of Western Europe", 1963, pp 249-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This system utilized fertilizer in the form of animal manure. [[Fertilizer]] was used in greater quantities due to the increase in animal husbandry and resulted in benefiting crop yields when it was time for tillage.&lt;ref name="Kitsikopoulos, Harry 2004, pp 462-3"&gt;Kitsikopoulos, Harry, "Convertible Husbandry vs. Regular Common Fields: A Model on the Relative Efficiency of Medieval Field Systems", ''[[The Journal of Economic History]]'', Vol. 64, No. 2, June 2004, pp 462-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Convertible husbandry also came with the added benefit of allowing variations in the types of soils and the extent of leys used in rotation because it was a system in which multiple variables could be modified to suit the needs of the location/type of land/type of soil.&lt;ref name="Kitsikopoulos, Harry 2004, pp 462-3"/&gt;

==Historical context==
Before the 16th and 17th centuries, farmlands had mostly been founded on the idea of simple alternations of tilling and fallowing during different seasons over several years. However, as livestock became an increasing staple in the lives of farmers and society alike in the midlands, the "rising population…density of settlements, lack of wastelands into which cultivation could expand…and 15th century enclosures for sheep" all led to a need for an improved system of agriculture that allowed for increasing numbers of livestock and a greater increase in crop output compared to input.&lt;ref name=broad/&gt; "The introduction of up-and-down husbandry…helped solve the problems of the midland by providing a measured pasture and arable rotation which not only produced the same amount of grain on a much reduced area, but broke the agrarian cycle of diminished returns by allowing more sheep and cattle to be kept, animals whose dung maintained the fertility of the arable."&lt;ref name=broad/&gt; Another factor that increased the popularity of convertible husbandry had to do with the fact that skill levels of workers were changing and the skills needed to manage a permanent grassland system were acquired too slowly to respond adequately to the growing demand of the population at the time.&lt;ref name=broad/&gt;

Although debatable, many agricultural historians also believe that the introduction of convertible husbandry was brought about with the introduction of the turnip. They argue that "the lowly turnip made possible a change in crop rotation which did not require much capital, but which brought about a tremendous rise in agricultural productivity."&lt;ref name=timmer&gt;Timmer, C. Peter, "The Turnip, New Husbandry, and The English Agricultural Revolution", ''[[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'', Vol. 83, No. 3 (Aug., 1969), pp. 375-395&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that this "fodder" crop pushed agriculture in a direction in which "alternating" husbandry was seen as more efficient than traditional permanent pasture farming and jump-started the improvement of crop rotation and agricultural output versus capital. Although the turnip was popularized by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]] during the mid-18th century, the use of turnips being grown as fodder was seen as early as the 16th century.&lt;ref name=timmer/&gt;

'''Country food''', in Canada, refers to the  [[traditional diet]]s of [[Aboriginal people in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] (known in Canada as [[First Nations]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]], and [[Inuit]]), especially in remote [[nordicity|northern regions]] where [[Western food]] is an expensive import, and [[traditional food]]s are still relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/sites/enr/files/weights_of_wildlife.pdf "in deriving estimates of the economic value of wildlife used as food (known in northern Canada as country food or traditional food)..." page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of the Northwest Territories estimated in 2015 that nearly half of N.W.T. residents in smaller communities relied on country food for 75% of their meat and fish intake, in larger communities the percentage was lower, with the lowest percentage relying on country foods (4%) being in [[Yellowknife]], the capital and only "large community".  The most common country foods in the NWT's area include mammals and birds (caribou, moose, ducks, geese, seals, hare, grouse, ptarmigan), fish (lake trout, char, inconnu (coney), whitefish, pike, burbot) and berries (blueberries, cranberries, blackberries, cloudberries).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/en/state-environment/183-country-food-use-nwt-ecozones&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eastern Canadian Arctic, Inuit consume a diet of foods that are fished, hunted, and gathered locally. This may include [[caribou]], [[walrus]], [[ringed seal]], [[bearded seal]], [[beluga whale]], [[polar bear]], berries, and [[fireweed]].

The cultural value attached to certain game species, and certain parts, varies.  For example, in the James Bay region, a 1982 study found that beluga whale meat was principally used as dog food, whereas the blubber, or [[muktuk]] was a "valued delicacy".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/sites/enr/files/weights_of_wildlife.pdf page 16&lt;/ref&gt;  Value also varies by age, with Inuit preferring younger ring seals, and often using the older ones for dog food.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, pg 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Contaminants in country foods are a public health concern in Northern Canada; volunteers are tested to track the spread of industrial chemicals from emitters (usually in the South) into the northern food web via the air and water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.myyellowknifenow.com/11118/country-food-contaminants-nwt-residents-undergo-tests/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Government of the N.W.T. committed to using country foods in the soon-to-open Stanton Territorial Hospital, despite the challenges of obtaining, inspecting, and preparing sufficient quantities of wild game and plants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/country-food-stanton-hospital-1.4299598&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southern Canada]], wild foods (especially meats) are actually relatively rare in restaurants, due to [[wildlife conservation]] rules against selling hunted meat, as well as strict [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency|meat inspection rules]].  Therefore there is a [[cultural divide]] between [[rural and remote]] communities that rely on wild foods, and urban Canadians (the majority), who have little or no experience with them.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewalrus.ca/kill-what-you-eat/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2856">'''Dead arm syndrome''' starts with repetitive motion and forces on the posterior capsule of the [[shoulder]]. The posterior capsule is a band of [[fibrous tissue]] that interconnects with [[tendon]]s of the [[rotator cuff]] of the shoulder. Four [[muscle]]s and their tendons make up the rotator cuff. They cover the outside of the shoulder to hold, protect and move the joint.

Overuse can lead to a buildup of tissue around the posterior capsule called [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]. The next step is tightness of the posterior capsule called posterior capsular contracture. This type of problem reduces the amount the shoulder can rotate inwardly.

Over time, with enough force, a tear may develop in the labrum. The labrum is a rim of [[cartilage]] around the shoulder socket to help hold the head of the [[humerus]] (upper arm) in the joint. This condition is called a superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesion. The final outcome in all these steps is the dead arm phenomenon.

The shoulder is unstable and dislocation may come next. Dead arm syndrome will not go away on its own with rest—it must be treated. If there is a SLAP lesion, then [[surgery]] is needed to repair the problem. If the injury is caught before a [[SLAP tear]], then [[physical therapy]] with stretching and exercise can restore it.

It is common among baseball pitchers as they age, and it can also occur with quarterbacks in football and handball players also as they age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16747">'''Disability rights''' are not specifically addressed by legislation in [[New Zealand]]. Instead, disability rights are addressed through human rights legislation. [[Human rights in New Zealand]] are protected by the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] (NZ BORA) and the [[Human Rights Act 1993]]. [[New Zealand]] also signed and ratified the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (CRPD) in 2008.

==International obligations==

===The Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
New Zealand became a member of the [[United Nations]] on October 24, 1945 and was a signatory in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 2].&lt;/ref&gt; says that all human beings are born free and equal with dignity and rights. The Declaration became the standard in judging government conduct in relations to human rights. Although the Declaration started out as having only moral and political authority, unable to create legal obligations like the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/4914/2388/0498/HRNZ_10_International_Human_Rights_Framework.pdf/ Human Rights in New Zealand: International Human Rights Framework].&lt;/ref&gt; its principles are now widely recognized. Today, the Declaration has attained a legal force as being part of the customary law of nations, including New Zealand. In addition, The Declaration has become the authority in interpreting human rights provisions of the United Nations Charter, binding all members.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration'' (1999) 29 Victoria U Wellington L.Rev. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities===
The United Nations assumed the Universal Declaration would be enough in protecting everyone. However, the 650 million people in the world with disabilities, representing 10 percent of the world population, lack opportunities available to the mainstream population. People with disabilities face many physical and social obstacles that prevent them from exercising many of their rights.  Therefore, a convention that deals with disability and the rights of people with disabilities was necessary.

The United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] is the international standard for rights of the people with disabilities. New Zealand ratified the Convention in 2008 and therefore has a legal obligation to respect, promote, and fulfill the rights provided in the Convention. The Convention is aimed at protecting the dignity of people with disabilities and ensuring that they are treated fairly and equally under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/people-disabilities/our-work/crpd/ |title=Human Rights Commission :: Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |publisher=Hrc.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides these individuals with a voice, visibility, and legitimacy as equal human beings in New Zealand and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/people-disabilities/your-rights/|title=Rights for the Disabled - NZ Human Rights|date=2005-07-07|publisher=Hrc.co.nz|accessdate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Convention does not create new rights or entitlements, it expresses existing rights in a way that address the needs and situations of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/questions.shtml#one|title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand ratified the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | Optional Protocol]] to the CRPD on 4 October 2016.

==National legislation==
===The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990===
The [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] (NZ BORA) aimed to affirm, protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM224792.html New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, long title].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the NZ BORA affirms New Zealand’s commitment to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] and provides the right to be free from disability discrimination on the grounds stated in the Human Rights Act 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM224792.html|title=New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite propositions that the NZ BORA has obtained 'constitutional status', it is not supreme law, and it can still be overridden by Acts of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/4914/2388/0498/HRNZ_10_International_Human_Rights_Framework.pdf Human Rights in New Zealand 2010: International Human Rights Framework].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Human Rights Act 1993===
Section 21(1)(h) of the [[Human Rights Act 1993|Act]] makes discrimination based on disability, without lawful justification, unlawful. Section 21(1)(h) of the act defines disability as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html Human Rights Act 1993, section 21(1)(h)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ol type="I"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical disability or impairment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical illness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychiatric illness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectual or psychological disability or impairment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any other loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliance on a guide dog, wheelchair, or other remedial means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presence in the body of organisms capable of causing illness (such as HIV or hepatitis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Disability rights issues in New Zealand==
===Unlawful Discrimination===
Discrimination happens when a person is treated unfairly or less-favourably than other people in the same or similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/1814/2353/9062/Resolving-discrimination-and-harassment.html#_The_Human_Rights Resolving discrimination and harassment].&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination can also occur against the relatives and associates of the people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/people-disabilities/your-rights/ People with Disabilities: Your Rights].&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination is only unlawful if it happens in one of the areas of activity set out in the Act, including employment, education, or government activity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[New Zealand Human Rights Commission]] provided a formula to help determine whether an activity or a practice amounts to unlawful discrimination. The following components must be present for the discrimination to be unlawful:
*Ground + area + disadvantage + absence of exception or justification = unlawful discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/1814/2353/9062/Resolving-discrimination-and-harassment.html#_The_Human_Rights|title=Resolving Discrimination and Harassment|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawful Discrimination===
Lawful justifications of discrimination based on disability exist as well. In relation to employment, a person with a disability can be treated differently if he or she can not perform duties without the help of special services that are unreasonable to expect from the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html|title=Human Rights Act 1993|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the environment where duties are performed poses an unreasonable risk to the person with disability or to those around them, including the risk of infecting others with an illness, then this is considered a lawful justification for discrimination as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html Human Rights Act 1993, section 29(1)(a)].&lt;/ref&gt; However, a justification will not be lawful if the duties can be performed with some adjustment of activities by the employer that does not involve unreasonable disruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html Human Rights Act 1993, section 35].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect discrimination===
The Human Rights Act also protects people from both direct and indirect discrimination. ‘Indirect discrimination’ describes the situation where an apparently neutral practice or condition has a disproportionate, negative impact on one of the groups against whom it is unlawful to discriminate, and the practice or condition cannot be justified objectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/7814/2398/1577/HRNZ_10_Equality_and_freedom_from_discrimination.pdf|title=Indirect discrimination|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities are specifically susceptible to indirect discrimination. For example, indirect discrimination takes place against people who use wheelchairs if the only way to get to a store is by climbing the stairs.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

==Disability protections and awareness initiatives==

===Equal suffrage and by ballot===
The NZ BORA gives a person with disability equal right to vote by [[secret ballot]]. For this to take place, the individual must be over 18 years old and obtain a New Zealand citizenship or permanent residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM224792.html New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, section 12].&lt;/ref&gt; However, he or she can be denied this right in some contexts. For example, a person with disability is disqualified from voting if they have been detained for three or more years for a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM307519.html Electoral Act 1993].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the right to a secret ballot can be compromised when the voter has visual impairment or has difficulty interpreting and reading the ballot. The individual would need assistance in placing their vote, therefore disclosing their preference to another person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/3114/2397/7311/web-Political.pdf Political participation for everyone: disabled people's rights and the political process].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Political Participation for Everyone Report &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/3114/2397/7311/web-Political.pdf Political Participation for Everyone: Disabled People's Rights and the Political Process Report 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; found that New Zealand’s voting and political systems were not designed for everyone, specifically at disadvantage are those with disability. It found that people with disabilities have experienced hurdles in exercising their right to vote and right to participate in political and public life. These hurdles included inaccessible information and voting papers and a lack of physical facilities where people with disabilities can engage with politicians.

In September 20, 2014, New Zealand introduced voting by telephone. For this reason, The United Nations commended the country on its Concluding Observations for enabling people with disabilities to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/327/uncrpd_committee_concluding_observations.pdf?1416967104/ UN's Concluding Observations of the New Zealand Disabled Person's Organisations Report].&lt;/ref&gt;

===General accessibility===
The Human Rights Commission claims that New Zealand is a fully inclusive society that recognises and values people with disability as equal participants.&lt;ref name="Disabled People's Rights Reports"&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/people-disabilities/our-work/disabled-peoples-rights-reports/ Disabled People's Rights Reports].&lt;/ref&gt;  The needs of these individuals are considered integral to the social and economic order and not identified as “special”.&lt;ref name="Disabled People's Rights Reports"/&gt; A full inclusion requires a barrier-free physical and social environment. The Better Design and Buildings for Everyone: Disabled People's Rights and the Built Environment Report 2012 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/4314/2397/6079/web-Builtenv.pdf Better Design and Buildings for Everyone: Disabled People's Rights and the Built Environment Report 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; found that New Zealand’s built environment is rarely designed in considerations of all users. This particularly excludes people with disabilities, approximately 17 to 20 percent of New Zealand's population, from using and accessing facilities and services like buildings, parks and recreation facilities.

===Access to information===
The Better Information for Everyone: Disabled People's Rights in the Information Age Report &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/9414/2397/6962/web-Access.pdf Better Information for Everyone: Disabled People's Rights in the Information Age Report 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; found that information is not accessible to a wide range of people with disabilities. Human rights depend on the accessibility of information, products and services. New Zealand information and communications were found to have often been designed for one kind of end user: an individual who is internet-literate, can see and read in English competently, and lacks learning disabilities.

===Making a complaint===
The Commission is an independent [[Crown entity]] responsible for administering the Human Rights Act 1993 and monitoring the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. An individual can make a complain to the Human Rights Commission if they feel that their human rights have been breached. A complaint can be made in [[sign language]] with interpreters available. In addition, the Commission offers free and confidential services. It can advise complainants on whether the complaint is covered by the Human Rights Act and if the Commission can help through mediation. If mediation does not work, advice can be given on possible legal options.

The Commission also developed guidelines for using disability rights language as a practical tool when referring to people with disability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/people-disabilities/our-work/guide-using-disability-rights-language/ Guide using disability rights language].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word-choice can reflect attitudes toward people with disability. Because of this, the Commission suggested to use [[People-first language|people-centred language]] that recognises a person with disability is, first and foremost, a person. In their view, this is one of the many ways New Zealand can promote and respect the dignity of people with disability in accordance with the Disability Convention.

===Recognition of people with disabilities===
The [[United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities| International Day of Persons with Disabilities]] first started in 1992 and it is celebrated yearly on December 3. The United Nations promotes this day across the world to encourage a better understanding of disability issues. Each year has a different theme. For example, the theme for 2015 was “Inclusion matters: access and empowerment for people of all abilities”, which aimed at ensuring that people with disabilities are empowered to create and use opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idpwd.com.au/theme/ International Day of Persons with Disability Themes].&lt;/ref&gt; At this event, thousands of bright orange wristbands with "Inclusion Matters" written on them were sent out to organisations throughout New Zealand for the day of celebration and acknowledgement. The government of New Zealand believes that by wearing the wristband, "you are calling for the inclusion of disabled people into all areas of life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrc.co.nz/news/be-included-and-include-all-3-dec/ Be included and include all on 3 Dec].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">{{For|the US patent law term "duty of candor"|Inequitable conduct}}
In [[UK public law]], the '''duty of candour''' is  the [[duty]] imposed on a public authority 'not to seek to win [a] litigation at all costs but
to assist the court in reaching the correct result and thereby to improve standards in public administration'.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance on Discharging the Duty of Candour at http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130704203515/http://www.tsol.gov.uk/Publications/Guidance_on_Discharging_the_Duty_of_Candour.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson MR]] in ''R v Lancashire County Council ex p. Huddleston'' &lt;ref&gt;R v Lancashire County Council, ex p Huddleston [1986] 2 All ER 941&lt;/ref&gt; stated that [[public servant]]s should be willing 'to explain fully what has occurred and why'.

There is also a '''contractual duty of candour''' imposed on all [[National Health Service|NHS]] and non-NHS providers of services to NHS patients in the UK to 'provide to the service user and any other relevant person all necessary support and all relevant information' in the event that a 'reportable patient safety incident' occurs. A 'reportable patient safety incident' is one which could have or did result in moderate or severe harm or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themdu.com/guidance-and-advice/guides/statutory-duty-of-candour/statutory-duty-of-candour|title=Statutory duty of candour in secondary care - The MDU|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaigner Will Powell &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mistreatment.com/news/article/campaigner-will-powell-joins-mistreatment-com-legal-duty-of-candour-robbies-law-234/#.VXuhxenJDIU|title=Campaigner Will Powell joins Mistreatment.com- Legal Duty of Candour-‘Robbie’s Law’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; led a campaign for NHS managers and doctors to have a formal 'duty of candour' when dealing with complaints about negligent or poor standards of care in NHS hospitals.

In January 2014 [[David Behan]], chief executive of the [[Care Quality Commission]], threw his weight behind a wide definition for the statutory duty of candour which was recommended by the [[Stafford Hospital scandal inquiry|Francis Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC chief executive backs wider duty of candour|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/cqc-chief-executive-backs-wider-duty-of-candour/5066602.article#.UtLwI7TYXz8|accessdate=12 January 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Government originally intended the duty to be limited to cases of “severe harm” – when a patient had been killed or left permanently disabled, as a wider reporting requirement could inundate organisations with unnecessary bureaucracy.  The CQC estimates there are about 11,000 incidents of severe harm per year, and up to 100,000 incidents of serious harm, although there may be significant under reporting of both. The charity [[Action Against Medical Accidents]] has been campaigning for a wide definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Duty of Candour - 'Robbie's Law'|url=http://www.avma.org.uk/pages/legal_duty_of_candour_-_robbies_law.html|publisher=Action Against Medical Accidents|accessdate=12 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112221215/http://www.avma.org.uk/pages/legal_duty_of_candour_-_robbies_law.html|archivedate=12 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Behan made it clear that he was supporting them.

The experience of powerful emotions has been characterized by researchers as disruptive and dysfunctional, particularly for cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averill|first1=James R.|editor1-last=Leary|editor1-first=David E.|title=Metaphors in the history of psychology|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521421522|pages=104–132|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research also suggests links between emotion-focused coping and poor psychological outcomes. A review of over 100 studies found associations between emotion-focused coping and negative outcomes such as poor [[life satisfaction]], greater [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] and [[Anxiety|anxious]] symptoms and [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt;

However, there is some evidence in the [[Empirical research|empirical]] literature that emotional expression can be functional and adaptive. Experimental research on expressive writing, involving emotional disclosure, has been shown to have benefits for performance on cognitive tasks and for psychological outcomes, such as depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frattaroli|first1=Joanne|title=Experimental disclosure and its moderators: A meta-analysis.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2006|volume=132|issue=6|pages=823–865|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotion regulation has also illustrated the importance of emotional processing and expression for well-being.&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gross|first1=James J.|last2=John|first2=Oliver P.|editor1-last=Gross|editor1-first=James J.|title=Handbook of emotion regulation|date=2013|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=9781462503506|pages=555–568|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapeutic approaches have also demonstrated the important role of emotions in coping with difficult situations. [[Emotionally focused therapy|Emotion-focused therapy]] is a clinical psychology approach that emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and tolerating negative emotions and enjoying positive emotions for healthy psychological adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenberg|first1=Leslie|title=Emotion-focused Therapy: Coaching Clients to Work Through Their Feelings|date=2015|publisher=American Psychological Association|isbn=9781433819957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have attempted to disentangle the maladaptive and functional aspects of emotion-focused coping by examining the measurements of emotion-focused coping. Several studies have found that emotion-focused measurements of coping often aggregate approach and avoidance strategies.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Snyder" /&gt; A second reason emotion-focused coping has been construed as maladaptive is that measures of emotion-focused coping are confounded with measures of [[Distress (medicine)|distress]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Coping through emotional approach: Problems of conceptualizaton and confounding.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.2.350|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 350–362|volume = 66|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.66.2.350|first = Annette L.|last = Stanton|first2 = Sharon|last2 = Danoff-Burg|first3 = Christine L.|last3 = Cameron|first4 = Andrew P.|last4 = Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to rectify these difficulties with the [[operationalization]] of emotion-focused coping, a new scale for assessing emotional approach coping was proposed.&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Assessment of coping through emotional approach ==

Emotional approach coping can be assessed using the emotional approach coping scales developed by Stanton, Kirk, Cameron, and Danoff-Burg in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanton|first1=Annette L.|last2=Kirk|first2=Sarah B.|last3=Cameron|first3=Christine L.|last4=Danoff-Burg|first4=Sharon|title=Coping through emotional approach: Scale construction and validation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2000|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1150–1169|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scales involve two distinct subscales of items: emotional processing and emotional expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotional processing and emotional expression scales are positively correlated but distinct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The emotional processing items reflect an attempt to understand, consider and examine emotions in response to a stressful event. For example, “I acknowledge my feelings” and “I take time to figure out what I’m really feeling.” Emotional expression items assess attempts to verbally and non-verbally communicate and share emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sample items include: “I allow myself to express my feelings” and “I feel free to express my emotions.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The emotional approach coping scales have been tested and validated using situational (i.e., what do you do in response to a specific stressor) and dispositional (i.e., what do you do in general) instruction sets.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Coping Through Emotional Approach: A New Look at Emotion, Coping, and Health-Related Outcomes|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00299.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Personality|date = 2004-12-01|issn = 1467-6494|pages = 1335–1364|volume = 72|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00299.x|first = Jennifer L.|last = Austenfeld|first2 = Annette L.|last2 = Stanton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scales are uncorrelated with social desirability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Multidimensional Structure for Repetitive Thought: What's on Your Mind, and How, and How Much?|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.909|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 909–921|volume = 85|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.909|first = Suzanne C.|last = Segerstrom|first2 = Annette L.|last2 = Stanton|first3 = Lynn E.|last3 = Alden|first4 = Brenna E.|last4 = Shortridge|pmid=14599253}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to English, the emotional approach coping scale has also been validated in Norwegian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotion regulation in patients with rheumatic diseases: validity and responsiveness of the Emotional Approach Coping Scale (EAC)|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/10/107/abstract|journal = BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders|date = 2009-09-03|issn = 1471-2474|pmc = 2749806|pmid = 19728869|pages = 107|volume = 10|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1471-2474-10-107|first = Heidi A.|last = Zangi|first2 = Andrew|last2 = Garratt|first3 = Kåre B.|last3 = Hagen|first4 = Annette L.|last4 = Stanton|first5 = Petter|last5 = Mowinckel|first6 = Arnstein|last6 = Finset}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Turkish Validation of the Emotional Approach Coping Scale|last = Durak|first = Mihat|date = 2011|journal = Psychological Reports|doi = 10.2466/02.08.20.21|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Senol-Durak|first2 = Emre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical support ==

=== Longitudinal research ===

====Infertility====
Among heterosexual couples coping with [[infertility]], emotional approach coping predicted decreased depressive symptoms for both members of the couple after an unsuccessful insemination attempt.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Emotional approach coping may also confer benefits for partners. Having a male partner high in emotional approach coping was protective against depressive symptoms for female partners low in emotional approach coping.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Sexual assault====
Emotional approach coping may confer some benefits to victims of [[sexual assault]]. Among sexual assault survivors, increases in emotional expression were associated with greater perceived control over the recovery process and feelings of control were associated with decreased distress after the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Correlates of Levels and Patterns of Positive Life Changes Following Sexual Assault.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.72.1.19|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 19–30|volume = 72|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.72.1.19|first = Patricia|last = Frazier|first2 = Ty|last2 = Tashiro|first3 = Margit|last3 = Berman|first4 = Michael|last4 = Steger|first5 = Jeffrey|last5 = Long|pmid=14756611|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breast cancer====
There is mixed evidence for the utility of emotional approach coping in samples of women with [[breast cancer]]. In a longitudinal study of women with breast cancer, for women who perceived their social environments to be receptive, emotional expression predicted improved quality of life.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Coping through emotional expression among women with breast cancer has also been found to predict an increase in [[Posttraumatic growth|post-traumatic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Posttraumatic growth after breast cancer: Patient, partner, and couple perspectives|last = Manne|first = S.|date = 2004|journal = Psychosomatic Medicine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Ostroff|first2 = J.|last3 = Winkel|first3 = G.|last4 = Goldstein|first4 = L.|last5 = Fox|first5 = K.|last6 = Grana|first6 = G.|pages = 442–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have not found the same link between emotional expression and post-traumatic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Curvilinear associations between benefit finding and psychosocial adjustment to breast cancer.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.74.5.828|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 828–840|volume = 74|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.74.5.828|first = Suzanne C.|last = Lechner|first2 = Charles S.|last2 = Carver|first3 = Michael H.|last3 = Antoni|first4 = Kathryn E.|last4 = Weaver|first5 = Kristin M.|last5 = Phillips|pmid=17032087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cross-sectional research ===

==== Student and community samples ====

Cross-sectional studies illustrate the link between emotional approach coping and positive psychological adjustment, under certain conditions in student and community samples. In a cross-sectional study of undergraduate women, women who scored more highly on emotional approach coping reported more positive and less negative valenced repetitive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Episodic repetitive thought: dimensions, correlates, and consequences|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2011.608126|journal = Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1061-5806|pmc = 3237825|pmid = 21861772|pages = 3–21|volume = 25|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/10615806.2011.608126|first = Suzanne C.|last = Segerstrom|first2 = Annette L.|last2 = Stanton|first3 = Sarah McQueary|last3 = Flynn|first4 = Abbey R.|last4 = Roach|first5 = Jamie J.|last5 = Testa|first6 = Jaime K.|last6 = Hardy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a community sample of African-American adults, emotional approach coping has also been found to be negatively associated with anger, trait anxiety and depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Relationship of Racism, Chronic Stress Emotions, and Blood Pressure|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1547-5069.2006.00108.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Nursing Scholarship|date = 2006-09-01|issn = 1547-5069|pages = 234–240|volume = 38|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1547-5069.2006.00108.x|first = Rosalind M.|last = Peters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, women who reported higher dispositional emotional processing also reported fewer depressive and anxious symptoms and greater life satisfaction; while for men, higher dispositional emotional expression was linked to greater life satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Clinical samples ====

There is some evidence to suggest associations between emotional approach coping and psychological well-being. In a study of individuals who met [[DSM-IV]] criteria for anxiety disorder and healthy controls, levels of emotional approach coping were lower in those individuals who met the criteria than in controls.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Comparison of Emotional Approach Coping (EAC) between Individuals with Anxiety Disorders and Nonanxious Controls|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2009.00080.x/abstract|journal = CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics|date = 2009-06-01|issn = 1755-5949|pages = 100–106|volume = 15|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1755-5949.2009.00080.x|first = Luana|last = Marques|first2 = Rebecca E.|last2 = Kaufman|first3 = Richard T.|last3 = LeBeau|first4 = Samantha J.|last4 = Moshier|first5 = Michael W.|last5 = Otto|first6 = Mark H.|last6 = Pollack|first7 = Naomi M.|last7 = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examined veterans and found that higher levels emotional expression (but not emotional processing) were associated with lower depressive symptoms and decreased [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], even when statistically controlling for age, gender, and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of emotional approach coping and hope on PTSD and depression symptoms in a trauma exposed sample of Veterans receiving outpatient VA mental health care services|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2011.621948|journal = Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping|date = 2012-09-01|issn = 1061-5806|pmid = 22059938|pages = 559–573|volume = 25|issue = 5|doi = 10.1080/10615806.2011.621948|first = Christina M.|last = Hassija|first2 = Jane A.|last2 = Luterek|first3 = Kristin|last3 = Naragon-Gainey|first4 = Sally A.|last4 = Moore|first5 = Tracy|last5 = Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cancer samples ====

Cross-sectional research of cancer samples reveals some positive, negative and mixed links with emotional approach coping. Higher emotional processing and emotional expression in female cancer survivors was associated with higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional approach coping: Gender differences on psychological adjustment in young to middle-aged cancer survivors|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2012.762979|journal = Psychology &amp; Health|date = 2013-08-01|issn = 0887-0446|pmid = 23391312|pages = 874–894|volume = 28|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/08870446.2012.762979|first = Dalnim|last = Cho|first2 = Crystal L.|last2 = Park|first3 = Thomas O.|last3 = Blank}}&lt;/ref&gt; In male cancer survivors, higher emotional processing has been linked to higher positive emotions and higher emotional expression has been linked with lower negative emotions and fewer intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the links between emotional approach coping and psychological adjustment are not all positive some are negative or mixed. In one study of women who had received an abnormal result on an ovarian cancer screen, higher emotional processing was associated with higher intrusive thoughts and neither emotional processing nor emotional expression were associated with cancer-related [[Posttraumatic growth|post-traumatic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Response to an abnormal ovarian cancer-screening test result: Test of the social cognitive processing and cognitive social health information processing models|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08870440903437034|journal = Psychology &amp; Health|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 0887-0446|pmc = 2911487|pmid = 20419561|pages = 383–397|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/08870440903437034|first = Michael A.|last = Andrykowski|first2 = Edward J.|last2 = Pavlik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diabetes samples ====
There is from cross-sectional research that suggests the benefits of emotional processing for patients with diabetes. Among patients with [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], higher emotional processing was associated with greater diabetes-related knowledge, [[Compliance (medicine)|medication adherence]] and relevant self-care behaviors such as diet, physical activity and [[Blood glucose monitoring|blood glucose]] monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Associations between coping, diabetes knowledge, medication adherence and self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 diabetes|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163834312001016|journal = General Hospital Psychiatry|pmc = 3383912|pmid = 22554428|pages = 385–389|volume = 34|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2012.03.018|first = Brittany L.|last = Smalls|first2 = Rebekah J.|last2 = Walker|first3 = Melba A.|last3 = Hernandez-Tejada|first4 = Jennifer A.|last4 = Campbell|first5 = Kimberly S.|last5 = Davis|first6 = Leonard E.|last6 = Egede}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in adolescent patients with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes]], emotional processing was revealed to be associated with better metabolic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Processing and Self-Control in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes|url = http://jpepsy.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/8/925|journal = Journal of Pediatric Psychology|date = 2012-09-01|issn = 0146-8693|pmc = 3437683|pmid = 22523404|pages = 925–934|volume = 37|issue = 8|doi = 10.1093/jpepsy/jss062|first = Amy E.|last = Hughes|first2 = Cynthia A.|last2 = Berg|first3 = Deborah J.|last3 = Wiebe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors that determine effectiveness ==

=== Stressor-coping strategy fit ===
The stressor and the individual's appraisal of the stressor may determine the effectiveness of emotional approach coping as a mechanism for managing stress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An appraisal of a stressful situation as uncontrollable may make emotional approach coping an advantageous coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt; In fact, one study of undergraduates shows that when faced with a stressor individuals appraise as more uncontrollable, they are more likely to endorse using emotional approach coping to manage it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Appraisal-Coping Goodness of Fit: A Daily Internet Study|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/30/5/558|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2004-05-01|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 15107156|pages = 558–569|volume = 30|issue = 5|doi = 10.1177/0146167203262855|first = Crystal L.|last = Park|first2 = Stephen|last2 = Armeli|first3 = Howard|last3 = Tennen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
There is some evidence to suggest that the utility of emotional approach coping varies by [[gender]].&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt; In a longitudinal study, emotional approach coping was found to predict increased life satisfaction and decreased depressive symptoms over time in women; however, in men, emotional approach coping predicted poorer adjustment over time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some samples have also found that women report using emotional processing and expression more than men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, research of infertile couples found no differences in the utility of emotional approach coping for men and women.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Adjustment to a dyadic stressor: A longitudinal study of coping and depressive symptoms in infertile couples over an insemination attempt.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.70.2.433|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 433–438|volume = 70|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.70.2.433|first = James P.|last = Berghuis|first2 = Annette L.|last2 = Stanton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual differences ===
Individual differences, such as skill at engaging active coping techniques and comfort with expressing emotions, may modify the tendency to successfully employ emotional approach coping.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt; Individuals high in perceived emotional intelligence may also be more likely to use emotional approach coping skillfully.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt; Holding unrealistic perceptions of control may make the use of coping through emotional approach less likely because expressing and processing emotions could lead to evaluations that result in acknowledgement of illusions of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Individuals Believe They Can and Cannot Do: Explorations of Realistic and Unrealistic Control Beliefs|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327752jpa8202_9|journal = Journal of Personality Assessment|date = 2004-04-01|issn = 0022-3891|pmid = 15080132|pages = 215–232|volume = 82|issue = 2|doi = 10.1207/s15327752jpa8202_9|first = Miron|last = Zuckerman|first2 = C. Raymond|last2 = Knee|first3 = Suzanne C.|last3 = Kieffer|first4 = Marylene|last4 = Gagne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality attributes, such as hope, can also moderate the effectiveness of emotional approach coping. Women with breast cancer who were high in hope and reported coping with emotional expression, had fewer medical appointments for cancer-related complaints, enhanced physical health and decreased distress compared to women who did not cope using emotional expression.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotionally expressive coping predicts psychological and physical adjustment to breast cancer.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.68.5.875|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 875–882|volume = 68|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.68.5.875|first = Annette L.|last = Stanton|first2 = Sharon|last2 = Danoff-Burg|first3 = Christine L.|last3 = Cameron|first4 = Michelle|last4 = Bishop|first5 = Charlotte A.|last5 = Collins|first6 = Sarah B.|last6 = Kirk|first7 = Lisa A.|last7 = Sworowski|first8 = Robert|last8 = Twillman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

=== Goal identification and pursuit ===
The effects of emotional approach coping could be the result of identifying goals, understanding barriers to achieving those goals, and finding new pathways to achieve them.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt; Emotional expression and processing could help individuals direct attention to identify the most important goals in their lives.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt;

=== Habituation to the stressor and cognitive appraisal ===
The effects of emotional approach coping could also be due to exposure to stressful stimuli when actively processing and expressing emotions.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt; The repeated exposure to the stressor could result in physiological [[habituation]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Repeated exposure to a stressor through emotional expression and processing could also lead to [[cognitive reappraisal]] of the stressor and related [[self-affirmation]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does Self-Affirmation, Cognitive Processing, or Discovery of Meaning Explain Cancer-Related Health Benefits of Expressive Writing?|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/33/2/238|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2007-02-01|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 17259584|pages = 238–250|volume = 33|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0146167206294412|first = J.

=== Affect labeling ===
The process of labeling the emotions (i.e., putting them into words) may lessen the intensity of the emotional experience. Studies have shown the process of affective labeling leads to decreases in brain regions such as the [[amygdala]] and increases in activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], possibly indicating beneficial emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The common and distinct neural bases of affect labeling and reappraisal in healthy adults|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00221/abstract|journal = Emotion Science|date = 2014-01-01|pmc = 3970015|pmid = 24715880|pages = 221|volume = 5|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00221|first = Lisa Jane|last = Burklund|first2 = J. David|last2 = Creswell|first3 = Michael|last3 = Irwin|first4 = Matthew|last4 = Lieberman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulation of social environment ===
The use of emotional approach coping may signal to the social environment that an individual is in need of support.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt; The responsiveness of the social environment will determine the adaptiveness of emotional approach coping. Emotional expression that is met with empathetic concern may lead to better adjustment than emotional expression met by rejection.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some evidence from the research suggests this could be a potential mechanism. For women with breast cancer who perceive their social environment to be highly receptive, coping through emotional expression predicts improved quality of life.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

It supports and conducts [[research]] aimed at improving the health of children, adults, families, and communities, including:
*Reducing infant deaths
*Promoting healthy pregnancy and childbirth
*Investigating growth and [[Human development (biology)|human development]]
*Examining problems of [[birth defect]]s and [[intellectual disabilities|intellectual and developmental disabilities]]
*Understanding reproductive health

==History==
The impetus for NICHD came from the Task Force on the Health and Well-Being of Children, convened in 1961 and led by Dr. Robert E. Cooke, a senior medical advisor to President [[John F. Kennedy]]. [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] also served on the task force, which reported that more research was needed on the physical, emotional, and intellectual growth of children.

The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] established NICHD in 1962 as the first NIH institute to focus on the entire life process rather than on a specific disease or body system. NICHD became a funding source for research on birth defects and intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs), created a new pediatrics specialty, and established IDDs as a field of research. The institute also focused on the idea that adult health has its origins in early development and that behavior and social science were important aspects of human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/Pages/establishment.aspx|title=Establishment of the NICHD|website=www.nichd.nih.gov|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2007, by act of Congress (Public Law 110-54), NICHD was renamed the ''Eunice Kennedy Shriver'' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in honor of Mrs. Shriver's vision, dedication, and contributions to the founding of the institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/eks_030308.cfm NICHD Renamed for Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Advocate for Institute's Founding]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The [[Mission statement|mission]] of NICHD is to ensure that every person is born healthy and wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability, and to ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/mission/Pages/index.aspx|title=NICHD Mission and Scientific Accomplishments|website=www.nichd.nih.gov|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
As of November 2016, the director of NICHD is [[Diana W. Bianchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/Pages/083016_drbianchi.aspx|title=NIH names Dr. Diana Bianchi director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|website=www.nichd.nih.gov|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICHD’s budget in 2015 was an estimated $1.3 billion, which supported research at institutions, universities, and organizations throughout the world, as well as research conducted by NICHD scientists on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD, and at other facilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11029">The '''European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)''' study is a [[Europe]]-wide prospective [[cohort study]] of the relationships between [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[cancer]], as well as other chronic diseases, such as [[cardiovascular disease]]. With over half a million participants, it is the largest study of diet and disease to be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrc1298| title = Diet and cancer — the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition| journal = Nature Reviews Cancer| volume = 4| issue = 3| pages = 206–15| year = 2004| last1 = Bingham | first1 = S. | last2 = Riboli | first2 = E. | url = http://www.angelfire.com/scary/lancelot/pdf/diet_and_cancer.pdf | pmid=14993902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPIC is coordinated by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), part of the [[World Health Organization]], and funded by the "Europe Against Cancer" programme of the [[European Commission]] as well as multiple nation-specific grants and charities.

521,457 healthy adults, mostly aged 35–70 years, were enrolled in 23 centres in ten European countries: [[Denmark]] (11%), [[France]] (14%), [[Germany]] (10%), [[Greece]] (5%), [[Italy]] (9%), [[The Netherlands]] (8%), [[Norway]] (7%), [[Spain]] (8%), [[Sweden]] (10%) and the [[United Kingdom]] (17%). One UK centre (Oxford) recruited 27,000 [[vegetarian]]s and [[vegan]]s; this subgroup forms the largest study of this dietary group. Recruitment to the study took place between 1993 and 1999, and follow up is planned for at least ten years, with repeat interview/questionnaires every three to five years. The main prospective data collected are standardised dietary [[questionnaire]]s (self-administered or interview-based), seven-day food diaries, blood samples and [[anthropometric]] measurements, such as [[body mass index]] and [[Waist-hip ratio|waist-to-hip ratio]]. Additionally, the GenAir [[case-control study]] is studying the relationship of [[passive smoking]] and [[air pollution]] with cancers and [[respiratory disease]]s.

Up to 2004, there were over 26,000 new cases of cancer recorded among participants, with the most common being cancers of the breast, colorectum, prostate and lung. Current analyses are focusing particularly on [[stomach cancer|stomach]], [[colorectal cancer|colorectal]], [[breast cancer|breast]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]] and [[lung cancer|lung]] cancers. The different dietary patterns in the different countries should enable reliable associations to be made between particular diets and cancers. The analysis of stored blood samples should also allow dissection of genetic factors involved in cancers, as well as the effects of [[hormone]]s and hormone-like factors.

== Key findings ==
The study and its analysis is ongoing, but [http://www.srl.cam.ac.uk/epic/findings key results] of the study retrieved in 2008 are:
*Lowered sodium from [[salt]] intake, high potassium from [[fruit]] and vegetable consumption promote healthy blood pressure levels
*High physical activity, involving some high impact activities is a good indicator of longevity and low risk of bone fractures
*High [[dietary fiber|dietary fibre]] protects against [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]]
*Obesity increases a number of cancer risks
*High levels of sex hormones increase risk of breast cancer
*Increased fat intake increases the risk of breast cancer
*Increases in eating fruit and vegetables reduces the risk from all causes of an early death
*High blood glucose levels are associated with increased risk of heart disease
*The combined impact of four behaviours – not smoking, being physically active, moderate alcohol intake and the consumption of at least five fruit and vegetable servings a day – was estimated to amount to 14 additional years of life (Khaw ''et al.'' 2008)

Subsequent findings from 2012 and 2013 are:
*Dietary [[flavonoid]] intake is [[association (statistics)|associated]] with reduced [[gastric carcinoma]] risk in women but not men&lt;ref name="pmid23076618"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zamora-Ros R, Agudo A, Luján-Barroso L, Romieu I, Ferrari P, Knaze V, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Leenders M, Travis RC, Navarro C, Sánchez-Cantalejo E, Slimani N, Scalbert A, Fedirko V, Hjartåker A, Engeset D, Skeie G, Boeing H, Förster J, Li K, Teucher B, Agnoli C, Tumino R, Mattiello A, Saieva C, Johansson I, Stenling R, Redondo ML, Wallström P, Ericson U, Khaw KT, Mulligan AA, Trichopoulou A, Dilis V, Katsoulis M, Peeters PH, Igali L, Tjønneland A, Halkjær J, Touillaud M, Perquier F, Fagherazzi G, Amiano P, Ardanaz E, Bredsdorff L, Overvad K, Ricceri F, Riboli E, González CA | title=Dietary flavonoid and lignan intake and gastric adenocarcinoma risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | year=2012 | volume=96 | issue=6 | pages=1398–1408 | pmid=23076618 | doi=10.3945/ajcn.112.037358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:Deep gastric ulcer.png|thumb|A peptic ulcer may accompany gastritis. [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|Endoscopic image]].]]
Many people with gastritis experience no symptoms at all. However, [[epigastrium|upper central]] [[abdominal pain]] is the most common symptom; the pain may be dull, vague, burning, aching, gnawing, sore, or sharp.&lt;ref name="eMed"&gt;{{cite news | title=Gastritis Symptoms | year=2008 | publisher=eMedicineHealth | url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/gastritis/article_em.htm | work= | pages= | accessdate=2008-11-18 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206065449/http://www.emedicinehealth.com/gastritis/article_em.htm | archivedate=2008-12-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain is usually located in the upper central portion of the [[human abdomen|abdomen]],&lt;ref name='NIH Publication No. 05–4764'&gt;{{cite news | title=Gastritis | date=December 2004 | publisher=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases | url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gastritis/ | work=National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse | pages= | accessdate=2008-10-06 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011181514/http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gastritis | archivedate=2008-10-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it may occur anywhere from the upper left portion of the abdomen around to the back.

Other signs and symptoms may include the following:
*[[Nausea]]
*[[Vomiting]] (may be clear, green or yellow, blood-streaked or completely bloody depending on the severity of the stomach [[inflammation]])
*[[Belching]] (does not usually relieve stomach pain if present)
*[[Bloating]]
*[[Hunger (motivational state)|Early satiety]]&lt;ref name="eMed" /&gt;
*[[Anorexia (symptom)|Loss of appetite]]
*[[Weight Loss|Unexplained weight loss]]

== Cause ==
Common causes include ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' and [[NSAIDs]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NID2013/&gt; --&gt; Less common causes include [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[cocaine]], severe illness and [[Crohn disease]], among others.&lt;ref name=NID2013/&gt;

===''Helicobacter pylori''===
''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' colonizes the stomachs of more than half of the world's population, and the infection continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastroduodenal diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with ''Helicobacter pylori'' results in the development of chronic gastritis in infected individuals, and in a subset of patients chronic gastritis progresses to complications (e.g., ulcer disease, [[stomach cancer]]s, some distinct extragastric disorders).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kandulski A, Selgrad M, Malfertheiner P |title=Helicobacter pylori infection: a clinical overview |journal=Digestive and Liver Disease |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=619–26 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18396114 |doi=10.1016/j.dld.2008.02.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over 80 percent of individuals infected with the bacterium are [[asymptomatic]] and it has been postulated that it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Blaser| first1 = M.

===Critical illness===
Gastritis may also develop after major surgery or traumatic injury ("[[Cushing ulcer]]"), burns ("[[Curling's ulcer|Curling ulcer]]"), or severe infections. Gastritis may also occur in those who have had weight loss surgery resulting in the [[Adjustable gastric band|banding]] or reconstruction of the digestive tract.

===Diet===
Evidence does not support a role for specific foods including spicy foods and coffee in the development of [[peptic ulcers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Raphael Rubin|editor2=David S. Strayer|editor3=Emanuel Rubin|title=Rubin's pathology : clinicopathologic foundations of medicine|date=2012|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781605479682|page=623|edition=Sixth|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wb2TzY9AgJ0C&amp;pg=PA623|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150147/https://books.google.ca/books?id=wb2TzY9AgJ0C&amp;pg=PA623|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them.&lt;ref name=Hold2012/&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==

===Acute===
Acute erosive gastritis typically involves discrete foci of surface necrosis due to damage to mucosal defenses.&lt;ref name=merckgastritis&gt;{{cite news | title=Gastritis | date=January 2007 | publisher=Merck | url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec02/ch013/ch013c.html | work= | pages= | accessdate=2009-01-11 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125094521/http://merck.com/mmpe/sec02/ch013/ch013c.html | archivedate=2009-01-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NSAIDs inhibit [[cyclooxygenase-1]], or COX-1, an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of [[eicosanoids]] in the stomach, which increases the possibility of [[peptic ulcer]]s forming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dajani EZ, Islam K |title=Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicity of selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors in man |journal=J Physiol Pharmacol |volume=59 Suppl 2 |pages=117–33 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18812633 |url=http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/0808_s2/pdf/117_0808_s2_article.pdf |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=Level C |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, NSAIDs, such as aspirin, reduce a substance that protects the stomach called [[prostaglandin]]. These drugs used in a short period are not typically dangerous. However, regular use can lead to gastritis.&lt;ref name=Siegelbaum&gt;{{cite news | first=Jackson | last=Siegelbaum | title=Gastritis | year=2006 | publisher=Jackson Siegelbaum Gastroenterology | url=http://www.gicare.com/pated/ecdgs46.htm | work= | pages= | accessdate=2008-11-18 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216012309/http://www.gicare.com/pated/ecdgs46.htm | archivedate=2008-12-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, severe physiologic stress ("stress ulcers") from sepsis, hypoxia, trauma, or surgery, is also a common etiology for acute erosive gastritis. This form of gastritis can occur in more than 5% of hospitalized patients.

Also, note that alcohol consumption does not cause chronic gastritis.  It does, however, erode the mucosal lining of the stomach; low doses of alcohol stimulate [[hydrochloric acid]] secretion. High doses of alcohol do not stimulate secretion of acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolff G |title=[Effect of alcohol on the stomach] |language=German |journal=Gastroenterol J |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=45–9 |year=1989 |pmid=2679657 |trans-title=Effect of alcohol on the stomach }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic===
[[Chronic gastritis]] refers to a wide range of problems of the gastric tissues.&lt;ref name=merckgastritis/&gt;  The immune system makes proteins and antibodies that fight infections in the body to maintain a [[homeostatic]] condition.  In some disorders the body targets the stomach as if it were a foreign protein or pathogen; it makes antibodies against, severely damages, and may even destroy the stomach or its lining.&lt;ref name=Siegelbaum/&gt;  In some cases bile, normally used to aid digestion in the small intestine, will enter through the [[pyloric valve]] of the stomach if it has been removed during surgery or does not work properly, also leading to gastritis.  Gastritis may also be caused by other medical conditions, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Crohn's disease]], certain [[connective tissue disease|connective tissue disorders]], and [[liver failure|liver]] or [[renal failure|kidney failure]]. Since 1992, chronic gastritis lesions are classified according to the Sydney system.&lt;ref name='DS00488'&gt;{{cite news | author=Mayo Clinic Staff | title=Gastritis | date=April 13, 2007 | publisher=MayoClinic | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gastritis/DS00488/DSECTION=causes | work= | pages= | accessdate=2008-11-18 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208050321/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gastritis/DS00488/DSECTION%3Dcauses | archivedate=December 8, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metaplasia====
Mucous gland [[metaplasia]], the reversible replacement of differentiated cells, occurs in the setting of severe damage of the gastric glands, which then waste away ([[atrophic gastritis]]) and are progressively replaced by mucous glands. Gastric ulcers may develop; it is unclear if they are the causes or the consequences.  Intestinal metaplasia typically begins in response to chronic mucosal injury in the [[antrum]], and may extend to the body. Gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa and may even assume absorptive characteristics. [[Intestinal metaplasia]] is classified histologically as complete or incomplete. With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides. In incomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits [[dysplasia]].&lt;ref name=merckgastritis/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Often, a diagnosis can be made based on the patient's description of their symptoms, but other methods which may be used to verify gastritis include:
*Blood tests:
**[[Complete blood count|Blood cell count]]
**Presence of ''H. pylori''
**[[Liver]], [[kidney]], [[gallbladder]], or [[pancreas]] functions
*[[Urinalysis]]
*Stool sample, to look for blood in the stool
*X-rays
*Endoscopy, to check for stomach lining inflammation and mucous erosion
*Stomach biopsy, to test for gastritis and other conditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Exams and Tests | year=2008 | publisher=eMedicinHealth | url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/gastritis/page3_em.htm | work= | pages= | accessdate=2008-11-18 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211013501/http://www.emedicinehealth.com/gastritis/page3_em.htm | archivedate=2008-12-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[Antacid]]s are a common treatment for mild to medium gastritis.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zajac|first1=P|last2=Holbrook|first2=A|last3=Super|first3=ME|last4=Vogt|first4=M |title=An overview: Current clinical guidelines for the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and management of dyspepsia|journal=Osteopathic Family Physician |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=79–85 |date=March–April 2013 |pmid=|doi=10.1016/j.osfp.2012.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; When antacids do not provide enough relief, medications such as [[H2 antagonist|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; blockers]] and [[proton-pump inhibitors]] that help reduce the amount of acid are often prescribed.&lt;ref name="Overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18457460"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boparai V, Rajagopalan J, Triadafilopoulos G |title=Guide to the use of proton pump inhibitors in adult patients |journal=Drugs |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=925–47 |year=2008 |pmid=18457460 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200868070-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytoprotective agents are designed to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fashner|first1=J|last2=Gitu|first2=AC|title=Diagnosis and Treatment of Peptic Ulcer Disease and H. pylori Infection.|journal=American Family Physician|date=15 February 2015|volume=91|issue=4|pages=236–42|pmid=25955624}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include the medications [[sucralfate]] and [[misoprostol]]. If [[NSAID]]s are being taken regularly, one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken. Another cytoprotective agent is [[bismuth subsalicylate]] {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.

Several regimens are used to treat ''H. pylori'' infection. Most use a combination of two [[antibiotics]] and a proton pump inhibitor. Sometimes bismuth is added to the regimen.

==History==
In 1,000 A.D, [[Avicenna]] first gave the description of stomach cancer. In 1728, German physician [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] first coined the term "gastritis". Italian anatomical pathologist [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]] further described the characteristics of gastric inflammation. He described the characteristics of erosive or ulcerative gastritis and erosive gastritis. Between 1808 and 1831, French physician [[François-Joseph-Victor Broussais]] gathered information from the autopsy of the dead French soldiers. He described chronic gastritis as "Gastritide" and erroneously believed that gastritis was the cause of [[ascites]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[meningitis]]. In 1854, [[Charles Handfield Jones]] and [[Wilson Fox]] described the microscopic changes of stomach inner lining in gastritis which existed in diffuse and segmental forms. In 1855, [[Carl von Rokitansky|Baron Carl von Rokitansky]] first described [[hypertrophy|hypetrophic]] gastritis. In 1859, British physician, [[William Brinton]] first described about [[acute (medicine)|acute]], [[subacute]], and [[chronic condition|chronic]] gastritis. In 1870, Samuel Fenwick noted that [[pernicious anemia]] causes glandular [[atrophy]] in gastritis. German surgeon, Georg Ernst Konjetzny noticed that gastric ulcer and gastric cancer are the result of gastric inflammation. [[Shields Warren]] and Willam A. Meissner described the [[intestinal metaplasia]] of the stomach as a feature of chronic gastritis.&lt;ref name="Guyula 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gyula |first1=Mozsik |title=Current Topics in gastritis |date=16 January 2013 |publisher=University of Pécs |isbn=978-953-51-0907-5 |pages=1–19 |url=https://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/41544.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2018 |chapter=Chapter 1: Diagnosis of Gastritis – Review from Early Pathological Evaluation to Present Day Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gastrophysics''' (gastronomical physics) is an emerging interdisciplinary science that employs principles from [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] to attain a fundamental understanding of the worlds of [[gastronomy]] and [[cooking]]. Gastrophysical topics of interest includes investigations of the raw materials of food, the effects of food preparation, and quantitative aspects of the physical basis for food quality, [[flavour]], appreciation and absorption in the human body.&lt;ref name=Mouritsen2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouritsen|first1=Ole G|title=The emerging science of gastrophysics and its application to the algal cuisine|journal=Flavour|date=2012|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6|doi=10.1186/2044-7248-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =MouritsenRisbo2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouritsen|first1=Ole G|last2=Risbo|first2=Jens|title=Gastrophysics-do we need it?|journal=Flavour|date=2013|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1186/2044-7248-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gastrophysics is a scientific discipline that focuses on investigations of aspects of [[gastronomy]] and [[cooking]] that relates to phenomena, which can be described and explained in a frame of [[physics]], [[physical chemistry]], [[chemistry]], and associated sciences.&lt;ref name=Mouritsen2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=G. Mouritsen|first1=Ole|title=Gastrophysics of the Oral Cavity|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=27 April 2016|volume=22|issue=15|pages=2195–2203|doi=10.2174/1381612822666160219120940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of inspiration for gastrophysics is [[gastronomy]] and [[cooking]]. Gastrophysical studies has a gastronomic observation as its starting point, and aims at unravelling the scientific nature of the observations on many different length scales, including explaining physical and chemical aspects of the raw materials, of their transformations during the preparation of food, as well as of the [[Sensory perception|sensory]] response while eating &lt;ref name=MouritsenRisbo2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vilgis|first1=Thomas A|title=Texture, taste and aroma: multi-scale materials and the gastrophysics of food|journal=Flavour|date=2013|volume=2|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/2044-7248-2-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical and physical composition and properties of raw food materials are important for the transformations that occur in the food during preparation (heating, cooling, mixing, beating, [[fermenting]], [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[drying]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], [[souring]] etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGee|first1=Harold|title=On food and cooking : the science and lore of the kitchen|date=2004|publisher=Scribner|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0684800012|edition=Completely rev. and updated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myhrvold|first1=Nathan Myhrvold with Chris Young and Maxime Bilet ; photography by Ryan Matthew Smith and Nathan|title=Modernist cuisine : the art and science of cooking|date=2011|publisher=Cooking Lab|location=Bellevue, Wash.|isbn=0982761007|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flavour]] ([[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]]), [[mouthfeel]], [[chemesthesis]], [[astringency]] are all determinants for the sensory evaluation of food, and these characteristics are also related to the chemical properties and the physical texture of the food, and to how the food is transformed in the mouth.&lt;ref name=Mouritsen2016 /&gt; Gastrophysics deals with each of these components and aims at uncovering their mutual relations i.e. how the sensory input relates to the material composition and properties of food, and the absorption in the human body.

Gastrophysics is a scientifically inspired approach to gastronomy, but it is a science in its own right, and not a discipline to service chefs in creating new dishes. Gastrophysics focuses on gaining fundamental scientific insight to gastronomy and understanding universal phenomena, without removing any of the craft, creativity, and art characteristics of cooking.&lt;ref name=MouritsenRisbo2013 /&gt;

The relation between gastrophysics and [[gastronomy]], can be seen analogous to the relation between [[astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name=Barham2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barham|first1=Peter|title=Physics in the kitchen|journal=Flavour|date=2013|volume=2|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/2044-7248-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Astronomers]] observe planets and stars, and describe where they are and how they move. [[Astrophysicists]] explain why the planets and stars are where they are, and how they got there.&lt;ref name=Barham2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keeler|first1=James E.|title=The Importance of ASTROPHYSIC4L Research and the Relation of Astrophysics to Other Physical Sciences.|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=October 1897|volume=6|pages=271|doi=10.1086/140401|bibcode=1897ApJ.....6..271K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, gastrophysics aims at explaining the universal scientific nature of [[gastronomy]].

== Methodology ==
Whereas gastrophysics is a relatively new discipline within the physical sciences, the foundation for exploring the kind of soft matter that food is, is already well-established in other areas of modern physics. The methodology of gastrophysics greatly overlaps with e.g. (molecular) [[biophysics]], [[soft matter physics]], [[material physics]], [[physical chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]] etc. This holds for both experimental, theoretical and phenomenological approaches. Gastrophysics leans on state-of-art technologies both experimentally and computationally.&lt;ref name=Mouritsen2012 /&gt;
	 
== History ==
It is unknown when the term gastrophysics was first coined, but it appears to have been independently proposed as a physics approach to gastronomy in the labs of the physicist [[Nicholas Kurti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=W. Graham|journal=Nature|date=17 December 1998|volume=396|issue=6712|pages=632–632|doi=10.1038/25257|bibcode=1998Natur.396..632R}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Barham]],&lt;ref name=Barham2013 /&gt; and [https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_G._Mouritsen Ole G. Mouritsen].&lt;ref name=Mouritsen2016 /&gt; 
	In order to conceptualise the term “Gastrophysics”, the first international symposium on the topic: “The emerging science of gastrophysics” was held in Copenhagen in 2012, bringing together key actors. One conclusion of the symposium was that gastrophysics could significantly impact gastronomy and tomorrow’s food sciences, and how both develop in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=MouritsenRisbo2013 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10131">'''Genetic epidemiology''' is the study of the role of [[genetics|genetic]] factors in determining health and disease in families and in populations, and the interplay of such genetic factors with environmental factors. Genetic epidemiology seeks to derive a statistical and quantitative analysis of how genetics work in large groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fundamentals of Genetic Epidemiology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VC7BAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 1993-01-01|isbn = 9780195052886|language = en|first = Muin J.|last = Khoury|first2 = Terri H.|last2 = Beaty|first3 = Bernice H.|last3 = Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The use of the term ''Genetic epidemiology'' emerged in the mid 1980s as a new scientific field.

In formal language, genetic epidemiology was defined by [[Newton Morton]], one of the pioneers of the field, as "a science which deals with the [[etiology]], distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives and with inherited causes of disease in populations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Morton |first= N. E. |date=1982 | title=Outline of Genetic Epidemiology |publisher=Karger| location= New York| isbn=3-8055-2269-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely allied to both [[molecular epidemiology]] and [[statistical genetics]], but these overlapping fields each have distinct emphases, societies and journals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One definition of the field closely follows that of [[Behavioural genetics|behavior genetics]], defining genetic epidemiology as "the scientific discipline that deals with the analysis of the familial distribution of traits, with a view to understanding any possible genetic basis", and that "seeks to understand both the genetic and environmental factors and how they interact to produce various diseases and traits in humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Genetic Epidemiology Defined|url = http://www.biostat.wustl.edu/gems/definition.shtml|website = www.biostat.wustl.edu|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMJ: British Medical Journal|BMJ]] adopts a similar definition, "Genetic epidemiology is the study of the aetiology, distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives and of inherited causes of disease in populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic epidemiology|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/320/7244/1257|journal = BMJ|date = 2000-05-06|issn = 0959-8138|pmid = 10797040|pages = 1257–1259|volume = 320|issue = 7244|doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7244.1257|language = en|first = Jaakko|last = Kaprio|pmc=1117994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As early as the 4th century BC, [[Hippocrates]] suggested in his essay “On Airs, Waters, and Places” that factors such as behavior and environment may play a role in disease. Epidemiology entered a more systematic phase with the work of [[John Graunt]], who in 1662 tried to quantify mortality in London using a statistical approach, tabulating various factors he thought played a role in mortality rates. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] is considered to be the father of epidemiology, and was the first to use statistics to discover and target the cause of disease, specifically of cholera outbreaks in 1854 in London. He investigated the cases of cholera and plotted them onto a map  identifying the most likely cause of cholera, which was shown to be contaminated water wells.

=== Modern history ===
Modern genetics began on the foundation of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work. Once this became widely known, it  spurred a revolution in studies of hereditary throughout the animal kingdom; with studies showing genetic transmission and control over characteristics and traits. As gene variation was shown to affect disease, work began on quantifying factors affecting disease, accelerating in the 20th century. The period since the second world war saw the greatest advancement of the field, with scientists such as [[Newton Morton]] helping form the field of genetic epidemiology as it is known today, with the application of modern genetics to the statistical study of disease, as well as the establishment of large-scale epidemiological studies such as the [[Framingham Heart Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice - An Introduction to Applied Epidemiology and Biostatistics|last = |first = |publisher = U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 1, 7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, epidemiology played a part in strategies for the worldwide eradication of naturally occurring smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epidemiology in the Global Eradication of Smallpox|url = http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/1/25|journal = International Journal of Epidemiology|date = 1972-03-20|issn = 0300-5771|pmid = 4669176|pages = 25–30|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/ije/1.1.25|language = en|first = D. A.|last = Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Traditionally, the study of the role of genetics in disease progresses through the following study designs, each answering a slightly different question:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorak.info/epi/genetepi.html |title=Introduction to Genetic Epidemiology | author= M. Tevfik Dorak | date=2008-03-03| accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Familial aggregation]] studies: Is there a genetic component to the disease, and what are the relative contributions of genes and environment?
* [[Genetic segregation|Segregation]] studies: What is the [[dominance relationship|pattern of inheritance]] of the disease (e.g. dominant or recessive)?
* [[Genetic linkage|Linkage]] studies: On which part of which [[chromosome]] is the disease gene located?
* [[Genetic association|Association]] studies: Which [[allele]] of which gene is associated with the disease?

This traditional approach has proved highly successful in identifying [[monogenic disorder]]s and locating the genes responsible.

More recently, the scope of genetic epidemiology has expanded to include common diseases for which many genes each make a smaller contribution ([[polygenic disorder|polygenic]], [[multifactorial or multigenic disorder]]s). This has developed rapidly in the first decade of the 21st century following completion of the [[Human Genome Project]], as advances in [[genotyping]] technology and associated reductions in cost has made it feasible to conduct large-scale [[genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] that genotype many thousands of [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s in thousands of individuals. These have led to the discovery of many [[genetic polymorphism]]s that influence the risk of developing many common diseases.

== Approaches ==
Genetic epidemiological research follows 3 discreet steps, as outlined by M.Tevfik Dorak''':'''
# Establishing that there is a genetic component to the disorder.
# Establishing the relative size of that genetic effect in relation to other sources of variation in disease risk (environmental effects such as intrauterine environment, physical and chemical effects as well as behavioral and social aspects).
# Identifying the gene(s) responsible for the genetic component.
These research methodologies can be assessed through either family or population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTRODUCTION TO GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY [M.Tevfik DORAK]|url = http://www.dorak.info/epi/genetepi.html|website = www.dorak.info|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerhard Fischer''' (20 September 1921 – 3 July 2006) was a German diplomat, ambassador and humanitarian who received the 1997 [[Gandhi Peace Prize]] in recognition of his work for [[leprosy]] and [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]-afflicted patients in India.&lt;ref name="Rotarian 1999-02" /&gt;

Born in [[Oslo]], Fischer grew up in China and studied medicine at [[Beijing Medical University]], where he gained experience as a volunteer with leprosy patients. When he was forced to abandon the course by the Japanese occupation, he travelled to Germany intending to study medicine there, but instead was obliged to fight in [[World War II]], then was held as a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] in France.&lt;ref name="Chennai Online" /&gt; After the war, he obtained a law degree and entered the German diplomatic service.

While at the German consulate in [[Madras]], he helped a German doctor to establish a leprosy treatment and rehabilitation centre at Chettipatty. He was also instrumental in setting up the [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras|Indian Institute of Technology]] in Madras,&lt;ref name="Chennai Online" /&gt; which was founded with financial and technical support from the [[West Germany|West German]] government.&lt;ref name="IITM History" /&gt; He later became ambassador to Malaysia, Ireland, Netherlands, and finally Switzerland.

He resigned from the diplomatic service in order to devote himself full-time to the support of leprosy and polio patients in India. Fischer regarded rehabilitation as the most important aspect of his work, and emphasised the need for attitudes to leprosy to change. His work was recognised by the Indian government with the award of the Gandhi Peace Prize. Fischer used the money from the prize to set up a foundation for his humanitarian work.

== Early life and education ==
Fischer was born in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], the elder son of a Norwegian mother and a German father, [[Martin Fischer (sinologist)|Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="Muthiah 2006-10-16" /&gt; When he was about 3 years old, his family moved to China, where his father was a [[sinologist]]. As a boy, Fischer had always wanted to be a doctor. He started to study medicine at [[Beijing Medical University]], but was forced to abandon the course when the University was closed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese occupation]]. So he decided to travel—via [[Siberia]]—to Germany, intending to study medicine there, but was instead compelled to fight in [[World War II|"another huge war"]], a situation he regarded as a "trap".&lt;ref name="rediff - part 1" /&gt; He spent five years fighting in the war, mainly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], followed by two years nine months as a prisoner of war. Destitute after the war, studying medicine was out of the question. He worked as a truck driver and various other jobs, and after three years had saved enough money to study again.&lt;ref name="rediff - part 2" /&gt; He entered a legal [[crammer]], and in one year obtained a law degree, a course that normally requires four years' study.

While studying medicine in Beijing, he volunteered to look after leprosy patients (an opportunity offered to all medical students there, in the days before [[Alexander Fleming|Fleming]] and modern [[antibiotics]]). From then on, he wanted to care for leprosy patients.&lt;ref name="rediff - part 2" /&gt;

== Diplomatic career ==
With a law degree in hand, he decided to join the German foreign service, as that would take him overseas.&lt;ref name="rediff - part 2" /&gt; In 1952–1953 he completed his training for the higher diplomatic and consular service in [[Speyer]], Rhineland-Palatinate, passing the final exam in 1953. He began his career at the German [[legation]] in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], followed by a posting to the consulate in Hong Kong from 1957 to 1960, when he took over the consulate in Madras. In 1963 he was promoted to [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], and in 1964 returned to the [[Bonn]] headquarters of the Foreign Office (''[[Auswärtiges Amt]]''). He was appointed to the rank of Councillor (''Vortragender Legationsrat'') in 1966 and from 1968 headed a political department there, becoming a First Councillor (''Vortragender Legationsrat Erster Klasse'') shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt;

His first appointment as Ambassador came in 1970, when he represented [[West Germany]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia. In March 1974 he was promoted to lead a large department in the Foreign Office dealing with Asia and Latin America. His second ambassadorial appointment came in July 1977, when he was sent to [[Dublin]], followed by further appointments to [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] (early 1980) and [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]] (mid-1983). In December 1985, only six months before reaching his normal retirement age, he resigned from the diplomatic service in order to devote more time to leprosy paients in India.&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt;

Fischer later said that taking a European posting, after his service in [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and [[India]] was a "mistake".&lt;ref name="rediff - part 2" /&gt;

== Work with leprosy and polio patients ==
As well as volunteering with leprosy patients during his medical training in Beijing, Fischer had also looked after leprosy patients in his free time at [[Addis Ababa]] and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt;

Fischer's work with leprosy patients in India began in 1960, when he was German [[Consul-General]] in Madras (now [[Chennai]]), in [[Tamil Nadu]].
A German doctor, [[Elizabeth Vomstein]], had asked for his help in obtaining a work permit so that she could work with a French nun she had heard of who was helping leprosy patients in Chettipatty, near [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]]. Fischer successfully helped her get the work permit, then drove with her to Chettipatty. Fischer remained in post in Tamil Nadu for four years, during which time he regularly visited Vomstein's station in Chettipatty, which she slowly built up to what he regarded as a "model station".&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt;

After resigning from the diplomatic service in 1985, Fischer regularly spent six months each year in India, and six months in the summer with his wife at their small farm near [[Chiemsee]], a lake in [[Bavaria]]. His wife, Ann, ran the administration, fund-raising and publicity for Fischer's work. They had decided not to have "an administration", so Fischer and his wife did everything on their own. Fischer said that his wife "deserves half this prize" (the Gandhi Peace Prize).&lt;ref name="rediff - part 1" /&gt;

Until 1991 he worked with Elizabeth Vomstein at her station in Chettipatty. He found her "very, very difficult", but said, "If she wasn't that type, she wouldn't have lasted 38 years."&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt; By 1991, he had had enough, and started out on his own.&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt; He had already built his own leprosy station in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]], and in the following years he established health centres, workshops and schools throughout India, building wells and latrines, and obtaining Jeeps, minibuses and other supplies. He was also involved with projects in [[Nepal]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt;

Fischer regarded curing leprosy as the easy part, with modern medicines, good treatment and good food.&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt; Much more important to Fischer was rehabilitation,&lt;ref name="heart - The Hindu" /&gt; which he regarded as his primary aim. He recognised that patients with missing legs or fingers would have no chance of surviving outside his stations. So he trained them in skills to earn a living, such as making [[chappal]]s, table cloths, mats, bed covers, beautiful carpets, and so on. He hoped to reach a position where his stations would no longer need donations, but could survive on their production.&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt;

=== Polio ===
Fischer's leprosy treatment, rehabilitation and vocational training centres also cared for polio victims. By 2005, new polio cases had been greatly reduced, thanks to vaccination and joint efforts between the Indian government and NGOs. As a result, Fischer's centres were able to take on additional responsibilities in other areas. But Fischer stressed the need for medical practitioners in the primary health centres to maintain a watch over polio and leprosy, and to be trained in recognising the symptoms.&lt;ref name="Fischer back - The Hindu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marathon - The Hindu" /&gt;

=== Attitudes to leprosy ===
Fischer insisted that his patients should never be called "lepers", but rather "leprosy patients". Although he stated that he believed in ''[[karma]]'', he condemned the consequent fatalism of, and inaction towards, leprosy patients in India, saying "It is not their fault. It is the bloody bug that caught them." He felt that they were outcasts who needed attention. In his Gandhi peace prize acceptance speech at the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], he said, "Don't treat us like outcasts. Don't treat us like the forgotten. We are also here in this country although you don't care about us."&lt;ref name="rediff - part 2" /&gt; Many visitors to his stations couldn't face the physically horrible nature of the disease, but Fischer said that it was far worse mentally to be an outcast from one's family and community. He said, "If you work in a leprosy community, the mental anguish is supreme and it is no different for me."&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt;

Fischer would touch all his patients, saying ''Nalla thane irukku'' ("You are all right"). He never wore a mask or gloves, as he thought the "human side" of his work was very important, that there should be no barriers, and that there was "no difference between us, two human beings".&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt;

=== "Leprosy is curable" ===
Fischer said, "I need publicity. I want to beat the drum, Leprosy is curable. Come and watch. Forget about the stigma. Forget about treating them as outcasts. Here I am constantly shouting to make the community aware and this Prize gives me a chance to focus the attention on 'us' who are forgotten."&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt;

=== Importance of early treatment ===
Fischer always emphasised the importance of early treatment. Patients were reluctant to admit that they might have leprosy, because of the fear of being thrown out of their family and community. Fischer said, "If you get early treatment, nobody can see that you ever had leprosy. This message is very important."&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt;

== Gandhi peace prize ==
Fischer received the Indian government's [[Gandhi Peace Prize]] for 1997 in New Delhi on 5 January 1998 from the President of India, [[K. R. Narayanan]]. The selection committee was unanimous in its decision to award the prize to Fischer.&lt;ref name="Rotarian 1999-02" /&gt; The prize carried an award of 10&amp;nbsp;million [[Indian rupee|rupees]], which Fischer used to set up a foundation for his humanitarian work.&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt; In his acceptance speech at the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], the official residence of the [[President of India]], Fischer said, "It is not enough to have compassion, ''[[Daya (Sikhism)|daya]]'', ''[[karuṇā]]'', and pity for the leprosy patients. We lepers, we don't care about compassion. We want action."&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt; Referring to the government slogan of "eradicating leprosy by 2000", he said that his speech made people such as [[Sonia Gandhi]], who were sitting in the front of the audience, very uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="rediff - part 3" /&gt;

== Death ==
Fischer died in [[Copenhagen]] on 3 July 2006, aged 84 years.&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt; On 8 July 2006, a silent procession was organised at [[Ayikudi]] as a mark of respect.&lt;ref name="tributes - The Hindu" /&gt; N.S. Rao, a former colleague of Fischer at the German consulate in Madras, said that Fischer "applied a missionary zeal to anything he put his mind to. He and his wife were a perfect two-people team and worked all over the country with tremendous energy and indefatigable enthusiasm. After his wife's death, he had been carrying on his social work relentlessly."&lt;ref name="Obit - The Hindu" /&gt; Rao added that Fischer's daughter, Karen Fischer Koch, carried on her father's work after his death.&lt;ref name="Muthiah 2006-10-16" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''HELLP syndrome''' is a [[complication of pregnancy]] characterized by [[hemolysis|'''h'''emolysis]], [[elevated liver enzymes|'''e'''levated '''l'''iver enzymes]], and a [[thrombocytopenia|'''l'''ow '''p'''latelet count]].&lt;ref name=GARD2018&gt;{{cite web |title=HELLP syndrome |url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/8528/hellp-syndrome |website=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program |accessdate=5 October 2018 |language=en |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually begins during the last three months of pregnancy or shortly after [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name=GARD2018/&gt; Symptoms may include feeling tired, retaining fluid, headache, nausea, upper right [[abdominal pain]], blurry vision, [[nosebleed]]s, and [[seizures]].&lt;ref name=GARD2018/&gt; Complications may include [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), [[placental abruption]], and [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=GARD2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=GARD2018/&gt; Usually it occurs in association with [[preeclampsia]] or [[eclampsia]].&lt;ref name=GARD2018/&gt; Other risk factors include previously having the syndrome, a mother older than 25 years, and being [[White people|white]].&lt;ref name=GARD2018/&gt; Diagnosis is generally based on blood tests finding signs of red blood cell break down ([[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] greater than 600 U/L), an [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] greater than 70 U/L, and platelets of less than 100x10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L.&lt;ref name=Har2009/&gt; If not all the criteria are present the condition is incomplete.&lt;ref name=Har2009/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Treatment generally involves delivery of the baby as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=GARD2018/&gt; This is particularly true if the pregnancy is beyond 34 weeks of [[gestation]].&lt;ref name=Har2009/&gt; Medications may be used to decrease blood pressure and [[blood transfusion]]s may be required.&lt;ref name=GARD2018/&gt; [[Corticosteroids]] may be used to speed development of the babies lungs, if it is early in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Har2009/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
HELLP syndrome occurs in about 0.7% of pregnancies and affects about 15% of women with eclampsia or severe preeclampsia.&lt;ref name=Mer2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Preeclampsia and Eclampsia |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/preeclampsia-and-eclampsia#v813330 |website=Merck Manuals Consumer Version |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Har2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Haram K, Svendsen E, and Abildgaard U| title=The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management.

==Signs and symptoms==
The first signs of HELLP start appearing midway through the [[third trimester]], though the signs can appear in earlier and later stages.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt; Symptoms vary in severity and between individuals and are commonly mistaken with normal pregnancy symptoms, especially if they are not severe.&lt;ref name="ref26"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Visser W, Wallenburg HC | title=Temporising management of severe pre-eclampsia with and without the HELLP syndrome | journal=Br J Obstet Gynaecol | volume =102 | issue = 2 | pages = 111–7 | date = February 1995 | pmid= 7756201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HELLP syndrome patients suffer from general discomfort followed by severe [[epigastric pain]] or right upper abdominal quadrant pain, accompanied by [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[backache]], anaemia, and [[hypertension]]. Some patients may also suffer from a [[headache]] and visual issues. These symptoms may also become more severe at night time.&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref27"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Sibai BM| title=he HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets): much ado about nothing? | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =162 | issue = 2 | pages = 311–6| date = February 1990 | pmid= 2309811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref28"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Weinstein L| title=It has been a great ride: The history of HELLP syndrome | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =193 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 860–3 | date = September 2005 | pmid= 16150288 | doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2005.06.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref29"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Aarnoudse JG, Houthoff HJ, Weits J, Vellenga E, Huisjes HJ| title=A syndrome of liver damage and intravascular coagulation in the last trimester of normotensive pregnancy.

==Risk factors==
Elevated [[body mass index]] (BMI) and [[metabolic disorders]], as well as, antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome ([[Antiphospholipid syndrome|APLS]]) significantly increase the risk of HELLP syndrome in all female patients. Females who have had or are related to a female with previous HELLP syndrome complications tend to be at a higher risk in all their subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref name="ref18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref33"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Habli M, Eftekhari N, Wiebracht E, Bombrys A, Khabbaz M, How H, Sibai B| title=Long-term maternal and subsequent pregnancy outcomes 5 years after hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =201 | issue = 4 | pages = 385 e1–5 | date = October 2009 | pmid= 19716544 | doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2009.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref34"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hupuczi P, Rigo B, Sziller I, Szabo G, Szigeti Z, Papp Z| title=Follow-up analysis of pregnancies complicated by HELLP syndrome | journal=Fetal Diagn Ther | volume =21 | issue = 6 | pages = 519–22 | date = 2006 | pmid= 16969007 | doi=10.1159/000095665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of HELLP syndrome is not conclusively associated with a specific genetic variation, but it is likely that a combination of genetic variations, such as ''[[Fas receptor|FAS]]'' gene, ''[[VEGF]]'' gene, ''[[glucocorticoid receptor]]'' gene and the ''tol-like receptor'' gene, increase the risk.&lt;ref name="ref33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref35"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Sziller I, Hupuczi P, Normand N, Halmos A, Papp Z, Witkin SS| title=Fas (TNFRSF6) gene polymorphism in pregnant women with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets and in their neonates | journal=Obstet Gynecol | volume =107 | issue = 3 | pages = 582–7| date = March 2009 | pmid= 16507928 | doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000195824.51919.81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref36"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Nagy B, Savli H, Molvarec A, Varkonyi T, Rigo B, Hupuczi P, Rigo J Jr| title=Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms in HELLP syndrome patients determined by quantitative real-time PCR and melting curve analyses | journal=Clin Chim Acta | volume =389 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 126–31 | date = 2006 | pmid= 18167313 | doi=10.1016/j.cca.2007.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref37"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Bertalan R, Patocs A, Nagy B, Derzsy Z, Gullai N, Szappanos A | title=Overrepresentation of BclI polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in pregnant women with HELLP syndrome | journal=Clin Chim Acta | volume =405 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 148–52 | date = July 2009 | pmid= 19336230 | doi=10.1016/j.cca.2009.03.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref38"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=van Rijn BB, Franx A, Steegers EA, de Groot CJ, Bertina RM, Pasterkamp G | title=Maternal TLR4 and NOD2 gene variants, pro-inflammatory phenotype and susceptibility to early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome | journal=PLoS One | volume =3 | issue = 4 | pages = e1865 | date = April 2008 | pmid= 18382655 | pmc=2270909  | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology is still unclear and an exact cause is yet to be found. However, it shares a common mechanism, which is [[endothelial cell]] injury, with other conditions, such as [[acute renal failure]] and [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]].&lt;ref name="ref9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Geary M | title=The HELLP syndrome | journal=Br J Obstet Gynaecol | volume =104  | issue = 8 | pages = 877–91 | date = August 1997 | pmid=9255078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Sibai BM, Kustermann L, Velasco J| title=DCurrent understanding of severe preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet syndrome, and postpartum acute renal failure: different clinical syndromes or just different names? | journal=Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens | volume =3  | issue = 4 | pages = 436–45 | date = July 1994 | pmid=8076148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the understanding of HELLP syndrome’s pathophysiology will enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially in the early stages. This will lead to advancements in the prevention, management, and treatment of the condition, which will increase the likelihood of both maternal and fetal survival and recovery.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref11"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Benedetto C, Marozio L, Tancredi A,Picardo E,Nardolillo P, Tavella AM, Salton L| title=Biochemistry of HELLP syndrome | journal=Adv Clin Chem | volume =53| pages = 85–104 | date = 2011 | pmid=21404915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflammation and coagulation===
As a result of endothelial cell injury, a cascade of pathological reactions manifests and become increasingly severe and even fatal as signs and symptoms progress. Following endothelial injury, vasospasms and platelet activation occur alongside the decreased release of the [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] and increased the release of [[von Willebrand factor]] ([[Von Willebrand factor|vWF]]), leading to general activation of the [[coagulation]] cascade and [[inflammation]]. Placental components, such as inflammatory [[cytokines]] and [[syncytiotrophoblast]] particles interact with the maternal immune system and endothelial cells, further promoting coagulation and inflammation.&lt;ref name="ref12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Gardiner C, Tannetta DS, Simms CA, Harrison P, Redman CW, Sargent IL| title=Syncytiotrophoblast microvesicles released from pre-eclampsia placentae exhibit increased tissue factor activity | journal=PLoS One | volume =6  | issue = 10 | pages = e26313 | date = 2011 | pmid= 22022598 | pmc=3194796 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0026313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref13"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hulstein JJ, van Runnard Heimel PJ, Franx A, Lenting PJ, Bruinse HW, Silence K, de Groot PG, Fijnheer R| title=Acute activation of the endothelium results in increased levels of active von Willebrand factor in hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome | journal=PLoS One | volume =4 | issue = 12 | pages = 2569–75 | date = December 2006| pmid= 16968329 | doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.02205.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions also elevate leukocyte numbers and interleukin concentrations, as well as increase complement activity.&lt;ref name="ref14"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Terrone DA, Rinehart BK, May WL, Moore A, Magann EF, Martin JN Jr| title=SLeukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity: evidence for an inflammatory form of preeclampsia | journal=South Med J | volume =93  | issue = 8 | pages = 768–71 | date = August 2000 | pmid= 10963506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Haeger M, Unander M, Norder-Hansson B, Tylman M, Bengtsson A | title=Complement, neutrophil, and macrophage activation in women with severe preeclampsia and the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count | journal=Obstet Gynecol | volume =79  | issue = 1 | pages = 19–26 | date = January 1992 | pmid= 1727579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low platelet count===
vWF degradation in HELLP syndrome is inhibited due to decreased levels of degrading proteins, leading to an increased exposure of [[platelets]] to vWF. As a result, [[thrombotic microangiopathies]] develop and lead to [[thrombocytopenia]].&lt;ref name="ref16"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Lattuada A, Rossi E, Calzarossa C, Candolfi R, Mannucci PM | title=Mild to moderate reduction of a von Willebrand factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS-13) in pregnant women with HELLP microangiopathic syndrome | journal=Haematologica | volume =88  | issue = 9 | pages = 1029–34 | date = September 2003 | pmid= 12969811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood breakdown===
As a result of the high number of angiopathies, the [[erythrocytes]] fragment as they pass through the blood vessels with damaged endothelium and large [[fibrin]] networks, leading to macroangiopathic [[haemolytic anaemia]]. As a consequence of hemolysis, [[lactic acid dehydrogenase]] (LDH) and [[hemoglobin]] are released, with the latter binding to serum [[bilirubin]] or [[haptoglobin]].&lt;ref name="ref17"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Sibai BM | title=Diagnosis, controversies, and management of the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count | journal=Obstet Gynecol | volume =103  | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = 981–91 | date = May 2004 | pmid= 15121574| doi= 10.1097/01.AOG.0000126245.35811.2a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref18"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Lachmeijer AM, Arngrimsson R, Bastiaans EJ, Frigge ML, Pals G, Sigurdardottir S, Stefansson H, Palsson B, Nicolae D, Kong A, Aarnoudse JG, Gulcher JR, Dekker GA, ten Kate LP, Stefansson K | title=A genome-wide scan for preeclampsia in the Netherlands | journal=Eur J Hum Genet | volume =9  | issue = 10 | pages = 758–64 | date = October 2001 | pmid= 11781687 | doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liver===
During the coagulation cascade, fibrin is deposited in the liver and leads to hepatic sinusoidal obstruction and [[vascular congestion]], which increase intrahepatic pressure. Placenta-derived FasL ([[CD95L]]), which is toxic to human [[hepatocytes]], leads to hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis by inducing the expression of [[TNFα]] and results in the release of liver enzymes. Hepatic damages are worsened by the disrupted portal and total hepatic blood flow that result as a consequence of the microangiopathies. Collectively, widespread endothelial dysfunction and hepatocellular damage result in global hepatic dysfunction often leading to liver [[necrosis]], haemorrhages, and capsular rupture.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Weinstein L | title=Syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count: a severe consequence of hypertension in pregnancy | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =142 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–67 | date = January 1982 | pmid = 7055180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref19"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Norwitz ER, Hsu CD, Repke JT | title=Acute complications of preeclampsia | journal=Clin Obstet Gynecol | volume =45  | issue = 2 | pages = 308–29 | date = June 2002 | pmid= 12048392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref20"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stevenson JT, Graham DJ |title=Hepatic hemorrhage and the HELLP syndrome: a surgeon's perspective |journal=Am Surg |volume=61 |issue=9 |pages=756–60 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7661469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis ==
===Diagnosis===
Early and accurate diagnosis, which relies on laboratory tests and imaging exams, is essential for treatment and management and significantly reduces the morbidity rate. However, diagnosis of the syndrome is challenging, especially due to the variability in the signs and symptoms and the lack of consensus amongst healthcare professionals. Similarities to other conditions, as well as normal pregnancy features, commonly lead to misdiagnosed cases or more often, delayed diagnosis.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref11" /&gt;

There is a general consensus regarding the main three diagnostic criteria of HELLP syndrome, which include [[hepatic dysfunction]], thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia in patients suspected to have preeclampsia. 
* A [[blood smear]] will often exhibit abnormalities, such as [[schistocytes]], bur cells, and [[helmet cells]], which indicate erythrocyte damage.  
* Thrombocytopenia, which is the earliest [[coagulopathy]] present in all HELLP syndrome patients, is indicated by low platelet count (below 100 x 109 L-1) or by testing the levels of fibrin metabolites and [[antithrombin III]]. 
* Elevated serum levels of certain proteins, in particular, LDH, [[alanine transaminase]] (ALT) and [[aspartate transaminase]] (AST), are indicative of hepatic dysfunction. Extremely high serum levels of these proteins, specifically LDH levels &gt; 1,400 IU/L, AST levels &gt; 150 IU/L and ALT levels &gt; 100 IU/L, significantly elevate the risk of maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Har2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref39"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Martin JN Jr, Rinehart BK, May WL, Magann EF, Terrone DA, Blake PG | title=The spectrum of severe preeclampsia: comparative analysis by HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet count) syndrome classification | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =180 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1373–84 | date = June 1999 | pmid= 10368474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref40"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Martin JN Jr, Rose CH, Briery CM | title=Understanding and managing HELLP syndrome: the integral role of aggressive glucocorticoids for mother and child | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =195 | issue = 4 | pages = 914–34 | date = October 2006 | pmid= 16631593 | doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2005.08.044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref41"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Martin JN Jr, Blake PG, Perry KG, Jr, McCaul JF, Hess LW, Martin RW | title=The natural history of HELLP syndrome: patterns of disease progression and regression | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =164 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1500–9; discussion 1509–13 | date = June 1992 | pmid= 2048596}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref42"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Catanzarite VA, Steinberg SM, Mosley CA, Landers CF, Cousins LM, Schneider JM | title=Severe preeclampsia with fulminant and extreme elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels: high risk for maternal death | journal=Am J Perinatol | volume =12 | issue = 5 | pages = 310–3 | date = September 1995 | pmid= 8540929 | doi=10.1055/s-2007-994482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other, but less conclusive, clinical diagnostic criteria are also used in diagnosis alongside the main clinical diagnostic criteria for HELLP syndrome. 
* ''De novo'' manifestation of hypertension with [[systolic pressure]] and [[diastolic]] pressure above 160mmHg and 110 mmHg, respectively.  
* [[Proteinuria]], [[leucocytosis]] and elevated [[uric acid]] concentrations &gt; 7.8 mg. 
* Decreased serum haptoglobin and haemoglobin levels.  
* Increased serum bilirubin levels and visual disturbances.&lt;ref name="ref43"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Roberts JM, Taylor RN, Musci TJ, Rodgers GM, Hubel CA, McLaughlin MK | title=Preeclampsia: an endothelial cell disorder | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =161 | issue = 5 | pages = 1200–4 | date = November 1989 | pmid= 2589440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref44"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Sibai BM | title=Treatment of hypertension in pregnant women | journal=N Engl J Med | volume =335 | issue = 45 | pages = 257–65 | date = July 1996 | pmid= 8657243 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199607253350407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imaging tests, such as [[ultrasound]], [[tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] ([[MRI]]), are instrumental in the correct diagnosis of HELLP syndrome in patients with suspected liver dysfunction. Unurgent cases must undergo MRI, but laboratory tests, such as glucose determination, are more encouraged in mild cases of HELLP syndrome.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref45"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Weinstein L | title=Preeclampsia/eclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia | journal=Obstet Gynecol | volume =66 | issue = 5 | pages = 657–60 | date = November 1985 | pmid= 4058824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
A classification system, which was developed in [[Mississippi]], measures the severity of the syndrome using the lowest observed platelet count in the patients alongside the appearance of the other two main clinical criteria. Class I is the most severe, with a relatively high risk of morbidity and mortality, compared to the other two classes.&lt;ref name="ref46"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Martin JN Jr, Blake PG, Lowry SL, Perry KG Jr, Files JC, Morrison JC| title=Pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia-eclampsia with the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count: how rapid is postpartum recovery?| journal=Obstet Gynecol | volume =76 | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = 737–41| date = November 1990 | pmid= 2216215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class I HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count below 50,000/µL.
* Class II HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count of 50,000-100,000/µL.
* Class III HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count of 100,000-150,000/µL.

Another classification system, introduced in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], categorises HELLP syndrome based on its expression.
* Partial expression of the condition is characterised by the manifestation of one or two of the main diagnostic criteria. 
* The complete expression of the condition is characterised by the manifestation of all three main diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref name="ref47"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Audibert F, Friedman SA, Frangieh AY, Sibai BM | title=Clinical utility of strict diagnostic criteria for the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =175 | issue =2 | pages = 460–4 | date = August 1996 | pmid= 8765269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The only current recommended and most effective treatment is delivery of the baby, as the signs and symptoms diminish and gradually disappear following the delivery of the [[placenta]]. Prompt delivery is the only viable option in cases with multiorgan dysfunction or [[multiorgan failure]], haemorrhage and considerable danger to the fetus. Certain medications are also used to target and alleviate specific symptoms.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Har2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref48"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Haddad B, Barton JR, Livingston JC, Chahine R, Sibai BM | title=Risk factors for adverse maternal outcomes among women with HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume =183 | issue =2 | pages =444–8 | date = August 2000 | pmid= 10942484 | doi=10.1067/mob.2000.105915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref49"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Rath W, Loos W, Kuhn W, Graeff H| title=The importance of early laboratory screening methods for maternal and fetal outcome in cases of HELLP syndrome | journal=Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol | volume =36 | issue =1–2 | pages = 43–51 | date = August 1990 | pmid= 2365128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corticosteroids]] are of unclear benefit, though there is tentative evidence that they can increase the mother's platelet count.&lt;ref name=Wou2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woudstra |first1=DM |last2=Chandra |first2=S |last3=Hofmeyr |first3=GJ |last4=Dowswell |first4=T |title=Corticosteroids for HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome in pregnancy. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=8 September 2010 |issue=9 |pages=CD008148 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008148.pub2 |pmid=20824872|pmc=4171033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref56"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Aloizos S, Seretis C, Liakos N, Aravosita P, Mystakelli C, Kanna E, Gourgiotis | title=HELLP syndrome: understanding and management of a pregnancy-specific disease | journal=J Obstet Gynaecol | volume =33 | issue =4 | pages =331–7| date = May 2013 | pmid=23654309 | doi=10.3109/01443615.2013.775231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
With treatment, maternal mortality is about 1 percent, although complications such as [[placental abruption]], [[acute renal failure]], subcapsular liver hematoma, permanent liver damage, and [[retinal detachment]] occur in about 25% of women.&lt;ref name="ref4"/&gt; Perinatal mortality (stillbirths plus death in infancy) is between 73 and 119 per 1000 babies of woman with HELLP, while up to 40% are [[small for gestational age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OD3nK6HUIUEC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hypertension in Pregnancy|last=Belfort|first=Michael A.|author2=Steven Thornton|author3=George R.

==History==
HELLP syndrome was identified as a distinct clinical entity (as opposed to severe pre-eclampsia) by Dr. Louis Weinstein in 1982.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; In a 2005 article, Weinstein wrote that the unexplained postpartum death of a woman who had haemolysis, abnormal liver function, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia motivated him to review the medical literature and to compile information on similar women.&lt;ref name="ref28"/&gt; He noted that cases with features of HELLP had been reported as early as 1954.&lt;ref name="ref28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard-1954"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=Jan 1954|title=Intravascular hemolysis, thrombocytopenia and other hematologic abnormalities associated with severe toxemia of pregnancy|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=250|issue=3|pages=89–98|doi=10.1056/NEJM195401212500301|vauthors=Pritchard JA, ((Weisman R Jr)), Ratnoff OD, Vosburgh GJ|pmid=13119851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish health care system is mainly [[Publicly funded health care|government-funded]] and decentralized, although private health care also exists. The health care system in [[Sweden]] is financed primarily through taxes levied by county councils and municipalities.

==Management==
[[File:Södersjukhuset September 2014.jpg|thumbnail|[[Södersjukhuset]] is one of the largest hospitals in Sweden. The hospital is owned, funded and operated by [[Stockholm County Council]].]]

Sweden's health care system is organized and managed on three levels: national, regional and local. At the national level, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs establishes principles and guidelines for care and sets the political agenda for health and medical care. The ministry along with other government bodies supervises activities at the lower levels, allocates grants and periodically evaluates services to ensure correspondence to national goals.

At the regional level, responsibility for financing and providing health care is decentralized to the 21 [[County Councils of Sweden|county councils]]. A county council is a political body whose representatives are elected by the public every four years on the same day as the national general election. The executive board or hospital board of a county council exercises authority over hospital structure and management, and ensures efficient health care delivery. County councils also regulate prices and level of service offered by private providers. Private providers are required to enter into a contract with the county councils. Patients are not reimbursed for services from private providers who do not have an agreement with the county councils. According to the Swedish health and medical care policy, every county council must provide residents with good-quality health services and medical care and work toward promoting good health in the entire population.

At the local level, municipalities are responsible for maintaining the immediate environment of citizens such as water supply and social welfare services. Recently, post discharge care for the disabled and elderly, and long term care for psychiatric patients was decentralized to the local municipalities.

County councils have considerable leeway in deciding how care should be planned and delivered. This explains the wide regional variations.

It is informally divided into 7 sections: "Close-to-home care" ([[primary care]] clinics, maternity care clinics, out-patient [[psychiatric]] clinics, etc.), [[emergency care]], [[elective care]], [[in-patient]] care, [[out-patient]] care, specialist care, and [[Dentistry|dental care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

All citizens are to be given on line access to their own [[electronic health records]] by 2020.  Many different record systems are used which has caused problems for interoperability.  A national patient portal, ‘1177.se’ is used by all systems, with both telephone and online access.  At June 2017 about 41% of the population had set up their own account to use personal e-services using this system. A national Health Information Exchange platform provides a single point of connectivity to the many different systems.  There is not yet a national regulatory framework for patients’ direct access to their health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hägglund|first1=Maria|title=How Sweden is giving all citizens access to their electronic health records|url=https://www.futurehealthindex.com/2017/10/30/access-electronic-health-records/|accessdate=1 November 2017|publisher=Future Health Index|date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provision==
Private companies in 2015 provide about 20% of public hospital care and about 30% of public primary care, although in 2014 a survey by the [[SOM Institute]] found that 69% of Swedes were opposed to private companies profiting from providing public education, health, and social care, with only about 15% actively in favour.

In April 2015 [[Västernorrland County]] ordered its officials to find ways to limit the profits private companies can reap from running publicly funded health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swedish council becomes first to limit private profits in healthcare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/apr/28/swedish-council-limit-private-profit-healthcare-public?CMP=new_1194&amp;CMP=|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==
Costs for health and medical care amounted to approximately 9 percent of Sweden’s [[gross domestic product]] in 2005, a figure that remained fairly stable since the early 1980s. By 2015 the cost had risen to 11.9% of GDP -the highest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy-one percent of health care is funded through local taxation, and county councils have the right to collect income tax. The state finances the bulk of [[health care costs]], with the patient paying a small nominal fee for examination. The state pays for approximately 97% of medical costs.&lt;ref&gt;Glenngard, A., Hjalte, F., Svennson, M., Anell, A., &amp; Bankauskaite, V. (2005). Health Systems in Transition: Sweden. WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

When a physician declares a patient to be ill for whatever reason (by signing a certificate of illness/unfitness), the patient is paid a percentage of their normal daily wage from the second day. For the first 14 days, the employer is required to pay this wage, and after that the state pays the wage until the patient is declared fit.

===Details and patient costs===
Prescription drugs are not free but fees to the user are capped at 2,200 kr per annum. Once a patient's prescriptions reach this amount, the government covers any further expenses for the rest of the year. The funding system is automated. The country's pharmacies are connected over the Internet. Each prescription is sent to the pharmacy network, which stores information on a patient's medical history and on the prescriptions fulfilled previously for that patient. If the patient's pharmaceutical expenses have exceeded the annual limit, the patient receives the medication free of charge at the point of sale, upon producing identification.

In a sample of 13 developed countries Sweden was eleventh in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in 2009 and twelfth in 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that the conditions treated had high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality, caused significant long-term morbidity and incurred high levels of expenditure and significant developments in prevention or treatment had been made in the last 10 years. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross border comparison of medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of health Economics|title=International Comparison of Medicines Usage: Quantitative Analysis|url=http://www.abpi.org.uk/our-work/library/industry/Documents/meds_usage.pdf|publisher=Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limit on health-care fees per year exists; 150-300 SEK for each visit to a doctor, regardless if they are a private doctor or work at a local health-care center or a hospital. When visiting a hospital, the entrance fee covers all specialist visits the doctor deems necessary, like x-ray, rheumatism specialist, heart surgery operations and so on. The same fee is levied for ambulance services. After 1100 SEK have been paid, health-care for the rest of the year will be provided free of charge.

Dental care is not included in the general health care system, but is partly subsidized by the government. Dental care is free for youths up to 19 years of age, while a general dental care insurance (introduced in 1974) covers all inhabitants from the age of 20 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mah.se/CAPP/Country-Oral-Health-Profiles/EURO/Sweden/Oral-Health-Care-System-and-Services/|title=Oral Health Care System and Services|date=27 October 2010|website=www.mah.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health care is an integrated part of the health care system and is subject to the same legislation and user fees as other health care services. If an individual has minor mental health issues, he is attended to by a GP in a primary health setting; if the patient has major mental health issues he is referred to specialized psychiatric care in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifn.se/eng/publications/popular_science_and_book_reviews/2016/2017-the-swedish-health-care-system|title=The Swedish Health Care System|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==

According to the [[Euro health consumer index]] the Swedish score for technically excellent healthcare services, which they rated 10th in Europe in 2015, is dragged down by access and waiting time problems, in spite of national efforts such as [[Vårdgaranti]]. It is claimed that there is a long tradition of steering patients away from their doctor unless they are really sick.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waiting times ===
Urgent cases are always prioritized and emergency cases are treated immediately. The national guarantee of care, [[Vårdgaranti]], lays down standards for waiting times for scheduled care, aiming to keep waiting time below 7 days for a visit to a primary care physician, and no more than 90 days for a visit to a specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vårdgaranti|url=http://www.1177.se/Regler-och-rattigheter/Vardgarantier/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Samuel Tanner''' (February 7, 1831 - December 28, 1918) was a physician who advocated fasting. He fasted for 40 days in [[Manhattan, New York City]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="FastingandLiving" /&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on February 7, 1831 in England to Hannah and Samuel Tanner. He claimed to have completed a 42 day fast in 1879, but was unable to prove it.  On June 28, 1880 he began a forty day fast in Manhattan. His first meal after completing the fast was milk, watermelon, and half a pound of beefsteak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=The Long Fast Finished. A Meal That Amazed Dr. Tanner's Attendants.

==The fast==
On June 28, 1880, Tanner began a forty days' fast at [[Clarendon Hall]] in Manhattan. After originally intending to go without food or water, he was persuaded to drink, before going without water from the second to the tenth day. Tanner lost almost 40 pounds by the conclusion of the experiment, and against the advice of his doctors began consuming meat, fruits, wine and milk immediately after.

Because no one believed his claim that he had fasted for 42 days, in January 1880, Tanner, a practitioner of  [[hygienic medicine]], announced that he would repeat his experiment to show that humans can survive without food and would agree to submit himself  to be placed “under the care of any medical society” that would provide adequate housing.&lt;ref name="FastingandLiving"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fasting and Living Death|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14586742/fasting_and_living_death/|accessdate=22 October 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=January 18, 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, Tanner began his attempt to duplicate his 40-day fast and after the 6th day, the New York Times began a series of articles chronicling his day –to-day progress, each dispatch becoming more ominous in its anticipation that his death by starvation was imminent.  As the twelfth night approached, a Times headline announced that “The End [was] Predicted to be at Hand”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All Eyes on the Faster|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14586791/all_eyes_on_the_faster/|accessdate=22 October 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 10, 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; But rather than deteriorating, by the twentieth day, Tanner’s condition improved and he “looked and acted better than ever”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rolling Up the Weeks|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14586904/rolling_up_the_weeks/|accessdate=22 October 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 19, 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, the Times reported that a crowd of over 2,000 would witness Tanner break his 40-day fast at midnight. The usual admission price of 25 cents was raised to half a dollar resulting in a box office take of over $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tanner's Fortieth Day|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14586941/tanners_40th_day/|accessdate=22 October 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 7, 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many doctors on hand still expected him to keel over though upon re-feeding and although he re-fed on milk (which today would be strongly discouraged) he suffered only minimal nausea and some vomiting. A few days, later the Times began reporting on Tanner’s recovery, gaining back some of his weight and that by September 10, the “fasting doctor” had launched a lecture tour touting “starvation” as a cure for disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tanner as Lecturer|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14586973/tanner_as_lecturer/|accessdate=22 October 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 10, 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The fast has been the subject of many books and studies taken since 1880. His daily log of weight and physical condition were released to the public for further evaluation.&lt;ref name="Dr. Tanner's Great Fast"&gt;{{cite book|first=I. |last=Platt |title=A Library Of Wonders And Curiosities Found In Nature And Art, Science And Literature|accessdate=2010-10-26 | year=1884 |url=http://chestofbooks.com/reference/A-Library-Of-Wonders-And-Curiosities/Dr-Tanner-s-Great-Fast.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tanner's fame in the coming decades was enough for [[Mark Twain]] to mention in passing, "I think that the Dr. Tanners and those others who go forty days without eating do it by resolutely keeping out the desire to eat, in the beginning, and that after a few hours the desire is discouraged and comes no more"&lt;ref name="Following the Equator"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark |last=Twain |title=Following the Equator: A Journey Around the World|accessdate=2010-10-26 | year=1897 |publisher=American Publishing Company |url=http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/twain/following-equator/2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Following the Equator]]: A Journey Around the World'' in 1897.

The '''Hudson River State Hospital''', is a former [[New York (state)|New York]] state [[psychiatric hospital]] which operated from 1873 until its closure in the early 2000s. The campus is notable for its main building, known as a "Kirkbride," which has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] due to its exemplary [[High Victorian Gothic]] architecture, the first use of that style for an American [[institution]]al building.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{Cite document|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Hudson River State Hospital, Main Building|url={{NHLS url|id=89001166}} |format=pdf|author=Carolyn Pitts|date=February 1989|publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=89001166|title=Accompanying 5 photos, aerial and exterior, from 1960, 1980, and 1985.|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.34&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] on the [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]]-[[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]] town line.

[[Frederick Clarke Withers]] designed the hospital's buildings in 1867. [[Calvert Vaux]] and [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the grounds. It was intended to be completed quickly, but went far over its original schedule and budget. The hospital opened on October 18, 1871 as the '''Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane'''&lt;ref name="Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1872/12/26/79205947.pdf|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=December 27, 1872|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admitted its first 40 patients. Construction, however, was far from over and would continue for another 25 years. A century later, it was slowly closed down as psychiatric treatment had changed enough that large hospitals were no longer needed, and its services had been served by the nearby [[Hudson River Psychiatric Center]] until that facility's closure in January 2012.

The campus was closed and abandoned in 2003 and since then has fallen into a state of disrepair. Authorities struggle with the risk of [[arson]] and vandals after suspicion of an intentionally set fire. The male bedding ward, south of the main building, was critically damaged in a 2007 fire caused by lightning. The property was sold to an unnamed buyer in November 2013.&lt;ref name="Former Hudson River Psychiatric Center site to be sold"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Hudson River Psychiatric Center site to be sold|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20131107/BUSINESS/311070048/Former-Hudson-River-Psychiatric-Center-site-sold|newspaper=[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
[[Image:Hudson River Psychiatric Center front view.jpg|right|thumb|The Cheney Building as visible from a nearby strip mall, with Ryon Hall to the right.]]
The Hospital includes a number of unique buildings:
*'''Main Building''' (the '''Kirkbride'''), a High Victorian Gothic building used for administrative purposes
*'''Patient Wings''', which split off the Kirkbride, housed patients. The male ward splits off to the south, and is much larger than the female wing to the north. It was struck by lightning on May 31, 2007, igniting a serious fire.
*Presbyterian and Roman Catholic churches were available to patients, one of which was near the male ward.
*A [[morgue]], with refrigerated cold chambers was located on the northeast corner of the property
*A [[power station|power house]] was built, and still stands, to the northeast of the Kirkbride to provide power to the various buildings. Its [[chimney|smokestack]] is visible from Route 9 as well as nearby [[Marist College]].
*'''Ryon Hall''' opened in 1934 and housed violent or criminally insane patients.&lt;ref name="Ryon Hall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Acts of Conscience:World War II, Mental Institutions, and Religious Objectors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYBL5GBTBUcC&amp;q=ryan#v=snippet&amp;q=ryan&amp;f=false|year=2009|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the very southern property line, visible from Home Depot, in the shadow of the much larger Cheney Building.
*The '''Clarence O. Cheney Building''', opened in 1952,&lt;ref name="Hudson River State Hospital"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson River State Hospital - Cheney Building|url=
http://www.emporis.com/building/hudsonriverstatehospitalcheneymemorialbuilding-poughkeepsie-ny-usa|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a ten-story steel structure with a brick facade. Named after Dr. Clarence O.

*The '''Herman B.''' '''Snow Rehabilitation Center''' opened in 1971 and provided recreational relief for patients, sporting two [[bowling alley]] lanes, a lunch counter, an auditorium, a basketball court, and an indoor [[swimming pool]]. The building featured a modern concrete and glass construction with angular asymmetrical wings. Skylights provided natural lighting.

==History==
The entire facility was built over the last three decades of the 19th century, at great cost. Once complete, it would be used as intended for much of the first half of the next century. As psychiatry moved away from inpatient treatments, it began to decline in use until its closure at century's end. Today, it is slowly deteriorating out of public view as it awaits reuse.

===19th century===
New York had opened what has since become [[Utica Psychiatric Center]] in 1843, the first state-run institution for the [[mental illness|mentally ill]]. By the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] it was reaching its capacity, so in 1866 then [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] [[Reuben Fenton]] appointed a five-member state commission to look for a site for a second hospital in the [[Hudson Valley]] between [[New York City|New York]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]], to serve New York City and the counties of Eastern New York.&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hudson River Insane Hospital|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=December 25, 1868}}, cited at [http://www.historic51.org/sources.shtml Hudson River State Hospital] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205225434/http://historic51.org/sources.shtml |date=2007-12-05 }}, retrieved from historic51.org November 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In January of the following year the members reported to the governor that they had temporarily secured a {{convert|296|acre|adj=on}} tract of land overlooking the [[Hudson River]] north of Poughkeepsie, formerly part of the [[estate (house)|estates]] of [[James Roosevelt]] and William A. Davis. It would cost nothing as the citizens of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] would be offering it to the state as a gift. Two months later, the state accepted.&lt;ref name="historic51"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson River State Hospital |url=http://www.historic51.org/mainbuilding.shtml |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205225347/http://historic51.org/mainbuilding.shtml |archivedate=2007-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nine-member Board of Managers was created and appointed to initiate and oversee construction of the actual building. They chose architect [[Frederick Clarke Withers]] to design a building according to the [[Kirkbride Plan]], then a popular theory for the design of mental institutions. Withers planned a building 1,500 feet (457 m) in length and over 500,000 square feet (45,000 m²) in area, most of it two wings that would house patients.&lt;ref name="historic51" /&gt; It was the first institutional building in the U.S. designed in the [[Victorian High Gothic|High Victorian Gothic]] [[architectural style|style]].&lt;ref name="nhlsum" /&gt; [[Calvert Vaux]] and [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], designers of New York's [[Central Park]], laid out the surrounding [[landscape architecture|landscape]].&lt;ref name="historic51" /&gt; Like Withers, they had been mentored by the influential [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] in nearby [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]].

The centerpiece of his design was the administration building, which branched off into two wings, composed of six parallel pavilions that flanked the central structure.&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, ''The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States'', Minneapolis: Minnesota University Press, 2007, 113-14&lt;/ref&gt; The two wings, designed to hold 300 patients of either sex, were divided by a [[chapel]] placed between them in the yard behind the administration building so that patients could not see into the rooms of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name="Harpers"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hudson River State Hospital |url=http://www.historic51.org/sources2.shtml |publisher=''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' |date=February 28, 1974 |accessdate=2007-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320063622/http://www.historic51.org/sources2.shtml |archivedate=March 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building and landscape plan were meant to aid in patients' recovery, by giving them adequate space and privacy and imbuing their healing with a sense of grandeur.&lt;ref name="Architecture studion"&gt;{{cite web|first=Michelle |last=Fornabai |title=Advanced Architecture Studio IV |url=http://www.arch.columbia.edu/gsap/60058 |accessdate=2007-11-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907162503/http://www.arch.columbia.edu/gsap/60058 |archivedate=2007-09-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1868, with the cost estimated at $800,000. Cost-saving measures included the construction of a new dock on the Hudson so that building materials could be shipped more directly to the site, [[quarry]]ing and cutting the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] stones on site, mixing [[concrete]] from local materials and hiring local craftsmen instead of a [[general contractor]].&lt;ref name="historic51" /&gt; The board also deviated from the plan it had sent the state, in particular by building a shorter female wing when it came to believe that fewer patients of that sex would be admitted. As a result, it is one of the few Kirkbride hospitals to have been built with asymmetrical wings.&lt;ref name="Kirkbride buildings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson River State Hospital|url=http://www.kirkbridebuildings.com/buildings/hudsonriver.html|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spending controversies and delays====
Despite the efforts to save money, the board was slightly over the $100,000 it had expected to spend that year, according to its first [[annual report]].&lt;ref name="historic51" /&gt; The main building was completed and opened, with 40 patients admitted, in October 1871. As work continued on other structures planned for the complex, so did the [[cost overrun]]s. In 1873, the year county residents had been promised the hospital would be finished,&lt;ref name="historic51" /&gt; the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' ran an [[editorial]] harshly criticizing the board for not only having gone way over budget but for lavish extravagance and waste:
{{quote|The managers have entirely disregarded the law by which they were authorized to act. They have altered the plans and specifications ... Some of the details of the extravagance of the board are amazing. For instance, the first part of the work undertaken was the construction of a reservoir, into which the water was pumped from the river through an eight-inch (''20 cm'') iron pipe; from the reservoir the water was carried to the hospital by a twelve-inch (''30 cm'') iron pipe, the engine and machinery employed being on the scale of those used in supplying a neighboring city of 20,000 inhabitants. The cost of the reservoir was $100,000. Thirty thousand dollars was expended in blasting some rough rocks jutting into the reservoir, and the Superintendent gave as a reason for this that, if some of the patients were missing, they might want to rake the bottom of the reservoir to find the bodies, and with this the rocks would interfere ... The floors are laid in yellow Southern pine, the most expensive of the flooring, fitted and cut in a way greatly to enhance the cost. The heating is arranged on a scale that, with only 150 patients, ten tons (''9 tonnes'') of coal per day is consumed. The mention of these items sufficiently explains the disappearance of $1,200,000 of the people's money.&lt;ref name="NYT editorial"&gt;{{cite news|title=An Extraordinary Job |url=http://www.historic51.org/sources1.shtml |date=July 4, 1863 |accessdate=2007-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320051426/http://www.historic51.org/sources1.shtml |archivedate=March 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some efforts were made to stop the project, but the [[New York State Legislature|legislature]] continued to appropriate funds despite further revelations like these. Construction continued until 1895, when further money could not be found. Despite this expenditure of time and money, the hospital's original plan was still not complete, and never would be.

===20th century===
A Refrigerating Plant was built 1948 and a Tubercular Hospital was built in 1951 to the designs of [[Samuel Juster]] of [[DePace &amp; Juster]].&lt;ref name=AAD&gt;''[[American Architects Directory]]'', First Edition ([[New York City]]: [[R.R. Bowker LLC]], 1956), p.236&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings continued to be opened and reopened in the 20th century, and as late as 1952 the institution was treating as many as 6,000 patients.&lt;ref name="historic51" /&gt;

Changes in the treatment of mental illness, such as [[psychotherapy]] and [[psychotropic drugs]], were making large-scale facilities relics and allowing more patients to lead more normal lives [[deinstitutionalization|without being committed]]. A major fire destroyed a hospital wing in the 1960s and threatened to spread to the administration building, but was halted in a connecting hallway. The section was rebuilt, although some large roof beams still showed evidence of the earlier fire. Though 1971 saw the addition of the Snow Recreational center, by the late 1970s the hospital administration had decided to shut down the two main wings as few patients were residing in them and due to neglect some of the floors had collapsed. The hospital housed 1,780 patients by 1976.&lt;ref name="Honest Mistake is Laid to Rest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Honest Mistake is Laid to Rest|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GHBRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3hEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6851,2706605&amp;dq=hudson+river+psychiatric&amp;hl=en|publisher=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]''|date=June 16, 1977|accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state offices of Mental Health and [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|Historic Preservation]] clashed over a plan to demolish the wings, even after the [[National Historic Landmark]] designation in 1989.

In the 1990s, more and more of the hospital site would be abandoned as its services were needed less and less. It was consolidated with another Dutchess County mental hospital, [[Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center]], in 1994 and closed in 2003. The center moved operations into a much smaller building nearby, Ross Pavilion, located on a hilltop on the east side of Rt 9G.&lt;ref name="modern NYT story"&gt;{{cite news|first=Claudia|last=Rowe|title=Modern Efficiency Displaces Historic Psychiatric Hospital|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E2D6123CF933A05756C0A9679C8B63|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=June 30, 2001|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
In 2005, the state sold the property and subsequently, the [[Empire State Development Corporation]] sold {{convert|156|acre}} including the Main Building to Hudson Heritage LLC, a subsidiary of the [[Chazen Companies]], for $2.75 million.&lt;ref name="redevelopment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Redevelopment Plan |url=http://www.historic51.org/redevelopment.shtml |accessdate=2007-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205225429/http://historic51.org/redevelopment.shtml |archivedate=2007-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson Heritage and Chazen had planned to thoroughly renovate the Main Building into a combination hotel/apartment complex as the centerpiece of a residential/commercial campus, Hudson Heritage Park.&lt;ref name="Chazen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson Heritage Park |url=http://www.chazencompanies.com/markets/hudson.html |accessdate=2007-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015230817/http://www.chazencompanies.com/markets/hudson.html |archivedate=2007-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hudson River Psychiatric Center fire.jpg|275px|right|thumb|May 2007 fire at the Main Building]]
 
Redevelopment plans hit two setbacks in the mid- to late-2000s: in 2005, the [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Town of Poughkeepsie]] imposed a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on new construction to cope with its growth. Hudson Heritage had been seeking to have a "historic revitalization district" created for the property that would help spur its growth.&lt;ref name="moratorium"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Valkys |title=Town Amends its Building Moratorium |url=http://www.historic51.org/media06.shtml |publisher=''[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]'' |date=February 17, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013160037/http://historic51.org/media06.shtml |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, on May 31, 2007, [[lightning]] struck the sprawling south wing, which held male housing, causing one of the most serious fires in Dutchess County's history.&lt;ref name="PoJo fire"&gt;{{cite news|first=Christine|last=Pizzutti|title=Fire engulfs building at former psychiatric center|url=http://www.forgottenphotography.com/v-web/bulletin/bb/viewtopic.php?t=142|publisher=''[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]''|date=June 1, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fire"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Johnson|title=6+ Alarm Structure Fire - Hudson River Psychiatric Center - Fairview Fire District|url=http://fdphotounit.smugmug.com/gallery/2934697#158360220|accessdate=2007-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013155624/http://fdphotounit.smugmug.com/gallery/2934697#158360220|archive-date=2007-10-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether that portion of the building can be effectively restored after such severe damage. The Administration building was again hit by fire on the morning on April 27, 2018.

In the meantime, the property has remained closed to the public, with signs posted at fenced-off entrances. Local firefighters have complained, after dealing with two fires in April 2010 that appeared to be [[arson|deliberately set]], that the property is not adequately secured against trespassing.&lt;ref name="PoJo 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Valkys|first=Michael|title=Suspicious fires at psychiatric hospital's old campus bring security push|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=20105030329|publisher=[[Gannett Corporation]]|newspaper=[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=May 3, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010s==
As of May 2012, the campus is owned by CPC Resources, a subsidiary of the [[New York City]]-based Community Preservation Corporation, a non-profit mortgage lender that finances multifamily developments. CPC has placed the 162-acre parcel on the market, citing that the poor economy has hindered timely development.&lt;ref name="Poughkeepsie Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=John|title=Psych center site development plan stalls|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20120428/NEWS01/304280022|publisher=[[Gannett Corporation]]|newspaper=[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]|date=April 28, 2012|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walmart]] has shown a strong interest in the property, but Poughkeepsie Town Supervisor Todd Tancredi noted that the Town Board cannot envision such a large piece of land used for a single store.

An unnamed buyer purchased the campus for an undisclosed sum in November 2013. The closing for the property occurred on November 8, 2013.&lt;ref name="Former Hudson River Psychiatric Center site to be sold"/&gt;

An intentional fire was set on the morning of April 27, 2018 at the Hudson River Psychiatric Center, according to Fairview Fire District Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=John|title=Arson triggered Hudson River Psychiatric Center fire: chief|url=https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/2018/04/27/fire-fighters-battle-blaze-hudson-river-psychiatric-center-property/557239002/|website=Poughkeepsie Journal|publisher=USA Today Network|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fire was located in the wing of the old Main Administration building, and firefighters were dispatched around 3:45 AM; more than a dozen agencies responded with assistance.

==How does hyperacuity differ from traditional acuity?==

The best example of the distinction between '''acuity''' and  '''hyperacuity''' comes from vision, for example when observing stars on a night sky.  The first stage is the optical imaging of the outside world on the retina.  Light impinges on the mosaic of receptor sense cells, rods and cones, which covers the retinal surface without gaps or overlap, just like the detecting [[pixels]] in the film plane of digital cameras. Each receptor accepts all the light reaching it but acts as a unit, representing a single location in visual space.  This compartmentalization sets a limit to the decision whether an image came from a single or a double star (resolution).  For a percept of separately articulated stars to emerge, the images of the two must be wide enough apart to leave at least one intervening pixel relatively unstimulated between them.   This defines the resolution limit and the basis of visual acuity.

[[File:Reslocfig.jpg|thumb|right|240pxl|Acuity/Resolution versus Hyperacuity/Localization

Top: Two stars imaged on the mosaic of retinal receptor cells can be resolved only if their separation leaves at least one intervening mosaic element with a detectably different intensity, otherwise the pattern is indistinguishable from a single elongated star.

Bottom:  Two targets can be localized relative to each other to values transcending the spacing of the mosaic units; the hyperacuity mechanism achieves this by identifying,  with sub-pixel precision, the light center of each target, across all the pixels it covers]]A quite different mechanism operates  in hyperacuity, whose quintessential example and the one for which the word was initially coined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=1150397 |year=1975 |last1=Westheimer |first1=Gerald |title=Editorial: Visual acuity and hyperacuity |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=570–2 |journal=Investigative Ophthalmology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2175231 Link to Westheimer (1975)]&lt;/ref&gt; is [[vernier acuity]]: alignment of two edges or lines can be judged with a precision five or ten times better than acuity.  In [[computer graphics]]  the phrase “[[sub-pixel resolution]]” is sometimes used in discussions of [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] and geometrical [[superresolution]]. Though what is in fact involved is not ''resolution'' (is it one or two? – a ''qualitative'' distinction) but ''localization'' (exactly where? – a ''quantitative'' judgment) it captures the process.  When an image spreads across several pixels, each with graded intensity response but only a single spatial value, the position of the image center can be located more exactly than the width of the pixel, much like the mean of a histogram can be calculated to a fraction of the bin width.

In the figure on the right, the [[retinal mosaic]] has superimposed on it, at top, the images of two stars at resolution limit when the intervening gap assures judgment that there are two stars and not a single elongated one.  Shown below are the images of two separate short lines; the precision of the read-out of their location difference transcends the dimension of the mosaic elements.

==Analysis of hyperacuity mechanism==
Details of the neural apparatus for hyperacuity still await discovery.  That the hyperacuity apparatus involves signals from a range of individual receptor cells, usually in more than one location of the stimulus space, has implications concerning performance in these tasks. Low contrast, close proximity of neighboring stimuli (crowding), and temporal asynchrony of pattern components are examples of factors that cause performance deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Westheimer |first1=G |year=2008 |chapter=Hyperacuity |editor1-last=Squire |editor1-first=L.

==Hyperacuity in various sense modalities==
The distinction between resolving power or acuity, literally sharpness, which depends on the spacing of the individual receptors through which the outside world is sampled, and the ability to identify individual locations in the sensory space is universal among modalities. There are many other examples where the organism’s performance substantially surpasses the spacing of the concerned receptor cell population.  The  normal human has only three kinds of color receptors in the retina, yet in [[color vision]], by subtly weighing and comparing their relative output, one can detect thousand of hues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1902">The '''Institute of Virus Preparations''' was an agency of the former [[Soviet Union]].

It was the equivalent to the [[Centers for Disease Control]] and the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), founded by Kent Truslow.  At one time, the Institute for Virus Preparations was one of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [[WHO Collaborating Centres|collaborating centers]] which served along with the CDC as a central collection point for [[smallpox]] (variola major) samples during the eradication effort in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Salem| first = Harry  | authorlink = |author2=Sidney A.

| isbn = 0-8493-4049-7| page = 939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute remained one of the collaborating centers.  Although the smallpox samples were transferred to the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology|Vector Institute]] in 1998 officially, contradictory reports indicate this may have happened several years earlier.  Additionally, reliable reports indicate that the smallpox samples were almost certainly used in a very advanced [[biological warfare]] program prior to this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Langford | first = Roland E.  | title = Introduction to Weapons of Mass Destruction: Radiological, Chemical, and Biological  | publisher = Wiley-IEEE | year = 2004 | pages = 145–147 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=jImqnqM8HygC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=russia+smallpox+biological+warfare#PPA145,M1 | isbn = 0-471-46560-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethology]] and [[social science]], '''male bonding''' is the formation of close personal relationships, and patterns of [[friendship]] or cooperation between males.

In the context of human relationships, male bonding is used to describe friendship between men, or the way in which men befriend each other. The expression is sometimes used synonymously with the word [[camaraderie]]. The first widely noticed use of the term was in ''Men in Groups'' (1969; 2004) by anthropologist [[Lionel Tiger]].

Male bonding can take place in various locations such as gyms, locker rooms, sport fields or courts, fraternities, and barbershops. This can include playing musical instruments, video games, business ventures, creative endeavors, journeys, quests, sporting activities, fishing, hunting, camping, gambling, social drinking, smoking cigars, working with tools, or even just conversing.

There was also a labyrinth of underground tunnels which connect every building. Like most asylums of its time, it had a gruesome and dark history. Remnants of this are the graveyard, hydrotherapy tubs and lobotomy equipment. It was the first [[mental institution|asylum]] in Iowa and was built under the [[Kirkbride Plan]]. It was closed after a massive fire destroyed most of the building and left the rest of the complex beyond repair.

==History==
It was constructed between 1855 and 1865 at a cost of $400,000.&lt;ref name="Kirkbride"/&gt; The first patient was admitted in February 1861. It is a [[Kirkbride building]], and was the first asylum in Iowa. Over the years, the name was changed to the Mount Pleasant State Hospital because of the housing of drug addicts, geriatrics, alcoholics, etc. The Mount Pleasant Mental Health Institute is the oldest of the four [[Iowa Department of Human Services]] facilities serving persons affected by mental illness.

In 1936, a fire destroyed most of the administration section, leaving only a kitchen area at the back.&lt;ref name="Kirkbride"/&gt; In 1946, the facility reached its peak occupancy of 1,581 patients. Since 1945, new therapies and medications had helped to lower the facility's population, and the individual's average length of stay was reduced from years to a matter of weeks.

This allowed the facility to release many of its patients and eventually reassign the patients to [[Cherokee Mental Health Institute]] (Cherokee, Iowa]]), [[Clarinda Treatment Complex]] ([[Clarinda, Iowa]]) and [[Independence State Hospital]] ([[Independence, Iowa]]), which are still in use today. It has been known by many names, including the Mount Pleasant Insane Asylum, the Mount Pleasant Hospital for the Insane and the Mount Pleasant Mental Health Institute.

Iowa Governor [[Terry Branstad]] announced, much to the chagrin of citizens and legislators, that he would close Mount Pleasant and Clarinda MHIs in 2015. Despite the outcry in Iowa (actually more inpatient beds are urgently needed), and despite the questions about the legality&lt;ref&gt;Tony Leys, [http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2015/01/24/mental-hospital-closures-mount-pleasant-illegal-branstad/22283877/ "Branstad plan to shut mental hospitals called illegal"], ''The Des Moines Register'', 24 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; of these shut-downs, Branstad appears immovable. There are plans to develop a "crisis line", which will treat chronic mental health disorders like [[schizophrenia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2997">A '''mucogingival junction''' is an anatomical feature found on the intraoral [[mucosa]].  The mucosa of the cheeks and floor of the mouth are freely moveable and fragile, whereas the mucosa around the teeth and on the palate are firm and [[keratinized]].  Where the two tissue types meet is known as a mucogingival junction.

There are three mucogingival junctions: on the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|facial]] of the [[maxilla]] and on both the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|facial and lingual]] of the [[human mandible|mandible]].  The [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|palatal]] gingiva of the maxilla is continuous with the tissue of the [[palate]], which is bound down to the palatal bones.  Because the palate is devoid of freely moveable [[alveolar mucosa]], there is no mucogingival junction.&lt;ref name="Carranza's Clinical Periodontology 2002, page 17"&gt;Carranza's Clinical Periodontology, W.B. Saunders 2002, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical importance==
The clinical importance of the mucogingival junction is in measuring the width of [[gingiva|attached gingiva]].&lt;ref name="Carranza's Clinical Periodontology 2002, page 17"/&gt;  Attached gingiva is important because it is bound very tightly to the underlying [[alveolar bone]] and provides protection to the mucosa during functional use of the structures of the oral cavity during function, such as [[mastication|chewing]].  Without attached gingiva, the freely moveable alveolar mucosa, being more fragile, would suffer injury during eating and cleansing activities, such as [[toothbrush|brushing]] of the [[teeth]].

The width of attached tissue is critical, because the more there is available provides a greater sense of protection against the aforementioned insults to the tissue.  Using the mucogingival junction as the boundary demarcating the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|apical]] border of the attached gingiva, a [[periodontal probe]] in inserted into the [[gingiva|gingival sulcus]] to measure how much of the [[keratinized]] gingiva [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|coronal]] to the mucogingival junction is in fact attached to the underlying bone.  The depth of the gingival sulcus, determined by the depth to which the probe enters the sulcus, is not attached to the underlying bone, and is subtracted from the total height of the keratinized tissue.

Thus, if the entire height of the keratinized gingiva, from the [[free gingival margin]] to the mucogingival junction is 8&amp;nbsp;mm, and the probing depth on the [[tooth]] at that location is 2&amp;nbsp;mm, the effective width of attached gingiva is 6&amp;nbsp;mm.

If the probe enters the sulcus and can descend ''up to or beyond'' the mucogingival junction, that area is said to represent a ''mucogingival defect''.

'''NHS Professionals''' is an organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] that supplies temporary staff to the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS). It manages temporary staff banks on behalf of more than 55 NHS Trusts across England.

==History==
The concept of NHS Professionals, an NHS-owned solution to the growing issue of temporary workforce requirements, was first introduced in 2001 by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]]. By 2003 the NHS Professionals service was being provided via four main host trusts and there was significant variation between them in terms both of activity and performance. To combat this, NHS Professionals was established as a Special Health Authority (SpHA) on 1 April 2004, a nationally branded managed service for temporary staff in the NHS. NHS Professionals underwent further reorganisation to improve its service and in 2010 it was dissolved as a Special Health Authority and became NHS Professionals Ltd, a company wholly owned by the Secretary of State for Health in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.nhsprofessionals.nhs.uk/nhsp/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06704614&lt;/ref&gt; The head office is in Watford, Hertfordshire, supported by a small finance team located in Tingley, Yorkshire as well as a client relationship team based both remotely and on-site at client trusts around the country. It announced its first ever surplus/profits in August 2010, and it continues to generate a surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Professionals Achieves Profitability|url=http://www.nhsprofessionals.nhs.uk/News/Pages/article97.aspx|website=www.nhsprofessionals.nhs.uk|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Stephen Dangerfield was announced as the chief executive of NHS Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Professionals appoints new CEO|url=https://www.nhsprofessionals.nhs.uk/News/Pages/NHS-Professionals-appoints-new-CEO.aspx|website=www.nhsprofessionals.nhs.uk|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been with NHS Professionals since 2007, originally as Director of Operations and then as Chief Operating Officer. Robin Williams is chairman of NHS Professionals. He has experience in corporate finance, outsourcing, support services, manufacturing, contracting and construction, IT systems and managed services. He is a qualified Chartered Accountant and a graduate engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Chair to lead the company as it enters the second year|url=http://www.property.nhs.uk/welcoming-our-new-chair-to-lead-the-companys-second-year/|website=NHS Property Services Ltd|accessdate=2 June 2016|date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 Sky News said ministers were examining the future of NHS Professionals, saying the agency’s sale, at an estimated price of between £50 million and £100 million, was “a very real possibility”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spending on private ambulances has risen by 82% in two years|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/spending-on-private-ambulances-has-risen-by-82-per-cent-in-two-years-9807077.html?origin=internalSearch|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=Independent|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2016, Nick Kirkbride replaced Stephen Dangerfield as chief executive officer of NHS Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laingbuissonnews.com/newsletter-archives/healthcare-markets/hm-personnel/nhs-professionals-appoints-ceo-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 plans to sell it were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Tory U-turn wastes millions in a “misguided” bid to privatise crucial NHS resources|url=https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/another-misguided-tory-u-turn-wastes-millions-bid-privatise-crucial-nhs-resources/09/09/|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=London Economic|date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nick Kirkbride was replaced by Colin McCready

Primarily it serves the needs of the NHS by offering [[NHS trust]]s [[temporary work|temporary staffing]] solutions as a managed service. It also serves the temporary working needs of healthcare professionals who work in the NHS.

The company works in partnership with NHS trusts supporting their workforce strategy attempting improving their temporary workforce provision. As a managed bank service, NHS Professionals takes over the day-to-day management of the Trust bank to help control demand for additional hours, minimise agency expenditure and improve compliance of temporary staff.

NHS Professionals gives staff the opportunity to work flexible hours at their convenience, across various trusts. It claims to be the NHS's largest temporary staff bank workforce with 70,000 on its books. Members of the NHS Professionals’ bank workforce are referred to as flexible workers. This refers to their flexible working patterns and contracts of engagement which contrasts with permanently employed trust staff.

Bank workers have access to the following benefits:
* Competitive weekly pay{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* First choice of available shifts{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* Paid annual leave
* Statutory maternity and paternity and sick pay (subject to qualifying criteria)
* Access to NHS Professionals'{{who|date=August 2014}} very own pension scheme called ‘NHSP Stakeholder pension’
* Free training and development opportunities{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

NHS Professionals employs a wide variety of healthcare staff including: General and specialist nurses, care support workers (healthcare assistants), doctors, midwives, administrative and clerical, allied health professionals, healthcare scientists, support services among other healthcare professionals.

Administrative and clerical workers need to have relevant skills and experience to join the workforce. All doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants are required to have at least six months' experience within the last two years in the UK and at an NHS hospital.

''Female genital Mutilation: A Guide to Laws and Policies Worldwide'', Zed Books, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kEG6GaudxQEC&amp;pg=PR2 p. ii].&lt;/ref&gt; is a Sudanese surgeon and women's health rights activist, specializing in research into [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref name=Shetty/&gt;

Toubia is the co-founder and director of [[RAINBO]], the Research, Action and Information Network for Bodily Integrity of Women.&lt;ref name=Shetty&gt;Shetty, Priya. [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2807%2960394-8/fulltext "Nahid Toubia"], ''The Lancet'', 369(9564), 10 March 2007, p. 819.&lt;/ref&gt; She is an associate professor at [[Columbia University]] School of Public Health. She sits on scientific and advisory committees for the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], and [[UNDP]]. She is also vice-chair of the advisory committee of the Women's Rights Watch Project of [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learningpartnership.org/node/1780 |title=Nahid Toubia |publisher=Learning Partnership |access-date=2011-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929123818/http://www.learningpartnership.org/node/1780 |archive-date=2011-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on reproductive health and gender inequality in Africa and the Middle East, Toubia is the author or co-author of several books, including ''Women of the Arab World: The Coming Challenge'' (1988), ''Female Genital Mutilation: A Call for Global Action'' (1995), and ''Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Worldwide Laws and Policies'' (2000).

==Education==
Toubia was born in [[Khartoum]], Sudan, and attended medical school in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Rahman-Toubia2000p2/&gt; In 1981 she completed her surgical training in the United Kingdom, gaining an MPhil and a PhD in Public Health &amp; Policy from the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]]. She became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1981, and the first female surgeon in Sudan.&lt;ref name=Rahman-Toubia2000p2/&gt;

==Career and research==
In 1985 she returned to Sudan, where she was head of [[paediatric]] surgery at Khartoum Teaching Hospital,&lt;ref name=Rahman-Toubia2000p2/&gt; and set up her own emergency clinic.&lt;ref name=Shetty/&gt; As a result of the country's political instability she returned to the UK, and began her research into female genital mutilation (FGM).&lt;ref name=BBC-Toubia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1916917.stm |title=Changing attitudes to female circumcision |date=8 April 2002 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 she worked for four years at the [[Population Council]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=Shetty/&gt;

Toubia is the founder and president of [[RAINBO|Research, Action and Information Network for the Bodily Integrity of Women (Rainbo)]], an international organisation which works to eliminate FGM through women’s self-empowerment and social change. The organisation has offices in New York City and London, and works in Uganda, South Africa, the Gambia, and Nigeria.&lt;ref name="UoW Internet FGM resources"&gt;[http://womenst.library.wisc.edu/fc/fcwebfgm.htm "Internet-Based Resources on Female Genital Mutilation" by Tobe Levin, Office of University of Wisconsin System Women's Studies Librarian], accessed 20 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Rainbo played a prominent role in changing the view of FGM from being a predominantly medical concern to a human rights issue.&lt;ref name=BBC-Toubia /&gt;

In 2002 Toubia told the BBC World Service that the campaign against FGM was fundamentally about changing women's consciousness, and empowering them to change their social position. She said while most African governments, health professionals and [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] had the issue on their agenda, the greatest challenge was at grassroots level. She said "By allowing your genitals to be removed [it is perceived that] you are heightened to another level of pure motherhood - a motherhood not tainted by sexuality and that is why the woman gives it away to become the matron, respected by everyone. By taking on this practise, which is a woman's domain, it actually empowers them. It is much more difficult to convince the women to give it up, than to convince the men." &lt;ref name=BBC-Toubia /&gt;

{{Fiqh|etiquette}}
'''''Raḍāʿ''''' or '''''riḍāʿa''''' ({{lang-ar|رضاع, رضاعة}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-ar|rɪˈdˤɑːʕ(æ)|pron}}, "breastfeeding") is a [[List of Islamic terms in Arabic|technical term]] from [[Sunni]] [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] meaning "the suckling which produces the legal impediment to marriage of foster-kinship".&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses: Medieval Islamic Views on Breastfeeding and Their Social Implications'', {{ISBN|90-04-11223-5}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  The term derives from the [[infinitive]] noun of the [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] ''radiʿa'' or ''radaʿa'' ("he sucked the breast of his mother").  Often it is translated as "[[fosterage]]" or "[[milk kinship]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. J. H. van Gelder, ''Close Relationships: Incest and Inbreeding in Classical Arabic Literature'', {{ISBN|1-85043-855-2}}, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''radāʿ'' derives from Islamic and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Islam and children#Breast-feeding|notions]] concerning the state of [[consanguinity]] created between [[wet nurse]] and unrelated nursling—that is, a woman and a baby other than her own—through the act of [[breastfeeding]].  ''Radāʿ'' also defines the links between various relations and family members of both wet nurse and baby, such that not only are the two [[Mahram|forbidden in marriage]] to one another, but so are their relations in various combination (e.g. the nursling's biological brother with the milk-mother's biological daughter).  Conversely, the milk-relationship allows usually forbidden familiarities between the two, particularly if the nursling is male and of adult stature, such as viewing the milk-mother [[Hijab|unveiled]] or [[Sex segregation in Islam|in private]], exactly as if he were a relation.{{Original research inline|date=April 2008}}

== In Islamic law ==
=== Sunni ===
''Radāʿ'' receives extensive treatment in the Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') of the classical jurists (''[[Faqīh|faqih]]'').  A primary feature of such works is the delineation of which relationships are [[Harām|subject to prohibition]] once the milk relationship is established.  The following are the sorts of questions directed to the founder of the [[Hanbali]] [[Madhhab|school of jurisprudence]] by his son:

{{cquote|
I asked [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|my father]] about a man who has two wives, each of whom has a daughter.  Then one of the wives nurses a certain man.  'Is it [[Halal|lawful]] for this man's son to marry the daughter of the wife who did not nurse him?'  (...) I asked my father about a man who has a wife who nurses both a youth and a girl, and the youth has a brother.  'Is it lawful for the brother to marry the girl?' (...)  I hear my father asked about a woman who nurses a young female slave belonging to someone else.   Then a certain man marries the woman who has nursed the young female slave.  'Is it lawful for the man to have intercourse with the [[Islamic views on slavery|female slave]] his wife has nursed if he buys and takes [[Ma malakat aymanukum|possession of her]]?'&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Other common topics included the following:

* ''laban al-fahl'', "milk of the sire", as under Islam the wet nurse's husband is considered the actual owner of her milk (it is his semen which caused the pregnancy that stimulated her lactation), which ties of consanguinity exist between his relations and the nursling?
* ''sifat al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', "quality of the milk", which ways of transmission create consanguinity?
* '' ʿadad al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', minimal number of sucklings necessary to establish fosterage;
* ''radāʿ al-kabīr'', suckling of a grown-up person, the maximum age at which the milk-relationship may be established;
* ''al-radāʿ min mayyita'', whether or not the absorption of milk from a dead woman creates the impediment.

''ʿAdad al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', or minimal number of sucklings necessary to establish the milk-kinship, was the subject of extensive debate and ever more elaborate [[Tafsīr|exegetical theorizing]].  For the adherents of older [[Madhhab|schools of law]], such as the [[Maliki]]s and [[Hanafi]]s, one suckling was enough.  Others, such as the [[Shafiʿi|Shāfi'ī]]s, maintained that the minimum number was five or ten, and that in fact a [[Qur'ān|Qur'ainic]] verse had once stipulated this exact number until [[Naskh (tafsir)#Modes|its wording]] had been [[Naskh (tafsir)|expurgated]] from the [[mushaf|Qur'ānic text]]&lt;ref&gt;John Burton, ''The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', {{ISBN|0-7486-0108-2}}, pp. 156-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, ''[[Naskh (tafsir)|Naskh]]'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]²&lt;/ref&gt;  The following tradition (''[[Hadīth|hadith]]'') treats both this topic as well as that of ''radāʿ al-kabīr'', or suckling of an adult:

{{cquote|
She [Aisha] [[Isnad|reported]] that 'in what was revealed of the Qur'ān, ten attested breast-feedings were mentioned as required to establish the marriage-ban.  The ten were replaced by mention of five attested breast-feeds.  The [[Muhammad|Prophet]] died and the five were still being recited in the Qur'ān.  No man ever called upon [[Aisha|'Ā'isha]] who had not completed the minimum number of five sucklings'...

[[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwa b. al-Zubayr]] reports that the Prophet commanded the wife of Abū Hudhayfa to feed her husband's [[mawla|mawlā]] [i.e. servant], Sālim, so that he could go on living with them [upon attaining manhood]. Sāalim b. 'Abdullāh reports that he was never able to visit 'Ā'isha.  She had sent him to be suckled by her sister [[Umm Kulthum (name)|Umm Kulthum]] who, however, suckled him only three times, then fell sick.  Sālim added, 'Thus I never did complete the course of ten sucklings.'&lt;ref&gt;John Burton, ''The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', pp. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

For most jurists ([[Ibn Hazm]] being one prominent exception), the bar to marriage was effective only if the nursling was an infant.  Yet even these allowed that a new relationship resulted between the two; [[Ibn Rushd]], for example, ruled that the woman could now comport herself more freely in front of the nursed adult male, such as appearing before him [[hijab|unveiled]].&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Muhaddith|traditionist]] [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] was forced to resign his position of ''[[mufti]]'' and leave the city of [[Bukhara]] after ruling that two nurslings who suckled from the same farm animal became milk-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shia ===
As per Quranic guidelines, non-mahram (not related) people are forbidden for each other as long as they are not legally married. Shi'ite Islam prohibits marriage to the consanguineous kin of a milk-parent. In Shi'ite societies, the wet nurse was always from a subordinate group, so that marriage to her kin would not have been likely.

== Examples ==
=== Egypt ===
In May 2007 Dr. Izzat Atiyya, lecturer at [[Cairo]]'s [[Al-Azhar University]], issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' that suggested that male and female colleagues could use breastfeeding to get around a religious ban on being alone together.  The ''fatwa'' said that if a woman fed a male colleague "directly from her breast" at least five times they would establish a family bond and thus be allowed to be alone together at work. "Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting, and does not ban marriage," he ruled. "A woman at work can take off the veil or reveal her hair in front of someone whom she breastfed."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6681511.stm Breastfeeding fatwa causes stir]''. BBC. May 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''fatwa'' sparked outrage and embarrassment, with critics deriding the author on [[Egyptian television]]. The university suspended the lecturer, who headed the university's ''[[hadith]]'' department.  The ''fatwa'' was widely publicized by Arabic-language [[satellite television]] channels and was discussed in the [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian parliament]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;''[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL2173061220070521 Lecturer suspended after breastfeeding fatwa]''. Reuters. May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  After being threatened with disciplinary action by the university, Atiyya issued a retraction, saying the ''fatwa'' was "a bad interpretation of a particular case" during the time of Muhammad&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and that it was based on the opinions of only a minority of scholars.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;  Egypt's minister of religious affairs, [[Mahmoud Zaqzouq]], has called for future ''fatwas'' to "be compatible with logic and human nature".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In 2010, a clerical adviser to the Royal court and Ministry of Justice issued a [[fatwa]] suggesting that women should provide breast milk to their employed drivers thereby making them relatives (a concept known as ''Rada'').&lt;ref name=Shaheen&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaheen|first=Abdul Rahman|title=Saudi women use fatwa in driving bid|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-women-use-fatwa-in-driving-bid-1.643431|accessdate=19 September 2010|newspaper=gulfnews.com|date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver could then be trusted to be alone with the woman. The fatwa was ridiculed by women campaigners.

Sam recently took an MA in Choreography at Laban, London, and now makes choreographic dance theatre with  Found Reality Dance Theatre, Cardiff, of which he is artistic director.

''Play Federico For Me'' is the fictional story of Catalan actress [[Margarita Xirgu]], who, during her exile after the Spanish Civil War, depends upon the ghost of Federico García Lorca, in her political-artistic battle with [[Eva Perón]] over the first performance of Lorca's "The House of Bernarda Alba". His translation and adaptation of Lorca's ''[[El público]]'' was produced by the Found Reality Theatre Company in 2005. His 2007 radio play, ''The Sixth Column Has Better Legs'', describes the experiences of four chorus girls in [[Siege of Madrid|Madrid]] while the city is under siege.

''Passion for the Impossible'' tells the story of [[Violette Leduc]] and [[Jean Genet]] in wartime [[Paris]] and ''Red Hot and Blue'' is the story of singer [[Libby Holman]], on the night before her suicide, as she looks back over a life that included a murder trial, an affair with [[Montgomery Clift]] and early [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] campaigning during the [[Second World War]].

In 2003 he taught for the Lemonia Disabled Writers' Residential Course, a project organised by [[Graeae Theatre Company]], Writernet and [[Tŷ Newydd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writernet.co.uk/projects__partners/recent_projects/lemonia_2003/lemonia_full_report.phtml  Lemonia - Full Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001021153/http://www.writernet.co.uk/projects__partners/recent_projects/lemonia_2003/lemonia_full_report.phtml |date=2006-10-01 }}, [http://www.writernet.co.uk/php/map.php?id=294  Writernet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428090957/http://www.writernet.co.uk/php/map.php?id=294 |date=2007-04-28 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8546">'''Spermatogenesis arrest''' is known as the interruption of  [[germinal cell]]s of specific cellular type, which elicits an altered [[spermatozoa]] formation. Spermatogenic arrest is usually due to [[Genetics|genetic]] factors resulting in irreversible [[azoospermia]]. However some cases may be consecutive to hormonal, thermic, or toxic factors and may be reversible either spontaneously or after a specific treatment. Spermatogenic arrest results in either [[oligospermia]] or [[azoospermia]] in men. It is quite a difficult condition to proactively diagnose as it tends to affect those who have normal testicular volumes; a diagnosis can be made however through a [[testicular biopsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin-du Pan |first1=RC|last2=Campana |first2=A |title=Physiopathology of spermatogenic arrest|journal=Fertil Steril | year=1993 | pages=937–46 | volume=60 | issue=6 | pmid=8243695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects== 
Spermatogenic arrest results in either oligospermia or azoospermia as mentioned above. Oligospermia is when extremely low concentrations of fertile sperm are found in semen or ejaculate, while azoospermia is when no fertile sperm are found in the semen or ejaculate. &lt;ref name="Franchimont"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Franchimont|first1=P|last2=Millet|first2=D|last3=Vendrely|first3=J|last4=Letawe|first4=J|last5=Legros|first5=J|last6=Netter| first6=A |title= Relationship between Spermatogenesis and Serum Gonadotropin Levels in Azoospermia and Oligospermia|journal=JCE and M | year=1971 | pages=1003-8 | volume=34 | issue=6 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Causes==
[[Spermatogenesis]] is controlled by [[androgens]], namely [[testosterone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), these are the most important androgens that control the process. FSH uses very specific G-coupled receptors that can be found only on [[Sertoli cells]], this hormone is secreted by the [[pituitary gland]], located in the brain. While testosterone, is produced within the testicles by [[Leydig cells]]. This hormone is the main androgenic steroid in the process of spermatogenesis and is regulated by a hormone known as [[luteinizing hormone]]. FSH plays a role in the spermatogenic capacity of the adult male as it controls the proliferation of Sertoli cells during either the perinatal or pubertal period, or both. &lt;ref name="Gendt"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gendt|first1=KD|last2=Swinnen|first2=JV|last3=Saunders|first3=P|last4=Schoonjans|first4=L|last5=Dewerchin|first5=M|last6=Devos| first6=A|last7=Tan|first7=K|last8=Atanassova|first8=N|last9=Claessens|first9=F|last10=Lecureuil|first10=C|last11=Heyns|first11=W|last12=Carmeliet|first12=P|last13=Guilou|first13=F|last14=Sharpe|first14=RM|last15=Verhoeven|first15=G|title=A Sertoli cell-selective knockout of the androgen receptor causes spermatogenic arrest in meiosis|journal=PNAS | year=2004 | pages=1327-1332 | volume=101 | issue=5 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, testosterone has been found to be the most important hormone that is responsible for both the initiation and the maintenance of spermatogenesis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sharpe |first1=RM|title=Physiopathology of Reproduction| year=1994 | pages=1363-2434|}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is known that spermatogenesis is under the control of androgens, but germ cells (that will become gametes), do not express a functional [[androgen receptor]], which are activated by the binding of androgenic hormones. It has been found through studies that spermatogenetic arrest tends to occur in the late spermatocyte/spermatid stage when the androgen receptor activation in Sertoli cells is interrupted or affected in some way.&lt;ref name="Gendt"/&gt; However, other studies have found that the condition can be due to either genetic factors or a variety of secondary factors. 
===Chemotherapy===
When using [[chemotherapy]] treatments, the possibility of azoospermia is dependent on the dose, duration, number and type of drugs used; the male’s fertility status before the treatment occurred is also taken into consideration. &lt;ref name="Damewood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damewood|first1=MD|last2=Grochow|first2=LB|title=Prospects for fertility after chemotherapy or radiation for neoplastic disease.|journal=Fertil Steril | year=1986 | pages=443-59 | volume=45|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Radiotherapy===
The use of [[radiotherapy]] can cause a temporary bout of azoospermia, this however, is dependant solely on the nature of the dose that are delivered to the testes. Those who experience less than 100 rads will recover in 9-18 months, doses of 200-300 rads will recover in 30 months and doses of 400-600 rads will recover in less than or equal to five years. An irreversible sterility may occur however, for those experiencing a single dose field with 600-800 rads. &lt;ref name="Ash"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ash|first1=P|title=The influence of radiation on fertility in man|journal=Br. J. Radiol.| year=1966 | pages=901-6 | volume=39|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Nutritional Factors===
Studies have shown that [[Vitamin A]] deficiencies in rats &lt;ref name="Ismail"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ismail|first1=N|last2=Morales|first2=C|last3=Clermont|first3=Y|title=Role of spermatogonia in the stage-synchronization of the seminiferous epithelium in vitamin-A deficient rats|journal=Am.J.Anat.| year=1990 | pages=57-63 | volume=188|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, as well as [[zinc]] deficiencies in human males may prevent the normal functioning of spermatogenesis. &lt;ref name="Abbasi"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abbasi|first1=AA|last2=Prasad|first2=AS|last3=Rabbani|first3=P|last4=DuMouchelle|first4=E|title=Experimental zinc deficiency in man: effect on testicular function|journal=J. Lab. Clin. Med.| year=1980 | pages=544-49 | volume=96|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Heat===
Heat may also be the cause of oligozoospermia which can lead to both partial and reversible spermatogenic arrest. &lt;ref name="Kandeel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kandeel|first1=FR|last2=Swerdloff|first2=RS|title=Role of temperature in regulation of and the use of heating as a method for contraception|journal=Fertil.

===Infections===
After the occurrence of an [[infectious disease]] in humans, such as [[hypothermia]] and/or the presence of toxic or infectious factors spermatogenic arrest is likely to follow, however, the condition may be normalized once [[antibiotic]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] treatments have been put into effect. &lt;ref name="Osegbe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Osegbe|first1=DN|title=Testicular function after unilateral bacterial epididymo-orchitis|journal=Eur. Urol.| year=1991 | pages=2014-8 | volume=19|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment== 
Various treatments have been discovered in order to aid those with spermatogenesis arrest, one of these being through the use of [[arginine]]. A study done by Jungling and Bunge in 1976 had a small breakthrough in the field by orally distributing arginine, daily to a group of infertile men. Of the eighteen men in the test group only one experienced an increase in sperm count, while others saw no improvement; these men also experienced a decreased sperm motility. However, one of the patients in the group successfully impregnated his wife while taking part in the study. &lt;ref name="Jungling"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jungling|first1=ML|last2=Bunge|first2=RG|title=The treatment of spermatogenic arrest with arginine|journal=The American Fertility Society | year=1976 | pages=282-3 | volume=27 | issue=3 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, more successful treatments have been developed, such as through the use of gonadotropin treatment. A study conducted by Selman and El-Danasouri in 2006 proved that using long-term gonadotropin therapy on infertile men can improve sperm production quantitatively and increase sperm population in some patients and can in turn provide a successful in-vitro fertilization treatment. These results were found using men that had normal hormone levels but suffered from spermatogenic arrest. These men were treated using FSH treatments and had testicular biopsy’s performed on them before and after the treatment had been administered in order to track progress.  &lt;ref name="Selman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sleman|first1=H|last2=El-Danasouri|first2=I|title=Rescue of spermatogenesis arrest in azoospermic men after long-term gonadotropin treatment|journal=Fertility and Sterility | year=2006| pages=446-468 | volume=86 | issue=2 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9557">Stress-related disorders can include [[mental health disorders]] that are a result of an atypical response to both short and long-term anxiety due to physical, mental, or emotional stress. These disorders can include, but are not limited to [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/geh/climatechange/health_impacts/mental_health/index.cfm|title=Mental Health and Stress-Related Disorders|last=|first=|date=|website=National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stress (psychological)|Stress]] is a conscious or unconscious psychological feeling or physical condition resulting from physical or mental 'positive or negative pressure' that overwhelms adaptive capacities. It is a psychological process initiated by events that threaten, harm or challenge an organism or that exceed available [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] resources and it is characterized by psychological responses that are directed towards adaptation. Stress is wear and tear on the body in response to stressful agents. [[Hans Selye]] called such agents stressors and said they could be physical, physiological, psychological or sociocultural.
And stress is not an anxiety disorder and it is not a normative concept.

A person typically is stressed when positive or negative (e.g., threatening) experiences temporarily strain or overwhelm adaptive capacities. Stress is highly individualized and depends on variables such as the novelty, rate, intensity, duration, or personal interpretation of the input, and genetic or experiential factors. Both acute and chronic stress can intensify morbidity from anxiety disorders. One person's fun may be another person's stressor. For an example, panic attacks are more frequent when the predisposed person is exposed to stressors.

== Stress reduction strategies ==

Stress-reduction strategies can be helpful to many stressed/anxious people. However, many anxious persons cannot concentrate enough to use such strategies effectively for acute relief. (Most stress-reduction techniques have their greatest utility as elements of a prevention plan that attempts to raise one's threshold to anxiety-provoking experiences.)

=== The five R's of stress and anxiety reduction===

Five core concepts are used to reduce anxiety or stress.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Benson H. The Relaxation Response. New York: Morrow, 1975; and Benson H, Beary JF, Carol MP. The relaxation response. Psychiatry 37:37-46, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''R'''ecognition of the causes and sources of the threat or distress; education and consciousness raising.
*'''R'''elationships identified for support, help, reassurance 
*'''R'''emoval from (or of) the threat or stressor; managing the stimulus.
*'''R'''elaxation through techniques such as meditation, massage, breathing exercises, or imagery.
*'''R'''e-engagement through managed re-exposure and desensitization.

== Defenses ==
{{see also|Defense mechanism}}
Defense mechanisms are behavior patterns primarily concerned with protecting ego. Presumably the process is unconscious and the aim is to fool oneself. It is intra psychic processes serving to provide relief from emotional conflict and anxiety. Conscious efforts are frequently  made for the same reasons, but true defense mechanisms are unconscious.

Some of the common defense mechanisms are:
compensation, conversion, denial, displacement, dissociation, idealization, identification, incorporation, introjection, projection, rationalization, reaction formation, regression, sublimation, substitution, symbolization and undoing.

=== Summary ===

The major function of these psychological defenses is to prevent the experiencing of painful emotions. There are several major problems with their use.
 
*Many of these defenses create new problems that are as bad, or worse, than the emotional problems they mask. Some may be just plain destructive. Example: rejection literally destroys the relationships we care most about.

*These defenses distort person's ability to perceive reality as it is. And this prevents them from dealing with their problems in a constructive way.

*These defenses do not get rid of the painful feelings. In fact, by masking them so that person doesn't feel them, they effectively store them up within themselves.  Emotions are discharged through expression, so by denying themselves the chance to feel them, they also deny themselves the ability to get rid of them.

*These defenses do not just screen out painful emotions. They are, in fact, defenses against all emotion. So the more effective person's defenses become in protecting them from painful feelings, the less able they are to experience the joyful and happy feelings that make life worth living.

*These defenses are not perfect. As more and more hurt is stored away, a tension is developed. Person becomes increasingly anxious, nervous, and irritable. They become emotionally unpredictable. And when defenses weaken, as they will from time to time, person may experience emotional explosions.

*These defenses prevent person from knowing what is wrong, but they do not prevent us from feeling bad.

== Stress as in clinical medicine ==
=== Acute stress disorder ===
[[Acute stress disorder]] occurs in individuals without any other apparent psychiatric disorder, in response to exceptional physical or psychological stress. While severe, such reactions usually subside within hours or days. The stress may be an overwhelming traumatic experience (e.g. accident, battle, physical assault, rape) or unusually sudden change in social circumstances of the individual, such as multiple bereavement.
Individual vulnerability and coping capacity play a role in the occurrence and severity of acute stress reactions, as evidenced by the fact that not all people exposed to exceptional stress develop symptoms. However, an acute stress disorder falls under the class of an anxiety disorder.  

====Symptoms====
Symptoms show considerable variation but usually include:
An initial state of "DAZE" with some constriction of the field of consciousness and narrowing of attention, inability to comprehend stimuli, disorientation. Followed either by further withdrawal from the surrounding situation to the extent of a dissociative stupor or by agitating and over activity.

====Autonomic signs of "panic anxiety"  ====
The signs are: tachycardia (increased heart rate), sweating, hyperventilation (increased breathing).
The symptoms usually appear within minutes of the impact of the stressful stimulus and disappear within 2–3 days.

=== Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)===
{{Main|Post-traumatic stress disorder}}
This arises after response to a stressful event or situation of an exceptionally threatening nature and likely to cause pervasive distress (great pain, anxiety, sorrow, acute physical or mental suffering, affliction, trouble) in almost anyone.

====Causes ====
The causes of PTSD are: natural or human disasters, war, serious accident, witness of violent death of others, violent attack, being the victim of sexual abuse, rape, torture, terrorism or hostage taking. 

The predisposing factors are: personality traits and previous history of psychiatric illness.

==== Typical symptoms ====

Flashbacks are the repeated reliving of the trauma in the form of intrusive memories or dreams, intense distress at exposure to events that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event, including  anniversaries of the trauma, avoidance of activities and situations reminiscent of the trauma, emotional blunting or "numbness", a sense of detachment from other people, autonomic hyperarousal with hypervigilance, an enhanced startle reaction and insomnia, marked anxiety and depression and, occasionally, suicidal ideation.

====Treatment====
Psychiatric consultation: exploration of memories of the traumatic event, relief of associated symptoms and counseling.

==== Prognosis ====
The course is fluctuating but recovery can be expected in the majority of cases. Few people may show chronic course over many years and a transition to an enduring personality change

== In surgery ==
{{Main|Surgical stress}}
=== Stress ulceration ===
[[Stress ulcer#Stress ulceration|Stress ulceration]] is a single or multiple fundic mucosal ulcers that causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and develops during the severe physiologic stress of serious illness. It can also cause mucosal erosions and superficial hemorrhages in patients who are critically ill, or in those who are under extreme physiologic stress, causing blood loss that can require blood transfusion.    

Ordinary peptic ulcers are found commonly in the “gastric antrum and the duodenum” whereas stress ulcers are found commonly in “fundic mucosa and can be located anywhere within the stomach and proximal duodenum”.

'''Tapela and Another v Attorney General and Others''' is a legal case in [[Botswana]] concerning the right of two [[HIV-positive]] non-citizen prisoners to access [[antiretroviral]] (ARV) medication at state expense. On 22 August 2014, the Botswana High Court in [[Gaborone]] ordered the government of Botswana to provide ARV medication to the prisoners.

==Background==
The case was brought by two Zimbabwean citizens who were imprisoned in Gaborone Central Prison and the Botswana Network on Ethics, Law and HIV/AIDS (BONELA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wongai Zhangazha |url=http://www.theindependent.co.zw/2014/06/20/hiv-zim-prisoners-take-botswana-court/ |title=HIV+ Zim prisoners take Botswana to court |publisher=Zimbabwe Independent |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two prisoners were both diagnosed as HIV-positive in prison. They were denied ARV treatment despite that their physical conditions met the treatment criteria under the government's Treatment Guidelines. The government denied them ARV treatment on the basis that they were not citizens. HIV-positive prisoners who were citizens were given access to ARV treatment at state expense in terms of the government's policy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Victor Baatweng |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/08/botswana-legal-battle-with-foreign-inmates-2014861947365121.html |title=Botswana in legal battle with foreign inmates |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=2014-08-10 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
The applicants brought a legal challenge against the government's refusal to provide the inmates with ARV treatment in the High Court in Gaborone. They argued that their denial of access to treatment, and the policy underlying the government's refusal to provide treatment, were unlawful and unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Thamani Shabani |url=http://www.dailynews.gov.bw/mobile/news-details.php?nid=12028&amp;flag= |title=Court reserves judgement in ARV case |publisher=Botswana Daily News |date=2014-06-12 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Default judgment===
The state respondents initially failed to defend the application. Default judgment was therefore issued in the applicants' favour in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mthokozisi Dube |url=http://www.chronicle.co.zw/botswana-inmates-to-get-arvs/ |title=Botswana inmates to get ARVs |publisher=The Chronicle |date=2014-08-23 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The default judgment was rescinded with the parties’ consent on 19 March 2014.

===High Court judgment===
The merits of the case were argued in the Gaborone High Court on 10 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=SABC News |url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/b86f04004450c47dac75afb0b8d8c2ff/Botswana-court-to-hear-arguments-in-ARV-treatment-case-20141006 |title=Botswana court to hear arguments in ARV treatment case |date=2014-06-10 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 2014, Judge Bengame Sechele ruled in the applicants' favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Al Jazeera |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/08/botswana-pay-all-inmates-hiv-drugs-2014823193954603359.html |title=Botswana to pay for all inmates' HIV drugs |date=2014-08-23 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held  that the policy denying foreign prisoners ARV treatment was unlawful in terms of the [[common law]], [[statutory law]] and the [[Constitution of Botswana]]. The Court held that denying the prisoners ARV treatment unjustifiably limited their rights to life, equality, and freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment. The Court ordered the Botswana government to enroll all foreign prisoners who meet the treatment criteria on ARV treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Godfrey Ganetsang |url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/article.php?NewsID=20870&amp;GroupID=1 |title=High Court orders Botswana to provide foreign inmates with ARVs |publisher=Sunday Standard |date=2014-08-25 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government respondents initially indicated an intention to comply with the Court's order but have since appealed the High Court decision to the Botswana Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mpho Tebele |url=http://www.southerntimesafrica.com/news_article.php?id=10455&amp;title=Bots%20appeals%20against%20giving%20foreign%20inmates%20ARVs%20%20%20&amp;type=64#.VIFPaDGUeAU |title=Bots appeals against giving foreign inmates ARVs |publisher=The Southern Times |date=2014-10-20 |accessdate=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water cribs''' are offshore structures that collect water from close to the bottom of a lake to supply a pumping station onshore. The name crib is derived from the function of the structure—to surround and protect the intake shaft. Cities supplied with drinking water collected by water cribs include [[Chicago]], where two of the nine originally built cribs are in active use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2014/March/03.26.14bancmap.pdf|title=2014 DWM Capital Plan|last=|first=|date=2014|website=City of Chicago|publisher=City of Chicago|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water cribs were also used as residences for caretakers who would live in the structure year round. Jobs included clearing debris and maintaining valves, gears, and instruments to keep the water flowing. These jobs have since been automated with periodic maintenance leaving no need for a full time caretaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2015/08/23/Water-intake-crib-was-once-a-home.html|title=Toledo water intake crib was once a home|work=www.toledoblade.com|author=Ignazio Messina|date=August 23, 2015|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drinking water supply and sanitation in India''' continue to be inadequate, despite longstanding efforts by the various levels of government and communities at improving coverage. The level of investment in water and [[sanitation]], albeit low by international standards, has increased in size during the 2000s. For example, in 1980 rural sanitation coverage was estimated at 1% and reached 95% in 2018.&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="health_11thplan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/11th/11_v2/11v2_ch3.pdf|author=[[Planning Commission of India]]|title=Health and Family Welfare and AYUSH : 11th Five Year Plan|accessdate=19 September 2010}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the share of Indians with access to improved sources of water has increased significantly from 72% in 1990 to 88% in 2008.&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt; At the same time, local government institutions in charge of operating and maintaining the infrastructure are seen as weak and lack the financial resources to carry out their functions. In addition, only two Indian cities have continuous water supply and according to an estimate from 2018 about 8% of Indians still lack access to [[improved sanitation]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkyXKPBKJI0C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;|title=State of Urban Services in India's Cities: Spending and Financing|first1=Kala Seetharam|last1=Sridhar|first2=A. Venugopal|last2=Reddy|date=24 July 2018|publisher=Public Affairs Centre|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[WaterAid|Water Aid]] estimated as many as 10 million Indians, or 5 percent of Indians living in urban areas, are live without adequate sanitation. India comes in first place globally for having the greatest number of urban-dwelling inhabitants living without sanitation. India tops the urban sanitation crisis, has the largest amount of urban dwellers without sanitation, and the most open defecators with over 5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The State of the World’s Toilet 2016| url=http://wateraidindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Overflowing-cities-The-State-of-the-Worlds-Toilets-2016.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Overflowing Cities: 5 Million Indians Still Without Toilets| url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/55250| accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of innovative approaches to improve water supply and sanitation have been tested in India, in particular in the early 2000s. These include demand-driven approaches in rural water supply since 1999, [[community-led total sanitation]], a public-private partnerships to improve the continuity of urban water supply in Karnataka, and the use of [[microcredit for water supply and sanitation|micro credits for water supply and sanitation]] in order to improve access to water and sanitation.

== Access ==
In 2015, 88% of the total population had access to at least basic water, or 96% in urban areas and 85% in rural areas. The term "at least basic water" is a new term since 2016, and is related to the previously used "[[improved water source]]". In India in 2015, 44% had access to "at least [[basic sanitation]]", or 65% in urban areas and 34% in rural areas. In 2015, there were still 150 million people without access to "at least basic" water and 708 million without access to "at least basic" [[sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washwatch.org/en/countries/india/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      India|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier years, in 2010, the UN estimated based on Indian statistics that 525 million people practice [[open defecation]].&lt;ref&gt;WASHwatch [[WASHwatch]]:[https://washwatch.org/en/countries/india/summary/statistics/],&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012 Minister of Rural Development [[Jairam Ramesh]] stated India is the world's largest "open air toilet". He also remarked that Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan have better sanitation records.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph:[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9354258/India-the-worlds-largest-open-air-toilet.html India the world's largest open air toilet], 25 June 2012, retrieved on 28 June 2012. According to JMP data for 2010 the share of people defecating in the open was 64% in Nepal, 63% in India, 37% in Pakistan, 29% in Afghanistan and 20% in Bangladesh. According to these figures, the statement by Jairam Ramesh is correct except for Nepal.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 88% of the population in India had access to an [[improved water source]], but only 31% had access to [[improved sanitation]]. In rural areas, where 72% of India’s population lives, the respective shares are 84% for water and only 21% for [[sanitation]]. In urban areas, 96% had access to an improved water source and 54% to improved sanitation. Access has improved substantially since 1990 when it was estimated to stand at 72% for water and 18% for sanitation.&lt;ref name="JMP"&gt;UNICEF/WHO [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] estimate for 2008 based on the 2006 [[Demographic and Health Survey]], the 2001 census, other data and the extrapolation of previous trends to 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Indian norms, access to improved [[water supply]] exists if at least 40&amp;nbsp;liters/capita/day of safe drinking water are provided within a distance of 1.6&amp;nbsp;km or 100&amp;nbsp;meter of elevation difference, to be relaxed as per field conditions. There should be at least one pump per 250 persons.

In urban areas, those that do not receive water from the piped network often have to purhchase expensive water of dubious quality from private water vendors. For example, in Delhi water trucks get water from illegal wells on the banks of the Yamuna River for 0.75 rupees per gallon (about USD 2.70/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sethi|first1=Aman|title=At the Mercy of the Water Mafia, Foreign Policy, July/August 2015|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/17/at-the-mercy-of-the-water-mafia-india-delhi-tanker-gang-scarcity/|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water supply continuity ===
[[File:Girls carrying water in India.jpg|thumb|Four girls carrying water in India]]

'''Challenges'''. As of 2010, only two cities in India — [[Trivandrum]] and [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]] — get continuous water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Only 2 Indian cities have continuous water supply'|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/-only-2-indian-cities-have-continuous-water-supply-110032300101_1.html|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=24 August 2013|author=quoting V Srinivasa Chary, director, Centre for Energy, Environment, Urban Governance and Infrastructure Development at the [[Administrative Staff College of India]], Hyderabad.|date=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 none of the 35 Indian cities with a population of more than one million distributed water for more than a few hours per day, despite generally sufficient infrastructure. Owing to inadequate pressure people struggle to collect water even when it is available. According to the [[World Bank]], none have performance indicators that compare with average international standards.&lt;ref name="WB 2006b"&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/05/03/000012009_20060503095630/Rendered/INDEX/36065.txt Delhi Water Supply &amp; Sewerage Project, Project Information Document Concept Stage], 15 March 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017074753/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/05/03/000012009_20060503095630/Rendered/INDEX/36065.txt |date=17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study by the Asian Development Bank showed that in 20 cities the average duration of supply was only 4.3&amp;nbsp;hours per day. None of the 20 cities had continuous supply. The longest duration of supply was 12&amp;nbsp;hours per day in [[Chandigarh]], and the lowest was 0.3&amp;nbsp;hours per day in [[Rajkot]].&lt;ref name="ADB 2007, p. 3"&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[http://www.adb.org/publications/2007-benchmarking-and-data-book-water-utilities-india 2007 Benchmarking and Data Book of Water Utilities in India], 2007, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; According to the results of a Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) Program carried out by the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) in 2006 in 28 cities, the average duration of supply was 3.3 hours per day, with a range from one hour every three days to 18 hours per day.&lt;ref name="WSP Kuwasip"/&gt; In [[Delhi]] residents receive water only a few hours per day because of inadequate management of the distribution system. This results in contaminated water and forces households to complement a deficient public water service at prohibitive 'coping' costs; the poor suffer most from this situation. For example, according to a 1996 survey households in Delhi spent an average of {{INRConvert|2.182|k|1}} per year in time and money to cope with poor service levels.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Helene Zerah: Unreliable supply in Delhi, Delhi 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This is more than two times as much as the 2001 water bill of about {{USD}}18 per year of a Delhi household that uses 20&amp;nbsp;cubic meters per month.

'''Achievements'''. [[Jamshedpur]], a city in [[Jharkhand]] with 573,000 inhabitants, provided 25% of its residents with continuous water supply in 2009.&lt;ref name="Every Drop Counts"/&gt; [[Navi Mumbai]], a planned city with more than 1m inhabitants, has achieved continuous supply for about half its population as of January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Comment by David Foster, Senior Urban Advisor at The Administrative Staff College of India, as part of the [[LinkedIn]] discussion on [http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers&amp;discussionID=2484828&amp;gid=39697&amp;commentID=2869318&amp;trk=view_disc "What are the most serious barriers to providing Continuously Pressurized (24/7) Water Supply?"], 11 April 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Badlapur]], another city in the [[Mumbai Conurbation]] with a population of 140,000, has achieved continuous supply in 3 out of 10 operating zones, covering 30% of its population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.box.net/shared/g1me3soxgg Dr. Sanjay and V.

=== Sanitation ===
Most Indians depend on on-site sanitation facilities which means mainly [[pit latrine]]s in rural areas. In rural areas, the government has been promoting community-led sanitation approaches such as the [[Total Sanitation Campaign]], with some success. In urban areas, a good practice example is the Slum Sanitation Program in Mumbai that has provided access to sanitation for a quarter million slum dwellers.&lt;ref name="WB 2006a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTWSS/0,,contentMDK:20879544~menuPK:3810623~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:337302,00.html|title=Water Supply &amp; Sanitation – Reaching the Poor Through Sustainable Partnerships: The Slum Sanitation Program in Mumbai, India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;[http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0705/feature3/text3.html Mumbai Slum: Dharavi], ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sewerage, where available, is often in a bad state. In Delhi the sewerage network has lacked maintenance over the years and overflow of raw [[sewage]] in open drains is common, due to blockage, settlements and inadequate pumping capacities.&lt;ref name="creaking" /&gt; The capacity of the 17 existing [[wastewater treatment plants]] in Delhi is adequate to cater a daily production of waste water of less than 50% of the drinking water produced.&lt;ref name="WB 2006b"/&gt; Of the 892&amp;nbsp;million people in the world that [[open defecation|defecate openly]], some 150&amp;nbsp;million live in India, making it the country with the highest number of people who defecate in the open.&lt;ref name="rediff_toilet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/oct/15/in-india-665-million-defecate-in-open-un.htm|title=665&amp;nbsp;million Indians still defecate in open: UN|publisher=Rediff news|author=Betwa Sharma|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has serious public health implications.

A specific Indian problem is also the (officially prohibited) "[[manual scavenging]]" which is connected to the officially banned caste system, and relates to unsafe and undignified emptying of toilets and pits, as well as handling of raw, untreated [[human waste|human excreta]].

===Environment===

{{See also|Environment of India}}

As of 2003, it was estimated that only 27% of India's [[wastewater]] was being treated, with the remainder flowing into rivers, canals, groundwater or the sea.,&lt;ref name="GTZ"&gt;GTZ:[http://www.gtz.de/en/dokumente/en-innovative-ecosan-network-india-progress-text-2006.pdf ECOLOGICAL SANITATION – A NEED OF TODAY!

== Health impact ==
{{see also|Health_in_India#Health_Issues}}
The lack of adequate sanitation and safe water has significant negative health impacts including [[diarrhoea]], referred to by travellers as the "Delhi Belly",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/travelers_diarrhea/article.htm|title=Travelers' Diarrhea: Learn About Antibiotics and Treatment|author=John P. Cunha, DO, FACOEP|work=MedicineNet|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experienced by about 10 million visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullstopindia.com/2010/01/10-ways-to-avoid-travelers-diarrhea-in-india/|title=Fullstopindia.com Is For Sale|website=www.fullstopindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most visitors to India recover quickly and otherwise receive proper care.  The dismal working conditions of sewer workers are another concern. A survey of the working conditions of sewage workers in Delhi showed that most of them suffer from chronic diseases, respiratory problems, skin disorders, allergies, headaches and eye infections.&lt;ref&gt;Survey by Dr Ashish Mittal, reported by Rupa Jha for the BBC on 7 February 2009 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7872770.stm 'My life cleaning Delhi's sewers']&lt;/ref&gt;. Various other cities in India have a record of unsafe drinking water. Municipal water in Visakhapatnam is contaminated with too much chlorine and pharmaceuticals which cause headache, short term memory loss and loss of focus.

== Water supply and water resources ==
Depleting ground [[water table]] and deteriorating ground water quality are threatening the sustainability of both urban and rural water supply in many parts of India. The supply of cities that depend on surface water is threatened by pollution, increasing [[water scarcity]] and conflicts among users. For example, [[Bangalore]] depends to a large extent on water pumped since 1974 from the [[Kaveri]] river, whose waters are disputed between the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. As in other Indian cities, the response to water scarcity is to transfer more water over large distances at high costs. In the case of Bangalore, the {{INRConvert|33.84|b|1}} Kaveri Stage IV project, Phase II, includes the supply of 500,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meter of water per day over a distance of 100&amp;nbsp;km, thus increasing the city's supply by two-thirds.&lt;ref&gt;Projects Monitor:[http://www.projectsmonitor.com/NEWPROJECTS/stageiv-of-cauvery-water-supply-scheme-underway Stage-IV of Cauvery water supply scheme underway] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715123433/http://www.projectsmonitor.com/NEWPROJECTS/stageiv-of-cauvery-water-supply-scheme-underway |date=15 July 2011 }}, 17 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwssb.org/water_source_sources.html Bangalore Water Supply and Sanitation Board:Water Sources]. Retrieved 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some coastal areas seawater desalination is becoming an important source of drinking water supply. For example, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board has put into service a first large seawater desalination plant with a capacity of 100,000 m3 per day at Minjur in 2010. A contract for a second plant with the same capacity at Nemmeli was awarded in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence: [http://www.globalwaterintel.com/news/2010/1/chennai-get-more-desal-after-nemmeli-award.html Chennai to get more desal after Nemmeli award], 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==
Water supply and sanitation is a [[States of India|State]] responsibility under the Indian Constitution. States may give the responsibility to the [[Panchayati Raj]] Institutions (PRI) in rural areas or municipalities in urban areas, called [[Urban Local Bodies]] (ULB). At present, states generally plan, design and execute water supply schemes (and often operate them) through their State Departments (of Public Health Engineering or Rural Development Engineering) or State Water Boards.

Highly centralised decision-making and approvals at the state level, which are characteristic of the Indian civil service, affect the management of water supply and sanitation services. For example, according to the World Bank in the state of Punjab the process of approving designs is centralised with even minor technical approvals reaching the office of chief engineers. A majority of decisions are made in a very centralised manner at the headquarters.&lt;ref name="World Bank Punjab 2006, Annex 1"&gt;World Bank:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/11/27/000020953_20061127111653/Rendered/INDEX/37377.txt Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, Project Appraisal Document ], 2006, Annex 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the Indian constitution and relevant state legislations were amended in order to decentralise certain responsibilities, including water supply and sanitation, to municipalities. Since the assignment of responsibilities to municipalities is a state responsibility, different states have followed different approaches. According to a Planning Commission report of 2003 there is a trend to decentralise capital investment to engineering departments at the [[Districts of India|district]] level and operation and maintenance to district and gram panchayat levels.&lt;ref&gt;Planning Commission:[http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/wtrsani.pdf India Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2002], a WHO-UNICEF sponsored study, 2003, p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy and regulation ===
The responsibility for water supply and sanitation at the central and state level is shared by various Ministries. At the central level three Ministries have responsibilities in the sector: The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (until 2011 the Department of Drinking Water Supply in the Ministry of Rural Development) is responsible for rural water supply and sanitation; the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (India)|Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation]] and the Ministry of Urban Development share the responsibility for urban water supply and sanitation. Except for the National Capital Territory of Delhi and other Union Territories, the central Ministries only have an advisory capacity and a limited role in funding. Sector policy thus is a prerogative of state governments.

'''National Urban Sanitation Policy'''. In November 2008 the government of India launched a national urban sanitation policy with the goal of creating what it calls "totally sanitized cities" that are open-defecation free, safely collect and treat all their wastewater, eliminate [[manual scavenging]] and collect and dispose solid waste safely. As of 2010, 12 states were in the process of elaborating or had completed state sanitation strategies on the basis of the policy. 120 cities are in the process of preparing city sanitation plans. Furthermore, 436 cities rated themselves in terms of their achievements and processes concerning sanitation in an effort supported by the Ministry of Urban Development with the assistance of several donors. About 40% of the cities were in the "red category" (in need of immediate remedial action), more than 50% were in the "black category" (needing considerable improvement) and only a handful of cities were in the "blue category" (recovering). Not a single city was included in the "green category" (healthy and clean city).  The rating serves as a baseline to measure improvements in the future and to prioritize actions. The government intends to award a prize called Nirmal Shahar Puraskar to the best sanitation performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Water and Sanitation Program|title=New Sanitation Award Creates Healthy Competition Among Indian Cities|url=http://www.wsp.org/wsp/node/1040|accessdate=21 August 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service provision ===
'''Urban areas'''. Institutional arrangements for water supply and sanitation in Indian cities vary greatly. Typically, a state-level agency is in charge of planning and investment, while the local government ([[Urban Local Bodies]]) is in charge of operation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="NIUA"/&gt; Some of the largest cities have created municipal water and sanitation utilities that are legally and financially separated from the local government. However, these utilities remain weak in terms of financial capacity. In spite of decentralisation, ULBs remain dependent on capital subsidies from state governments. Tariffs are also set by state governments, which often even subsidise operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/10th/volume2/v2_ch6_1.pdf 10th Plan, p. 613]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when no separate utility exists, there is no separation of accounts for different activities within a municipality. Some states and cities have non-typical institutional arrangements. For example, in [[Rajasthan]] the sector is more centralised and the state government is also in charge of operation and maintenance, while in [[Mumbai]] the sector is more decentralised and local government is also in charge of planning and investment.&lt;ref name="NIUA"/&gt; In 2012 the Delhi Jal Board contracted out operations and management in three zones of the city to private companies under performance-based contracts to reduce non-revenue water.

'''Private sector participation.''' The private sector plays a limited, albeit recently increasing role in operating and maintaining urban water systems on behalf of ULBs. For example, the Jamshedpur Utilities &amp; Services Company (Jusco), a subsidiary of [[Tata Steel]], has a lease contract for [[Jamshedpur]] (Jharkhand), a management contract in [[Haldia]] (West Bengal), another contract in [[Mysore]] (Karnataka) and since 2007 a contract for the reduction of [[non-revenue water]] in parts of [[Bhopal]] (Madhya Pradhesh).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/ The Financial Express]: [http://www.financialexpress.com/news/jusco-reaches-bhopal-aims-for-other-cities-under-jnurm/212545/ Jusco reaches Bhopal, aims for other cities under JNURM], 25 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The French water company [[Veolia]] won a management contract in three cities in [[Karnataka]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTWAT/Resources/4602122-1213366294492/5106220-1234469721549/21.5_India_Karnatka_Alvarado.pdf Introducing 24/7 water supply – Challenges in three cities in Karnataka, India].

'''Rural areas'''. There are about a 100,000 rural water supply systems in India. At least in some states, responsibility for service provision is in the process of being partially transferred from State Water Boards and [[Districts of India|district]] governments to [[Panchayati Raj]] Institutions (PRI) at the block or village level (there were about 604 districts and 256,000 villages in India in 2002, according to [[Subdivisions of India]]. Blocks are an intermediate level between districts and villages). Where this transfer has been initiated, it seems to be more advanced for single-village water schemes than for more complex multi-village water schemes. Despite their professed role Panchayati Raj Institutions, play only a limited role in provision of rural water supply and sanitation as of 2006. There has been limited success in implementing decentralisation, partly due to low priority by some state governments.&lt;ref name="World Bank Punjab 2006, Annex 1"/&gt; Rural sanitation is typically provided by households themselves in the form of latrines.

== Innovative approaches ==
A number of innovative approaches to improve water supply and sanitation have been tested in India, in particular in the early 2000s. These include [[community-led total sanitation]], demand-driven approaches in rural water supply, a public-private partnerships to improve the continuity of urban water supply in Karnataka, and the use of [[microcredit for water supply and sanitation|microcredits in water supply and sanitation]] to women in order to improve access to water.

=== Total Sanitation Campaign ===
{{main|Total Sanitation Campaign}}
In 1999 a demand-driven and people-centered sanitation program was initiated under the name [[Total Sanitation Campaign]] (TSC) which has some similarities with [[Community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS), but is not the same. It evolved from the limited achievements of the first structured programme for rural sanitation in India, the Central Rural Sanitation Programme, which had minimal community participation. The main goal of Total Sanitation Campaign is to eradicate the practice of [[open defecation]] by 2017. Community-led total sanitation is not focused on building infrastructure, but on preventing open defecation through self-awareness and shame. In Maharashtra where the program started more than 2000 [[Gram Panchayat]]s have achieved "open defecation free" status. Villages that achieve this status receive monetary rewards and high publicity under a program called Nirmal Gram Puraskar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irc.nl/page/103 IRC]:[http://www.irc.nl/page/35966 India: Unrealistic approach hampers rural sanitation programme] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005020454/http://www.irc.nl/page/35966 |date=5 October 2008 }}, 1 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Development Studies:[http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/country/india Community-led total sanitation:India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benny George:[http://www.ivcs.org.uk/IJRS/April2009/incentivising%20sanitation%20coverage%20in%20rural%20india.pdf Nirmal Gram Puraskar: A Unique Experiment in Incentivising Sanitation Coverage in Rural India]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, International Journal of Rural Studies (IJRS), Vol. 16, No. 1, April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A new sanitation campaign was launched as [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Mission) in October 2014.

As of 1 December 2017, Total Sanitation Coverage throughout India has risen to 73% up from 42% on October 2, 2014, the day Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://sbm.gov.in/sbmdashboard/ |title=Swachh Bharat Abhiyan Report Stats |date=12 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928152538/http://sbm.gov.in/sbmreport/home.aspx |archivedate=28 September 2017 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand-driven approaches in rural water supply ===
Most rural water supply schemes in India use a centralised, supply-driven approach, i.e. a government institution designs a project and has it built with little community consultation and no capacity building for the community, often requiring no water fees to be paid for its subsequent operation. Since 2002 the Government of India has rolled out at the national level a program to change the way in which water and sanitation services are supported in rural areas. The program, called ''Swajaldhara'', decentralises service delivery responsibility to rural local governments and user groups. Under the new approach communities are being consulted and trained, and users agree up-front to pay a tariff that is set at a level sufficiently high to cover operation and maintenance costs. It also includes measures to promote sanitation and to improve hygiene behaviour. The national program follows a pilot program launched in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Rural
Development, Department of Drinking Water Supply:[http://ddws.gov.in/swajaldhara.htm Swajaldhara] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510030643/http://ddws.gov.in/swajaldhara.htm |date=10 May 2010 }}, updated on 31 March 2009. Retrieved 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2008 World Bank study in 10 Indian states, ''Swajaldhara'' results in lower capital costs, lower administrative costs and better service quality compared to the supply-driven approach. In particular, the study found that the average full cost of supply-driven schemes is {{INRConvert|0.038|k|1}} per cubic meter, while it is only {{INRConvert|0.026|k|1}} per cubic meter for demand-driven schemes. These costs include capital, operation and maintenance costs, administrative costs and coping costs incurred by users of malfunctioning systems. Coping costs include travelling long distances to obtain water, standing in long queues, storing water and repairing failed systems. Among the surveyed systems that were built using supply-driven approach system breakdowns were common, the quantity and quality of water supply were less than foreseen in designs, and 30% of households did not get daily supply in summer. The poor functioning of one system sometimes leads to the construction of another system, so that about 30% of households surveyed were served by several systems. As of 2008 only about 10% of rural water schemes built in India used a demand-driven approach. Since water users have to pay lower or no tariffs under the supply-driven approach, this discourages them to opt for a demand-driven approach, even if the likelihood of the systems operating on a sustainable basis is higher under a demand-driven approach.&lt;ref name="Misra"&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/07/23/000333037_20080723003033/Rendered/PDF/447910PP0P09411741301PUBLIC10PAPER2.pdf World Bank:Inefficiency of Rural Water Supply Schemes in India], Smita Misra, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achieving continuous water supply in Karnataka ===
In the cities of [[Hubli]], [[Belgaum]] and [[Gulbarga]] in the state of [[Karnataka]], the private operator [[Veolia]] increased water supply from once every 2–15&amp;nbsp;days for 1–2&amp;nbsp;hours, to 24&amp;nbsp;hours per day for 180,000 people (12% of the population of the 3 cities) within 2&amp;nbsp;years (2006–2008). This was achieved by carefully selecting and ring-fencing demonstration zones (one in each city), renovating the distribution network, installing meters, introducing a well-functioning commercial system, and effective grass-roots social intermediation by an NGO, all without increasing the amount of bulk water supplied. The project, known by its acronym as KUWASIP (Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project), was supported by a {{USD}}39.5&amp;nbsp;million loan from the [[World Bank]]. It constitutes a milestone for India, where no large city so far has achieved continuous water supply. The project is expected to be scaled-up to cover the entire area of the three cities.&lt;ref name="WSP Kuwasip"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank Water and Sanitation Program (WSP):|title=The Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project: 24x7 Water Supply is Achievable|url=http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/WSP_Karnataka-water-supply.pdf|accessdate=20 August 2012|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="web.worldbank.org"/&gt;

=== Microcredit for water connections in Tamil Nadu ===
{{Further|Microcredit for water supply and sanitation}}
In [[Tiruchirapalli]] in Tamil Nadu, the NGO Gramalaya, established in 1987, and women self-help groups promote access to water supply and sanitation by the poor through microcredit. Among the benefits are that women can spend more time with their children, earn additional income, and sell surplus water to neighbours. This money contributes to her repayment of the WaterCredit loan. The initiative is supported by the US-based non-profit [[Water Partners International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water.org/waterpartners.aspx?pgID=1015 Water Partners International:Mrs. Manonmani's Story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616043138/http://www.water.org/waterpartners.aspx?pgID=1015 |date=16 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company ===

The Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company (JUSCO) provides water and sanitation services in [[Jamshedpur]], a major industrial center in East India that is home to [[Tata Steel]]. Until 2004 a division of Tata Steel provided water to the city’s residents. However, service quality was poor with intermittent supply, high water losses and no metering.&lt;ref name="Every Drop Counts"&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[http://www.aquasafecanada.com/mirror/every-drop-counts/every-drop-counts.pdf Every Drop Counts. Learning from good practices in eight Asian cities]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2010, accessed on 26 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; To improve this situation and to establish good practices that could be replicated in other Indian cities, JUSCO was set up as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel in 2004.

Efficiency and service quality improved substantially over the following years. The level on [[non-revenue water]] decreased from an estimated 36% in 2005 to 10% in 2009; one quarter of residents received continuous water supply (although the average supply remained at only 7&amp;nbsp;hours per day) in 2009; the share of metered connections increased from 2% in 2007 to 26% in 2009; the number of customers increased; and the company recovered its operating costs plus a portion of capital costs. Identifying and legalising illegal connections was an important element in the reduction of non-revenue water. The utility prides itself today of the good drinking water quality provided and encourages its customers to drink from the tap. The utility also operates a wastewater treatment plant that meets discharge standards. The private utility pays salaries that are higher than civil service salaries and conducts extensive training programs for its staff. It has also installed a modern system to track and resolve customer complaints. Furthermore, it conducts independent annual customer satisfaction surveys. JUSCO’s vision is to be the preferred provider of water supply and other urban services throughout India. Together with Ranhill Malaysia it won a 25-year concession contract for providing the water supply in [[Haldia]] City, West Bengal.&lt;ref name="Every Drop Counts"/&gt;

== Efficiency of utilities==
There are only limited data on the operating efficiency of utilities in India, and even fewer data on the efficiency of investments. Two indicators of operating efficiency are non-revenue water and labour productivity.

'''Non-revenue water'''. According to the results of a Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) Program carried out by the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) in 2006 in 28 cities, the average level of [[non-revenue water]] (NRW) was 44 percent.&lt;ref name="WSP Kuwasip"/&gt; Another study of 20 cities by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission with the support of the Asian Development Bank showed an average level of [[non-revenue water]] (NRW) of 32%. However, 5 out of the 20 cities did not provide any data. For those that provided data there probably is a large margin of error, since only 25% of connections are metered, which makes it very difficult to estimate non-revenue water. Also, three utilities in the sample show NRW levels of less than 20%, two of which have practically no metering, which indicates that the numbers are not reliable and actual values are likely to be higher.&lt;ref name="ADB 2007, p. 3"/&gt; In Delhi, which was not included in the ADB study, non-revenue water stood at 53% and there were about 20 employees per 1000 connections. Furthermore, only 70% of revenue billed was actually collected.

'''Labour productivity'''. Concerning [[labour productivity]], the 20 utilities in the sample had on average 7.4 employees per 1,000 connections, which is much higher than the estimated level for an efficient utility.&lt;ref name="ADB 2007, p. 3"/&gt; A survey of a larger sample of Indian utilities showed an average ratio of 10.9 employees per 1,000 connections.&lt;ref name="NIUA"/&gt;

== Tariffs, cost recovery and subsidies ==

[[Water tariff|Water and sewer tariffs]] in India are low in both urban and rural areas. In urban areas they were set at the equivalent of about {{USD}}0.10 per cubic meter in 2007 and recovered about 60% of operating and maintenance costs, with large differences between cities. Some cities such as Kolkata do not bill residential users at all. In rural areas the level of cost recovery often is even lower than in urban areas and was estimated at only 20% in rural Punjab. Subsidies were estimated at {{USD}}1.1&amp;nbsp;billion per year in the mid-1990s, accounting to 4% of all government subsidies in India. 70% of those benefiting from the subsidies are not poor.

=== Urban areas ===
'''Metering.''' [[Water metering]] is the precondition for billing water users on the basis of volume consumed. Estimates of the share of customers metered vary depending on the study quoted. According to the results of a Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) Program carried out by the Ministry of Urban Development in 2006 in 28 cities, the share of metering was 50 percent.&lt;ref name="WSP Kuwasip"/&gt; According to a 1999 survey of 300 cities about 62% of urban water customers in metropolitan areas and 50% in smaller cities are metered (average 55%). However, meters often do not work so that many "metered" customers are charged flat rates. Bangalore and Pune are among the few Indian cities that meter all their customers. Many other cities have no metering at all or meter only commercial customers.&lt;ref name="NIUA"/&gt; Users of standposts receive water free of charge. A 2007 study of 20 cities by the [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission]] with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) showed that only 25% of customers of these utilities were metered. Most other customers paid a flat tariff independent of consumption. Some utilities, such as the one serving [[Kolkata]], actually do not bill residential users at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[http://www.adb.org/publications/2007-benchmarking-and-data-book-water-utilities-india Benchmarking and Data Book of Water Utilities in India], 2007, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tariff levels'''. According to the same ADB study the average tariff for all customers – including industrial, commercial and public customers – is {{INRConvert|0.0049|k|1}} per cubic meter.&lt;ref name="ADB 2007, p. 3"/&gt; According to a 2007 global water tariff survey by the OECD the residential water tariff for a consumption of 15&amp;nbsp;m³ was equivalent to {{USD}}0.15 per m3 in Bangalore, {{USD}}0.12 per m3 in Calcutta, {{USD}}0.11 per m3 in New Delhi and {{USD}}0.09 per m3 in Mumbai. Only Bangalore had a sewer tariff of {{USD}}0.02 per m3. The other three cities did not charge for sewerage, although the better-off tend to be the ones with access to sewers.&lt;ref&gt;OECD/Global Water Intelligence Water Tariff Survey 2007, quoted in Peter Gleick:[https://books.google.com/books?id=_wd-s1FB7VEC&amp;pg=PT338&amp;lpg=PT338&amp;dq=oecd+gwi+water+tariff+survey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ex3zfOJn_U&amp;sig=mLCxZXJkA9WWtvj51jDYxqpzpgU&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=QesxS8-IKJCj_gbE79COCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=oecd%20gwi%20water%20tariff%20survey&amp;f=false The World's Water 2008–2009], p. 321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tariff structure.''' The tariff for customers that are effectively metered is typically a uniform linear tariff, although some cities apply increasing-block tariffs.&lt;ref name="NIUA"/&gt;

'''Affordability.''' Urban water tariffs were highly affordable according to data from the year 2000. A family of five living on the poverty line which uses 20&amp;nbsp;cubic meter of water per month would spend less than 1.2% of its budget on its water bill if it had a water meter. If it did not have a water meter and was charged a flat rate, it would pay 2.0% of its budget. This percentage lies below the often used affordability threshold of 5%. However, at that time the average metered tariff was estimated at only {{USD}}0.03 per m3, or less than three times what it was estimated to be in 2007.&lt;ref name="tariffs"&gt;National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), 2002, Status of Water Supply, Sanitation and Solid Waste Management in Urban India, quoted in: World Bank/PPIAF/Water and Sanitation Program/World Bank Institute:[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/418200752957_scorecard.pdf Water Tariffs and Subsidies in South Asia: A Scorecard for India], 2002, p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently no more up-to-date estimates on the share of the average water bill in the budget of the poor are available.

'''Cost recovery.''' According to a 2007 study of 20 cities the average rate of cost recovery for operating and maintenance costs of utilities in these cities was 60%. Seven of the 20 utilities generated a cash surplus to partially finance investments. [[Chennai]] generated the highest relative surplus. The lowest cost recovery ratio was found in [[Indore]] in Madhya Pradesh, which recovered less than 20% of its operating and maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="ADB 2007, p. 3"/&gt; According to the results of a Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) Program carried out by the Ministry of Urban Development in 2006 in 28 cities, cost recovery was 67% on average.&lt;ref name="WSP Kuwasip"/&gt;

'''Delhi example'''. Between 2011 and 2013 Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has increased its revenues by 50 percent and reduced operating subsidies from the National Capital Territory of Delhi. It owes {{INRConvert|350|b|1}} in debt, but hopes that the debt will be converted into a grant. The utility focuses on improving its customer database, meter reading through hand-held devices, billing and bill collection under a new manager, Debashree Mukherjee, who took the helm of the utility in 2012.&lt;ref name="GWI Delhi"/&gt; As of 2004, in [[Delhi]] revenues were just sufficient to cover about 60% of operating costs of DJB; maintenance was, as a result, minimal. In the past, the Delhi utility has relied heavily on government financial support for recurrent and capital expenditures in the magnitude of {{INRConvert|3|b|1}} per year and {{INRConvert|7|b|1}} respectively. Accounts receivable represent more than 12&amp;nbsp;months of billing, part of it being non-recoverable.&lt;ref name="WB 2006b"/&gt; The average tariff was estimated at {{USD}}0.074/m³ in 2001, compared to production costs of {{USD}}0.085/m³, the latter probably being a very conservative estimate that does not take into account capital costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/Water/Indicators/Profiles/Delhi_city.pdf Delhi ADB 2001] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010125148/http://www.adb.org/Water/Indicators/Profiles/Delhi_city.pdf |date=10 October 2007 }} The same source estimates the working ratio at 2.45, which implies that current revenues must be less than half of recurrent costs&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Challenges faced in attempting to increase tariffs.''' Even if users are willing to pay more for better services, political interests often prevent tariffs from being increased even to a small extent. An example is the city of [[Jabalpur]] where the central government and the state government financed a {{INRConvert|130|m|1}} water supply project from 2000–2004 to be operated by the Jabalpur Municipal Corporation, an entity that collected only less than half of its operational costs in revenues even before this major investment. Even so, the municipal corporation initially refused to increase tariffs. Only following pressure from the state government it reluctantly agreed to increase commercial tariffs, but not residential tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Global Water Partnership]]:[http://www.gwptoolbox.org/index.php?option=com_case&amp;id=151&amp;Itemid=45 Malay Raj MukerjeeIndia: Issues in introducing a realistic water pricing regime in urban local bodies]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rural areas ===

Cost recovery in rural areas is low and a majority of the rural water systems are defunct for lack of maintenance. Some state governments subsidise rural water systems, but funds are scarce and insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Planning Commission:[http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/10th/volume2/v2_ch5_5.pdf 10th Plan, p. 604]&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], operation and maintenance cost recovery is only about 20%. On one hand, expenditures are high due to high salary levels, high power tariff and a high number of operating staff. On the other hand, revenue is paid only by the 10% of the households who have private connections. Those drawing water from public stand posts do not pay any water charges at all, although the official tariff for public stand post users is {{INRConvert|0.015|k|1}} per month per household.&lt;ref name="World Bank Punjab 2006, Annex 1"/&gt;

=== Subsidies and targeting of subsidies ===

There are no accurate recent estimates of the level of subsidies for water and sanitation in India. It has been estimated that transfers to the water sector in India amounted to {{INRConvert|54708|m|1}} per year in the mid-1990s, accounting for 4% of all government subsidies in India. About 98% of this subsidy is said to come from State rather than Central budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, D.K. and Sen, T.K. (1997), Government Subsidies in India, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, New Delhi, quoted in: World Bank/PPIAF/Water and Sanitation Program/World Bank Institute:[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/418200752957_scorecard.pdf Water Tariffs and Subsidies in South Asia: A Scorecard for India], 2002, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; This figure may only cover recurrent cost subsidies and not investment subsidies, which are even higher (see below). There is little targeting of subsidies. According to the World Bank, 70% of those benefiting from subsidies for public water supply are not poor, while 40% of the poor are excluded because they do not have access to public water services.&lt;ref name="WBI tariffs"&gt;World Bank/PPIAF/Water and Sanitation Program/World Bank Institute:[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/418200752957_scorecard.pdf Water Tariffs and Subsidies in South Asia: A Scorecard for India], 2002, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investment and financing ==
Investment in urban water supply and sanitation has increased during the first decade of the 21st century, not least thanks to increased central government grants made available under [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission]] under the Congress government until 2014 and the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Mission) under the BJP government since 2014, alongside loans from the [[Housing and Urban Development Corporation]].

=== Investment ===
The [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (India)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] (2007–2012) foresaw investments of {{INRConvert|1270.25|b|1}} for urban water supply and sanitation, including urban (stormwater) drainage and solid waste management.&lt;ref name="11th 5-year plan"/&gt;

=== Financing ===
The funding of government programmes for water supply and sanitation is shared by the central government, states and other contributors, with the share contributed by various stakeholders varying between programmes and over time. For example, as of 2016 the states pay 60% and the central government pays 40% for investments financed under the Clean India Mission and the National Rural Drinking Water Programme. Until 2015 the central government had funded 75% of the Clean India Mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking Policy and Budgetary Commitments for Drinking Water and Sanitation: A Study of Select States|url=http://www.cbgaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tracking-Policy-and-Budgetary-Commitments-for-Drinking-Water-and-Sanitation-1.pdf|publisher=Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA)|accessdate=28 July 2016|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 11th Plan (2007–12) 55% of the investments were to be financed by the central government, 28% by state governments, 8% by "institutional financing" such as HUDCO, 8% by external agencies and 1.5% by the private sector. Local governments were not expected to contribute to the investments. The volume of investments was expected to double to reach 0.7% of GDP. Also, it implied a shift in financing from state governments to the central government.&lt;ref name="11th 5-year plan"&gt;[[Planning Commission (India)]]:[http://planningcommission.nic.in/aboutus/committee/strgrp11/str11_hud1.pdf DRAFT REPORT OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE ON URBAN DEVELOPMENT FOR ELEVENTH FIVE YEAR PLAN (2007–2012)], 2007. Retrieved 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 9th Plan only 24% of investments were financed by the central government and 76% by state governments. Central government financing was heavily focused on water supply in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Planning Commission 2003, p. 51-53"&gt;[[Planning Commission of India]]:[http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/wtrsani.pdf India Assessment 2002, Water Supply and Sanitation, a WHO-UNICEF sponsored study], 2003, p. 51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutions ===
The current system of financing water supply and sanitation is fragmented through a number of different national and state programs. This results in simultaneous implementation with different and conflicting rules in neighbouring areas. For example, in rural areas different programs undermine each other, adversely affecting demand driven approaches requiring cost sharing by users.

State budgets the major source of financing for water supply and sanitation. State Financing Corporations (SFC) play an important role in making recommendations regarding the allocation of state tax revenues between states and municipalities, criteria for grants, and measures to improve the financial position of municipalities. According to the Planning Commission, SFCs are in some cases not sufficiently transparent and/or competent, have high transactions costs, and their recommendations are sometimes not being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Planning Commission:[http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/10th/volume2/v2_ch6_1.pdf 10th Plan (2002–2007), p. 611]&lt;/ref&gt; An important source of financing are loans from [[Housing and Urban Development Corporation]] Ltd (HUDCO), a Central government financial undertaking. HUDCO loans to municipal corporations need to be guaranteed by state governments. HUDCO also on-lends loans from foreign aid, including Japanese aid, to states. The [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission]] (2005-2014) played an important role in financing urban water supply and sanitation through central government grants. However, its grants were limited to the 35 largest cities in the country and 28 other selected cities, so that most cities with less than 1 million inhabitants were not eligible to receive grants from this mission. It was replaced by the [[Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation]] (AMRUT), the new government's flagship programme for urban development. In addition, in 2014 the new government announced its high-profile [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Mission) that aims at eradicating [[open defecation]] by 2019, covering 4,041 cities and towns. The programme has received funding and technical support from the [[World Bank]], corporations and state governments under the [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] and [[Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan]] schemes.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-02-17/news/59232518_1_india-open-defecation-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-toilets|title=Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan: Government builds 7.1 lakh toilets in January|work=timesofindia-economictimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is expected to cost over {{INRConvert|620|b}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/swachh-bharat-abhiyan-with-a-broom-in-hand-pm-modi-to-lead-from-the-front_1478677.html|title=PM Modi's 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' set for mega launch Thursday; schools, offices gear up for event|work=[[Zee News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; An amount of {{INRConvert|90|b}} was allocated for the mission in [[2016 Union budget of India]].&lt;ref name=et&gt;{{citation |title=Budget 2016: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan gets Rs 9,000 crore |url=http://economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/budget-2016-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-gets-rs-9000-crore/articleshow/51193662.cms |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the government introduced a 0.5% service tax on air travel, telephony, eating out and banking to finance the Clean India Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New steps to make Swachh Bharat, or Clean India Campaign, a reality|url=http://www.ircwash.org/news/tax-raise-realise-india%E2%80%99s-dream|publisher=IRC - Supporting water, sanitation and hygiene services for life|accessdate=28 July 2016|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A budget tracking study revealed that the shift of policy focus from water to sanitation as part of the Clean India Campaign has resulted in a cut in government spending on rural water supply. A Parliamentary Standing Committee report found that the government would be unable to achieve its 2017 target of providing 50% rural households with piped water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dietvorst|first1=Cor|title=The decision to divert funding from water to sanitation turned sour when drought struck India.|url=http://www.ircwash.org/news/can-you-spend-too-much-sanitation|publisher=IRC|accessdate=28 July 2016|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Tamil Nadu introduced a public-private partnership, the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF), to channel both grants and loans to cities in the state. TNUDF has received funding from the [[World Bank]], Japanese [[JICA]] and [[KfW]] from Germany. It also mobilizes funding from the capital market through a water and sanitation pooled fund, under which several municipalities joined together to issue a bond in the local market. TNUDF so far is the only functioning state-level fund that channels loans to ULBs in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund|title=Water and Sanitation Pooled Fund|url=http://www.tnudf.com/wspf.asp|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the state of Orissa has created an Urban Development Fund modelled on the example of Tamil Nadu.

== External cooperation ==

In absolute terms India receives almost twice as much development assistance for water, sanitation and water resources management as any other country, according to data from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. India accounts for 13 per cent of commitments in global water aid for 2006–07, receiving an annual average of about {{USD}}830&amp;nbsp;million (€620&amp;nbsp;million), more than double the amount provided to China. India's biggest water and sanitation donor is Japan, which provided {{USD}}635&amp;nbsp;million, followed by the World Bank with {{USD}}130&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Times]]:[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec5ab47a-2309-11de-9c99-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1 India gets biggest share of aid for water and hygiene], 7 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[OECD]], 2007:[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/2/60/42265683.pdf Measuring Aid to Water Supply and Sanitation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525044541/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/2/60/42265683.pdf |date=25 May 2010 }}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The annual average for 2004–06, however, was about half as much at {{USD}}448&amp;nbsp;million, of which Japan provided {{USD}}293&amp;nbsp;million and the [[World Bank]] {{USD}}87&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;OECD:Aid to the water sector commitments, India, calculated from the following pivot table:[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090200/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/14/41812948.xls Water focus charts: Disbursements 2004–2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] and Germany are other important external partners in water supply and sanitation.

In 2003 the Indian government decided it would only accept bilateral aid from five countries (the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, Germany and Japan). A further 22 bilateral donors were asked to channel aid through nongovernmental organisations, United Nations agencies or multilateral institutions such as the European Union, the Asian Development Bank or the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Price, [[Chatham House]]:[http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/3199_wp200904.pdf India’s aid dynamics: from recipient to donor?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617014553/http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/3199_wp200904.pdf |date=17 June 2011 }}, Asia Programme Working Paper, September 2004, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asian Development Bank ===

India has increased its loans from the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) since 2005 after the introduction of new financing modalities, such as the multitranche financing facility (MFF) which features a framework agreement with the national government under which financing is provided in flexible tranches for subprojects that meet established selection criteria. In 2008 four MFFs for urban development investment programs were under way in North [[Karnataka]] ({{USD}}862&amp;nbsp;million), [[Jammu and Kashmir]] ({{USD}}1,260&amp;nbsp;million), [[Rajasthan]] ({{USD}}450&amp;nbsp;million), and [[Uttarakhand]] ({{USD}}1,589&amp;nbsp;million). Included in these MFFs are major investments for the development of urban water supply and sanitation services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130703163214/http://www.adb.org/features/country-water-action-testing-innovative-financing Asian Development Bank:Country Water Action: India. Testing Innovative Financing], December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

Germany supports access to water and sanitation in India through financial cooperation by [[KfW]] development bank and technical cooperation by [[GTZ|GIZ]]. Since the early 1990s both institutions have supported [[watershed management]] in rural [[Maharashtra]], using a participatory approach first piloted by the Social Center in Ahmednagar and that constituted a fundamental break with the previous top-down, technical approach to watershed management that had yielded little results.&lt;ref&gt;In German: [http://www.jesuiten.de/jesuitenmission.ch/pdf/jhs2005_4.pdf Interview mit Pater Hermann Bacher SJ], Jesuiten 4/2005 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of women in decision-making is an essential part of the project. While the benefits are mostly in terms of increased agricultural production, the project also increases availability of water resources for rural water supply.&lt;ref&gt;[[KfW]]:[http://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/EN_Home/Development_policy_positions/Gender/Project_-_Erosion_protection_in_India.jsp Project – Erosion Protection in India. Getting Women Involved in Decision-Making Processes], June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, GIZ actively supports the introduction of [[ecological sanitation]] concepts in India, including community toilets and decentralised wastewater systems for schools as well as small and medium enterprises. Many of these systems produce biogas from wastewater, provide fertiliser and irrigation water.&lt;ref&gt;[[GTZ]]:[http://www.gtz.de/en/dokumente/en-ecosan-sustainablesanitation-india-2008.pdf Sustainable Sanitation in India.

=== Japan ===

As India's largest donor in the sector the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA) finances a multitude of projects with a focus on capital-intensive urban water supply and sanitation projects, often involving follow-up projects in the same locations.

'''Current projects.''' Projects approved between 2006 and 2009 include the [[Guwahati]] Water Supply Project (Phases I and II) in [[Assam]], the [[Kerala]] Water Supply Project (Phased II and III), the [[Hogenakkal Integrated Drinking Water Project|Hogenakkal Water Supply and Fluorosis Mitigation Project]] (Phases I and II) in [[Tamil Nadu]], the [[Goa]] Water Supply and Sewerage Project, the [[Agra]] Water Supply Project, the [[Amritsar]] Sewerage Project in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], the [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] Integrated Sanitation Improvement Project, and the [[Bangalore]] Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Phase II).&lt;ref&gt;[[JICA]]:[http://www.jica.go.jp/english/operations/evaluation/oda_loan/economic_cooperation/index.html Ex-Ante Evaluation]. Retrieved 18 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evaluation of past projects'''. An ex-post evaluation of one large program, the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Program, showed that "some 60%–70% of the goals were achieved" and that "results were moderate". The program was implemented by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation, Ltd. (HUDCO) from 1996 to 2003 in 26 cities. The evaluation says that "state government plans were not based on sufficient demand research, including the research for residents' willingness to pay for services", so that demand for connections was overestimated. Also fees (water tariffs) were rarely increased despite recommendations to increase them. The evaluation concludes that "HUDCO was not able to make significant contributions to the effectiveness, sustainability, or overall quality of individual projects. One of the reasons that not much attention was given to this problem is probably that there was little risk of default on the loans thanks to state government guarantees."&lt;ref&gt;[[JICA]]:[http://www.jica.go.jp/english/operations/evaluation/oda_loan/post/2006/pdf/project33_full.pdf Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Program], External Evaluator: Hajime Sonoda
Field Survey: September 2005. Retrieved 18 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bank ===
'''Current projects'''. The World Bank finances a number of projects in urban and rural areas that are fully or partly dedicated to water supply and sanitation. In urban areas the World Bank supported or supports among others the USD 1.55 bn National Ganga River Basin Project approved in 2011, the [[Andhra Pradesh]] Municipal Development Project (approved in 2009, {{USD}}300&amp;nbsp;million loan), the [[Karnataka]] Municipal Reform Project (approved in 2006, {{USD}}216&amp;nbsp;million loan), the Third [[Tamil Nadu]] Urban Development Project (approved in 2005, {{USD}}300&amp;nbsp;million loan) and the Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project (approved in 2004, {{USD}}39.5&amp;nbsp;million loan). In rural areas it supports the Andhra Pradesh Rural Water Supply and Sanitation ({{USD}}150&amp;nbsp;million loan, approved in 2009), the Second Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (approved in 2001, {{USD}}151.6&amp;nbsp;million loan), the [[Uttarakhand]] Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (approved in 2006, {{USD}}120&amp;nbsp;million loan) and the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (approved in 2006, {{USD}}154&amp;nbsp;million loan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=218616&amp;piPK=217470&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=51526214&amp;category=simsearch&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;pagesize=10&amp;sortby=BOARDSORTDATE&amp;sortorder=DESC&amp;query=India%20water&amp;status=A|title=Projects - Active Projects|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evaluation of past projects'''. A study by the World Bank's independent evaluation department evaluated the impact of the World Bank-supported interventions in the provision of urban water supply and wastewater services in [[Mumbai]] between 1973 and 1990. It concluded that water supply and sewerage planning, construction and operations in Bombay posed daunting challenges to those who planned and implemented the investment program. At the outset, there was a huge backlog of unmet demand because of underinvestment. Population and economic growth accelerated in the following decades and the proportion of the poor increased as did the slums which they occupied. The intended impacts of the program have not been realised. Shortcomings include that "water is not safe to drink; water service, especially to the poor, is difficult to access and is provided at inconvenient hours of the day; industrial water needs are not fully met; sanitary facilities are too few in number and often unusable; and urban drains, creeks and coastal waters are polluted with sanitary and industrial wastes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/0C21174E191C96F4852567F5005D38EF?opendocument|title=India - Water Supply and Waste Water Services in Bombay: First, Second and Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects - Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) - The World Bank Group|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Assembly Hall View.jpg|thumb|The World Health Assembly meets in the assembly hall of the [[Palace of Nations]], in [[Geneva]] ([[Switzerland]]).]]

The '''World Health Assembly''' ('''WHA''') is the forum through which the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is governed by its 194 [[World Health Organization#Membership|member state]]s. It is the world's highest [[health policy]] setting body and is composed of [[health minister]]s from member states. 

The members of the World Health Assembly generally meet every year in May in [[Geneva]], the location of WHO Headquarters. The main tasks of the WHA are to decide major policy questions, as well as to approve the WHO work programme and budget and elect its Director General.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/governance/wha/en/ World Health Assembly.] Geneva. Retrieved 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and observers==
The original membership of the WHA, at the first assembly held in 1948, numbered 55 member states.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/about/brochure_en.pdf ''Working for health: an introduction to the World Health Organization''.] Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt; The WHA has, currently, 194 member states.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/countries/en/ Countries.] Retrieved 27 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, seven agencies have [[observer status]] at the WHA - the [[Holy See|Vatican]], the [[Palestinian Authority]], the [[Order of Malta]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]], the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], and The [[Department of Health (Republic of China)|Department of Health]] of the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as [[Taiwan]], was invited on 28 April 2009 to participate in the WHA 2009 as an observer for the first time since losing its China seat in [[United Nations]] to [[People's Republic of China]] in 1971. The invitation was extended to "the Department of Health, [[Chinese Taipei]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-03/26/content_7618267.htm Beijing may help Taipei in WHO role.] Posted by ''China Daily'', 2009-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2009/04/29/206179/Taiwan-invited.htm Taiwan invited to attend World Health Assembly.] Posted by ''The China Post'', April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Margaret Chan declared at the Assembly that [[Intellectual Property]], or patents on strains of new virus, should not impede nations from protecting their citizens by limiting scientific investigations. Following the 2012 MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia, Deputy Health Minister Ziad Memish raised concerns that scientists who applied for a patent would not allow the MERS-coronavirus to be used for investigations by other scientists and were therefore delaying the development of diagnostic tests. Ten of the 22 people who died and 22 of 44 cases reported were in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=coronavirus_patent23may2013&gt;{{cite news|date=23 May 2013|title=WHO urges information sharing over novel coronavirus

==Early life==
Buben was born in [[Paris|Paris, France]] in 1895. Her mother did not like France, and thus her father suggested that they move. When Zdenka was two, Buben's father's friend arranged for Buben's father to transfer his work to New York, where the Buben family lived until 1908.&lt;ref name=SWH /&gt; In 1908, they moved to San Franscisco, where Buben finished high school. She went on to attend the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], where she originally majored in music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AXM9AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA12-IA11&amp;ots=ko29bMiE89&amp;dq=%22Alice%20Mayer%22%20piano&amp;pg=PP18#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alice%20Mayer%22%20piano&amp;f=false "Miss Zdenka Buben"] ''Pacific Coast Musical Review'' (April 3, 1920): 8.&lt;/ref&gt; She switched her major to Hygiene, a department where people were trained as somewhat nurse and somewhat social work trainees.&lt;ref name=SWH /&gt;  and went on to graduate and become a [[health visitor|Health Visitor]] for the city of [[Alameda, California|Alameda]]. Afterwards, her title changed, and she became a public health nurse in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=TS /&gt;

==Career==
Buben joined the Council of Social Agencies in its Health Division. She eventually helped work toward establishing a school of social work in Los Angeles, and also established a Bureau of Social Work in the Los Angeles County health department. At the time, many private medical doctors were against publicly funded medical care, and the Health Department also feuded with doctors about who should exactly receive care.&lt;ref name=SWH /&gt;&lt;ref name=TS /&gt; Despite being the chief medical social worker in her department, Buben actually did not have a degree in social work until she decided to do so in the 1940s. She went on to attend the [[University of Chicago]] and obtained her Master's degree in Social Work.  Afterward, she returned to Los Angeles and returned to her old position as the Director of Public Health Social Work, and maintained that position until her retirement in October 1961. Throughout her career, she advocated for the development of professional standards.&lt;ref name=TS /&gt; Some of her lasting legacy of practices are the development of a sliding scale of fees for indigent persons who wished to receive medical care; the development of numerous social work training schools; and connecting many social agencies, the Health Department, and medical providers with one another.&lt;ref name="PHP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Worthington Worcester|first1=Daisy Lee|title=Public Health and Private Doctors|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma01/davis/survey/articles/health/health_apr34_4.html|website=Portrait of America: Survey Graphic in the Thirties|publisher=The University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SWH /&gt;&lt;ref name=TS /&gt; Buben also was a proponent of preventative care for diseases that are preventable, particularly [[tuberculosis]] and [[smallpox]]. She also lobbied for standards for social work and better licensure practices.&lt;ref name=SWH /&gt;&lt;ref name=TS /&gt; In recognition of her significant contribution to social work, Buben was inducted to the [[California Social Work Hall of Distinction]].&lt;ref name=SWH /&gt;
