'''Aoraki / Mount Cook''' is the highest mountain in [[New Zealand]]. Its height since 2014 is listed as {{convert|3724|m|ft|abbr=off}}, down from {{convert|3764|m|ft|abbr=on}} before December 1991, due to a rockslide and subsequent erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/9616590/Aoraki-Mt-Cook-shrinks-by-30m|title=Aoraki/Mt Cook shrinks by 30m|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies in the [[Southern Alps]], the mountain range which runs the length of the [[South Island]]. A popular tourist destination,&lt;ref name="Man_Plan1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/about-doc/role/policies-and-plans/aoraki-mount-cook-np-management-plan-1.pdf |title=Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park Management Plan 2004 |accessdate=9 May 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=Department of Conservation | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614120701/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/about-doc/role/policies-and-plans/aoraki-mount-cook-np-management-plan-1.pdf| archivedate= 14 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also a favourite challenge for [[mountain climber]]s. Aoraki / Mount Cook consists of three summits, from South to North the Low Peak ({{convert|3593|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Middle Peak ({{convert|3717|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and High Peak. The summits lie slightly south and east of the main divide of the Southern Alps, with the [[Tasman Glacier]] to the east and the [[Hooker Glacier (New Zealand)|Hooker Glacier]] to the southwest.&lt;ref name="TOPO" /&gt;

There was a large rock fall in 1991 that turned the summit into a knife-edge ridge and reduced the height of the mountain by an estimated 10 m or so at that time.&lt;ref name="blogs.agu.org"&gt;[http://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/2014/01/16/aoraki-mount-cook/]&lt;/ref&gt; Aoraki / Mount Cook was measured in 2013 to be 3724 m, which is 30 m down from its pre-1991 rock-fall measurement.&lt;ref name="blogs.agu.org"/&gt;

== Location ==
The mountain is in the [[Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park]], in the [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury region]]. The park was established in 1953 and along with [[Westland National Park]], [[Mount Aspiring National Park]] and [[Fiordland National Park]] forms one of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]]. The park contains more than 140 peaks standing over {{convert|2000|m|ft}} and 72 named [[glacier]]s, which cover 40 percent of its {{convert|700|km2|acre}}.

The peak is located at the northern end of the Kirikirikatata / Mount Cook Range, where it meets with the main spine of the Main Divide, forming a massif between the Hooker Valley to the southwest and the Tasman Valley east of the mountain. These two valleys provide the closest easily accessible view points of Aoraki / Mount Cook.  A lookout point at the end of the [[Hooker Valley Track]] located only 10&amp;nbsp;km from the peak has views of the entire mountainside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hooker Valley Track|url=http://www.newzealand.com/int/feature/hooker-valley-track/|publisher=[[Tourism New Zealand]]|accessdate=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alpine Highs in Aoraki/Mt.Cook|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/lifestyle/travel/mike-yardley-alpine-highs-in-aorakimtcook/|publisher=[[Newstalk ZB]]|author=Mike Yardley|date=26 Aug 2016|accessdate=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement of [[Mount Cook Village]], also referred to as "Aoraki / Mount Cook", is a tourist centre and base camp for the mountain. It is 7&amp;nbsp;km from the end of the Tasman Glacier and 15&amp;nbsp;km south of Aoraki / Mount Cook's summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aoraki/Mount Cook, Canterbury – NZ Topo Map|url=http://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap/nz26116/Aoraki%2fMount-Cook/Canterbury|website=NZ Topo Map|publisher=[[Land Information New Zealand]]|accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On clear days, Aoraki / Mount Cook is visible from the West Coast as far north as Greymouth, some 150&amp;nbsp;kilometres away, and from most of State Highway 80 along [[Lake Pukaki]] and State Highway 6 south of Lake Pukaki. The near horizontal ridge connecting the mountain's three summits forms a distinctive blocky shape when viewed from an eastern or western direction.
Another popular view point is from [[Lake Matheson]] on the West Coast, described as the "view of views", where on calm days, the peaks of Aoraki / Mount Cook and Mt Tasman are reflected in Lake Matheson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/west-coast/places/westland-tai-poutini-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/lake-matheson-walk/|title=Lake Matheson Walk|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local climate==
Aoraki / Mount Cook receives substantial [[Orography|orographic precipitation]] throughout the year, as breezy, moisture-laden westerly winds dominate all year-round, bringing rainclouds from the [[Tasman Sea]] with them.

Annual precipitation around the mountain ranges varies greatly as the local climate is dominated by the eastward movement of depressions and anticyclones from across the Tasman Sea.  The Aoraki / Mount Cook massif is a major obstacle to the prevailing westerly winds as they push depressions and associated cold fronts of moist air from the subtropics in the northwest against the mountain range. As the air rises towards the peaks, it expands and cools, and forms clouds.  Rain and snowfall are often heaviest around the {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} level and can last for several days if the front is slow-moving.&lt;ref name="doc2pg16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/getting-involved/students-and-teachers/field-trips-by-region/canterbury/aoraki/aoraki-mt-cook-education-resource-colour.pdf|title=Aoraki/Mount Cook Education Resource|year=2010|publisher=Department of Conservation|page=16|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the local weather patterns, the western slopes of Aoraki / Mount Cook can receive well over {{convert|10000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="doc2pg16" /&gt; of annual precipitation, whereas the nearby Mount Cook Village, only {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the mountain receives {{convert|4484|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain or snowfall.&lt;ref name="niwa"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/schools/resources/climate
| title = Climate Data and Activities
| publisher = NIWA Science 
| accessdate = 15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While the weather on the eastern side of the mountain is generally better, rain or snow can quickly become widespread on that side as well if the wind turns to the south or southeast. This brings with it a rapid drop in temperature and poor visibility,&lt;ref name="doc2pg16" /&gt; adding to the difficult climbing conditions on Aoraki / Mount Cook.&lt;ref name="climbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11381328|title=Climbers missing on Aoraki-Mt Cook may never be found|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=3 January 2015|accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperatures at the mountain's base in the Hooker Valley around {{convert|800|m|abbr=off}} range from {{convert|-13|C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|32|C|abbr=on}}, and generally fall just over 1&amp;nbsp;°C for every 200 metres of altitude.&lt;ref name="doc2pg8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/getting-involved/students-and-teachers/field-trips-by-region/canterbury/aoraki/aoraki-mt-cook-education-resource-colour.pdf|title=Aoraki/Mount Cook Education Resource|year=2010|publisher=Department of Conservation|page=8|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} and higher, semi-permanent snow and ice fields exist during winter.  Winter and spring are usually less settled than summer and autumn. Anticyclones often bring days of settled weather in summer, or clear cold conditions in winter with severe frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/schools/resources/climate/overview/map_alpine|title=Map Alpine|publisher=[[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research|NIWA]]|accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming and European discovery ==
[[File:Mtcook1600x1200.jpg|thumb|left|Aoraki / Mount Cook seen from the south, taken from a glider flying at {{convert|4000|m|ft}}]]

''{{lang|mi|Aoraki}}'' is the name of a person in the traditions of the [[Ngāi Tahu]] iwi; an early name for the South Island is ''{{lang|mi|Te Waka o Aoraki}}'' (Aoraki's Canoe). In the past many believed it meant "Cloud Piercer",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/NgaiTahu/2/ENZ-Resources/Standard/1/en |title=Ngāi Tahu – Aoraki – Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=8 May 2007 |author=Te Maire Tau |date=21 December 2006 |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manatū Taonga }}&lt;/ref&gt; a romantic rendering of the name's components: ''{{lang|mi|ao}}'' (world, daytime, cloud, etc.) and ''{{lang|mi|raki}}'' or ''{{lang|mi|rangi}}'' (day, sky, weather, etc.).&lt;ref name="MaoriDictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/ |title=Māori Dictionary Online |publisher=Maoridictionary.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the [[Māori language|Māori]] name has been spelt ''{{lang|mi|Aorangi}}'', using the standard Māori form.

Aoraki / Mount Cook became known to Māori after their arrival in New Zealand some time around the 14th Century CE. The first Europeans who may have seen Aoraki / Mount Cook were members of [[Abel Tasman]]'s crew, who saw a "large land uplifted high" (probably some part of the Southern Alps) while off the west coast of the South Island, just north of present-day Greymouth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/EuropeanDiscoveryOfNewZealand/2/en/ |title=European discovery of New Zealand – Abel Tasman – Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=8 May 2007 |author=John Wilson |date=21 December 2006 |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manatū Taonga }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/european-discovery-of-new-zealand/page-2 |title=European discovery of New Zealand – Abel Tasman |publisher=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=2015-12-09 |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 13 December 1642 during Tasman's first Pacific voyage. The English name of ''Mount Cook''  was given to the mountain in 1851 by Captain [[John Lort Stokes]] to honour Captain [[James Cook]] who surveyed and circumnavigated the islands of New Zealand in 1770. Captain Cook did not sight the mountain during his exploration.&lt;ref name="Cook_journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8106 |title=Captain Cook's Journal During the First Voyage Round the World |accessdate=9 May 2007 |author=James Cook |date=1728–1779 |pages=Sunday, 18 March 1770 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QST2ITBp?url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8106 |archivedate=19 July 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|settlement]] between Ngāi Tahu and the Crown in 1998, the name of the mountain was officially changed from Mount Cook to Aoraki / Mount Cook to incorporate its historic Māori name, Aoraki.&lt;ref name="Ngai_Tahu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/feature/ngai-tahu-settlement-260 |title=Ngai Tahu Settlement Section 3: Aoraki/Mount Cook |first=Doug |last=Graham |publisher=New Zealand Government |date=13 October 1998 |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the settlement, a number of South Island placenames were amended to incorporate their original Māori name. Signifying the importance of Aoraki / Mount Cook, it is the only one of these names where the Māori name precedes the English. Under the settlement the Crown agreed to return title to Aoraki / Mount Cook to Ngāi Tahu, who would then formally gift it back to the nation.&lt;ref name="Ngai_Tahu"/&gt; Neither transfer has yet occurred; Ngāi Tahu can decide when this will happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Claire |last=Trevett |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10645708 |title=Tuhoe veto followed parks advice |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
[[File:mtcook.nz.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Aoraki / Mount Cook from LandSat]]
The Southern Alps in the South Island were formed by [[tectonics|tectonic]] uplifting and pressure as the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Indo-Australian Plate]]s collided along the island's western coast. The uplifting continues, raising Aoraki / Mount Cook an average of {{convert|7|mm|in}} each year. However, erosive forces are also powerful shapers of the mountains. The severe weather is due to the mountain's jutting into powerful westerly winds of the [[Roaring Forties]] which run around approximately 45°S latitude, south of both Africa and Australia. The Southern Alps are the first obstacle the winds encounter after South America, having moved east across the Southern Ocean.

The height of Aoraki / Mount Cook was established in 1881 by G. J. Roberts (from the west side) and in 1889 by T. N. Brodrick (from the Canterbury side). Their measurements agreed closely at {{convert|12349|ft|m}}. The height was reduced by {{convert|10|m|ft}} when approximately 12–14 million cubic metres of rock and ice fell off the northern peak on 14 December 1991.&lt;ref name="Landslide1"&gt;The landslide carried with it another 40 million cubic metres of rock and ice. The impact caused an earth quake of 3.9 on the Richter scale. [P207 In search Of Ancient NZ.Campball and Hutching.GNS science/Penguin.2011.]

&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades of erosion of the ice cap exposed after this collapse reduced the height by another 30&amp;nbsp;m to 3724&amp;nbsp;m, as revealed by new GPS data from a University of Otago climbing expedition in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Height of NZ's tallest peak Aoraki/Mt Cook slashed by 30m |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11187423 |accessdate=16 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago062651.html |title=Otago-led study revises height of Aoraki/Mt Cook |publisher=[[University of Otago]] |date= |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mt Cook lies in the centre of the distinctive alpine fault, a 650&amp;nbsp;km long [[active fault]] in the Southern Alps. It is responsible for the uplift of Mt Cook and is believed to move every 100 to 300 years. It last moved in 1717.&lt;ref&gt;Campball and Hutching. ''In Search of Ancient New Zealand'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surrounding forests and glaciers ==
The average annual rainfall in the surrounding lowlands, in particular to the west, is around {{convert|5|to|10|m|in}}.&lt;ref name="doc2pg16" /&gt;  This very high rainfall leads to temperate [[rainforest]]s in these coastal lowlands and a reliable source of snow in the mountains to keep the glaciers flowing. These include the [[Tasman Glacier]] to the east of the mountain and the smaller [[Hooker Glacier (New Zealand)|Hooker Glacier]] immediately to its south.

The vegetation in the valleys to the east, in particular the Tasman Valley, is noticeably less lush than that on the western slopes of the mountain. Forest would normally grow to about 1,300&amp;nbsp;m in this area, but a lack of soil due to scree, rock falls and the effects of glaciation prevent this in most localities around the mountain. [[Tussock grasslands of New Zealand|Snow tussock]] and other alpine plants cling to as high as 1,900&amp;nbsp;m.
Above the snowline, only [[lichen]] can be found amongst the rock, snowfields and ice that dominate the highest parts of Aoraki / Mt Cook.&lt;ref name="doc2pg17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/getting-involved/students-and-teachers/field-trips-by-region/canterbury/aoraki/aoraki-mt-cook-education-resource-colour.pdf|title=Aoraki/Mount Cook Education Resource|year=2010|publisher=Department of Conservation|page=17|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climbing history ==
[[File:MountCook-P1140884a.jpg|thumb|View of Aoraki / Mount Cook from the Tasman Lake south of the mountain.]]
The first recorded attempt on the summit was made by the Irishman Rev. [[William S. Green]] and the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann on 2 March 1882 via the Tasman and Linda Glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Mt Cook Guidebook author Hugh Logan believe they came within 50&amp;nbsp;metres of the summit.&lt;ref&gt;p 11, Logan, H. (1990) ''Great peaks of New Zealand'', [[New Zealand Alpine Club]], Wellington, and John McIndoe Limited, Dunedin, New Zealand, {{ISBN|0-86868-125-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known ascent was on 25 December 1894, when New Zealanders [[Tom Fyfe]], John Michael (Jack) Clarke and George Graham reached the summit via the Hooker Valley and the north ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, J. (1994) ''Piercing the Clouds. Tom Fyffe: First to climb Mt Cook''. Hazard Press, New Zealand, {{ISBN|0-908790-64-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite an earlier failed attempt on 20 December, the local climbers were spurred on by their desire for the first ascent to be made by New Zealand mountaineers amid reports that the American mountaineer [[Edward FitzGerald (mountaineer)|Edward FitzGerald]] had his eye on the summit.&lt;ref name="Aoraki/Mt Cook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aoraki/Mt Cook|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/mountaineering/3#2|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party reached the summit at approximately 1:30pm after bounding up the last leg of the mountain full of excitement at reaching the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountaineering – First Ascent Aoraki/Mt Cook|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/mountaineering/3/4|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route they had successfully traversed was not repeated again until the 100th ascent over 60 years later in 1955.&lt;ref name="Aoraki/Mt Cook"/&gt; Swiss guide [[Matthias Zurbriggen]] of FitzGerald's party made the second ascent on 14 March 1895 from the Tasman Glacier side, via the ridge that now bears his name. This is credited as the first solo ascent, although Zurbriggen was accompanied part of the way up the ridge by J Adamson. After Zurbriggen's ascent it was another ten years before the mountain was climbed again. In February 1905 Jack Clarke with four others completed the third ascent following Zurbriggen's route. So Clarke therefore became the first person to do a repeat ascent.

The first woman to ascend the mountain was [[Freda Du Faur]], an Australian, on 3 December 1910. Local guide George Bannister, a nephew of another guide, [[Pahikore Te Koeti Turanga]] of [[Ngāi Tahu]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3t15/te-koeti-turanga-pahikore " Te Koeti Turanga"], te Ara&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[Māori people|Māori]] to successfully scale the peak in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Mountaineering/4/en |title=Mountaineering – Guided climbing |publisher=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=2014-10-15 |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A traverse of the three peaks was first accomplished in 1913 by Freda Du Faur and guides [[Alexander and Peter Graham|Peter and Alex Graham]]. This 'grand traverse' was repeated in January 1916 by [[Conrad Kain]], guiding the 57-year-old Mrs. [[Jane Thomson]], considered at the time "a marvellous feat unequalled for daring in the annals of the Southern Alps".&lt;ref&gt;J.M.T., [http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12193423600/Conrad-Kain-1833-1934 Conrad Kain, 1833–1934 In Memoriam], American Alpine Journal Vol 2, p.236 (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Hillary|Sir Edmund Hillary]] made his first ascent in January 1948.

Aoraki / Mount Cook is a technically challenging mountain with a high level of glaciation.  Its level of difficulty is often underestimated and can change dramatically depending on weather, snow and ice conditions. The climb crosses large crevasses, and involves risks of ice and rock falls, avalanches and rapidly changing weather conditions.&lt;ref name="climbers" /&gt;

Since the early 20th century, around 80 people have died attempting to climb the mountain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/64350575/Mt-Cook-Does-reaching-summit-outweigh-risks|title=Mt Cook: Does reaching summit outweigh risks?|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|author=Anna Pearson|date=20 Dec 2014|accessdate=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it New Zealand's deadliest peak. The climbing season traditionally runs from November to February, and hardly a season goes by without at least one fatality.&lt;ref name="climbers" /&gt;

== Māori history, legends and traditions ==
[[File:Hooker Valley towards Aoraki Mount Cook at sunset.jpg|thumb|Aoraki / Mount Cook at sunset from Hooker Valley]]
According to [[Māori culture|Māori]] legend, Aoraki was a young boy who, along with his three brothers, were the sons of [[Rangi and Papa|Rakinui]], the Sky Father. On their voyage around the [[Papatuanuku|Papatūānuku]], the Earth Mother, their canoe became stranded on a reef and tilted. Aoraki and his brothers climbed onto the top side of their canoe. However, the south wind froze them and turned them to stone. Their canoe became the Te Waka o Aoraki, the [[South Island]], and their prows, the [[Marlborough Sounds]]. Aoraki, the tallest, became the highest peak, and his brothers created the Kā Tiritiri o te Moana, the [[Southern Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Ngāi Tahu]], the main iwi (tribe) of New Zealand's southern region, consider Aoraki as the most sacred of the ancestors that they had descended from. Aoraki brings the iwi with its sense of community and purpose, and remains the physical form of Aoraki and the link between the worlds of the supernatural and nature.

The '''atmosphere of Earth''' is the layer of [[gas]]es, commonly known as '''air''', that surrounds the planet [[Earth]] and is retained by [[gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]]. The atmosphere of Earth protects [[life]] on Earth by creating [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] allowing for [[liquid water]] to exist on the Earth's [[planetary surface|surface]], absorbing [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], warming the surface through heat retention ([[greenhouse effect]]), and reducing temperature extremes between [[daytime|day]] and [[night]] (the [[diurnal temperature variation]]).

By volume, dry air contains 78.09% [[nitrogen]], 20.95% [[oxygen]],&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Earth’s Oxygen: A Mystery Easy to Take for Granted |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html |date=3 October 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 0.93% [[argon]], 0.04% [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]], and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]], on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and [[atmospheric pressure]] vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in [[photosynthesis]] by [[terrestrial plant]]s and [[breathing]] of [[terrestrial animal]]s is found only in Earth's [[troposphere]] and in [[breathing gas|artificial atmospheres]].

The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;kg,&lt;ref&gt;Lide, David R. ''Handbook of Chemistry and Physics''. Boca Raton, FL: CRC, 1996: 14–17&lt;/ref&gt; three quarters of which is within about {{convert|11|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]]. The [[Kármán line]], at {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during [[atmospheric reentry]] of spacecraft at an altitude of around {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Several [[Atmospheric stratification|layers]] can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.

The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called [[Atmospheric sciences|atmospheric science]] (aerology). Early pioneers in the field include [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] and [[Richard Assmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Vázquez|author2=A.

[[File:Atmospheric Water Vapor Mean.2005.030.jpg|thumb|right|Mean atmospheric water vapor]]

The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[argon]]. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).&lt;ref name="WallaceHobbs"&gt;Wallace, John M. and Peter V. Hobbs. [http://cup.aos.wisc.edu/453/2016/readings/Atmospheric_Science-Wallace_Hobbs.pdf ''Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey'']. Elsevier. Second Edition, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-12-732951-2}}.

Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as [[aerosol]]s in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]] of mineral and organic composition, [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], and [[volcanic ash]]. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as [[chlorine]] (elemental or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds and elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor. Sulfur compounds such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.

== Structure of the atmosphere ==
[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|'''Earth's atmosphere''' Lower 4 layers of the atmosphere in 3 dimensions as seen diagonally from above the exobase.  Layers drawn to scale, objects within the layers are not to scale. Aurorae shown here at the bottom of the thermosphere can actually form at any altitude in this atmospheric layer.]]

=== Principal layers ===
In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the [[Atmosphere of Earth#Temperature and speed of sound|temperature]] section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented [[Weather balloon|balloon soundings]], the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/mos-upper-atmosphere.html#.VHg5AzHF8vY |title=Earth's Upper Atmosphere |last=Zell |first=Holly |date=2015-03-02 |newspaper=NASA|access-date=2017-02-20 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:
* Exosphere: 700 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;km (440 to 6,200 miles)
* Thermosphere: 80 to 700&amp;nbsp;km (50 to 440 miles)&lt;ref name="thermosphere"&gt;{{cite web |author=Randy Russell |title=The Thermosphere |year=2008 |url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/thermosphere.html |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mesosphere: 50 to 80&amp;nbsp;km (31 to 50 miles)
* Stratosphere: 12 to 50&amp;nbsp;km (7 to 31 miles)
* Troposphere: 0 to 12&amp;nbsp;km (0 to 7 miles)&lt;ref name=tropopauseheight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap01/tropo.html |title=The height of the tropopause |publisher=Das.uwyo.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exosphere====
{{main|Exosphere}}
The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the [[exobase]], which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700&amp;nbsp;km above sea level, to about 10,000&amp;nbsp;km (6,200&amp;nbsp;mi; 33,000,000&amp;nbsp;ft) where it merges into the [[solar wind]].

This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow [[ballistic trajectories]] and may migrate in and out of the [[magnetosphere]] or the solar wind.

The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the [[aurora borealis]] and [[aurora australis]] sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.

====Thermosphere====
{{main|Thermosphere}}
The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about {{convert|80|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} up to the [[thermopause]] at an altitude range of {{convert|500|-|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2|comma=5}}. The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.&lt;ref name="thermosphere"/&gt; Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the [[exobase]]. The lower part of the thermosphere, from {{convert|80|to|550|km}} above Earth's surface, contains the [[ionosphere]].

The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as {{convert|1500|C|abbr=on|sigfig=2|comma=5}}, though the gas molecules are so far apart that its [[Kinetic theory of gases|temperature in the usual sense]] is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of [[oxygen]], for example) travels an average of {{convert|1|km|mi ft|comma=5}} between collisions with other molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Ahrens, C. Donald. Essentials of Meteorology. Published by Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.

This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the [[aurora borealis]] and [[aurora australis]] are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|350|and|420|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.

====Mesosphere====
{{main|Mesosphere}}
The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about {{convert|50|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} to the mesopause at {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} above sea level.

Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the [[mesopause]] that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around {{convert|-85|C|F K|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=States |first=Robert J. |last2=Gardner |first2=Chester S. |title=Thermal Structure of the Mesopause Region (80–105 km) at 40°N Latitude.

Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric [[noctilucent cloud]]s. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning-induced discharges known as [[upper-atmospheric lightning|transient luminous events (TLEs)]] occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric [[cumulonimbus cloud|thunderclouds]]. The mesosphere is also the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by [[sounding rocket]]s and rocket-powered aircraft.

====Stratosphere====
{{main|Stratosphere}}

The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the [[tropopause]]. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly {{convert|12|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} above Earth's surface to the [[stratopause]] at an altitude of about {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.

The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at [[Sea level pressure|sea level]]. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) radiation from the Sun by the [[ozone layer]], which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be {{convert|-60|C|F K|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="stratopause"&gt;{{cite web |author=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |title=stratopause |year=1993 |url=http://www.webref.org/chemistry/s/stratopause.htm |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or [[nacreous cloud]]s are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.

====Troposphere====
{{main|Troposphere}}
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about {{cvt|12|km|mi ft}}, although this [[altitude]] varies from about {{cvt|9|km|mi ft}} at the [[geographic pole]]s to {{cvt|17|km|mi ft}} at the [[Equator]],&lt;ref name=tropopauseheight/&gt; with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the [[tropopause]], a boundary marked in most places by a [[temperature inversion]] (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]]al with height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barry |first1=R. G. |last2=Chorley |first2=R. J. |year=1971 |title=Atmosphere, Weather and Climate |location=London |publisher=Menthuen &amp; Co Ltd. |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tyson |first1=P. D. |last2=Preston-Whyte |first2=R. A. |year=2013 |title=The Weather and Climate of Southern Africa |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence, the origin of its name in the Greek word τρόπος, ''tropos'', meaning "turn"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the [[mass]] of Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology |year=1984 |section=Troposphere |quote=It contains about four-fifths of the mass of the whole atmosphere.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower {{cvt|5.6|km|mi ft}} of the troposphere.

Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.

===Other layers===
Within the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:
* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer [[ozone]] concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The [[ionosphere]] is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s. During daytime hours, it stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the [[magnetosphere]]. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth.
* The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=homosphere1 |title='&amp;#39;homosphere'&amp;#39;—AMS Glossary |publisher=Amsglossary.allenpress.com |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914045832/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=homosphere1 |archivedate=14 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the ''[[turbopause]]'' found at about {{convert|100|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, the very [[Kármán line|edge of space]] itself as accepted by the [[Federation Aeronautique Internationale|FAI]], which places it about {{convert|20|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} above the mesopause.
:Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the [[mean free path|distance that particles can move without colliding with one another]] is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.{{clarify|reason=so what is the intermediate region of the heterosphere composed of??|date=February 2016}}
* The [[planetary boundary layer]] is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [[turbulence|turbulent diffusion]]. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about {{convert|100|m|ft}} on clear, calm nights to {{convert |3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more during the afternoon in dry regions.

==Physical properties==
{{Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg}}

===Pressure and thickness===
{{Main|Atmospheric pressure}}

The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] as {{convert|101325|Pa|Torr psi mmHg|lk=on|comma=off}}. This is sometimes referred to as a unit of [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmospheres (atm)]]. Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; kg (1.135×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; lb),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Mass of the Atmosphere: A Constraint on Global Analyses |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=864 |date=1970-01-01 |doi=10.1175/JCLI-3299.1 |bibcode = 2005JCli...18..864T|last1 = Trenberth|first1 = Kevin E.|last2=Smith |first2=Lesley }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and [[low-pressure area|weather]].

If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of {{convert|8.50|km|ft|abbr=on}}. It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every {{convert|5.6|km|ft|abbr=on}} or by a factor of 1/[[e (mathematical constant)|e]] every {{convert|7.64|km|ft|abbr=on}}, the average [[scale height]] of the atmosphere below {{convert|70|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.

In summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Lutgens, Frederick K. and Edward J. Tarbuck (1995) ''The Atmosphere'', Prentice Hall, 6th ed., pp. 14–17, {{ISBN|0-13-350612-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 50% is below {{convert|5.6|km|ft|abbr=on}}.
* 90% is below {{convert|16|km|ft|abbr=on}}.
* 99.99997% is below {{convert|100|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, the [[Kármán line]]. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered [[astronaut]]s.

By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at {{convert|8848|m|ft|abbr=on}};
commercial [[airliners]] typically cruise between {{convert|10|and|13|km|ft|abbr=on}} where the thinner air improves fuel economy; [[weather balloons]] reach {{convert|30.4|km|ft|abbr=on}} and above; and the highest [[North American X-15|X-15]] flight in 1963 reached {{convert|108.0|km|ft|abbr=on}}.

Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]] still occur. [[Meteors]] begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's [[ionosphere]], important to [[HF radio]] propagation, begin below 100&amp;nbsp;km and extend beyond 500&amp;nbsp;km. By comparison, the [[International Space Station]] and [[Space Shuttle]] typically orbit at 350–400&amp;nbsp;km, within the [[F-layer]] of the ionosphere where they encounter enough [[atmospheric drag]] to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700–800&amp;nbsp;km.

=== Temperature and speed of sound ===
{{Main|Atmospheric temperature|Speed of sound}}
[[File:Atmospheric Temperature Trend.jpg|thumb|Temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured between January 1979 and December 2005 by [[Microwave Sounding Unit]]s and [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit]]s on [[NOAA]] weather satellites.  The instruments record microwaves emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Source:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=7839 |title=Atmospheric Temperature Trends, 1979–2005 : Image of the Day |publisher=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11&amp;nbsp;km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the [[stratosphere]], starting above about 20&amp;nbsp;km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the [[ozone layer]] caused by capture of significant [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the [[Sun]] by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named [[thermosphere]] above 90&amp;nbsp;km.

Because in an [[ideal gas]] of constant composition the [[speed of sound]] depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.

===Density and mass===
[[File:Atmosphere model.png|thumb|Temperature and mass density against altitude from the [[NRLMSISE-00]] [[International Standard Atmosphere|standard atmosphere]] model (the eight dotted lines in each "decade" are at the eight cubes 8, 27, 64, ..., 729)]]

{{Main|Density of air}}

The density of air at sea level is about 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1.2&amp;nbsp;g/L, 0.0012 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the [[ideal gas law]]). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the [[barometric formula]]. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.

The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5{{e|15}}) [[tonne]]s or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], "The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480{{E|18}}&amp;nbsp;kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5{{E|15}}&amp;nbsp;kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27{{E|16}}&amp;nbsp;kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 ±0.0003{{E|18}}&amp;nbsp;kg."

==Optical properties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2013}} 
{{See also|Sunlight}}
Solar [[radiation]] (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the [[Sun]]. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170519"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRL-201760515"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point |date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |volume=44 |issue=10 |page=5197 |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.5197M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scattering===
{{Main|Scattering}}
When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, [[photon]]s interact with it through ''scattering''. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called ''direct radiation'' and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. ''Indirect radiation'' is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an [[overcast]] day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called [[Rayleigh scattering]], shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

===Absorption===
{{Main|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}
[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric [[transmittance]] (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including [[visible light]].]]

Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 [[nanometer]]s. Water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700&amp;nbsp;nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.

The combined [[absorption spectra]] of the gases in the atmosphere leave "windows" of low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The [[optical window]] runs from around 300&amp;nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet]]-C) up into the range humans can see, the [[visible spectrum]] (commonly called light), at roughly 400–700&amp;nbsp;nm and continues to the [[infrared]] to around 1100&amp;nbsp;nm. There are also [[Infrared window|infrared]] and [[radio window]]s that transmit some infrared and [[radio waves]] at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.

===Emission===
{{Main|Emission (electromagnetic radiation)}}

''Emission'' is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their "[[black body]]" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately {{convert|6000|K|lk=on}}, its radiation peaks near 500&amp;nbsp;nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately {{convert|290|K|abbr=on}}, so its radiation peaks near 10,000&amp;nbsp;nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.

Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.

The [[greenhouse effect]] is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are {{CO2}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

===Refractive index===
{{See also|Scintillation (astronomy)}}The [[refractive index]] of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the [[horizon]] because light is refracted in the same direction as the [[curvature]] of Earth's surface.

The refractive index of air depends on temperature,&lt;ref name="Edlén"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bengt |last=Edlén |date=1966 |journal=Metrologia |volume=2 |issue=2 |title=The refractive index of air |pages=71–80 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/2/2/002 |bibcode=1966Metro...2...71E }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the [[mirage]].

==Circulation==
{{Main|Atmospheric circulation}}

[[File:AtmosphCirc2.png|thumb|right|An idealised view of three large circulation cells.]]
''Atmospheric circulation'' is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with [[ocean circulation]]) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.

==Evolution of Earth's atmosphere==
{{See also|History of Earth|Paleoclimatology}}

===Earliest atmosphere===
The [[paleoatmosphere|first atmosphere]] consisted of gases in the [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|solar nebula]], primarily [[hydrogen]]. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the [[gas giant]]s ([[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]), notably water vapor, [[methane]] and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=Zahnle&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Zahnle |first1=K. |last2=Schaefer |first2=L. |last3=Fegley |first3=B. |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a004895 |title=Earth's Earliest Atmospheres |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=a004895 |year=2010 |pmid=20573713 |pmc=2944365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second atmosphere===
Outgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge [[asteroids]], produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]] plus [[carbon dioxide]] and inert gases.&lt;ref name=Zahnle/&gt; A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;B. Windley: ''The Evolving Continents.'' Wiley Press, New York 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable "second atmosphere". The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schopf: ''Earth's Earliest Biosphere: Its Origin and Evolution.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1983&lt;/ref&gt; How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the "[[faint young Sun paradox]]".

The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early [[temperature record]] of Earth – with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late [[Archean]] [[Eon (geology)|Eon]] an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing [[cyanobacteria]] (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]), which have been found as [[stromatolite]] fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy ([[isotope ratio]] proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the [[carbon cycle]] became established as early as 4 billion years ago.

[[Proxy (climate)#Lake and ocean sediments|Ancient sediments]] in the [[Gabon]] dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the [[Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion]].&lt;ref&gt;

The constant re-arrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] and its appearance is indicated by the end of the [[banded iron formations]].

Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a [[Redox|reducing]] atmosphere to an [[oxidizing]] atmosphere. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Scotese, [http://www.scotese.com/precamb_chart.htm Back to Earth History : Summary Chart for the Precambrian], Paleomar Project&lt;/ref&gt; The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the [[Phanerozoic]] Eon, during the earliest period of which, the [[Cambrian]], oxygen-requiring [[metazoan]] life forms began to appear.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants [[photosynthesis|use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]], releasing oxygen. Breakdown of [[pyrite]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s release [[sulfur]] into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward:[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11630] Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air pollution ===
{{Main|Air pollution}}

''Air pollution'' is the introduction into the atmosphere of [[chemical]]s, [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] or [[Organic matter|biological materials]] that cause harm or discomfort to organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Starting from [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pollution] Pollution – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] is caused by air pollution, chiefly from [[chlorofluorocarbons]] and other ozone-depleting substances.

The [[scientific consensus]] is that the [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="grida7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf |format=PDF |title=Summary for Policymakers |work=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

'''Azbukovica''' is a highland area in western [[Serbia]], on the border with [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. River [[Drina]] separates Azbukovica from municipalities of [[Srebrenica]] and [[Bratunac]]. Borders: to the northwest - municipality of [[Mali Zvornik]], to the north - municipality of [[Krupanj]], to the northeastern - municipality of [[Osečina]], to the east - municipality of [[Valjevo]], and to the south - municipality of [[Bajina Bašta]]. The highest peak is Tornička Bobija 1272 meters high on the mountain [[Bobija]]. Several torrential rivers, flowing into the [[Drina]], intersect Azbukovica. The most famous rivers are [[Trešnjica]] and [[Ljuboviđa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2003/05/03/srpski/SR03050201.shtml Prolaznici kroz Azbukovicu, Glas javnosti]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Ottoman period, the region was administratively part of the Sokol ''nahiya'' (Sokolska nahija).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/svecovek/ustrojstvo/manastiri/soko/mvasiljevic-soko/drugi_deo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BibleBelt.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The area roughly considered to constitute the Bible Belt]]

The '''Bible Belt''' is an informal region in the [[Southern United States]] in which socially conservative [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Protestantism]] plays a strong role in society and politics, and Christian [[church attendance]] across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. During the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial period]] (1607–1776), the South was a stronghold of the [[Church of England|Anglican church]]. Its transition to a stronghold of non-Anglican Protestantism occurred gradually over the next century as a series of religious revival movements, many associated with the Baptist denomination, gained great popularity in the region.&lt;ref name=Jeynes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=William H. Jeynes ; foreword by William J.|title=A call for character education and prayer in the schools|date=2009|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=031335104X|pages=122–123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmlFCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region is usually contrasted with the religiously diverse [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Great Lakes region|Great Lakes]], the [[Mormon Corridor]] in [[Utah]] and [[southern Idaho]], and the relatively [[Secularism|secular]] [[Western United States|Western]] and [[New England]] regions of the [[United States]]. Whereas the state with the highest percentage of residents identifying as non-religious is the New England state of [[Vermont]] at 37%, in the Bible Belt state of [[Alabama]] it is just 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/unaffiliated-religious-nones/|title=The Unaffiliated|date=May 11, 2015|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tennessee]] has the highest proportion of Evangelical Protestants, at 52%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/tennessee/|title=Adults in Tennessee|date=May 11, 2015|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known usage of the term "Bible Belt" was by American journalist and social commentator [[H. L. Mencken]], who in 1924 wrote in the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]'': "The old game, I suspect, is beginning to play out in the Bible Belt."&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro (ed.). ''Yale Book of Quotations''. [[Yale University Press]] (2006). {{ISBN|978-0-300-10798-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Mencken claimed the term as his invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/h-l-mencken-letter-to-charles-green-shaw-9819 H. L. Mencken letter to Charles Green Shaw, 1927 Dec. 2 .] Charles Green Shaw papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.

==Geography==
The name "Bible Belt" has been applied historically to the South and parts of the Midwest, but is more commonly identified with the South. In a 1961 study, [[Wilbur Zelinsky]] delineated the region as the area in which Protestant denominations, especially Southern Baptist, Methodist, and evangelical, are the predominant religious affiliation. The region thus defined included most of the Southern United States, including most of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], and in the states south of the [[Ohio River]], and extending east to include central West Virginia and Virginia, from the [[Shenandoah Valley]]  southward. In addition, the Bible Belt covers most of [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] and southern parts of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]]. On the other hand, areas in the South which are ''not'' considered part of the Bible Belt include heavily Catholic Southern Louisiana, central and southern Florida, which have been settled mainly by immigrants and Americans from elsewhere in the country, and overwhelmingly Hispanic South Texas. A 1978 study by Charles Heatwole identified the Bible Belt as the region dominated by 24 fundamentalist Protestant denominations, corresponding to essentially the same area mapped by Zelinsky.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Vann (2008), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_cx6NMWOqKQC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=bible+belt+charles+heatwole&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s_3pBjUyyC&amp;sig=58XbseF5_V9de4OW2ZOX34mqwTw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0Z8zS-zxDtWztgeb4Jj9CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=13&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=bible%20belt%20charles%20heatwole&amp;f=false In search of Ulster-Scots land: the birth and geotheological imagings of a transatlantic people, 1603-1703]'', Univ of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|1-57003-708-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-708-5}}. Pages 138-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen W. Tweedie, an Associate Professor Emeritus in the Department of Geography at [[Oklahoma State University]], the Bible Belt is now viewed in terms of numerical concentration of the audience for religious television.&lt;ref name=Carney_Fast_Food&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carney|first1=edited by George O.|title=Fast food, stock cars and rock'n' roll : place and space in American pop culture|date=1995|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham|isbn=9780847680801|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJnNasHzjN0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finds two belts: one more eastern that stretches from Florida, (excluding Miami, [[Tampa]] and South Florida), through [[Alabama]], [[Tennessee]], Kentucky, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], North and [[South Carolina]], and into Southern Virginia ; and another concentrated in Texas (excluding [[El Paso]], and [[South Texas]]), [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], (excluding [[New Orleans]] and [[Acadiana]]), Oklahoma, Missouri (excluding [[St. Louis]]), [[Kansas]], and [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Tweedie, S.W. (1978) Viewing the Bible Belt. [[Journal of Popular Culture]] 11; 865-76&lt;/ref&gt;  "[H]is research also broke the Bible Belt into two core regions, a western region and an eastern region. Tweedie's western Bible Belt was focused on a core that extended from Little Rock, Arkansas to Tulsa, Oklahoma. His eastern Bible Belt was focused on a core that included the major population centers of Virginia and North Carolina.&lt;ref name=About_BibleBelt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Matt|title=The Bible Belt Extends Throughout the American South (And Perhaps Beyond?)|url=http://geography.about.com/od/culturalgeography/fl/The-Bible-Belt.htm|accessdate=11 June 2015|agency=About Education|publisher=About.com|ref=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bible-minded Cities map.PNG|thumb|Bible-minded cities map]]
A study was commissioned by the [[American Bible Society]] to survey the importance of the Bible in the metropolitan areas of the United States. The report was based on 42,855 interviews conducted between 2005 and 2012. It determined the 10 most "Bible-minded" cities were [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]; [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]; [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]; [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; [[Jackson, Mississippi]]; [[Springfield, Missouri]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]];, [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]; [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville-Decatur, Alabama]]; and [[Charleston, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.barna.org/americas-most-and-least-bible-minded-cities/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328095729/http://cities.barna.org/americas-most-and-least-bible-minded-cities/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 March 2013|title=America's Most and Least Bible-Minded Cities|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the South, there is a smaller Bible Belt in [[West Michigan]], centered around the heavily Dutch-influenced cities of [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. Christian colleges in that region include [[Calvin College]], [[Hope College]], [[Cornerstone University]], [[Grace Bible College]], and [[Kuyper College]]. West Michigan is generally fiscally and socially conservative.

==Buckle==
[[File:Go to church....jpg|thumb|A billboard near the center of [[Alabama]] ]]

Several locations are occasionally referred to as "the Buckle of the Bible Belt":
*[[Abilene, Texas]] a city of 117,000, is home to three Christian universities: the Baptist affiliated [[Hardin-Simmons University]], the Church of Christ's [[Abilene Christian University]], and Methodist founded [[McMurry University]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia of the great plains"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ct.002|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains - ABILENE, TEXAS|work=unl.edu|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nashville, Tennessee]], sometimes referred to as "the Protestant Vatican",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insiders' Guide to Nashville|first1=Cindy Stooksbury|last1=Guier|first2=Jackie Sheckler|last2=Finch|year=2007|edition=6th|pages=13, 35, 396}}&lt;/ref&gt; has over 700 churches,&lt;ref name="nashcity1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nashcity.com/religious-institutions/christian-churches/index.shtml |title=Nashville Area Churches |work=NashCity.com |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; several seminaries, and a number of Christian schools, colleges and universities, including [[Belmont University]], [[Trevecca Nazarene University]], [[Lipscomb University]], [[Free Will Baptist Bible College]] and [[American Baptist College]]. Nashville is the seat of the [[National Baptist Convention, USA]], the headquarters of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], the [[National Association of Free Will Baptists]], the [[Gideons International]], the [[Gospel Music Association]], and [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]], the world's largest producer of Bibles.&lt;ref name="road&amp;travel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadandtravel.com/travel%20directory/Tennessee/nashvillestory.htm |title=Nashville: Sophisticated Southern City with a Country Edge |work=RoadandTravel.com |first=Rachel L |last=Miller |date=2008-04-14 |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and cultural context==
There has been research that links evangelical Protestantism with social conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/6/8/0/6/p68068_index.html{{deadlink|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, President [[Harry S. Truman]] told Catholic leaders he wanted to send an ambassador to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Truman said the leading Democrats in Congress approved, but they warned him, "it would defeat Democratic Senators and Congressmen in the Bible Belt."&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Smith, ''Hostage of Fortune'' (2001) p. 604&lt;/ref&gt;

In presidential elections, the Bible Belt states of Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas have voted for the Republican candidate in all elections since 1980; Oklahoma has supported the Republican presidential candidate in every election since 1968. Other Bible Belt states have voted for the Republican presidential candidate in the majority of elections since 1980, but have gone to the Democratic candidate either once or twice since then. However, with the exception of Mississippi, historical geographer Barry Vann shows that counties in the upland areas of the Appalachians and the Ozarks have a more conservative voting pattern than the counties located in the coastal plains.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Vann, In Search of Ulster Scots Land; Barry Vann, "Natural Liberty in the Bible Belt," Nomocracy in Politics (February, 2014), http://nomocracyinpolitics.com/2014/02/03/natural-liberty-in-the-bible-belt-an-explanation-of-conservative-voting-patterns-in-southern-appalachia-by-barry-a-vann/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203064959/http://nomocracyinpolitics.com/2014/02/03/natural-liberty-in-the-bible-belt-an-explanation-of-conservative-voting-patterns-in-southern-appalachia-by-barry-a-vann/ |date=2014-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the term "Bible Belt" has been used to refer to areas within individual cities, which have a high concentration of Christians, usually centralised around a [[megachurch]], for example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/14/1094927585127.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Bible Belt wants to tighten a grip on power | date=15 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the north-western suburbs of [[Sydney]] focusing on The [[Hills District]], where [[Hillsong Church]] is located
* the outer-eastern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], where [[CityLife Church]], [[Crossway Baptist Church]], Stairway Church and Discovery Church are located.
* the north-eastern suburbs of [[Adelaide]] focusing on [[Paradise, South Australia|Paradise]], [[Modbury, South Australia|Modbury]] and [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]], where [[Influencers Church]] is located
* the south-eastern region of [[Queensland]] comprising the towns of [[Laidley, Queensland|Laidley]], [[Gatton, Queensland|Gatton]] and [[Toowoomba]].
* the Brisbane southern suburbs of Mansfield, Springwood, Carindale and Mount Gravatt.  Garden City Assembly of God church, Citipointe church, Clark Taylor's Worship Centre, and Brisbane Hillsong are notable mega-churches in this area.

[[Toowoomba]] city in [[Queensland]] has long been regarded as fertile ground for Christian fundamentalist right-wing movements &lt;ref name="espace.library.uq.edu.au"&gt;https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that adhere to biblical literalism, particularly those within the Pentecostal and charismatic stream of Christianity.  This was exemplified by the highly publicised rise and subsequent fall of [[Howard Carter (evangelist)|Howard Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifemessenger.org/HTML/AboutUs/TheMessenger/TheStory.php{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Logos Foundation (Australia)|Logos Foundation]] in the 1980s. The Logos Foundation and other similar movements that have followed it, operate in a controlling, authoritarian and almost cultish manner, contributing to their notoriety.&lt;ref name="espace.library.uq.edu.au"/&gt; Other similarly conservative Pentecostal churches within the city have, since that time, banded together into a loose federation known as the Toowoomba Christian Leaders' Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.onechurch.org.au/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214181124/http://www.onechurch.org.au/ |archive-date=2015-02-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (note - most traditional church denominations have their own, separate ecumenical group) This network views itself as having a divine mission to 'take the city for the Lord' and as such, endorses elements of religious right-wing political advocacy,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Christian-Leaders-Network-Toowoomba-199607780060750/&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Australian Christian Lobby]](ACL).   ACL's current managing director who was raised in the Logos Foundation and is a former Toowoomba City councillor is [[Lyle Shelton (Australian lobbyist)|Lyle Shelton]].  These church groups are strongly associated with North American trends such as the [[New Apostolic Reformation]], [[Dominion theology]], [[Five-fold ministry]] thinking, [[Kingdom Now theology]] and [[revivalism]].  They support the achievement of a type of theocratic society where conservative and literal interpretations of the bible are the dominant drivers of government, education, the Arts, the media and entertainment.  Churches involved in this group currently include the successor organization to the Logos Foundation, the Toowoomba City Church, along with the Range Christian Fellowship, Spring Street Assembly of God, Christian Outreach Centre, Hume Ridge Church of Christ, Revival Ministries of Australia Shiloh Centre, the Edge Christian Centre and many others.

===Canada===
The province of [[Saskatchewan]] has been referred to as Canada's Bible Belt with a significant [[Anabaptist]] population and other [[Protestants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wells|first1=Kristopher|title=Progressive Albertans are challenging province’s Bible Belt stereotypes|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/progressive-albertans-are-challenging-provinces-bible-belt-stereotypes/article28361567/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estonia===
[[Demographics of Estonia#Religion|Census results]] show religious belief in the country is more prevalent in the east running from north to south along the border with Russia, particularly in those areas with large populations of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]], [[Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church|Estonian Orthodox]] and [[Old Believers|Orthodox Old Believers]].

===Finland===
[[Conservative Laestadianism]], a Finnish Lutheran revival, is widespread in northern ([[Northern Ostrobothnia]] and [[Lapland (Finland)]]) and central parts ([[Northern Savonia]]) of [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/maantiede/geofi/fennia/demo/pages/fig_pages/raento_cd4.htm|title=FENNIA 2002|website=www.helsinki.fi|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Rural portions of Bavaria, approximately stretching from [[Franconia]] into [[Württemberg]], constitute Germany's Bible Belt with mostly [[Catholics]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.statistik.bayern.de/presse/archiv/2013/216_2013.php According to a 2011 census, Bavaria is still predominatly Catholic.]&lt;/ref&gt;, some [[Lutherans]] and [[Reformed]] [[Protestants]].
An area in [[Erzgebirge]] in [[Saxony]] has been described also as the "Saxon Bible Belt" with a notable [[evangelical Protestant]]/[[Christian fundamentalist]]/[[free church]] community, as well as some conservative [[Lutheran]] parishes that are opposed to homosexual marriage. Nevertheless, the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony]] approved church resolutions regarding the issue regardless of opinions within those parishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weiterdenken.de/sites/default/files/downloads/ErklaerungKirchgemeinden.pdf Erklärung 144 sächsischer Kirchgemeinden zum familiären Zusammenleben im Pfarrhaus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weiterdenken.de/de/2014/06/01/evangelikale-sachsen-ein-bericht Evangelikale in Sachsen – Ein Bericht.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===

In [[Northern Ireland]], the area in [[County Antrim]] stretching from roughly [[Ballymoney]] to [[Larne]] and centred in the area of [[Ballymena]] is often referred to as a Bible Belt. This is because the area is heavily Protestant with a large [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] community. From 1970 to 2010, the MP for [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|North Antrim]] was [[Ian Paisley]], a [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|Free Presbyterian]] minister well known for his theological fundamentalism. The town of Ballymena, the largest town in the constituency, is often referred to as the "buckle" of the Bible Belt. In the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[County Wicklow]] and western parts of [[County Cork]] have the highest population of Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sluggerotoole.com/2005/07/29/more_news_from_the_bible_belt/|title=More news from the Bible Belt…|first=Belfast|last=Gonzo|date=29 July 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blue Hole Falls''' located on High Shoals Creek in the High Shoals Scenic Area of the [[Chattahoochee National Forest]] in [[Towns County]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], United States.

The falls can be accessed via the High Shoals Trail, a well-maintained 1.2 mile trail to the larger [[High Shoals Creek Falls]] downstream.  The trailhead is accessed via Indian Grave Gap Road (Forest Service Road 283), a gravel road located about 11.5 miles north of [[Helen, GA]] on GA Highway 17/75.  The road fords a shallow creek about 100 yards from the entrance at [[Georgia State Route 75|GA Highway 17/75]], but the ford does not require a four-wheel drive vehicle to cross under normal conditions.

To reach Blue Hole Falls requires a one-mile hike downhill via the High Shoals Trail.  There are several easily  identifiable primitive campsites with fire rings located between the  latter half of the trail and High Shoals Creek that offer camping to large and small groups.  A small observation deck overlooks the falls as they cascade into Blue Hole.  Blue Hole reaches depths of more than ten feet, and is a common destination for swimmers, hikers, and campers during the summer months, when the creek temperature remains in the 40s Fahrenheit.

A '''buoy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ}} or  {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|b|uː|iː}}) is a [[Buoyancy|float]]ing device that can have many purposes. It can be [[anchor]]ed (stationary) or allowed to drift with ocean currents. The word, of [[Old French]] or [[Middle Dutch]] origin, is in [[British English]] most commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ}} (identical to [[boy]], as in [[buoyancy|buoyant]]). In [[American English]] the pronunciation is closer to "''boo-ee''."

==Types==
* [[Sea mark]] – aids [[pilotage]] by marking a [[Shipping|maritime]] channel, hazard and administrative area to allow [[boat]]s and [[ship]]s to [[navigation|navigate]] safely.  Some navigational buoys are fitted with a bell or gong, which sounds when waves move the buoy
* [[Lifebuoy]] – used as a life saving buoy designed to be thrown to a person in the water to provide [[buoyancy]]. Usually has a connecting line allowing the casualty to be pulled to the rescuer
* [[Rescue buoy (submarine)|Submarine rescue buoy]] – used for release in case of emergencies or for communication
* DAN buoy – has several meanings:
** A large maritime [[navigation]]al aid providing a platform for [[light]] and [[radio]] beacons
** A lifebuoy with flags used on [[yacht]]s and smaller pleasure craft
** A temporary marker buoy used during [[Seine fishing#Danish seine|Danish seine]] fishing to mark the anchor position of a net.
** A temporary marker buoy set by [[danlayer]]s during minesweeping operations to indicate the boundaries of swept paths, swept areas, known hazards, and other locations or reference points.
** A temporary marker buoy set to mark a [[man overboard]] position.
* Large Navigational Buoy (LNB or [[Lanby buoy]]) is an automatic buoy over 10m high equipped with a powerful light monitored electronically as a replacement for lightships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Large Navigational Buoys (LNB)|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/LNB.asp|publisher=United States Coast Guard|accessdate=Jul 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A LNB may be marked on charts as a "Superbuoy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=US Chart No. 1|author=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|publisher=NOAA|year=2013|location=Silver Spring|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sonobuoy]] – used by [[anti-submarine warfare]] aircraft to detect [[submarine]]s by [[Sonar|SONAR]]
* [[Surface marker buoy]] – taken on dives by [[scuba diving|scuba divers]] to mark their position underwater&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davies, D |title=Diver location devices |journal=Journal of the [[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=1998 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5968 |accessdate=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Decompression buoy]] – deployed by submerged scuba divers to mark their position underwater whilst doing [[decompression stops]]
* [[Diving shot|Shot buoy]] – used to mark dive sites for the boat safety cover of scuba divers so that the divers can descend to the dive site more easily in conditions of low visibility or [[tide|tidal currents]] and more safely do [[decompression stops]] on their ascent.
* [[Safe water mark]] or [[Fairway Buoy]] – a navigational buoy which marks the entrance to a channel or a nearby landfall
* [[Emergency wreck buoy]] – An Emergency Wreck Buoys provides a clear and unambiguous means of marking new wrecks. This buoy is used as a temporary response, typically for the first 24–72 hours. This buoy is coloured in an equal number of blue and yellow vertical stripes and is fitted with an alternating blue and yellow flashing light. This has come about due to the collisions which occurred in the Dover Straits in 2002 when vessels struck the new wreck of the {{Ship|MV|Tricolor}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/buoys/emergency_wreck.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702032424/http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/buoys/emergency_wreck.html |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Navigational aid#Lateral marker|lateral marker]] buoy
* Mooring buoys – used to keep one end of a [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] cable or chain on the water's surface so that [[ship]]s or boats can tie on to it. Many [[marina]]s mark these with a number and assign it to a particular vessel, or rent it out to transient vessels.
* Tripping buoys – used to keep one end of a 'tripping line' on the water's surface so that a stuck [[anchor]] can more easily be freed
* [[Weather buoy]]s – equipped to measure weather parameters such as air temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction and to report these data via satellite radio links such as the purpose-built [[Argos System]] or commercial [[satellite phone]] networks to meteorological centres for use in forecasting and climate study. May be anchored (moored buoys) or allowed to drift (drifting buoys) in the open ocean currents. Position is calculated by the satellite. Weather buoys are sometimes referred to as [[Ocean_Data_Acquisition_System|ODAS]] buoys or [[Ocean_Data_Acquisition_System|Ocean Data Acquisition Systems]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iala-aism.org/wiki/dictionary/index.php/ODAS_buoy|title=International Dictionary of Marine Aids to Navigation – ODAS buoy|last=IALA|first=|date=2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be marked on charts as "Superbuoys."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis|Tsunami buoys]] – anchored buoys that can detect sudden changes in undersea water pressure are used as part of [[tsunami warning systems]] in the [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]] and Indian Oceans.
* [[Spar buoy]] – a tall, thin buoy that floats upright in the water, e.g. [[R/P FLIP]].
* Profiling buoy – specialized models which adjust buoyancy so that they will sink at a controlled rate to 2,000 metres below the surface while measuring sea temperatures and salinity.  After a time, typically 10 days, the buoy returns to the surface, transmits its data via satellite, and then sinks again.&lt;ref name=Kery1989&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kery, SM |title=Diving in support of buoy engineering: The RTEAM project |journal=In: Lang, MA; Jaap, WC (ed).

* Ice marking buoys – used for marking ice holes in frozen lakes and rivers, so that snowmobiles do not drive over the holes.
* Marker buoys – used in [[naval warfare]], particularly [[anti-submarine warfare]], is a light-emitting or smoke-emitting, or both, marker using some kind of [[pyrotechnic]] to provide the [[flare]] and [[smoke]]. It is commonly a 3-inch (76&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter device about 20&amp;nbsp;inches (500&amp;nbsp;mm) long that is set off by contact with seawater and floats on the surface. Some markers extinguish after a set period and others are made to sink.
*Lobster trap buoys – brightly colored buoys used for the marking of lobster trap locations so the person [[lobster fishing]] can find their lobster traps.  Each lobster fisherman has his or her own color markings or registration numbers so they know which ones are theirs.  They are only allowed to haul their own traps and must display their buoy color or license number on their boat so law enforcement officials know what they should be hauling.  The buoys are brightly colored with highly visible numbers so they can be seen under conditions when there is poor visibility like [[rain]], [[fog]], [[sea smoke]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John N., [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17475/17475-h/17475-h.htm#7 "The Lobster Fishery of Maine"], Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission, Vol. 19, Pages 241–265, 1899; from [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Hank; Taft, Jan, [http://www.mainecoastguide.com/ ''A Cruising Guide to the Maine Coast and the Maine Coast Guides for Small Boats''], Peaks Island, Maine : Diamond Pass Publishing, 5th Edition, 2009.

*[[Wave buoy]] – used to measure the movement of the water surface as a wave train. The wave train is analysed to determine statistics like the [[significant wave height]] and period, and wave direction.
*Target buoy – used to simulate target (like small boat) in live fire exercise by naval and coastal forces, usually targeted by weapons (medium size) like HMG's, rapid fire cannons (20 or so mm), autocannons (bigger ones up to 40 and 57mm) and also anti-tank rockets.

'''David Ross Stoddart''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (15 November 1937 – 23 November 2014)  was a British physical geographer known for the study of [[coral reef]]s and [[atoll]]s. He was also known for key works on the history and philosophy of geography as an academic discipline. He was a lecturer at the [[University of Cambridge]], and then professor and later emeritus professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.berkeley.edu/people/person_detail.php?person=40 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200043/http://geography.berkeley.edu/people/person_detail.php?person=40 |archivedate=10 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, The Independent, 4 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and private life==
Stoddart grew up in [[Stockton-on-Tees]], north-east England. His parents both served in France during the First World War, his father with the [[Royal Flying Corps]] and his mother as a nurse.  His father later became an engineer working in the construction of heavy industrial buildings for [[Ashmore, Benson, and Pease]] (later Davy International; now part of Siemens).  He had two siblings.

He married fellow Cambridge geographer June in 1961 and had a daughter, Aldabra (named after the island) and a son, Michael.  He collected a very large private library in Berkeley.

Stoddart suffered from diabetes and skin cancer in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.berkeley.edu/video/walker/walkertalks/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609153917/http://geography.berkeley.edu/video/walker/walkertalks/ |archivedate=9 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}  Walker, R. 2012.

==Academic career ==
Stoddart was possibly the first person from his local grammar school (now demolished) to enter the [[University of Cambridge]], in 1956 (a schoolfriend secured a place at Oxford).  He studied tropical geography at [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St.John's College]] with [[Alfred Steers]] from 1956, graduating with a first class degree in 1959.  His introduction to coral reefs came on the Cambridge Expedition to British Honduras ([[Belize]]), 1959–60. He returned there for further research into corals and the plants of the cays, working for [[Louisiana State University]] before and after a major hurricane, tracking its effects on atolls and reefs. He gained a Cambridge PhD for this work in 1964 and was appointed lecturer in Geography at Cambridge, rising through the ranks.  He was a fellow of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]] from 1966 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00494.12.pdf  Stoddart, D.R. 2001. Be of good cheer, my weary readers, for I have espied land. ''Atoll Research Bulletin'' 494(12)&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s he was a [[Regents Fellow]] at the [[Smithsonian]].

He was appointed Chair of Department and Professor of Geography at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1988, holding the headship until 1994 when he was forced aside by the Dean. The Department had internal conflicts, and Stoddart had managed these effectively for the first few years, hiring several new staff. Ill health was cited when he retired from Berkeley in 2000.

Stoddart studied the geomorphology and ecology of tropical islands and reefs, beginning in Belize, then the [[Maldives]], [[Seychelles]], [[Solomon Islands]], and various locations in the Pacific including the [[Great Barrier Reef]], [[Aitutaki]] in the [[Cook Islands]], and in the mid-1970s to the disputed [[Phoenix Islands]].  His particular focus was documenting the plant assemblages present on atolls, making links to evolutionary biology. He also studied the evolution of atolls since the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;Spencer, T. 2011. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5umXDDmqxwIC&amp;pg=PA1044&amp;lpg=PA1044&amp;dq=David+Ross+Stoddart+date+of+birth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u7Kz2iN2a7&amp;sig=MdyQy1nALvHuboZ2x2MriGDYl68&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WGWJUsy0Auy4iAf-j4H4Ag&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=David%20Ross%20Stoddart%20date%20of%20birth&amp;f=false David Stoddart]. In Hopley, D. (ed.). 'Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs: Structure, Form and Process'. Springer. p1044.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s, accompanying a military expedition, he discovered great biodiversity and documented the huge tortoise populations on the Seychelles island of [[Aldabra]], and the scientific work on its habitat was instrumental in stopping the construction of a British military airfield.  The island became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1982.  In 1967, a similar expedition went to [[Diego Garcia]], one of the [[Chagos Islands]], prior to its appropriation for a controversial American base.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00494.12.pdf  Stoddart, D.R. 2001. Be of good cheer, my weary readers, for I have espied land. ''Attoll Research Bulletin'' 494(12)&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in interest and status of the discipline of [[climatic geomorphology]] was in part indebted to a 1969 publication of Stoddart.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goudie|first=A.S.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Climatic geomorphology|year=2004|pages=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Thomas|first=Michael F.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Tropical geomorphology|year=2004|pages=1063–1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology for applying supposedly "trivial" methodologies in establishing landform differences between morphoclimatic zones, being linked to [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] and by allegedly neglecting the fact that physical laws governing processes are the same across the globe.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt;

He also held an interest in the history of geographic thought, publishing a major book ''On Geography and Its History'' in 1986 and several articles about the discipline, and on the contribution of Darwin's work to understanding the Earth. A parallel program on the morphology and hydrodynamics of salt marshes was largely conducted in the UK.&lt;ref name="spencer" /&gt;  He also studied mangroves and sedimentation.

He published work in the Smithsonian Institution's ''Atoll Research Bulletin''.  He was also one of the founders of the journal ''Progress in Geography'', and the first co-ordinating editor of the journal ''Coral Reefs''.  He was a co-founder and first president of the [[International Society for Reef Studies]] and helped to establish the quadrennial International Coral Reef Symposium. He was also involved in the establishment of the International Year of the Reef in 1997, and of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.

These structures have existed for many centuries and after falling out of use and their function having been forgotten the more substantial earth or stone examples have attracted names such as ''Roman Trenches'', ''Old Fortifications'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The hinds were the main target of the hunt.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Silz cerf8.jpg|thumb|290px|Red Deer stags and hinds]]
Deer hay winds, folds and elricks were sites where by means of traps wild deer were killed or caught. Evidence that during Saxon times deer hunting was taking place in this fashion survives in a tract written by a 10th-century monk called Ælfric who wrote "''I weave myself nets and set them in a suitable place and urge on my dogs so that they chase the wild animals until they come into the nets unawares and are thus ensnared and I kill them in the nets.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Saxon documents 'Deer Parks' are recorded to as 'Derhage' or 'Deer-hay'. The Saxon word ''haga'' means a palisade or pale, an enclosure, hedge, or set of nets&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JZ7GlfI8UToC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=How+were+Deer+hayes+used?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=toP0x4LJYd&amp;sig=roOVjtpC5bi_C89-TdDVhvQxvOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTu5-miIjPAhVmLcAKHcPgDn8Q6AEIOTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=How%20were%20Deer%20hayes%20used%3F&amp;f=false Wharton's Pocket Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm#H Forests and Chases in England and Wales, c. 1000 to c. 1850. A Glossary of Terms and Definitions.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also regarded as the etymological root of the word hay. The term ''haga'' or hay effectively came to mean a deer park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''haga'', ''hage'', ''hege'', ''haia'', etc. all relate to the managing of deer.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doomsday Book]] records 31 parks with a few still held by Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; The 'deer-hays' of Anglo-Saxon times would have been more or less temporary structures although some may have developed into places where deer were kept until such a times as they were needed at which point they would be killed.&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

Imparkment developed from the 12th to the 14th centuries, reaching its peak in the early 1300s at which time around 3,200 parks in England covered up to 2% of the total land area representing about a quarter of the country’s woodland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'elerc' or 'erelc' in Gaelic originally meant 'ambush' and later meant a 'deer trap' described as a funnel-like defile, artificial or natural into which deer were herded so that they could be contained and then killed. The personal or place name '[[Elrick]]' is linked to such deer traps.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic name ''Tainchell'' was the term used for the group of beaters who took part.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic word 'eilid' means a hind and this association may explain why the word after linguistic evolution in Wigtownshire to 'eileirg' or ' eileirig' with the meaning of 'deer-trap' and the local place-names 'Eldrig', 'Elrig', 'Elrick', etc. derive from this source and some of the defiles used in the hunt can still be identified.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

The capture and movement of deer from the wild or from established deer hays or parks was necessary for establishing new ones and for restocking existing ones to replace animals lost via excessive hunting or disease and at times to introduce new breeding stock to maintain vigour in isolated and inbred populations. Deer might also be managed in terms of castrating stags and selectively culling diseased or elderly animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In feudal times the monarch would at times make gifts of live deer to those who were in the royal favour to replenish or establish herds, and a system of capturing deer therefore had to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coilsfield Deer Hay, Tarbolton - ditch system with parallel banks, South Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|thumb|250px|A section of the Parkmoor Deer Hay trenches at Coilsfield]]
To create a deer park the person had to own the land, purchase a license from the monarch and have sufficient funds to empark the area, constructing pales and ditches, deer leaps or salters, etc. Some parks even had towers from which the deer could be shot with bows and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thirty-seven parks or hays are listed in the Domesday Book, and of these nine belonged to the king, five by bishops or monastic houses and twenty three by Norman knights, etc. These hays or parks were isolated in the countryside by physical land divisions such as pales with ditches and served to protect the deer which were to be used for hunting and to help keep out predators whilst also preventing wild deer from eating crops in areas where farming was prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term 'fence month' was applied to the time during fawning and to the annual rut time in the autumn during which the deer were not disturbed and this restricted the period when deer hay winds and elricks could be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both wattle fencing and nets may have been employed in the 'wynding of the deer hay' and it was also important that the animals could be separated into small groups to reduce the chance of them goring each other by accident.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; A wide entrance that narrowed down on a gently rising slope would also slow their progress when pursued by hounds and places where people could hide,&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; possibly with hounds until required would be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The beaters would also separate the stags from the hinds if required.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Elricks or deer hay winds were a places in Scotland and England&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; where deer could be channelled and confined in a corral, a practice that ceased to be used in the 18th century although the practice had a brief resurgence in the days of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Stone lined pits and boulders once heated in fires have been found in association with elricks which may have been used to cook or render the venison from the newly slaughtered animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; A deer hunt of this type was recorded in the medieval romance ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

The native Red Deer ([[Cervus elaphus]]) and later introduced Fallow Deer ([[Dama dama]]) are suited for enclosure in deer parks however European Roe Deer ([[Capreolus capreolus]]) are not as they are aggressive towards other deer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt; Fallow Deer were introduced by the Normans from [[Sicily]], probably in the early twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Deer Hays and Elricks===
[[File:Windy Gill, Water of Fail, Tarbolton.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Windy Gill and the Water of Fail]]
Near Parkmill Farm on Parkmoor (NS 4425 2693), [[Tarbolton]] in [[South Ayrshire]] is a complex system of interlinking deep trenches running down to the Water of Fail that were given the name 'Roman Trenches'.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; The local historian John Smith circa 1895 examined them and also identified what he regarded as an ''Ancient British Stockade'' which had been taken following a siege by Roman troops during which the 'Roman Trenches' were built.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the trenches are still around 9 feet deep and are recorded to have once been much deeper.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; They lie within a few hundred metres from a medieval deer park's boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parkmoor Roman Trenches, Tarbolton.jpg|thumb|upright|The Parkmoor 'Roman trenches']]
In 1428 it is recorded that [[John Stewart of Darnley|John Stewart]] of [[Darnley]] near Glasgow held a deer park with a ditch, bank and pale in the Tarbolton area.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, page 215&lt;/ref&gt; Place names such as Parkmoor, Parkmill and Parkhill reflect the existence of a deer park in this area and a park with a building and pale is recorded on the 1654 map of Kyle by the cartographer Blaeu&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; taken from an earlier map by [[Timothy Pont]]. Herman Moll's map of 1732 shows at least four deer parks in the vicinity of Parkmoor at [[Fail Monastery|Fail Abbey]], Park Mill, at Coilsholm Wood and at Barskimming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.nls.uk/view/00000274 The South Part of the Shire of Air, containing Kyle and Carrick by H. Moll]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once known as 'Quillisfield' the estate was given to the monks of [[Melrose Abbey]] by [[John de Graham|Sir John de Graham]] of [[Dunduff Castle|Dunduff]], Lord of Tarbolton in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harpguitars.net/blog/2011/10/hgg9-scheduled-events/ 'Coilsfield' by Nathaniel Gow]&lt;/ref&gt; After the reformation Coilsfield Castle and Estate was acquired by the Cunninghames of Caprington, it was then sold to the Montgomerie family in 1661. In around 1847 the Coilsfield estate was sold to William Orr who had agreed to become the heir of the architect of the house, John Paterson, on the understanding that he would change his name to Paterson but and also buy the Coilsfield estate, renaming it Montgomerie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://landedfamilies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/189-arthur-of-carlung-house-barshaw.html Landed Families of Britain and Ireland.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The RCAHMS describes these features on the old Coilsfield Estate as an "''irregular series of artificially-cut ditches run roughly parallel in a SE-NW direction down a gently W-facing and wooded slope at c70m OD. They are closely spaced, mostly V-shaped, and range from 0.5m to 2.0m in depth with little evidence of upcast banking. Some conjoin to form wider channels which fade at the steeper slopes above the water of Fail.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/42710/parkmill RCAHMS Parkmoor 'Roman Trenches']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nuthill Estate, 'Old Fortifications'.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The 'Old Fortifications' at Nuthill.]]
Taylor has associated the local place names of Wyndford and Windy Gill at Parkmoor with an early 16th-century reference to the ''winding of the hay yard'' to catch deer at the Nuthill Estate in Fife and has suggested that this made reference to the construction of wattle fencing and nets along the line of the trench banks in preparation for catching deer and that the system of trenches may have been known as a 'wynd'.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scots language]] the word 'Wynd' has been used since at least the 13th century to describe frequently winding, narrow streets or alleys which aptly describes the appearance of known deer hay winds and elricks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/wynd_n_2 Scots Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and wynding would be the creation of narrow alleys or entrances.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; At Parkmoor the deer would naturally enter the Windy Gill to drink&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; and could then be driven by men and hounds towards the deer hay wind. The area that was supposed by John Smith to be an ''Ancient British Stockade'' and the area later used as a bowling green may have been involved in the processing of the deer by comparison with the use of elricks.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the Nuthill Estate in Fife (NO234079) are a system of trenches surveyed by Thomas Winter in 1757 and recorded as 'The Trenches are Old Fortifications' or 'Roman Trenches'. This complex system of trenches and banks are located near the old royal hunting park of Falkland.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is considered to have been used to capture deer from the Lomond Hills by corralling them and then taking suitable hinds and stags to the nearby royal hunting park.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The Falkland Treasurers Accounts of 1505 refer to a payment of 14 shillings to "''John Balfour for ranging through the countryside with bloodhounds to drive the deer to the park''" and for the "''winding of the hay yard to catch them''".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Fields or enclosures called ‘Deerends’ are recorded just to the west of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onomastics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Falkland-to-Strathmiglo-13-Sept-2014-leaflet.pdf Living Lomonds Landscape Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Glen of the Bar - geograph.org.uk - 1465166.jpg|thumb|200px|The Glen of the Bar elrick]]
At Nuthill at least seven trenches can still be discerned with a present-day depth of up to 2 metres and a length of 150 to 200 metres. Some are cut through the bedrock and they curve towards each other towards the west at the bottom of a slope that joins a water course. The glen or gill then acts as a natural channel that runs towards the old Falkland Deer Park and the Lomond Hills lie above.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; A number of place names suggest the past use of the site such as 'Deerends', 'Greyhound Den' and 'Burn of Deer'.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; 

Indications of similar systems of trenches exist at [[Chillingham Castle|Chillingham Park]] in [[Northumberland]] and [[Erringden]] Park in Yorkshire, additionally "''Montrose's Camp''" near [[Fyvie Castle]] has features in common with deer hay winds famously militarily utilised by [[Fyvie Castle|Montrose]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kington, Worcestershire|Kington]] in Worcestershire is recorded to have had a deer hay.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; 

The as yet unidentified system of trenches and banks at the High Parks in the Cadzow Wood area (NS 7343 5347) of [[Chatelherault Country Park]] have a number of characteristics in common with deer hay winds and are located in an area closely associated with the hunting of deer by royalty and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/45727/cadzow Cadzow - Canmore entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some deer hay winds may have consisted of banks and ditches several kilometres long that were used to direct deer for the purpose of capture&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; such as with the so-called "''Deil's Dyke''" near [[New Cumnock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bob_newcumnock/deilsdyke_B/ History of the Parish of New Cumnock]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elricks have been identified at [[Dalkeith]] and others may have existed at the Glen of the Bar in Galloway, on the [[Isle of Rum]] and on the [[Isle of Jura]] where in one case stone walls may have channelled the deer into a corral.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual 'deer trap' may have been the function of a structure with foot high walls at Wet Sleddle Slack near [[Shap]] in [[Cumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

A relevant quote here is that "''Deer hunting has left physical traces on the landscape in the form of banks and dykes used either as park boundaries or for trapping the deer''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bob_newcumnock/deilsdyke_B/ History of the Parish of New Cumnock]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Micro-history==
The fourteenth century treatise ''The Book of Hunting'' illustrates a scene ''The Gathering before the Stag Hunt'' which clearly portrays wattle fencing of the kind used in a deer hay wind.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; 

The town of [[Hayes and Harlington Urban District|Hayes]] in West Middlesex derives its name from the presence of a deer hay in the area.

The village of [[Elrick]] near Aberdeen is named after an elrick and the surname 'Elrick' is common in the area.

In 1559 seven acres of land near Tarbolton named Longhuntflat was leased by John Stewart and his wife Helen Cunninghame of Halrig.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3527">The '''flags of the [[States of Austria|Austrian states]]''' show two (or three) stripes in the main colours of the respective [[Heraldry|arms]]. These flags are the state flags and are shown with the [[coats of arms]], although it is common for them to be shown without it. Without the coats of arms, some flags are very similar, such as those of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Upper Austria]] (also nearly identical to the [[flag of Poland]]). Frequently, the flags are used in vertical variants with or without coat of arms. As well, the coats of arms of the Austrian States are shown.

'''GPS navigation software''' usually falls into one of the following two categories:
# [[Navigation]] with route [[calculation]] and directions from the [[software]] to the user of the route to take, based on a [[Euclidean vector|vector]]-based [[map]], normally for motorised [[vehicles]] with some motorised forms added on as an afterthought.
# Navigation tracking, often with a map "picture" in the background, but showing where you have been, and allowing "routes" to be preprogrammed, giving a line you can follow on the screen. This type can also be used for [[geocaching]].

== Terminology ==

=== Track ===
A track is a trace of somewhere that you have actually been (often called a "breadcrumb trail").  The [[GPS]] unit (external or internal) periodically sends details of the location which are recorded by the software, either by taking a reading based on a set time interval, based on a set distance, based on a change in direction by more than a certain angle, or a combination of these. Each point is stored together with its date and time. The resulting track can be displayed as a series of the recorded points or a line connecting them.

Retracing your steps is a simple matter of following the track back to the source.

=== Route ===
A route is a preset series of points that make up a set route to follow for your destination. Most software allows the route and the track to be displayed at the same time.

=== Waypoint ===
Waypoints are used to mark particular locations, typically used as markers along the "way" to somewhere. They are either key entered by users or downloaded from other sources, depending upon the sophistication of the device. Although not linked to tracks or routes, they can be used to simplify the construction of routes, by being able to be re-used. Frequently, waypoints serve a "safety" purpose, enabling a route to be taken around obstacles such as shallow water (marine navigation) or streams/cliffs/other hazards which may prevent a safe passage directly from point "A" to point "B".

==Platforms ==
{{see also|GPS navigation device}}
Software can be used on a [[laptop computer]] with an attached [[GPS]] receiver. Most commercial software runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]].
Some software like [[Waze]] and [[Google Maps]] can also be used on mobile phone [[operating systems]].

==Software products{{anchor|Software}}==
There are several navigation software products available. The primary distinction is whether it is designed for use on land or water.

=== Land-based navigation software ===

;Commercial navigation software with embedded maps:
* [[DeLorme]] Street Atlas USA and Topo USA
* [[Destinator]]
* [[HERE_(app)|HERE]]
* [[Microsoft Streets and Trips]] 2009
* [[Rand McNally]]
* [[Navigon]]
* [[Navman]]
* [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]]
* [[IGO (software)|iGO]]
* [[Route 66 (company)|ROUTE 66]]
* [[TomTom#TomTom Navigator|TomTom Navigator]]
* [[TomTom#TomTom Navigator|TomTom Mobile]]
* [[TeleType Co.|TeleType WorldNavigator]]
* [[Waze]] 


;Commercial navigation software with scanned or downloaded maps and orthophotos stored in the computer (independent, stand alone system):
* [[OziExplorer]]
* [[GPSS]]

;Free open source navigation software (independent stand alone system):
* [[OsmAnd]] (Android) [[Open-source software|open source]], and [[Free software|free]] (in the [[F-Droid]] repository)
* [[MoNav]] (Cross-platform) [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[Free software|free]]
* [[Navit]] (Cross-platform) [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[Free software|free]]

;Navigation software with maps downloaded from a remote server:
* [[Google Earth]] (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* [[Google Maps]] (platform independent)
* [[Navit]] (Cross-platform) [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[Free software|free]]

=== Marine navigation software ===
Navigation software for use on the water has many features in common with land-based GPS navigation software. It can use [[Position (vector)|electronic navigation chart]] or raster charts, usually provides user ability to plan routes and set waypoints, and may have live [[GPS tracking]] capabilities. In addition, marine navigation software often has option to control external [[autopilot]] for automated boat navigation. It may incorporate [[GRIB]] weather overlay on the chart, [[Tide]] predictions and other related information services of additional use to mariners.


;Free open source marine navigation software:
* [[OpenCPN]] (Cross-platform) [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[Free software|free]]

=== Aeronautical navigation software ===
This kind of software usually creates a modern [[glass cockpit]] and uses more than just a single GPS sensor to assist the navigation. Such sensors are [[Attitude and Heading Reference Systems]] (AHRS) and [[Inertial Measurement Unit]] (IMU) sensors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="827">The '''geology of [[Dominica]]''' is part of the broader [[Lesser Antilles]] volcanic island arc, considered a modern example of island arcs that often accreted to continues as exotic terranes. Dominica is located in the center of the chain, with Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique to the south. [[Pleistocene]] sediments overlie almost the entire island except for an area of [[Pliocene]] exposures in the east.

The '''geology of Togo''' is largely of [[gneiss]]es and [[granite|granitic]] rocks of [[Proterozoic]] age in the central and southern part of the country. These are overlain in the coastal zone by [[Cretaceous]] and [[Cenozoic]] sediments. The northern part of the country has a [[Basement rock|basement]] of [[Neoproterozoic]] [[metamorphic rock]]s and [[Paleoproterozoic]] granite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisourcebook.org/1254_Togo.html|title=Togo Geology, The Extractive Industries Source Book|website=Extractive Industries|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The south of the country is covered in sedimentary basins, covering 3,300 km.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of land. The [[West African Craton]] is made up of crystalline structures, ranging in age from the Neoarchean to the Paleoproterozoic age. The North-Dapaong zone, which is located in the West African Craton, [[migmatite]]s, [[gneiss]]es, [[amphibolite]]s, [[granodiorite]]s and [[granite]]s are commonly found. The [[Neoproterozoic]] [[Volta Basin]] contains sedimentary formations on the [[Birrimian]] bedrocks. These sedimentary formations are divided into two groups: an intra-tillite group and a supra-tillite group.&lt;ref name="geoatlas" /&gt;

== Economic geology ==
Togo mines gold, diamonds, and phosphate rock, with the largest of these being phosphate rock. The phosphate rock is found Eocene deposits at the coastal basin. In addition to those easy to exploit locations, there are also hardened Neoproterozoic which have not been exploited. The country is Africa's sixth highest producer of phosphate rock. Diamonds and gold are extracted on the artisanal level, and is Africa's sixth largest gold producer. The diamonds are found in alluvial formations in rivers. Exploration activities unveiled the possibility of mining in the future: bauxite, gypsum, iron ore, manganese, marble, rutile, zinc, uranium, and lithic metals. Togo does not have a petroleum sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisourcebook.org/1554_ExtractiveIndustries.html|title=Extractive Industries Mining|website=Extractive Industries|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geoatlas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlüter|first=Thomas|title=Geological Atlas of Africa: With Notes on Stratigraphy, Tectonics, Economic Geology, Geohazards, Geosites and Geoscientific Education of Each Country|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|url={{Google books|IfvKWpsISTQC|page=232|plainurl=yes}}|access-date=October 25, 2016|date=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232}}

'''Groundcover''' or '''ground cover''' is any [[plant]] that grows over an area of ground. Groundcover provides [[soil protection|protection]] of the [[topsoil]] from [[erosion]] and [[drought]].

In an [[ecosystem]], the ground cover forms the layer of vegetation below the [[shrub layer]] known as the [[herbaceous layer]]. The most widespread ground covers are [[Poaceae|grasses]] of various types.

In [[ecology]], groundcover is a difficult subject to address because it is known by several different names and is classified in several different ways. The term groundcover could also be referring to “the herbaceous layer,” “regenerative layer", “ground flora” or even "step over."

In [[agriculture]], ground cover refers to anything that lies on top of the soil and protects it from erosion and inhibits weeds.  It can be anything from a low layer of [[grass]]es to a plastic material. The term ''ground cover'' can also specifically refer to [[landscaping fabric]] which is like a breathable tarp that allows water and gas exchange.

In [[gardening]] jargon, however, the term ''groundcover'' refers to plants that are used in place of [[weed]]s and improves appearance by concealing bare earth.

== Contributions to the environment ==
The herbaceous layer is often overlooked in most ecological analyses because it is so common and contributes the smallest amount of the environment’s overall [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. However, groundcover is crucial to the survival of many environments. The groundcover layer of a forest can contribute up to 90% of the ecosystem’s plant diversity. Additionally, the herbaceous layer ratio of biomass to contribution to plant productivity is disproportionate in many ecosystems. The herbaceous layer can constitute up to 4% of the overall [[Primary production|net primary productivity]] (NPP) of an ecosystem, four times its average biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://science.marshall.edu/gilliam/Chapter%2014.pdf|title=The Herbaceous Layer in Forests of North America|last=Gilliam|first=Frank|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|location=USA|chapter=The Dynamic Nature of the Herbaceous Layer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Groundcover typically reproduces one of five ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/426/426-609/426-609_pdf.pdf|title=Selecting Landscape Plants: Groundcovers|last=Niemiera|first=Alex|date=2012|website=Virginia State University|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lateral growth 
* Side growth: Branches on the side of the plant extend outwards upon contact with the soil.
* Base growth: New plants produced from the base of the origin plant.
* Under/Above Ground growth: Produced from [[rhizome]]s and [[stolon]]s
* Roots
Like most foliage, groundcover reacts to both natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances. These responses can be classified as legacy or active responses. Legacy responses occur during long-term changes to an environment, such as the conversion of a forest to agricultural land and back into forest. Active responses occur with sudden disturbances to the environment, such as tornadoes and forest fires.

Groundcover has also been known to influence the placement and growth of tree seedlings. All tree seedlings must first fall from their origin trees and then permeate the layer created by groundcover in order to reach the soil and germinate. The groundcover filters out a large amount seeds, but lets a smaller portion of seeds pass through and grow. This filtration provides ample amount of space between the seeds for future growth. In some areas, the groundcover can become so dense that no seeds can permeate the surface, and the forest is instead converted to shrubbery. Groundcover also inhibits the amount of light which reaches the floor of an ecosystem. An experiment conducted with the ''[[rhododendron maximum]]'' canopy in the southern [[Appalachian region]] concluded that 4 to 8% of total sunlight makes it to the herbaceous layer, whereas only about 1 to 2% reaches the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Herbaceous Layer in Forests of Eastern North America|last=Gilliam|first=Frank|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|location=USA|chapter=The Herbaceous Layer as a Filter Determining Spatial Pattern in Forest Tree Regeneration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation===
Two common variations of groundcover are residency and transient species. Residency species typically reach a maximum of 1.5 meters in height, and are therefore permanently classified as herbaceous. Transient species are capable of growing past 1.5 meters, and are therefore only temporarily considered herbaceous. These height differences make ideal environments for a variety of animals, such as the [[reed warbler]], the [[Micromys minutus|harvest mouse]] and the [[wren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverwildlife.com/british-wildlife/how-identify-bird-and-mammal-nests|title=How to identify bird and mammal nests|last=Harris|first=Steve|date=2010-06-09|website=Discover Wildlife|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundcover can also be classified in terms of its foliage. Groundcover that keeps its foliage for the entire year is known as [[evergreen]], whereas groundcover that loses its foliage in the winter months is known as [[deciduous]].

== In gardening ==
[[File:Microstegium vimineum.JPG|thumbnail|''[[Microstegium vimineum]]'', an invasive groundcover]]
Five general types of plants are commonly used as groundcovers in [[gardening]]:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pinterest.com/explore/ground-covering-plants/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegardenhelper.com/shadecovers.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finegardening.com/covering-ground-creeping-plants&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vine]]s, which are [[woody plant]]s with slender, spreading stems
* [[Herbaceous]] plants, or non-woody plants
* [[Shrub]]s of low-growing, spreading species
* [[Moss]] of larger, coarser species
* [[Ornamental grass]]es, especially low-growing varieties

Of these types, some of the most common groundcovers include:

* [[Alfalfa]] (''Medicago sativa'')
* [[Clover]] (''Trifolium'')
* [[Dichondra]]
* [[Bacopa]] (''Bacopa'')
* [[Hedera|Ivy]] (''Hedera'')
* [[Gazania]] (''Gazania rigens'')
* [[Ground-elder]] (''Aegopodium podagraria'')
* [[Aizoaceae|Ice plant]]
* [[Japanese honeysuckle]] (''Lonicera japonica'')
* [[Juniper]]s of various low-growing types
* [[Lantana]], creeping species
* [[Liriope (plant)|Lilyturf]] (''[[Liriope muscari]]'' and ''[[Liriope spicata]]'')
* [[Mentha|Mint]] (''Mentha'')
* [[Tropaeolum majus|Nasturtium]] (''Tropaeolum majus'')
* [[Pachysandra]]
* [[Sagina|Pearlwort]] (''Sagina subulata'')
* [[Vinca|Periwinkle]] (''Vinca'')
* [[Leucanthemum × superbum|Shasta daisy]] (''Leucanthemum'')
* [[Soleirolia soleirolii|Soleirolia]] (''Soleirolia soleirolii'')
* [[Chlorophytum comosum|Spider plant]] (''Chlorophytum comosum'')

=== In roof gardens ===
Groundcover is a popular solution for difficult gardening issues because it is low maintenance, aesthetically pleasing and fast growing, minimizing the spread of weeds. For this reason, ground cover is also a common choice for roof gardens. Roofs take on the brunt of incoming weather, meaning any plants on a roof must be resistant to long-term exposure to sun, overwatering from rain and harsh winds. Groundcover plants are able to sustain themselves in such conditions while also providing lush vegetation to what would otherwise be unused space.

Gmelin was born in [[Tübingen]], the son of a [[professor]] at the [[University of Tübingen]].&lt;ref name="Egerton (2008)"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Egerton | first = Frank N. | title = A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 27: Naturalists Explore Russia and the North Pacific During the 1700s | journal = Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–60 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1890/0012-9623(2008)89[39:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a gifted child and began attending university lectures at the age of 14. In 1727, he graduated with a [[medicine|medical]] degree at the age of 18. He then travelled to [[St Petersburg]] and obtained a fellowship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in 1728. He lectured at the [[Saint Petersburg State University#History|university]] from 1730, and in the following year was appointed professor of [[chemistry]] and [[natural history]].&lt;ref name="Egerton (2008)"/&gt;

At his suggestion, [[Johann Amman]] left [[Hans Sloane]] in London to take up a post in St Petersburg. The final two volumes of [[Johann Christian Buxbaum]]'s (1693–1730) ''Centuria'' were published posthumously by Gmelin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polybiblio.com/marta/3105.html AMMAN, Johannes, Stirpium rariorum in Imperio Rutheno sponte provenientium icones et descriptiones&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084611/http://www.polybiblio.com/marta/3105.html |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Second Kamchatka Expedition ==
Gmelin was elected one out of three professors to join [[Vitus Bering]]’s [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]] (1733–43). During the early part of the expedition - leaving [[St Petersburg]] in August 1733 - he was accompanied by the young student [[Stepan Krasheninnikov]]. They travelled together through the [[Ural mountains|Urals]] and western [[Siberia]] to [[Yeniseysk]]. He described the position of the [[Yenisey]] river as a boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] and participated in measuring the lowest [[temperature]] ever recorded at [[Yeniseysk]]. He was also the first person to measure the fact that the level of the [[Caspian Sea]] was below that of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. He eventually reached [[Vitus Bering|Bering]]’s headquarters at [[Yakutsk]] in September 1736. Unfortunately, Gmelin's residence burned on November 8, destroying all his [[natural history]] collections and notes plus part of his library. The subsequent summer, he made as many re-collections of specimens as possible to replace the loss. His ''Flora Sibirica'' (1747–1769)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Gmelin | first= J. G. |author2=S.

It contains descriptions of 1178 species, 294 of which he illustrated. His nephew [[Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin]] assisted him in editing the final two volumes. A fifth volume of ''Flora Sibirica'', mainly on [[cryptogam]]s, was written by [[Stepan Krasheninnikov]], but was never printed. Gmelin also described the journey in his ''Reise durch Sibirien von dem Jahr 1733 bis 1743'' (1751–1752).&lt;ref name="reise"&gt;{{cite book | last= Gmelin | first= J.

== Later life ==
Gmelin returned to the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1747 and became [[professor]] of [[medicine]] and, in 1751, director of the [[Botanischer Garten der Universität Tübingen|university's botanic garden]]. His travel description&lt;ref name="reise"/&gt; was published there. It was translated to [[French language|French]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but not to [[Russian language|Russian]], ''"because it contained uncomplimentary observations and comments on Russians"''.&lt;ref name="Egerton (2008)"/&gt;

Gmelin was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1749.

The plant [[genus]] [[Gmelina]] ([[Lamiaceae]]) and several dozen plant and animal species are named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipni.org/ipni/advPlantNameSearch.do?find_family=&amp;find_genus=&amp;find_species=gmelin*&amp;find_infrafamily=&amp;find_infragenus=&amp;find_infraspecies=&amp;find_authorAbbrev=&amp;find_includePublicationAuthors=on&amp;find_includePublicationAuthors=off&amp;find_includeBasionymAuthors=on&amp;find_includeBasionymAuthors=off&amp;find_publicationTitle=&amp;find_isAPNIRecord=on&amp;find_isAPNIRecord=false&amp;find_isGCIRecord=on&amp;find_isGCIRecord=false&amp;find_isIKRecord=on&amp;find_isIKRecord=false&amp;find_rankToReturn=all&amp;output_format=normal&amp;find_sortByFamily=on&amp;find_sortByFamily=off&amp;query_type=by_query&amp;back_page=plantsearch IPNI query]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karakorum''' ([[Khalkha Mongolian]]: Хархорум ''Kharkhorum'') was the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] between 1235 and 1260, and of the [[Northern Yuan dynasty|Northern Yuan]] in the 14–15th centuries. Its ruins lie in the northwestern corner of the [[Övörkhangai Province]] of [[Mongolia]], near today's town of [[Kharkhorin]], and adjacent to the [[Erdene Zuu monastery]]. They are part of the upper part of the [[World Heritage site]] [[Orkhon Valley]].

==History==

=== Foundation ===
The Orkhon valley was a centre of the [[Xiongnu]], [[Göktürks|Göktürk]] and [[Uyghur Empire|Uyghur]] empires. To the Göktürks, the nearby [[Khangai Mountains]] had been the location of the [[Ötüken]], and the Uighur capital [[Karabalgasun]] was located close to where later Karakorum would be erected (downstream the Orkhon River 27&amp;nbsp;km north–west from Karakorum). This area is probably also one of the oldest farming areas in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Micheal Walther, Ein idealer Ort für ein festes Lager. Zur Geographie des Orchontals und der Umgebung von Charchorin (Karakorum), in: ''Dschingis Khan und seine Erben'', p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1218–19, [[Genghis Khan]] rallied his troops for the campaign against the [[Khwarezm Empire]] in a place called Karakorum,&lt;ref&gt;Micheal Weiers, ''Geschichte der Mongolen'', Stuttgart 2004, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; but the actual foundation of a city is usually said to have occurred only in 1220. Until 1235, Karakorum seems to have been little more than a [[yurt]] town; only then, after the defeat of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] empire, did Genghis' successor [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]] erect walls around the place and build a fixed palace.&lt;ref name="Huettel"&gt;Hans–Georg Hüttel, Karakorum - Eine historische Skizze, in: ''Dschingis Khan und seine Erben'', p. 133–137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ögedei Khan]] gave the decree to build the ''Tumen Amgalan Ord'' (Palace of Myriad Peace, Wan'an'gong in Chinese) in 1235 the year after he defeated the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Dynasty]]. It was finished in one year. In the [[History of Yuan|Yuanshi]] (元史) it is written in the section for Taizong (太宗) Ögedei Khan: "In the seventh year (1236), in the year of the blue sheep the Wanangong (萬安宫) was established in Helin (和林, Karakorum)." One of Genghis Khan's nine ministers the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Yelü Chucai]] (1190–1244) said the following poem during the ridge raising ceremony of the Tumen Amgalan Ord: "Installed ridge well fit and stone foundation, The parallel placed majestic palace has been raised, When the bells and drums of the Lord and officials sound pleasantly, The setting sun calls the horses of war to itself from the mountain peaks." The Mongolian version of the poem is as follows: "''Tsogtslon tavih nuruu chuluun tulguur, Zeregtsen zogsoh surleg asriig bosgovoi, Ezen tushmediin honh hengereg ayataihan hanginan duursahad, Echih naran uuliin tolgoigoos dainii agtadiig ugtnam''.&lt;ref&gt;Jagar, Bayar, Baatar, Och, Urtogtokh, Wang, Bayartogtokh, J.Saintsogt, Mongol nuudel soyoliin tuuhen murdul (Historical investigation of Mongolian nomadic culture), Uvur Mongoliin surgan humuujliin hevleliin horoo (Educational Printing Committee of Inner Mongolia), Hohhot, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sh.|last=Baatar|url=http://www.hicheel.mn/index.php?module=menu&amp;cmd=content&amp;id=3005&amp;menu_id=437|script-title=mn:Хархорум хотын 'Түмэн амгалан' ордны тухай тодруулга|trans-title=Clarification of the 'Tumen Peace' palace in Karakorum|language=mn|publisher=hicheel.mn|accessdate=30 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330113847/http://www.hicheel.mn/index.php?module=menu&amp;cmd=content&amp;id=3005&amp;menu_id=437|archivedate=30 March 2014|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Karakorum or "Kharkhorin" literally translates to 'black-twenty'. But scientists argue that the 'khorin' might have been a diversion of the word 'khurem', which means "castle" in Mongolian. Other translations vary.&lt;ref&gt;http://tashuur.mn/?p=631{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prosperity ===
Under Ögedei and his successors, Karakorum became a major site for world politics. [[Möngke Khan]] had the palace enlarged, and the great [[stupa]] temple completed.&lt;ref name="Huettel"/&gt; They had the Parisian goldsmith, Guillaume Bouchier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Abigail|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/genghis-khans-treasures-118867438/|title=Genghis Khan's Treasures|publisher=Smithsonian.com|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waugh|first=Daniel C.|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/paxmongolica.shtml|title=The Pax Mongolica|publisher=Silk-road.com|year=2000|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; design the Silver Tree of Karakorum for the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;''Mongolia, Land of Inspiration''. Irmuun Press, 2008, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; A large tree sculpted of silver and other precious metals rose up from the middle of the courtyard and loomed over the palace, with the branches of the tree extended into the building. Silver fruit hung from the limbs and it had four golden serpents braided around the trunk, while within the top of the tree was placed a trumpet angel, all as [[Automaton|automata]] performing for the emperor's pleasure. When the khan wanted to summon the drinks for his guests, the mechanical angel raised the trumpet to his lips and sounded the horn, whereupon the mouths of the serpents began to gush out a fountain of alcoholic beverages into the large silver basin arranged at the base of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;"Genghis Khan and the making of the Modern World " Jack Weatherford, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== William of Rubruck ====
[[William of Rubruck]], a [[Flanders (county)|Flemish]] [[Franciscan]] missionary and [[pope|papal]] envoy to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] reached Karakorum in 1254. He has left one of the most detailed, though not always flattering, accounts of the city. He compared it rather unfavourably to the village of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] near Paris, and was of the opinion that the [[Basilica of St Denis|royal abbey there]] was ten times as important as the Khan's palace. On the other hand, he also described the town as a very cosmopolitan and religiously tolerant place, and the silver tree he described as part of Möngke Khan's palace as having become the symbol of Karakorum.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Hüttel, Der Silberbaum im Palast des Ögedei Khan, in: ''Dschingis Khan und seine Erben'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He described the walled city as having four gates facing the four directions, two quarters of fixed houses, one for the "[[Saracen]]es" and one for the "[[Cathay|Cathai]]", twelve pagan temples, two [[mosque]]s, as well as a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] church.&lt;ref name="Huettel"/&gt;

===Later times===
{{See also|Mongolia under Yuan rule}}
When [[Kublai Khan]] claimed the throne of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1260—as did his younger brother, [[Ariq Böke]]—he relocated his capital to [[Shangdu]], and later to [[Khanbaliq]] (Dadu, today's [[Beijing]]). Karakorum was reduced to the administrative centre of a provincial backwater of the [[Yuan dynasty]] founded in [[China]] in 1271. Further to that, the ensuing [[Toluid Civil War]] with Ariq Böke and a [[Kaidu–Kublai war|later war]] with [[Kaidu]] hit the town hard. In 1260, Kublai disrupted the town's grain supply, while in 1277 Kaidu took Karakorum, only to be ousted by Yuan troops and [[Bayan of the Baarin]] in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Trauzettel, Die Yüan-Dynastie, in: Michael Weiers (editor), ''Die Mongolen, Beiträge zu ihrer Geschichte und Kultur'', Darmstadt 1986, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; In 1298–99 prince [[Ulus Buqa]] looted the markets and the grain storehouses. However, the first half of the 14th century proved to be a second time of prosperity: in 1299, the town had been expanded eastwards, then in 1311, and again from 1342 to 1346, the stupa temples were renewed.&lt;ref name="Huettel"/&gt;

===Decline===
[[File:Stara stupa Nirwany w Karakorum.jpg|thumb|Old, damaged stupa of Nirvana]]
After the collapse of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1368, Karakorum became the residence of [[Biligtü Khan]] in 1370. In 1388, [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] troops occupied and later razed the capital. According to [[Saghang Sechen]]'s ''[[Erdeni-yin Tobči]]'', in 1415 a [[khuriltai]] decided to rebuild it, but no archaeological evidence for such a venture has been found yet. However, Karakorum was inhabited at the beginning of the 16th century, when [[Batu-Möngke Dayan Khan]] made it a capital once again. In the following years, the town changed hands between [[Oirad]]s and [[Chinggisids]] several times, and {{clarify|text=was consequently given up permanently.|reason=Given up to whom? Was it abandoned, or did subsequent states not consider it important enough to fight over?|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="Huettel"/&gt;

== Excavations ==
[[File:Karakorum Modell 1.jpg|thumb|The model of the city Karakorum in the National Museum of Mongolian History in Ulaan-Baatar]] 
[[File:Karakorum Modell 2.jpg|thumb|Model of the Khan Palace called ''Tumen Amgalan Ord'', Wanangong (萬安宫) in Chinese]] 
[[Erdene Zuu monastery]] stands near Karakorum. Various construction materials were taken from the ruin to build this monastery.
The actual location of Karakorum was long unclear. First hints that Karakorum was located at Erdene Zuu were already known in the 18th century, but until the 20th century there was a dispute whether or not the ruins of [[Karabalgasun]], or ''Ordu-Baliq'', were in fact those of Karakorum. In 1889, the site was conclusively identified as the former Mongol capital by [[Nikolai Yadrintsev]], who discovered examples of the [[Orkhon script]] during the same expedition. Yadrintsev's conclusions were confirmed by [[Wilhelm Radloff]].
[[File:Beiyue Temple 8.jpg|thumb|[[Beiyue Temple|Dening Hall]] of the [[Beiyue Temple]] built in 1270 during the Yuan Dynasty closely resembles the lost palace architecture of Dadu (Beijing) and Karakorum.]]
The first excavations took place in 1933–34 under [[Dmitry Bukinich|D. Bukinich]]. After his Soviet-Mongolian excavations of 1948–49, [[Sergei Vladimirovich Kiselyov|Sergei Kiselyov]] concluded that he had found the remains of Ögödei's palace. However, this conclusion has been put into doubt by the findings of the 2000–2004 German-Mongolian excavations, which seem to identify them as belonging to the great stupa temple rather than to Ögödei's palace.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Hüttel, Der Palast des Ögedei Khan - Die Ausgrabungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts im Palastbezirk von Karakorum, in: ''Dschingis Khan und seine Erben'', p. 140–146&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavation findings include paved roads, some [[brick]] and many [[adobe]] buildings, floor heating systems, [[Kang bed-stove|bed-stoves]], evidence for the processing of copper, gold, silver, iron (including iron wheel [[Wheel#Hub|naves]]), glass, jewels, bones, and [[birch bark]], as well as ceramics and coins from China and Central Asia. Four [[kiln]]s have also been unearthed.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Franken, Die Brennöfen im Palastbezirk von Karakorum, in: ''Dschingis Khan und seine Erben'', p. 147–149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulambayar Erdenebat, Ernst Pohl, Aus der Mitte der Hauptstadt - Die Ausgrabungen der Universität Bonn im Zentrum von Karakorum, in: ''Dschingis Khan und seine Erben'', p. 168–175&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern times ==
[[File:Kharkorum silver tree1.jpg|thumb|The Silver Tree Fountain of Karakorum (modern reconstruction)]]
In 2004, Prime Minister [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]] appointed a working group of professionals to develop a project to build a new city at the site of the ancient capital Karakorum. According to him, the new Karakorum was to be designed to be an exemplary city, with a vision of its becoming the capital of Mongolia. After his resignation and the appointment of [[Miyeegombyn Enkhbold]] as prime minister, the project was abandoned.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

'''Kumbakkarai Falls''' are lesser known falls in the foothills of the [[Kodaikanal|Kodaikanal Hills]].  They are located at {{coord|10|10|48|N|77|31|50|E}} in [[Theni district]], {{convert|9|km|mi|sp=us}} from [[Periyakulam]]. Kumbakkarai Falls are located along the [[Kodaikanal-Munnar Road#Intersections|Kodai-Vellagavi-Periyakulam footpath]].

These falls have two stages. At the first stage, water collects in huge rock recesses which are each named after wild animals such as tiger, elephant, snake etc. The Pambar river then flows {{convert|.5|km|abbr=on}} to the second stage before falling as the main waterfall.&lt;ref name="Kumba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovertamilnadu.net/tamilnadu%20dams%20and%20waterfalls.html|title=Kumbakkarai Falls|work=Tamilnadu Waterfalls &amp; Dams|publisher=Discover Tamil Nadu|accessdate=2009-10-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923185629/http://www.discovertamilnadu.net/tamilnadu%20dams%20and%20waterfalls.html|archivedate=2009-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water originates in Kodaikanal Hills and flows along the rocks and finally reaches the foot hills. This place is called Kumbakarai. The travellers come here and take bath in the falls. The water flows throughout the year; but in rainy seasons the flow will be very heavy. Bathing is possible. There is a bus from Periyakulam with fare of Rs. 5 (6AM,7AM,1PM,3.30PM,4.30PM).  There is no guest house.&lt;ref name="theni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenionline.org/theni_falls.php|title=KUMBAKKARAI FALLS|work=THENI FALLS|publisher=Theni Online|accessdate=2009-10-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213212643/http://www.thenionline.org/theni_falls.php|archivedate=2009-12-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kumbakarai Murugan.JPG|thumb|alt=The Murugan Statue in Kumbakarai Falls|The Murugan Statue in Kumbakarai Falls]]

The present day Kumbakarai which is tourist spot  was once nothing but a forest with water falls . Thiru K.Chellam Iyer an affluent business man of Periyakulam those days and Properiter of Bavani Krishna Vilas hotel wanted  kumbakarai water falls to be one another tourist spot similar to courtallam. He obtained permission of the British government in 1942 and  constructed dressing rooms, staircases and bathing spots in that area at his own expense  and  Kumbakarai  water falls soon turned out to be a tourist spot. The present day  Kumbakarai still speak of his name. The stone inscription at Kumbakarai waterfalls speaks about his contribution to the falls. The Murugan statue that can be seen in the Photo was Sponsored by Thiru K Chellam Iyer of Periyakulam.

This is a list in both [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Friulian language]] of [[Toponym|place names]] in the historical area of [[Friuli]], [[Italy]], with the official spelling standard published by ARLeF - Regional Agency for the Friulian Language in 2009.  [[Grave accent]]s ( ` ) on the Friulian forms are to show syllable stress but are rarely written except when placed on the ultimate syllable.  Italics are used for the names of municipalities that are not included within the area subject to protection of the Friulian language minority. These names are divided according to the modern Italian [[Provinces of Italy|province]] in which they lie.  From the historical point of view, both the Italian and Friulian forms are found in medieval documents. In some cases, though, Italian names were created by the [[Italian fascism|fascist]] regime to Italianise the region.

== Municipalities in the province of Belluno ==
One ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) in the [[Province of Belluno]], [[Sappada]], was historically part of Friuli.

This is a '''list of [[national parks]] in Africa'''.  The nature of the parks varies considerably not only between countries but also within some nations – the degree of protection, accessibility and type of environment for which it is intended to deliver protection.  Some parks have been cleared of their original human population, others have always been essentially uninhabited, while yet others contain significant population centres.

National parks can be found in a large majority of African countries, being most numerous in [[Gabon]], [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]].  Some nations also have considerable areas designated as private parks, [[game reserve]]s, [[forest reserve]]s, [[marine reserve]]s, [[national reserve]]s and [[nature park|natural park]]s.  These are not included in the list below, even though some of these may resemble some national parks.  For more information on such zones, see the individual articles on each country.

{{History of Burma}}
[[Image:Burma indo china 1886.jpg|thumb|left|Lower Burma in pink, as opposed to [[Upper Burma]] in orange.]]

'''Lower Burma''' ({{lang-my|အောက်မြန်မာပြည်}}, also called '''Outer Myanmar''') is a geographic region of [[Burma]] (Myanmar) and includes the low-lying [[Irrawaddy delta]] ([[Ayeyarwady Region|Ayeyarwady]], [[Bago Region|Bago]] and [[Yangon Region]]s), as well as coastal regions of the country ([[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] and [[Mon State]]s and [[Tanintharyi Region]]).

In the [[Burmese language]], people originating from [[Upper Burma]] are typically called ''a-htet-tha'' for men and ''a-hiet-lhu'' for women, whereas those from Lower Burma are called ''auk tha'' ({{my|အောက်သား}}) for men and ''auk thu'' for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustaaf Houtman|title=Traditions of Buddhist Practice in Burma|year=1990|publisher=ILCAA|isbn=|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2018}} While ''a-nya tha'' ({{my|အညာသား}}) refers to interior inhabitants of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. H. Sloan|title=A Practical Method with the Burmese Language|year=1876|publisher=American Mission Press|isbn=|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2018}}

Historically, Lower Burma referred to the part of [[Burma]] annexed by the [[British Empire]] after the end of the [[Second Burmese War|Second Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1852,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mya Than|title=Myanmar's External Trade: An Overview in the Southeast Asian Context|year=1992|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian|isbn=98-130-1613-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus the former kingdom of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] and the territory of [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim]] which the British had taken control of in 1826 through the [[Treaty of Yandabo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Stuart Olson &amp; Robert Shadle|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire, Volume 1|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=03-132-9366-X|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower Burma was centred at [[Rangoon]], and composed of all of the coast of modern [[Burma]], and also the lower basin of the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]], including [[Prome]]. Until the early 19th century, Lower Burma was predominantly populated by the [[Mon people|Mon]] and [[Karen people|Karen]] tribes and was a historical stronghold of the Mon people.

Map historian and geographer '''Matthew H. Edney''' was born in 1962 in London SW19. He completed the B.Sc. (hons.) in Geography at University College London (1983) and then the M.S. in Cartography (1985) and Ph.D. in Geography (1990) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

After teaching at SUNY–Binghamton (aka Binghamton University) in 1990–95, Edney moved to the University of Southern Maine as faculty scholar in the [http://www.oshermaps.org Osher Map Library and Smith Center for Cartographic Education]. In 2007 he also became Osher Professor in the History of Cartography.

Already working with Mary Pedley as editors of ''Cartography in the European Enlightenment'', volume 4 of ''The History of Cartography'', Edney took over in 2005 as director of the [[History of Cartography Project]], at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, after the death of his graduate advisor, [[David Woodward]]. In this capacity, Edney implemented Woodward's strategy of pursuing the last three volumes of the series concurrently and as interpretive encyclopedias. He persuaded the University of Chicago Press both to publish the three volumes (4, 5, and 6) in full color and to place the [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/index.html published volumes online for free public access].

Edney's own research interests have addressed a variety of topics and concerns. His dissertation was published as ''Mapping an Empire: The Geographical Construction of British India, 1765–1843'' (Chicago, 1997). Since moving to Maine, Edney has particularly studied the mapping of colonial New England and North America, including essays on William Hubbard's map of New England (1677), the first map printed in British America, John Smith's map of New England (1616|7), and John Mitchell's 1755 map of North America that is often called "the most important map in American history." He has an abiding interest in developing conceptual frameworks for mapping and map history, which has matured into a large project; the first part of this is in press and will appear in early 2019 as ''Cartography: The Ideal and Its History'' (Chicago). A full accounting of Edney's scholarship is available at [https://www.mappingasprocess.net/ Mapping as Process].

Located on the isolated west coast of [[Espiritu Santo]], '''Mount Tabwemasana''' is not only the highest peak in [[Vanuatu]], but also one of the highest mountains in the Pacific.  At {{convert|1879|m|ft|0}}, Tabwemasana towers above the surrounding mountains and provides fantastic views toward the Coral Sea in East. Tabwemasana actually consists of two peaks and local folklore believes that these two peaks (male and female) come together in embrace at night.

Until the 1970s the village of Kerepua was located on the flanks of Tabwemasana, a full day's walk to the coast through thick rainforest. However, in the late 1970s like many other mountain villages, Kerepua was relocated to the coast and now provides the launching pad for any summit attempt.

Very few tourists climb Tabwemasana each year, with the number reaching the summit generally less than six persons per year. This is primarily due to the isolated location of the mountain and the physical difficulty of ascending the peak. Those wishing to climb Tabwemasana must first take a boat from the village of Tasiriki to Kerepua. From Kerepua you trek up a river before leaving the valley for a steep ascent up the mountain. Guides are required as the track is very difficult to follow.

'''Mount Tahat''' ({{lang-ar|جبل تاهات}}) is the highest mountain peak in [[Algeria]]. It sits at an elevation of {{Convert|3003|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name="peaklist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pb"/&gt; Tahat is also the highest peak in the [[Hoggar Mountains]]. Its nearest city is [[Tamanrasset]] which is located 56&amp;nbsp;km to the south.  

Mount Tahat is of volcanic origin. It is located in an arid, rocky high plateau area of the central [[Sahara Desert]]. The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] inhabit this region. To the north lie the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] mountains, which contain [[cave painting]]s dating from a period between 8000 and 2000 BC. The rock art is pastoral, showing cattle breeding and hunting of animals that are today exclusively found in the southern Sahara's climate.

The city located about 190&amp;nbsp;km north of state capital Mumbai, is called the ''"Wine Capital of India"'' as half of India’s vineyards and wineries are located in Nashik.&lt;ref name=wine&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Nashik is the wine capital of India - Asia-Pacific - RFI|url=http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20160925-why-nashik-wine-capital-india}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit Nashik, Wine Capital of India|url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/nashik-wine-india/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
As per ''[[Ramayana]]'', Nashik is the location on the banks of [[Godavari river]] where [[Laxman]], by the wish of Lord [[Rama]], cut the nose of [[Shurpanakha]] and thus this city was named as "Nashik".&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Development and present Status of Nashik District|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/95441/15/15_chapter6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nashik lies in the northern part of [[Maharashtra]] state at {{convert|584|m|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="nashik.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nashik.nic.in/htmldocs/disoverview.htm |title=Overview of District |website=Official Website of Nashik District |publisher=Nashik.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2015-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405153304/http://www.nashik.nic.in/htmldocs/disoverview.htm |archivedate=5 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the mean sea level which gives it ideal temperature variation, particularly in winters.&lt;ref name=wine/&gt;

[[File:Nashik Clouds.jpg|left|thumb|Nashik has lush mountainous terrain]]
The river [[Godavari]] originates from the Brahmagiri Mountain, Trimbakeshwar about {{Convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Nashik and flows through the old residential settlement, now in the central part of the city. Due to high pollution created by factories in proximity of the city the river was dying at an alarming rate. It has since been successfully cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=geography |url=http://www.ecoindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than Godavari, important rivers like Vaitarana, Bhima, Girana flow across Nashik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=geography|url=http://www.indiamapssite.com/maharashtra/rivers/nashik}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Moldova:

'''[[Moldova]]''' (officially the Republic of Moldova) &amp;ndash; landlocked country in Eastern Europe, located between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east and south. The capital city is Chișinău. Moldova declared itself an independent state in 1991 as part of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Moldova is a parliamentary republic with a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government. A new constitution was adopted in 1994. A strip of Moldovan territory on the east bank of the river Dniester has been under the de facto control of the breakaway government of Transnistria since 1990. As a result of a decrease in industrial and agricultural output since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the relative size of the service sector in Moldova's economy has grown to dominate its GDP and currently stands at over 60%. Moldova remains, however, the poorest country in Europe.

Polemius was among the Christian cultural elite&lt;ref&gt;David Paniagua Aguilar, "''Adis'': A Ghost Latin Zoological Term," ''Bulletin Du Cange'' 65 (2007), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; working within the imperial bureaucracy in Gaul&lt;ref&gt;Traina, ''428 AD'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Valentinian III]]. He was a friend of [[Hilarius of Arles]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Regional Diversification'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Gallic Chronicle of 452]]'', year 438, calls him "mentally disturbed."&lt;ref&gt;Traina, ''428 AD'',p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polemius was assigned to [[Eucherius of Lyon|Eucherius]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lyon|bishop of Lyon]] (ancient [[Lugdunum]]), and produced the calendar for him.&lt;ref&gt;Traina, ''428 AD'', p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; Because fixed [[feast day|Christian feasts]] were still few in number, Polemius faced the challenge of fulfilling the conventions of a traditional [[Roman calendar]] with named holidays while "disinfecting" it of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial Roman]] and other festivals now regarded as "[[paganism|pagan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, "Medicine in Medieval Calendar Manuscripts," in ''Manuscript Sources of Medieval Medicine: A Book of Essays'' (Garland, 1995), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Chronography of 354|Calendar of Filocalus in 354]] had recorded the traditional religious holidays freely, by the time of Polemius the Christian state had begun to legislate against other religions and to divorce Rome's religious heritage from the culture and civic life of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Polemius, who had probably consulted the Calendar of Filocalus,&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; filled gaps with [[meteorology|meteorological]] and seasonal markers, and the "[[Egyptian Days]],"&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, "Medicine in Medieval Calendar Manuscripts," pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; days considered unpropitious for new undertakings and for certain medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Eastwood, ''Ordering the Heavens: Roman Astronomy and Cosmology in the Carolingian Renaissance'' (Brill, 2007), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bede]] was among those who drew information from it.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time'' (Liverpool University Press, 1999), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Polemius's calendar, the word ''[[ludi]]'', "games" in [[classical Latin]], means more specifically theatrical performances, while ''circenses'' is used for [[chariot racing|chariot races]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, ''Bede'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; His work provides significant examples of [[Gallo-Romance]] vocabulary, regional variations of the [[Latin|Latin language]], and local survivals of [[Gaulish]] words.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Regional Diversification'', pp. 295ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The calendar==
The format used by Polemius for the most part followed the conventions of Roman calendars, with days arranged in parallel columns under the name of the month, and each day noted on a separate  line. Column 1 numbers the days of the month. Column 2 identifies any special days, not only traditional Roman and Christian holidays, but also the birthdays of emperors, and days when [[Roman consul|consuls]] and [[praetor]]s took office. Column 3 gives weather conditions; [[Columella]]'s 1st-century treatise on agriculture may have influenced the inclusion of references to weather.&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Lee, ''Pagans and Christians in Late Antiquity: A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Polemius also provided information from his own research, such as the birthdays of [[Cicero]], [[Vergil]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Maas, ''John Lydus and the Roman Past'' (Routledge, 1992), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Faustina who was the divinized wife ''([[divus|diva]])'' of an [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty|Antonine emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Roman calendar had traditionally served a didactic purpose,&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''laterculus'' of Polemius provided several other lists and tables under the month-by-month  [[chronography|chronographic]] presentation:
* emperors and usurpers;
* the [[Roman province]]s;
* animal names, spread out over two months;
* a table for [[computus|calculating the date]] of [[Paschal cycle|Easter]] and the [[phases of the moon]] (not extant);
* buildings and [[topography of ancient Rome|topographical features of Rome]];&lt;ref&gt;For examples of the kinds of information Polemius provides, see Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;dq=%22Polemius+Silvius%22&amp;q=%22Polemius+Silvius%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Polemius%20Silvius%22&amp;f=false passim.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''fabulae poeticae'' ("poets' tales");
* a [[breviary]] of Roman history;
* "a register of animal voices";
* weights and measures;
* [[meter (poetry)|meters of poetry]] (not extant);
* a survey of philosophical sects (not extant).

Lost portions are known only from the introductory synopsis.&lt;ref&gt;Lists as described by Aguilar, "''Adis''," p. 227; Adams, ''Regional Diversification'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; For each month, the calendar also presents the equivalent Hebrew, Egyptian, Athenian, and Greek names.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, ''Bede'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Provinces==

Polemius Silvius also wrote a list of Late Roman provinces, which [[Seeck]] appended to his edition of the [[Notitia Dignitatum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1200">A '''processional walkway''' is a ceremonial [[walkway]] in use since ancient times. Common functions of a processional walkway are for religious, governmental or celebratory purposes.

Early examples of this type of [[pedestrian]] travel way can be found in [[Egypt]], [[Babylon]]&lt;ref&gt;Barbara N. Porter, ''Images, Power, and Politics: Figurative Aspects of Esarhaddon's Babylonia'', 1993, Diane Publishing  {{ISBN|978-0-87169-208-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Crete]].  Ancient processional walkways were often associated with the design of palaces such as [[Phaistos]] on [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Crete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Knossos Fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The processional walkway is also an element of contemporary outdoor [[garden]] design.&lt;ref&gt;Steven L. Cantor, ''Contemporary Trends in Landscape Architecture'', 1996, John Wiley and Sons, United States, 348 pages  {{ISBN|0-471-28791-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quiver Tree Forest''' ('''Kokerboom Woud''' in [[Afrikaans]]) is a forest and [[tourism|tourist]] attraction of southern [[Namibia]]. It is located about 14&amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Keetmanshoop]], on the road to [[Koës]], on the [[Gariganus farm]]. It comprises about 250 specimens of ''[[Aloidendron dichotomum]]'', a [[species]] that is also locally known as "quiver tree" ([[Afrikaans]]: ''kokerboom'') because [[bushmen]] traditionally used its branches to make [[quiver]]s. The forest is spontaneous; the tallest quiver trees are two to three centuries old. The forest was declared a [[national monument]] of Namibia on June 1, 1995.

The Quiver tree is also known for looking like its upside down because the "leaves" look somewhat similar to roots. This tree has a long history of beliefs that it will bring good luck to anybody that worships a tree and nurtures it. Since diamonds are very rich in Namibia, people say that if you dig up one of these trees you will get diamonds in your lifetime, but since these trees are blessed nobody wants to dig them up.

Near the forest, there is another site of natural interest (itself a tourist attraction) for its geology, the '''Giant's Playground''', a vast pile of large [[dolerite]] rocks.

==Ecology==
The Quiver Tree Forest holds tremendous ecological value within its native landscape. Bright yellow flowers are born from June to July, when a huge variety of insects, birds and mammals are drawn to the abundant nectar.

===Fauna===
The forest is home to the [[rock hyraxes]] living among rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Quiver Tree Forest in Namibia|url=https://independent-travellers.com/namibia/quiver_tree_forest/|website=Independent Travellers|publisher=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Quiver Tree Forests==
Although ''Aloe dichotoma'' is common in southern Africa, there are only a small number of quiver tree forests proper. Most have been created by men; one of them is found in the [[Karoo National Botanical Garden]] of [[Worcester, South Africa]].

[[File:Sea of Japan naming dispute.png|thumb|The dispute concerns the international name of the body of water marked with a "?" above.|alt=The waters that are bordered by Sakhalin in the north-east, Japan in the east and south, Korea in the west and continental Russia in the north are marked with a question mark.]]
A dispute exists over the international name for the body of water which is bordered by [[Japan]], [[Korea]] ([[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South]]) and [[Russia]]. In 1992, objections to the name [[Sea of Japan]] were first raised by North Korea and South Korea at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names.&lt;ref name="MOFAJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/index.html|title=The Issue of the Name of the Sea of Japan|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Japanese government supports the exclusive use of the name "Sea of Japan" (日本海), while South Korea supports the alternative name "East Sea" ({{Korean|hangul=동해|hanja=東海}}), and North Korea supports the name "Korean East Sea" ({{Korean|hangul=조선동해|hanja=朝鮮東海|context=north}}).  Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or equivalent translation) exclusively, and far fewer maps include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name.  The [[International Hydrographic Organization]], the international governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world, in 2012 decided not to change the current single name "Sea of Japan" rejecting South Korea's request to use "East Sea" together with "Sea of Japan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2012/04/26/69/0301000000AEN20120426001300315F.HTML "IHO rejects Japan's proposal to rule out East Sea name"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024259/http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2012/04/26/69/0301000000AEN20120426001300315F.HTML |date=5 March 2016 }}, ''YONHAP NEWS AGENCY'', 26 April 2012.

The involved countries (especially Japan and South Korea) have advanced a variety of arguments to support their preferred name(s).  Many of the arguments revolve around determining when the name Sea of Japan became the common name.  South Korea argues that historically the more common name was East Sea, Sea of Korea, or another similar variant.  South Korea further argues that the name Sea of Japan did not become common until Korea was under [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], at which time it had no ability to influence international affairs.  Japan argues that the name Sea of Japan has been the most common international name since at least the beginning of the 19th century, long before its annexation of Korea.  Both sides have conducted studies of antiquarian maps, but the two countries have produced divergent research results.  Additional arguments have been raised regarding the underlying geography of the sea as well as potential problems regarding the ambiguity of one name or the other.

==Arguments==
[[Image:Matteo Ricci Far East 1602 Larger.jpg|thumb|The Far East as depicted within the ''[[Kunyu Wanguo Quantu]]'' by [[Matteo Ricci]] in 1602 describing the sea as the Sea of Japan.]]

Both sides in the dispute have put forward a number of arguments to support their claims.

===Arguments based on historical maps===

====Arguments from North Korea====
North Korea favors the exclusive use of the more nationalistic "Korean East Sea" or "East Sea of Korea" (조선동해/朝鮮東海) &lt;ref name="nk_1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geocurrents: The On-Going Japan Sea/East Sea Naming Controversy|url=http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/the-on-going-japan-seaeast-sea-naming-controversy#ixzz4jktTOJFy}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently{{When|date=January 2018}} no known published maps on behalf of the North Korean government to assert their claims on the nomenclature "Korean East Sea" or "East Sea of Korea".

====Arguments from South Korea====
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for South Korea, the name Donghae (동해, literally East Sea) has been used in Korea for over 2,000 years, including in ''[[Samguk Sagi|History of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (三國史記, 1145), the monument of [[King Gwanggaeto]], and "Map of Eight Provinces of Korea" (八道總圖, 1530).&lt;ref name="km1"&gt;{{cite web|title=East Sea|url=http://www.mofat.go.kr/english/political/hotissues/eastsea/index.jsp
|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|South Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]|year=2010 |accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented map to name the area the Sea of Japan was the world map drawn by the Italian missionary [[Matteo Ricci]] in China (1602) named ''[[Kunyu Wanguo Quantu]]'' (坤輿萬國全圖).  No Japanese record published up to the late-18th century indicated any name for the body of water.&lt;ref name="NEHF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Naming of the East Sea|url=http://english.historyfoundation.or.kr/?sub_num=160|publisher=Northeast Asian History Foundation|year=2007 |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, South Korea has pointed out that a few 19th-century Japanese maps referred to the sea as Chōsenkai (朝鮮海, literally Sea of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]), including the "Simplified Map of Japan's Periphery" (日本邊界略圖, 1809) and "New World Map" (新製輿地全圖, 1844).&lt;ref name = km1/&gt; South Korea argues there was no standard name prior to Japan's military expansion in the region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Additionally, it specifically states that the name Sea of Japan was not widely used, even in Japan, as late as the mid 19th century.&lt;ref name="legitimacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legitimacy for Restoring the Name East Sea|url=http://www.mofat.go.kr/english/political/images/res/east_sea.pdf|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|South Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]|date=May 2009 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=April 2011}} Thus, South Korea argues that the current name reflects active promotion by Japan during a time when Korea could not represent its interests internationally.&lt;ref name="WorkingPaper48"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Changes in Geographical Names of Korean Cities and other Developments|url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/maplib/ungegn/session-20/working-papers/working-paper-48.pdf|work=Working Paper 48 of the UNGEGN Twentieth Session|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=17–28 January 2000|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments from Japan====
The Japanese government claims that the name Sea of Japan was internationally used since the 17th century and established by the early 19th century, during a period in which Japan was under an isolationist policy ([[Sakoku]]) of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which restricted cultural exchange and commerce with foreign countries except China and the Netherlands until 1854.&lt;ref name="MOFARussianFederationstudy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Issue of naming of the Sea of Japan (Study in the Russian Federation) Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/study-6.html|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]]|year=2010 |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic Position"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/GIJUTSUKOKUSAI/nihonkai/position_eng.htm | title = Japanese Basic Position on the Naming of the "Japan Sea" | publisher = [[Japan Coast Guard]] | date = 1 March 2005 | accessdate = 22 November 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110524092704/http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/GIJUTSUKOKUSAI/nihonkai/position_eng.htm | archivedate = 24 May 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, they state, Japan could not have, at that time, had an influence on the international community regarding the naming of the sea.&lt;ref name="Basic Position"/&gt;

The invention of the [[marine chronometer]] in the late 18th century enabled Western explorers, such as [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Jean-François de Galaup]] from France, [[William Robert Broughton]] from Britain, and [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] (Ivan Fyodorovich Kruzenshtern) from Russia, to measure time and longitudes on the sea precisely and map the detailed shape of the Sea of Japan.&lt;ref name="Basic Position"/&gt; Krusenstern was an [[Russian Admiral|admiral]] and [[List of Russian explorers|explorer]], who led the [[first Russian circumnavigation]] of the [[Earth|globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adam Johann von Krusenstern |coauthors= |title=Voyage Round the World |year=1813 |publisher= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgXVHAAACAAJ&amp;dq |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Japanese records, it was Krusenstern who popularized the name "Mer du Japon" (Sea of Japan) in the West. In his work "Reise um die Welt in den Jahren" (1812), he wrote, "People also call this sea area the Sea of Korea, but because only a small part of this sea touches the Korean coast, it is better to name it the Sea of Japan."&lt;ref name="Basic Position"/&gt; The original book was published in [[St. Petersburg]] in German and Russian, translated into Dutch, French, Swedish, Italian and English, and distributed widely among Europe.&lt;ref name="Basic Position"/&gt; As a result, the international name of the sea changed from no name to the Sea of Japan, on the maps drawn by countries other than Japan or Korea during the 17th to 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Basic Position"/&gt; Thus, the Japanese side argues that the South Koreans misunderstand the history of the name.

[[File:Mer Orientale 1700.jpg|thumb|A 1700 French map describing the sea as ''Mer Orientale'' (Eastern Sea or Oriental Sea).]]

To provide evidence for the date when Sea of Japan came to be used internationally, both South Korea and Japan have undertaken surveys of various historical maps.

In 2004, South Korea surveyed ancient maps archived in the British Library, the Cambridge University Library, the University of Southern California (USC) East Asian Map Collection, the U.S. Library of Congress, the National Library of Russia, and the French National Library examined 762 maps.  They found that 440 maps had used Sea of Korea (Corea), Oriental Sea/East Sea, 122 had used Sea of Japan, and 200 had used other terms.&lt;ref name="NAHF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Naming of the East Sea|url=http://english.historyfoundation.or.kr/?sub_num=160|publisher=Northeast Asian History Foundation|year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815174553/http://english.historyfoundation.or.kr/?sub_num=160|archivedate=15 August 2011|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[French language]], the word ''orientale'' includes both the meaning of "eastern" related to compass direction and the meaning of "oriental", the Asiatic region. The same ambiguity is present in the [[Russian language]], with both "eastern" and "oriental" indicated by one word.

From 2003 to 2008, Japan conducted a number of surveys of different collections. In 2010, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] (MOFA) published their conclusions; they found that among 1,332 maps from the Berlin Library, 279 used Sea of Korea, Oriental Sea, or East Sea (or some combination thereof), 579 used Sea of Japan exclusively, 47 used China Sea (with or without other names), 33 used another term, and 384 used no term.&lt;ref name="MOFAstudy7f"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Issue of the Naming of the Sea of Japan (Study in Germany)|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/study-7f.html|work=SEA OF JAPAN|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]]|year=2010|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOFA said the Struck collection (a collection of antiquarian maps owned by a European map collector) showed that out of 79 maps, 35 used Sea of Japan, 9 used the Sea of Korea, 2 used Oriental Sea, and 33 were unmarked.&lt;ref name= MOFAstudy7f/&gt; MOFA reported that among four Russian libraries and document archives holding 51 maps, 29 used Sea of Japan, 8 used Sea of Korea, 1 used Korea Strait, 1 used East Sea, 1 used Sea of China, and 11 used no name.&lt;ref name="MOFAstudy6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Issue of naming of the Sea of Japan (Study in the Russian Federation)|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/study-6.html|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]]|year=2010|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MOFA said that 1,213 maps from the U.S. Library of Congress, ones that gave a name for this body of water, showed that 87 percent used Sea of Japan, 8 percent used Sea of Korea, 5 percent used other terms, and none used Oriental Sea or East Sea.&lt;ref name="MOFApamphlet2003"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/pamph0903.pdf|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]]|date=February 2009|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, MOFA said that 58 maps from the British Library and the University of Cambridge showed 86 percent used Sea of Japan, 14 percent used Sea of Korea, and none used Oriental Sea, East Sea, or other terms.&lt;ref name=MOFApamphlet2003/&gt; MOFA said that they looked at 1,485 maps in the French National Library. They reported that 95 percent of 215 French maps used Sea of Japan.&lt;ref name=MOFApamphlet2003/&gt;

In November 2007, the National Geographic Information Institute of South Korea published a report on a survey of 400 ancient maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.kr/policy/pressReleaseView.do?newsId=155257262|script-title=ko:세계사와 함께한 우리나라 지도역사를 한눈에… – 동해 ․ 독도 및 간도의 변화 집중조명 – |trans-title=At a glance of the World history and the history of the map of our country ... – Spotlight on the change of Donghae, Dokdo and Jiandao – | publisher=National Geographic Information Institute of Korea|date= November 2007|language=Korean}}&lt;br/&gt;Original text in HWP format in Korean is available here [http://academic.naver.com/openUrl.nhn?doc_id=13076350&amp;linkType=doclink]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, nine maps used East Sea for the water currently called Sea of Japan, while 31 maps used East Sea for the water currently called East China Sea. The number of maps used Sea of Japan is not disclosed. Furthermore, the report says "''In the late 18th century (1790–1830) the name Sea of Japan emerged. From the 19th century (1830 onward), there was a rapid increase in the use of the name Sea of Japan.''" Japan stated, "This clearly shows the fallacy of the ROK's assertion that the name Sea of Japan was the result of the Japanese policy of expansionism and colonial rule, and can be interpreted as affirming that the name Sea of Japan was in widespread use well before Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula".&lt;ref name="MOFA#6"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Government of the Republic of Korea(ROK) has recently published a survey that can be interpreted as withdrawing a part of its own assertion. |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/#6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical arguments===
[[File:South Korea map - en.png|thumbnail|left|South Korea refers to its surrounding waters as the East Sea, South Sea, and West Sea.]]
Japan argues that, the name Sea of Japan has been and should be used because the [[marginal sea]] is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the [[Japanese Archipelago]].&lt;ref name="mofapamph0208"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/pamph0208.pdf|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]]|date=August 2002|accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korea argues that the adjective "East" describes its geographical position east of the Asian continent, although it is west of Japan and south of Russia. It states that this is analogous to the [[North Sea]], which lies north of the European continent, but west of Scandinavian countries and east of Great Britain.&lt;ref name = "WorkingPaper48"/&gt;

===Arguments relating to ambiguity===
[[File:East Seas in East Asia.png|thumb|The name "East Sea" is used to refer to several different seas in Eastern Eurasia.]]
The Japanese Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japanese Coast Guard has claimed that the name East Sea is confusing and unsuitable as an international geographic name, because the local name for a variety of seas can be translated into English as East Sea.  Examples include Dōng Hǎi (东海), the Chinese name for the [[East China Sea]]; Biển Đông, the Vietnamese name for the [[South China Sea]]; and the [[Baltic Sea]], which means East Sea in several European languages such as German (''Ostsee''), Swedish (''Östersjön'') and Finnish (''Itämeri'').&lt;ref name="Basic Position"/&gt; East Sea is officially used as an English name for the water by the Government of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Basic Position"/&gt; Thus the Government of Vietnam uses East Sea for South China Sea in its English publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VN, China pledge to solve East Sea issue|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Socialist Republic of Việt Nam|url=http://thutuong.chinhphu.vn:2012/Home/VN-China-pledge-to-solve-East-Sea-issue/20114/1040.vgp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VN asserts sea and island sovereignty |date=2011-06-09|publisher=Socialist Republic of Việt Nam|url=http://thutuong.chinhphu.vn:2012/Home/VN-asserts-sea-and-island-sovereignty/20116/1025.vgp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China uses East Sea for East China Sea in its English publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth Round of Consultation on East Sea between China and Japan to Be Held |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of People's Republic of China|date=2 March 2006|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjdt/wsrc/t238013.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Premier Meets with Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of People's Republic of China|date=24 October 2008|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/zxxx/t519594.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, {{nihongo|East Sea|[[東海 (disambiguation)|東海]]|''[[Tōkai (disambiguation)|Tōkai]]''}} is not the Sea of Japan but the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the Japanese context. The regions on the east coast of Japan were named accordingly as the [[Tōkaidō (region)|Tōkaidō region]] and the [[Tōkai region]].
The Japanese government is concerned that the name change could set a bad precedent and cause more naming disputes worldwide.&lt;ref name="Basic Position"/&gt;

==Position of international bodies==
The main two international organizations which have been involved in the naming dispute are the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] and the [[United Nations]].

===International Hydrographic Organization===

The International Hydrographic Organization is an organization that coordinates with member countries over [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] issues.  One of the organization's functions is to help set international standards on the naming and delineation of nautical regions.  In 1929, the organization (then called the International Hydrographic Bureau) published "IHO Special Publication 23" (IHO SP 23), which established the name of the sea as Sea of Japan; however, at that time, Korea could not participate in the IHO because it was under Japanese rule.&lt;ref name="KHOA"&gt;{{cite web|title=IHO Special Publication 23|url=http://eastsea.nori.go.kr/eng/open_content/iho/magazine.asp|publisher=Korean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration|year=2004|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  South Korea officially joined the IHO in 1957.&lt;ref name="JCGchronology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Historical Background Information|url=http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/GIJUTSUKOKUSAI/nihonkai/keii_eng.htm|publisher=[[Japan Coast Guard]]|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=21 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524121526/http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/GIJUTSUKOKUSAI/nihonkai/keii_eng.htm|archivedate=24 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, IHO released Technical Resolution A.4.2.6. This resolution stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is recommended that where two or more countries share a given geographical feature (such as a bay, a strait, channel or archipelago) under different names, they should endeavor to reach agreement on a single name for the feature concerned. If they have different official languages and cannot agree on a common name form, it is recommended that the name forms of each of the languages in question should be accepted for charts and publications unless technical reasons prevent this practice on small scale charts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
South Korea has argued that this resolution is relevant to the debate about the Sea of Japan and implies that both names should be used; Japan, however, argues that the resolution does not apply to the Sea of Japan, because it does not specify this body of water and only applies to geographical features for which sovereignty is shared between two or more countries.&lt;ref name = MOFApamphlet2003/&gt;

The IHO agreed to conduct a survey of available evidence in 2011. Previously, South Korea had been pushing the IHO to recommend only using the term East Sea, but announced on 2 May 2011, that it now preferred the gradual approach of using both names now, and eventually dropping the Sea of Japan name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2935590 |title=Gov’t goes easy on East Sea renaming demand |publisher=Korea Joongang Daily |date=2 May 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=?url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2935590 |archivedate=2 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }} (Archived by WebCite® at )&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2012, the IHO announced that it had decided to use only "Sea of Japan" in its governing publication ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' and rejected the alternative use of "East Sea" as proposed by South Korea.  According to the South Korean government, the organization will again discuss the issue of the name when it reconvenes in 2017.{{Update inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name="Sea of Japan name dispute rolls on"/&gt;

===United Nations===
While the United Nations has never directly addressed the issue of establishing an official, standardized name for the sea, several resolutions and statements by the UN have had relevance to the topic.  Japan joined the United Nations in 1956, while South and North Korea both joined in 1991.&lt;ref name="UN members"&gt;{{cite web|title=Member States of the United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/members|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=3 July 2006|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the third U.N. Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (UNCSGN) adopted Resolution III/20, entitled "Names of Features beyond a Single Sovereignty". The resolution recommended that "when countries sharing a given geographical feature do not agree on a common name, it should be a general rule of cartography that the name used by each of the countries concerned will be accepted. A policy of accepting only one or some of such names while excluding the rest would be inconsistent as well as inexpedient in practice."  As with IHO Technical Resolution A.4.2.6, South Korea and Japan disagree about whether or not this policy applies to the Sea of Japan.&lt;ref name = MOFApamphlet2003/&gt;

In 1992, during the 1992 Sixth UNCSGN, the South Korean government, in their first time participating in UNCSGN, requested that the name of the sea be determined through consultation, which the North Korean representative concurred with.  The Japanese representative stated that the name of the Sea of Japan had already been accepted worldwide and that any change would introduce confusion. The conference recommended that the parties work together on the issue outside of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report of the Sixth UNCSGN Conference|id=United Nations Publication E.93.I.23|pages=21–22|publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, South Korea raised the issue again at the Seventh UNCSGN. Japan, however, opposed the method by which the South Korean government proposed the issue, arguing that they had not followed the proper procedure for doing so. Following some debate, South Korea withdrew the issue, and instead recommended that the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names work so that a resolution could be submitted to the Eighth UNSCGN conference. The president of the conference urged that Japan, South Korea, and North Korea work towards a mutually acceptable agreement.&lt;ref name="UNSCGN7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Seventh UNCSGN Conference|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/7th-uncsgn-docs/7thUNCSGN-Report_E-.pdf|page = 18|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=13–22 January 1998|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Eighth UNCSGN in 2002, South Korea and Japan presented a number of papers to the conference regarding their positions on the naming issue.  South Korea asked for a resolution to adjudicate the name, while Japan asked that the name be decided through resolution outside of the conference.

On 23 April 2004, the United Nations affirmed in a written document to the Japanese government that it will continue using the name Sea of Japan in its official documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/un0406.html | title = The Policy of the United Nations Concerning the Naming of {{'}}Sea of Japan{{'}} | publisher = [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]] |date=June 2004|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it agreed to leave the topic open for further discussion. In a letter to South Korea, it was explained that the UN was not determining the validity of either name, but wished to use the term most widely used until the parties resolved the disagreement.  The letter further stated, "The use of an appellation by the Secretariat based on the practice is without prejudice to any negotiations or agreements between the interested parties and should not be interpreted as advocating or endorsing any party's position, and can in no way be invoked by any party in support of a particular position in the matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mofat.go.kr/pdffiles/en_Eastsea_1.htm| title = The Practice of the Secretariat of the United Nations Concerning the Naming of the Sea Area between Korea and Japan, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of South Korea| accessdate = 22 November 2010| publisher = [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|South Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120806062346/http://www.mofat.go.kr/pdffiles/en_Eastsea_1.htm| archivedate = 6 August 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2012, representatives from North and South Korea addressed an assembly at the [[United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names]], asking that the names "East Sea" and "Sea of Japan" be used concurrently for the sea.  {{Interlanguage link multi|Ferjan Ormeling|nl}}, chairman of the conference, responded that the organization had no authority to decide the issue and requested that the involved countries resolve the differences over the name amongst themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/08/08/national/genba-stands-firm-on-senkakus/ Genba stands firm on Senkakus; Koreas in 'East Sea' push] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104222924/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/08/08/national/genba-stands-firm-on-senkakus/ |date=4 January 2016 }}", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 8 August 2012, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia calls this sea "Япо́нское мо́ре" (Yapónskoye móre, Japanese Sea).&lt;ref name="FEB_RAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=ATLAS OF OCEANOGRAPHY Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan|url=http://www.pacificinfo.ru/data/cdrom/2/HTML/4_00.htm |language=Russian |publisher=Far East Branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Univ.Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seas of the USSR|url=http://tapemark.narod.ru/more/20.html |language=Russian |publisher=A.

The [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] (BGN) continues to advocate the use of Sea of Japan without qualification in [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] publications.  [[The World Factbook]] published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] follows the BGN's guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/faqs.html|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|year=2010|accessdate=8 November 2010}} Note: expand the "Policies" tab to see details.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2011, a spokesman for the United States Department of State stated that the United States Board on Geographic Names considered the official name of the sea to be "Sea of Japan".  According to [[Yonhap]], the U.S. has officially recommended to the IHO that "Sea of Japan" remain as the official name for the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "Sea of Japan is the official name, not East Sea: U.S.", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 August 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this failure of the South Korean campaign, South Korean foreign minister [[Kim Sung-hwan (diplomat)|Kim Sung-hwan]] suggested advocating other historical names, such as "Sea of Korea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/08/15/2011081500441.html|title=Now 'East Sea' Has Sunk, Can 'Sea of Korea' Swim?|publisher=The Chosunilbo|date=15 August 2011|quote=''When asked in a press briefing if the country would consider yet another name for the East Sea, Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan said, "We can think of various ways, for example retrieving the lost historical name 'Sea of Corea' if that is helpful."''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Virginia]] state lawmaker [[David W. Marsden]], acting on behalf of Korean-American voters, introduced a bill to the education panel of the [[Senate of Virginia]] that would have required public school textbooks to include both "Sea of Japan" and "East Sea" as names. The panel rejected the bill by an 8–7 vote on 26 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "Virginia sinks sea-renaming plan", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 31 January 2012, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='East Sea' textbook directive fails Senate panel | url=http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2722782&amp;nid=120 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was revisited two years later on 3 February 2014, with the Education Committee of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] passing legislation to use both "Sea of Japan" and "East Sea" in school textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001001763 |title=Virginia nears law on Sea of Japan |publisher=The Japan News |date= |accessdate=24 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307113844/http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001001763 |archivedate=7 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2012, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs [[Kurt M. Campbell]] affirmed the BGN's position in his response, published on the White House website, to a [[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People petition]] concerning the usage of "Sea of Japan", in which he stated, "It is longstanding United States policy to refer to each sea or ocean by a single name. This policy applies to all seas, including those bordered by multiple countries that may each have their own names for such bodies of water. Concerning the body of water between the Japanese archipelago and the Korean peninsula, longstanding U.S. policy is to refer to it as the "Sea of Japan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Response to We the People Petition on the Sea of Japan Naming Issue | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/06/29/response-we-people-petition-sea-japan-naming-issue | publisher=The White House | accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, "We are aware the Republic of Korea refers to the body of water as the 'East Sea,' and the United States is not asking the Republic of Korea to change its nomenclature. U.S. usage of the 'Sea of Japan' in no way implies an opinion regarding any issue related to sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://info.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120704b3.html U.S. to keep Sea of Japan on books] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140447/http://info.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120704b3.html |date=22 February 2014 }}", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 July 2012, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compromise names==
On 18 November 2006, during the APEC summit in Hanoi, South Korean President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] informally proposed to the Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] that the sea be called instead the "Sea of Peace" or "Sea of Friendship", which Abe rejected. In January 2007 Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Yasuhisa Shiozaki]] opposed the idea, saying that there was no need to change the name of the Sea of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/01/10/national/shiozaki-no-need-to-change-name-of-sea-of-japan/|title =No need to change name of Sea of Japan|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=10 January 2007|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of media and publishers==
{{Update|type=section|date=October 2012}}

A number of maps, encyclopedias, and other publications have switched to using both names. For example, the Manual of Style of the [[National Geographic Society]] states that disputed place-names in international waters or jointly controlled by two or more countries should use the conventional name first with other names following in parentheses.&lt;ref name="NGSPlaceNamesentry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Place-Names|url=http://stylemanual.ngs.org/home/S/sea-of-japan-east-sea|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, their policy on this sea states that "The internationally accepted name is Sea of Japan, although Korea prefers East Sea. When scale permits, Geographic maps show the alternative name East Sea in parentheses after Sea of Japan."&lt;ref name="NGSSeaofJapanentry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea of Japan (East Sea) |url=http://stylemanual.ngs.org/intranet/styleman.nsf/f2aba7b22d0d07cf8525664b00705a8f/13756ea8bedd77a1852568da0066e7fd?OpenDocument |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=22 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Google put both names on [[Google Earth]], using East Sea near the Korean coast and Sea of Japan near the Japanese coast.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cho|first=Jin-Seo|title=Google asked to identify Korea correctly|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-eastasia.asp?parentid=50214|accessdate=21 September 2010|newspaper=Korea Times|date=2 August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520090640/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-eastasia.asp?parentid=50214|archivedate=20 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 edition of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the primary article is called "Sea of Japan". A secondary article called "East Sea" notes "see Japan, Sea of". On the encyclopedia's map of Japan and other Asia maps, Sea of Japan appears as the primary label and East Sea appears as a secondary label in parentheses. However, on the map of Korea the name East Sea appears as the primary label and Sea of Japan appears as a secondary label in parentheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=브리태니커 백과사전,2007년판에 {{'}}동해 표기!{{'}}|url=http://sisa-issue.inews24.com/php/news_view.php?g_serial=261338&amp;g_menu=050200|work=[[Naver]]|accessdate=15 October 2010|date=10 May 2007|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of publishers who use similar systems include Microsoft Encarta,&lt;ref name="MSNEncarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Japan, Sea of definition – Dictionary|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861677081/Japan_Sea_of.html|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]]|publisher=[[MSN]]|year=2009|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia,&lt;ref name="Colum6thed"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Japan, Sea of|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0825981.html|encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |edition=6th|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2007|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and About.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa022402a.htm | title = Sea of Japan vs. East Sea – Letter Writing Campaign Influences Cartography | publisher = [[About.com]]  | date=24 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, French encyclopedia publisher [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] replaced "Mer du Japon" ("Sea of Japan") with "Mer de L'est (Mer du Japon)" ("East Sea (Sea of Japan)") in maps of South Korea and North Korea in two of its books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/02/20/2012022001079.html French Encyclopedia Publisher Adopts 'East Sea' Denomination (Chosun Ilbo, 20 February 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093341/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/02/20/2012022001079.html |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larousse"&gt;{{cite book|title=Le Petit Larousse illustré 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=044a_gAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|publisher=Laurier Books Ltd|year= 2011|isbn=2-03-584090-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;　However other maps such as those of Asia, China, Japan, and Russia continue to use "Mer du Japon".&lt;ref name="Larousse"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Asie" (Asia), "Chine" (China), "Japon" (Japan), "Russie" (Russia)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the article "Mer du Japon" does not mention "East Sea" at all.&lt;ref name="Larousse"/&gt;

In 2013, [[Bandai Namco Entertainment|Bandai Namco Games]], a Japanese game developer, initially presented both names as "Sea of Japan (East Sea)" in ''[[Ace Combat Infinity]]''. There was intense backlash from the Japanese community for including the Korean name at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=PS3『エースコンバット インフィニティ』で東海表記が見つかり超大荒れ状態に！ゲームはメンテナンスから未だサービス再開せず|url=http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/7401068.html|work=はちま起稿|accessdate=21 April 2017|date=9 November 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the company removed all international borders and labels from the game's maps and heavily blurred them to maintain neutrality.

'''Siberia''' ({{IPAc-en|s|aɪ|ˈ|b|ɪər|i|ə}}; {{lang-rus|Сиби́рь|r=Sibírj;|p=sʲɪˈbʲirʲ|a=Ru-Сибирь.ogg}}) is an extensive geographical [[region]] spanning much of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Asia]]. Siberia has historically been a [[Russian conquest of Siberia|part of modern Russia]] since the 16th and 17th centuries.

The territory of Siberia extends eastwards from the [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[drainage divide|watershed]] between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] [[drainage basin]]s. The [[Yenisei River]] conditionally divides Siberia into two parts, [[Western Siberia|Western]] and Eastern. Siberia stretches southwards from the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the hills of north-central [[Kazakhstan]] and to the national borders of [[Mongolia]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encycl.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00070/76500.htm?text=%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%8C |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712213914/http://encycl.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00070/76500.htm?text=%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%8C |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian) |publisher=Encycl.yandex.ru |date= |accessdate=15 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With an area of {{Convert|13.1|e6km2|mi2}}, Siberia accounts for 77% of Russia's land area, but it is home to approximately 36 million people—27% of the country's population. This is equivalent to an average population density of about {{Convert|3|PD/sqkm}} (approximately equal to that of [[Australia]]), making Siberia one of the most sparsely populated regions on Earth. If it were a country by itself, it would still be the largest country in area, but in population it would be the world's 35th-largest and Asia's 14th-largest.

Worldwide, Siberia is well known primarily for its long, harsh winters, with a January average of −25&amp;nbsp;°C (−13&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aer.com/science-research/climate-weather/arctic-oscillation/|title=Arctic Oscillation and Polar Vortex Analysis and Forecasts|website=AER|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its extensive history of use by Russian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] administrations as a place for prisons, [[Gulag#Geography|labor camps]], and exile.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is unknown. Some sources say that "Siberia" originates from the [[Siberian Tatar]] word for "sleeping land" (Sib Ir).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/20/escape.adventure|title=Trans-Siberian for softies|author=Euan Ferguson|work=the Guardian|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another account sees the name as the ancient tribal ethnonym of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Sirtya|ru|3=Сиртя}} (also "Syopyr" (sʲɵpᵻr)), an ethnic group which spoke a [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]] language. The Sirtya people were later assimilated into the [[Siberian Tatar]]s.

The modern usage of the name was recorded in the Russian language after the Empire's conquest of the [[Siberian Khanate]]. A further variant claims that the region was named after the [[Xibe people]].&lt;ref name=manchus213&gt;{{cite book |last=Crossley |first=Pamela Kyle |title=The Manchus |series=Peoples of Asia |volume=14 |year=2002 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=0-631-23591-4 |page=213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KHLEvqvET8C |edition=3rd |author-link=Pamela Kyle Crossley |access-date=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish historian Chycliczkowski has proposed that the name derives from the [[proto-Slavic]] word for "north" (север, ''sever''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Czaplicka |first=M.C. |title=Aboriginal Siberia |year=1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Anatole Baikaloff has dismissed this explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baikaloff |first=Anatole |title=Notes on the origin of the name "Siberia" |journal=Slavonic and East European Review |date=Dec 1950 |volume=29 |issue= 72|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the neighbouring Chinese, Turks, and Mongolians, who have similar names for the region, would not have known Russian. He suggests that the name might be a combination of two words with [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origin, ''"su"'' (water) and ''"bir"'' (wild land).

==Prehistory==
The region has [[Paleontology|paleontological]] significance, as it contains bodies of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] animals from the [[Pleistocene]] [[epoch (geology)|Epoch]], preserved in ice or in [[permafrost]]. Specimens of [[Panthera leo spelaea#Specimens|Goldfuss cave lion cubs]], [[Yuka (mammoth)]] and another [[woolly mammoth]] from [[Oymyakon]], a [[woolly rhinoceros]] from the [[Kolyma River]], and [[bison]] and [[horse]]s from [[Yukagir]] have been found.&lt;ref name=Thesiberiantimes2015&gt;{{Cite web |title = Meet this extinct cave lion, at least 10,000&amp;nbsp;years old – world exclusive |url = http://siberiantimes.com/science/others/news/n0464-meet-this-extinct-cave-lion-at-least-10000-years-old/ |website = siberiantimes.com |accessdate = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siberian Traps]] were formed by one of the largest-known volcanic events of the last 500&amp;nbsp;million years of [[Earth's geological history]]. Their activity continued for a million years and some scientists consider it a possible cause of the "[[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Great Dying]]" about 250&amp;nbsp;million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/supervolcano/others/others_07.html |title="Yellowstone's Super Sister" |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050314025022/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/supervolcano/others/others_07.html |archivedate=14 March 2005 |df=dmy-all | quote =  [...] the Siberian Traps is the prime suspect in wiping out 90 percent of all living species 251&amp;nbsp;million years ago — the most severe extinction event in Earth's history.}}.

&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three species of human lived in Southern Siberia around 40,000 years ago: ''[[Homo sapiens|H. sapiens]]'', ''[[Neanderthal|H. neanderthalensis]]'', and the [[Denisovans]].&lt;ref name="Woman X"&gt;"

Siberia was inhabited by different groups of [[nomad]]s such as the [[Enets people|Enets]], the [[Nenets people|Nenets]], the [[Huns]], the [[Scythians]] and the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]]. The Khan of Sibir in the vicinity of modern [[Tobolsk]] was known as a prominent figure who endorsed [[Kubrat]] as ''Khagan'' of [[Old Great Bulgaria]] in 630. The Mongols conquered a large part of this area early in the 13th century. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

With the breakup of the [[Golden Horde]], the [[autonomous]] [[Khanate of Sibir]] was established in the late 15th century. Turkic-speaking [[Yakuts|Yakut]] migrated north from the [[Lake Baikal]] region under pressure from the Mongol tribes during the 13th to 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Richards]] wrote: "... it is doubtful that the total early modern Siberian population exceeded 300,000 persons."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&amp;pg=PA538 Richards, 2003] p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing power of [[Russia]] in the West began to undermine the Siberian Khanate in the 16th century. First, groups of traders and [[Cossack]]s began to enter the area. The Russian Army was directed to establish forts farther and farther east to protect new settlers from European Russia. Towns such as [[Mangazeya]], [[Tara, Russia|Tara]], [[Yeniseysk]] and [[Tobolsk]] were developed, the last being declared the capital of Siberia. At this time, ''Sibir'' was the name of a fortress at Qashlik, near Tobolsk. [[Gerardus Mercator]], in a map published in 1595, marks ''Sibier'' both as the name of a settlement and of the surrounding territory along a left tributary of the Ob.&lt;ref&gt;''[[:File:CEM-15-Asia-Mercator-1595-Russia-2533.jpg|Asia ex magna Orbis terrae descriptione Gerardi Mercatoris desumpta, studio &amp; industria G.M. Iunioris]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources{{which|date=September 2017}} contend that the [[Xibe people|Xibe]], an indigenous [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic people]], offered fierce resistance to Russian expansion beyond the Urals. Some suggest that the term "Siberia" is a Russification of their ethnonym.

By the mid-17th century, Russia had established areas of control that extended to the [[Pacific]]. Some 230,000 [[Russians]] had settled in Siberia by 1709.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sean C.

The first great modern change in Siberia was the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], constructed during 1891–1916. It linked Siberia more closely to the rapidly industrialising Russia of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Around seven million people moved to Siberia from [[European Russia]] between 1801 and 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/1848991|title=Review: The Great Siberian Migration: Government and Peasant in Resettlement from Emancipation to the First World War|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1859 to 1917, more than half a million people migrated to the [[Russian Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jce4rBWjG5wC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Russian Far East: A History]''.

At 7:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 30 June 1908, millions of trees were felled near the [[Podkamennaya Tunguska River|Podkamennaya Tunguska (Stony Tunguska) River]] in central Siberia in the [[Tunguska Event]]. Most scientists believe this resulted from the air burst of a meteor or a comet. Even though no crater has ever been found, the landscape in the (sparsely inhabited) area still bears the scars of this event.

In the early decades of the [[Soviet Union]] (especially the 1930s and 1940s), the government established the [[Gulag]] state agency to administer a system of penal [[labour camp]]s, replacing the previous [[katorga]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gG6cPY2RpzUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''The Unknown Gulag: The Lost World of Stalin's Special Settlements'']. [[Lynne Viola]] (2007). [[Oxford University Press US]]. p.3. {{ISBN|0-19-518769-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to semi-official Soviet estimates, which were not made public until after the fall of the Soviet government, from 1929 to 1953 more than 14 million people passed through these camps and prisons, many of which were in Siberia. Another seven to eight million people were [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|internally deported]] to remote areas of the Soviet Union (including entire nationalities or ethnicities in several cases).&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] in "Victims of Stalinism: A Comment," ''Europe-Asia Studies,'' Vol. 49, No. 7 (Nov. 1997), pp. 1317–1319 states: "We are all inclined to accept the Zemskov totals (even if not as complete) with their 14 million intake to Gulag 'camps' alone, to which must be added four to five million going to Gulag 'colonies', to say nothing of the 3.5 million already in, or sent to, 'labour settlements'. However taken, these are surely 'high' figures."&lt;/ref&gt;

Half a million (516,841) prisoners died in camps from 1941 to 1943&lt;ref&gt;Zemskov, "Gulag," ''Sociologičeskije issledovanija,'' 1991, No. 6, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; due to food shortages caused by [[World War II]].

Many Gulag camps were positioned in extremely remote areas of northeastern Siberia. The best known clusters are ''[[Sevvostlag]]'' (''The North-East Camps'') along the [[Kolyma]] River and ''[[Norillag]]'' near [[Norilsk]], where 69,000 prisoners were kept in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Courtois and Kramer (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H1jsgYCoRioC&amp;pg=PA239 ''Livre noir du Communisme,'' p.239. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Major industrial cities of Northern Siberia, such as [[Norilsk]] and [[Magadan]], developed from camps built by prisoners and run by former prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arlindo-correia.org/041003.html |title=Gulag: a History of the Soviet Camps |publisher=Arlindo-correia.org |date= |accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an area of {{Convert|13.1|e6km2|mi2}}, Siberia makes up roughly 77% of Russia's total territory and almost 10% of Earth's land surface ({{Convert|148,940,000|km2|abbr=on|disp=comma}}). While Siberia falls entirely within Asia, many authorities such as the [[UN geoscheme]] will not subdivide countries and will place all of Russia as part of Europe and/or [[Eastern Europe]]. Major geographical zones include the [[West Siberian Plain]] and the [[Central Siberian Plateau]].

Eastern and central [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]] comprises numerous north-south mountain ranges of various ages. These mountains extend up to almost {{convert|3000|m|ft}}, but above a few hundred metres they are almost completely devoid of vegetation. The [[Verkhoyansk Range]] was extensively glaciated in the Pleistocene, but the climate was too dry for glaciation to extend to low elevations. At these low elevations are numerous valleys, many of them deep and covered with [[larch]] forest, except in the extreme north where the [[tundra]] dominates. Soils are mainly turbels (a type of [[gelisols|gelisol]]). The active layer tends to be less than one metre deep, except near rivers.

The highest point in Siberia is the active [[volcano]] [[Klyuchevskaya Sopka]], on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Its peak is at {{convert|4750|m}}.

=== Geology ===

The West Siberian Plain consists mostly of [[Cenozoic]] alluvial deposits and is somewhat flat. Many deposits on this plain result from [[Proglacial lake|ice dam]]s which produced a large [[glacial lake]]. This mid- to late-[[Pleistocene]] lake blocked the northward flow of the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] rivers, resulting in a redirection southwest into the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Aral Sea|Aral]] seas via the [[Turgai Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/lake.html Lioubimtseva E.U., Gorshkov S.P. &amp; Adams J.M.; ''A Giant Siberian Lake During the Last Glacial: Evidence and Implications''; Oak Ridge National laboratory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213101647/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/lake.html |date=13 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is very swampy, and soils are mostly peaty [[histosol]]s and, in the treeless northern part, [[histels]]. In the south of the plain, where [[permafrost]] is largely absent, rich grasslands that are an extension of the [[Kazakh Steppe]] formed the original vegetation, most of which is no longer visible.{{why?|date=April 2015}}

The Central Siberian Plateau is an ancient [[craton]] (sometimes named ''Angaraland'') that formed an independent [[continent]] before the [[Permian]] (see the [[Siberia (continent)|Siberian continent]]). It is exceptionally rich in minerals, containing large deposits of [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, and ores of [[manganese]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]] and [[molybdenum]]. Much of the area includes the [[Siberian Traps]]—a [[large igneous province]]. This massive eruptive period was approximately coincident with the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]]. The volcanic event is said to be the largest known [[volcanic eruption]] in [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]]. Only the extreme northwest was [[glaciated]] during the [[Quaternary]], but almost all is under exceptionally deep permafrost, and the only [[tree]] that can thrive, despite the warm summers, is the deciduous [[Siberian Larch]] (''Larix sibirica'') with its very shallow roots. Outside the extreme northwest, the [[taiga]] is dominant, covering a significant fraction of the entirety of Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2011.

Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; Soils here are mainly [[Gelisols|turbels]], giving way to [[spodosols]] where the active layer becomes thicker and the ice content lower.

The ''Lena-Tunguska petroleum province'' includes the Central Siberian platform (some authors refer to it as the Eastern Siberian platform), bounded on the northeast and east by the [[Late Carboniferous]] through [[Jurassic]] Verkhoyansk [[foldbelt]], on the northwest by the [[Paleozoic]] Taymr foldbelt, and on the southeast, south and southwest by the Middle [[Silurian]] to [[Middle Devonian]] Baykalian foldbelt.&lt;ref name=Meyerhof&gt;Meyerhof, A.

The climate of Siberia varies dramatically, but it typically has short summers and long, brutally cold winters. On the north coast, north of the [[Arctic Circle]], there is a very short (about one-month-long) summer.

[[File:BaikalForest (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Taiga]] near [[Lake Baikal]]]]

Almost all the population lives in the south, along the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. The climate in this southernmost part is [[Humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dfb'') with cold winters but fairly warm summers lasting at least four months.

By far the most commonly occurring climate in Siberia is continental [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] (Koppen ''Dfc'' or ''Dwc''), with the annual average temperature about {{convert|-5|°C|°F}} and an average for January of {{convert|-25|C}} and an average for July of {{convert|+17|C}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N56E107+1102+30337W |title=Kazachengoye climate |publisher=Worldclimate.com |date=4 February 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this varies considerably, with a July average about {{Convert|10|C}} in the taiga–tundra [[ecotone]]. The Business oriented website and blog ''Business Insider'' lists [[Verkhoyansk]] and [[Oymyakon]], in Siberia's [[Sakha Republic]], as being in competition for the title of the Northern Hemisphere's ''[[Pole of Cold]]''. [[Oymyakon]] is a village which recorded a temperature of {{convert|−67.7|°C|F}} on 6 February 1933. [[Verkhoyansk]], a town further north and further inland, recorded a temperature of {{convert|−69.8|°C|F}} for 3 consecutive nights: 5, 6 and 7 February 1933. Each town is alternately considered the Northern Hemisphere's Pole of Cold, meaning the coldest inhabited point in the Northern hemisphere. Each town also frequently reaches {{convert|86|F}} in the summer, giving them, and much of the rest of Russian Siberia, the world's greatest temperature variation between summer's highs and winter's lows, often being well over {{Convert|170|-|180|F-change|disp=preunit|6=+}} between the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Insider'', February 2014, http://www.businessinsider.com/verkhoyansk-russia-most-miserable-place-2014-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} The rural locality of [[Delyankir]], also in the Sakha Republic, is another candidate for the "Northern Pole of Cold", as its average temperature throughout all winter months is lower than that of either Oymyakon or Verkhoyansk, and it also has a lower yearly average temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/russia/delyankir-climate|title=Delyankir, Russia - Detailed climate information and monthly weather forecast {{!}} Weather Atlas|last=d.o.o.|first=Yu Media Group|website=Weather Atlas|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its record low of −65 °C (−85 °F) is slightly higher than the record lows set at Oymyakon and Verkhoyansk, however.

Southwesterly winds bring warm air from Central Asia and the Middle East. The climate in West Siberia (Omsk, Novosibirsk) is several degrees warmer than in the East (Irkutsk, Chita) where in the north an extreme winter subarctic climate (Köppen ''Dfd'' or ''Dwd'') prevails. But summer temperatures in other regions can reach {{convert|+38|C}}. In general, [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]] is the coldest Siberian region, and the basin of the [[Yana River]] has the lowest temperatures of all, with permafrost reaching {{convert|1493|m|ft}}. Nevertheless, as far as Imperial Russian plans of settlement were concerned, cold was never viewed as an impediment. In the winter, southern Siberia sits near the center of the semi-permanent [[Siberian High]], so winds are usually light in the winter.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] in Siberia is generally low, exceeding {{convert|500|mm}} only in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] where moist winds flow from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] onto high mountains&amp;nbsp;– producing the region's only major [[glacier]]s, though volcanic eruptions and low summer temperatures allow limited forests to grow. Precipitation is high also in most of [[Primorsky Krai|Primorye]] in the extreme south where monsoonal influences can produce quite heavy summer rainfall.

Researchers, including Sergei Kirpotin at [[Tomsk State University]] and Judith Marquand at [[Oxford University]], warn that [[West Siberian Plain|Western Siberia]] has begun to thaw as a result of [[global warming]]. The frozen [[peat bog]]s in this region may hold billions of tons of [[methane gas]], which may be released into the atmosphere.

The term "Siberia" has a long history. Its meaning has gradually changed during ages. Historically, Siberia was defined as the whole part of Russia to the east of [[Ural Mountains]], including the [[Russian Far East]]. According to this definition, Siberia extended eastward from the [[Ural Mountains]] to the Pacific coast, and southward from the Arctic Ocean to the border of Russian [[Central Asia]] and the national borders of both Mongolia and China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713173752/http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/brokminor/article/36/36372.html?text=%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%8C Малый энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона] (The [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]], in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet-era sources (''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' and others)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724201114/http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00070/76500.htm?text=%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%8C Сибирь—Большая советская энциклопедия] (The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; and modern Russian ones&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/geography/article/geo/geo3/geo-4313.htm Сибирь- Словарь современных географических названий]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; usually define Siberia as a region extending eastward from the Ural Mountains to the [[drainage divide|watershed]] between [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] drainage basins, and southward from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central [[Kazakhstan]] and the national borders of both [[Mongolia]] and [[China]]. By this definition, Siberia includes the [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] of the [[Siberian Federal District]], and some of the [[Ural Federal District]], as well as [[Sakha Republic|Sakha (Yakutia) Republic]], which is a part of the [[Far Eastern Federal District]]. Geographically, this definition includes subdivisions of several other subjects of Urals and Far Eastern federal districts, but they are not included administratively. This definition excludes [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] and [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]], both of which are included in some wider definitions of Siberia.

Other sources may use either a somewhat wider definition that states the Pacific coast, not the watershed, is the eastern boundary (thus including the whole Russian Far East)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067598/Siberia |title=Siberia-Britannica online encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a somewhat narrower one that limits Siberia to the Siberian Federal District (thus excluding all subjects of other districts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/si/Siberia.html |title="Siberia" |accessdate=2008-06-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824090623/http://www.bartleby.com/65/si/Siberia.html |archivedate=24 August 2000 |df=dmy-all }}, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; In Russian, the word for Siberia is used as a substitute for the name of the federal district by those who live in the district itself and less commonly used to denote the federal district by people residing outside of it.

=== Major cities ===
The most populous city of Siberia, as well as the third most populous city of Russia, is the city of [[Novosibirsk]]. Other major cities include:

* [[Barnaul]]
* [[Irkutsk]]
* [[Kemerovo]]
* [[Krasnoyarsk]]
* [[Novokuznetsk]]
* [[Omsk]]
* [[Tomsk]]
* [[Tyumen]]

Wider definitions of Siberia also include:

* [[Chelyabinsk]]
* [[Khabarovsk]]
* [[Vladivostok]]
* [[Yekaterinburg]] - Some sources such as [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] include this city as it lies in the [[Ural Mountains]]. Inhabitants have distanced themselves though saying that there is a difference between Siberian and Urals culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/this-russian-city-says-dont-call-us-siberia/2017/01/05/85e9e352-bb2f-11e6-ae79-bec72d34f8c9_story.html|title=This Russian city says: ‘Don’t call us Siberia’|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|author=David Filipov|date=January 5, 2017|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
[[File:RF NG pipestoEU.gif|thumb|Russia is a key [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] supplier to much of Europe. ]]

Siberia is extraordinarily rich in [[mineral]]s, containing ores of almost all economically valuable [[metal]]s. It has some of the world's largest deposits of [[Norilsk#Norilsk-Talnakh nickel deposits|nickel]], [[gold]], [[lead]], [[coal]], [[molybdenum]], [[gypsum]], [[diamond]]s, [[diopside]], [[silver]] and [[zinc]], as well as extensive unexploited resources of [[oil]] and [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/159771/yamal-peninsula-in-western-siberia-development-of-gas-fields/ Statistics on the Development of Gas Fields in Western Siberia], Daily Questions on Energy and Economy&lt;/ref&gt; Around 70% of Russia's developed [[List of oil fields|oil fields]] are in the [[Khanty-Mansiysk]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Simone |last=Schlindwein |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-city-built-on-oil-eu-russia-summit-visits-siberia-s-boomtown-a-562248.html |title=The City Built on Oil: EU-Russia Summit Visits Siberia's Boomtown |publisher=Spiegel |date=August 26, 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia contains about 40% of the world's known resources of [[nickel]] at the [[Norilsk]] deposit in Siberia. [[Norilsk Nickel]] is the world's biggest nickel and [[palladium]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/29/norilsk-russia-output-idUSLDE60S0DU20100129 |title=Norilsk raises 2010 nickel output forecast |publisher=Reuters |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Siberian agriculture]] is severely restricted by the short growing season of most of the region. However, in the southwest where soils are exceedingly fertile black earths and the climate is a little more moderate, there is extensive cropping of [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[rye]] and [[potato]]es, along with the grazing of large numbers of [[sheep]] and [[cattle]]. Elsewhere food production, owing to the poor fertility of the [[podzol]]ic soils and the extremely short growing seasons, is restricted to the herding of [[reindeer]] in the tundra—which has been practiced by natives for over 10,000 years.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Siberia has the world's largest [[forest]]s. Timber remains an important source of revenue, even though many forests in the east have been logged much more rapidly than they are able to recover. The [[Sea of Okhotsk]] is one of the two or three richest fisheries in the world owing to its cold currents and very large [[tide|tidal ranges]], and thus Siberia produces over 10% of the world's annual fish catch, although fishing has declined somewhat since the collapse of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/naso_russiafed/en#tcN700AD|title=FAO &amp;nbsp;National Aquaculture Sector Overview (NASO)|author=|date=16 January 2005|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the development of renewable energy in Russia is held back by the lack of a conducive government policy framework,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Indra_Overland/publication/289325179_Russian_renewable_energy_The_potential_for_international_cooperation/links/5b433c09aca2728a0d65a451/Russian-renewable-energy-The-potential-for-international-cooperation.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=fJROtvVQJaGcTFYuJzrRw5YvRJ6kigQ7JivnE2OehtRLANQN5UY6hfCuKCR6dinnMB_D3ujxLErL1PIDI5HelQ.A13qk_1frVttX8HtCbEnBrEbAxm7nmNYLuAtXa57cd0YKMrMtQprdrDwA20j4-00EHuPWI9IpsTeoGqBbrFhoQ&amp;_sg%5B1%5D=UwM1losY1xmC998Vnnf7Cp9PESfdrYEJ3o8-qKxIFeSRwtMnvae0dRvvReNFkUcpoCX7plJM8Aqq2hjRaHWmHbqV04_RPTuPCE31huwCJSQ2.A13qk_1frVttX8HtCbEnBrEbAxm7nmNYLuAtXa57cd0YKMrMtQprdrDwA20j4-00EHuPWI9IpsTeoGqBbrFhoQ&amp;_iepl=|title=Russian renewable energy: The potential for international cooperation|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Kjaernet|first2=Heidi|publisher=Ashgate|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siberia still offers special opportunities for off-grid renewable energy developments. Remote parts of Siberia are too costly to connect to central electricity and gas grids, and have therefore historically been supplied with costly diesel, sometimes flown in by helicopter. In such cases renewable energy is often cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2011|title=The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693_The_Siberian_Curse_A_Blessing_in_Disguise_for_Renewable_Energy|journal=Sibirica|volume=9(2)|pages=1–20|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Street Scene in Tomsk - Russia.JPG|thumb|[[Tomsk]], one of the oldest Siberian cities, was founded in 1604.]]
According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|Russian Census of 2010]], the [[Siberian Federal District|Siberian]] and [[Far Eastern Federal District|Far Eastern]] Federal Districts, located entirely east of the [[Ural Mountains]], together have a population of about 25.6 million. [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]] and [[Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]] Oblasts, which are geographically in Siberia but administratively part of the [[Urals Federal District]], together have a population of about 4.3 million. Thus, the whole region of Asian Russia (or Siberia in the broadest usage of the term) is home to approximately 30 million people.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol1/pub-01-05.pdf Census 2010 official results (Russian)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GpcVf6ln?url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol1/pub-01-05.pdf |date=23 May 2013 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; It has a population density of about three people per square kilometre.

All Siberians are Russian citizens, and of these Russian citizens of Siberia, most are Slavic-origin [[Russians]] and russified [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainians]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2003/180304.shtml Ukrainians in Russia's Far East try to maintain community life]". ''The Ukrainian Weekly''. May 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining Russian citizens of Siberia consists of other groups of non-indigenous ethnic origins and those of indigenous Siberian origin.

Among the largest non-Slavic group of Russian citizens of Siberia are the approximately 400,000 ethnic [[Volga Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.everyculture.com/Russia-Eurasia-China/Siberian-Germans-Orientation.html |title=Siberian Germans |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original indigenous groups of Siberia, including [[Mongol]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups such as [[Buryats]], [[Tuvinians]], [[Yakuts]], and [[Siberian Tatars]] still mostly reside in Siberia, though they are minorities outnumbered by all other non-indigenous Siberians. Indeed, Slavic-origin Russians by themselves outnumber all of the indigenous peoples combined, both in Siberia as a whole and its cities, except in the Republic of [[Tuva]].

Slavic-origin Russians make up the majority in the Buryat, [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]], and [[Altai Republic]]s, outnumbering the indigenous [[Buryats]], [[Yakuts|Sakha]], and [[Altai people|Altai]]. The Buryat make up only 25% of their own republic, and the Sakha and Altai each are only one-third, and the Chukchi, [[Evenks|Evenk]], [[Khanty people|Khanti]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]], and [[Nenets people|Nenets]] are outnumbered by non-indigenous peoples by 90% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WFjPAxhBEaEC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Batalden 1997], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2002 census there are 500,000 [[Siberian Tatars|Tatars in Siberia]], but of these, 300,000 are [[Volga Tatars]] who also settled in Siberia during periods of colonization and are thus also non-indigenous Siberians, in contrast to the 200,000 Siberian Tatars which are indigenous to Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newasp.omskreg.ru/hist/fotatlas/rezumeen.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2003-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020227012304/http://newasp.omskreg.ru/hist/fotatlas/rezumeen.htm |archivedate=27 February 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the indigenous Siberians, the [[Buryats]], numbering approximately 500,000, are the most numerous group in Siberia, and they are mainly concentrated in their homeland, the [[Buryatia|Buryat Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,49709eae2,49749cc4c,0.html World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Russian Federation: Buryats].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Demographics of Russia#Ethnic groups|2002 census]] there were 443,852 indigenous [[Yakuts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2eff2,49749cb441,0.html World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Russian Federation: Yakuts].&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[ethnic group]]s indigenous to Siberia include [[Ket people|Kets]], [[Evenks]], [[Chukchis]], [[Koryaks]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupiks]], and [[Yukaghirs]].

About seventy percent of Siberia's people live in cities, mainly in apartments. Many people also live in rural areas, in simple, spacious, log houses. [[Novosibirsk]] is the largest city in Siberia, with a population of about 1.5 million. [[Tobolsk]], [[Tomsk]], [[Tyumen]], [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Irkutsk]], and [[Omsk]] are the older, historical centers.

== Transport ==
Many cities in northern Siberia, such as [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]], cannot be reached by road, as there are virtually none connecting from other major cities in Russia or Asia. The best way to tour Siberia is through the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. The Trans-Siberian Railway operates from Moscow in the west to [[Vladivostok]] in the east. Cities that are located far from the railway are best reached by air or by the separate [[Baikal Amur Mainline|Baikal-Amur-Railway]] (BAM).

[[File:Thistleslide.png|thumb|right|The slump that destroyed [[Thistle, Utah]], by creating an earthen dam that flooded the area]]
A '''slump''' is a form of [[mass wasting]] that occurs when a coherent mass of loosely consolidated materials or rock layers moves a short distance down a slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Earth, an introduction to Physical Geology|first=E.J.|last=Tarbuck|first2=F.K.|last2=Lutgens|year=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|edition=6th|isbn=978-0139741227|pages=219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movement is characterized by sliding along a concave-upward or planar surface. Causes of slumping include earthquake shocks, thorough wetting, freezing and thawing, undercutting, and loading of a slope.

Translational slumps occur when a detached landmass moves along a planar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Perilous Earth: Understanding Processes Behind Natural Disasters|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/visualgeology/naturaldisasters/Chapters/Chapter8Landslides.pdf|chapter=Landslides|first=G. H.|last=Girty|year=2009|publisher=Montezuma Publishing|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common planar surfaces of failure include joints or bedding planes, especially where a permeable layer overrides an impermeable surface. Block slumps are a type of translational slump in which one or more related block units move downslope as a relatively coherent mass.

Rotational slumps occur when a slump block, composed of sediment or rock, slides along a concave-upward slip surface with rotation about an axis parallel to the slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Surfaces Processes and Landforms|first=D. J.|last=Easterbrook|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0138609580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotational movement causes the original surface of the block to become less steep, and the top of the slump is rotated backward. This results in internal deformation of the moving mass consisting chiefly of overturned folds called sheath folds.

Slumps have several characteristic features. The cut which forms as the landmass breaks away from the slope is called the [[Escarpment|scarp]] and is often cliff-like and concave. In rotational slumps, the main slump block often breaks into a series of secondary slumps and associated scarps to form stairstep pattern of displaced blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Earthquakes and Seismic Risk in Ohio|url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/geosurvey/tabid/7882/Default.aspx|first=M. C.|last=Hansen|year=2000|publisher=[[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]], Division of Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper surface of the blocks are rotated backwards, forming depressions which may accumulate water to create ponds or swampy areas. The surface of the detached mass often remains relatively undisturbed, especially at the top. However, hummocky ridges may form near the toe of the slump. Addition of water and loss of sediment cohesion at the toe may transform slumping material into an [[earthflow]].  Transverse cracks at the head scarp drain water, possibly killing vegetation. Transverse ridges, transverse cracks and radial cracks form in displaced material on the foot of the slump.

[[File:Mupe Bay cliffs.jpg|thumb|left|Slumped [[chalk]] slopes at [[Mupe Bay]] in Dorset, England]]

Slumps frequently form due to removal of a slope base, either from natural or manmade processes. Stream or wave erosion, as well as road construction are common instigators for slumping. It is the removal of the slope's physical support which provokes this mass wasting event. Thorough wetting is a common cause, which explains why slumping is often associated with heavy rainfall, storm events and earthflows. Rain provides lubrication for the material to slide, and increases the self-mass of the material. Both factors increase the rate of slumping. Earthquakes also trigger massive slumps, such as the fatal slumps of Turnagain Heights Subdivision in Anchorage, Alaska. This particular slump was initiated by a magnitude 8.4 earthquake that resulted in liquefaction of the soil. Around 75 houses were destroyed by the Turnagain Slump. Power lines, fences, roads, houses, and other manmade structures may be damaged if in the path of a slump.

The speed of slump varies widely, ranging from meters per second, to meters per year. Sudden slumps usually occur after earthquakes or heavy continuing rains, and can stabilize within a few hours. Most slumps develop over comparatively longer periods, taking months or years to reach stability.  An example of a slow-moving slump is the [[Swift Creek Landslide]], a deep-seated rotational slump located on [[Sumas Mountain]], Washington.

Slumps may also occur underwater along the margins of continents and islands, resulting from tidal action or a large seismic event. These submarine slumps can generate disastrous [[tsunami]]s. The underwater terrain which encompasses the [[Hawaiian Islands]] gains its unusual hummocky [[topography]] from the many slumps that have taken place for millions of years.

One of the largest known slumps occurred on the south-eastern edge of the [[Agulhas Bank]] south of Africa in the Pliocene or more recently.  This so-called Agulhas Slump is {{Convert|750|km|abbr=on}} long, {{Convert|106|km|abbr=on}} wide, and has a volume of {{Convert|20000|km3|abbr=on}}.  It is a composite slump with proximal and distal [[allochthon]]ous sediment masses separated by a large glide plane scar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Uenzelmann-Neben | first1 = G.| last2 = Huhn | first2 = K.| title = Sedimentary deposits on the southern South African continental margin: Slumping versus non-deposition or erosion by oceanic currents?| year = 2009 | journal = Marine Geology | volume = 266 | pages = 65–79| doi = 10.1016/j.margeo.2009.07.011}}&lt;!-- pp=66, 76 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southern Ural''' - the south, the widest part of the [[Ural Mountains]], stretches from the river Ufa (near the village of Lower [[Ufaley]]) to the [[Ural River]]. From the west and east of the Southern Ural is limited to the [[East European]], [[West Siberian Plain]] and the steppes near [[Aral Sea]] and [[Caspian sea]].

[[File:40821335 YAmantau.jpg|thumb|Mount [[Yamantau]]]]
The highest peak - Mount [[Yamantau]] - 1640 m. Due to the wide abutting the foothills of the Southern Ural extends up to 250&amp;nbsp;km with an average width of the Ural Mountains from 40 to 150&amp;nbsp;km.

The length of the Southern Ural - 550&amp;nbsp;km.

The relief of the Southern Ural is more complex, with numerous valleys and parallel ridges directed south-west and meridionally.  The range includes the [[Ilmensky Mountains]] separated from the main ridges by the [[Miass River]]. The maximum height is {{convert|1640|m|ft|abbr=on}} ([[Mount Yamantau]]) and the width reaches {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Other notable peaks lie along the [[Iremel]] mountain ridge (Bolshoy Iremel and Maly Iremel). The Southern Urals extend some {{convert|550|km|mi|abbr=on}} up to the sharp westward bend of the Ural River and terminate in the wide [[Mughalzhar Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;Ural Mountains, Encyclopædia Britannica on-line&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SpiralIsland2000.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Spiral Island I in early March 2000]]

'''Spiral Island''' is the name of a [[floating island|floating]] [[artificial island]] built in [[Mexico]] by British artist Richart "Reishee" Sowa. It was destroyed by [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] in 2005; a replacement, Joyxee Island, has been open for tours since 2008.

Spiral Island has been featured in a number of [[newspaper]]s and TV [[Documentary film|documentaries]] around the world, including in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], and has been featured in an episode of the ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' TV series, and on the MTV program Extreme Cribs in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-of-recycled-plastic-bottle-eco-art-is |title=Grand Launch of Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiral Island==
The first Spiral island was located in a [[lagoon]] near [[Puerto Aventuras]], on the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Mexico]] south of [[Cancún]]; Richart Sowa began constructing it in 1998.  He filled nets with empty discarded plastic bottles to support a structure of [[plywood]] and [[bamboo]], on which he poured sand and planted numerous plants, including [[mangrove]]s. The island sported a two-story house, a [[solar oven]], a self-[[composting toilet]], and three beaches. He used some 250,000 bottles for the {{convert|66|x|54|ft|m|adj=on}} structure. 

Sowa was ordered to take the island out of the man-made canal in 2004 because many private homes and condos were being built and he lived for one year tied to the end of a loose rock pier. Richart was offered a new location in the bay of Soliman about 200 km south, Finally, he was permitted by Port authorities to tow Spiral Island but the island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005. &lt;ref&gt;[http://greentravelife.com/richart-sowa-a-green-island-made-of-plasti-bottles/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joyxee Island==
In late 2007 and 2008, Sowa built a replacement for Spiral Island in the waters of [[Isla Mujeres]], the "Island of Women", also near Cancun. It opened for tours in August 2008. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-recycled-plastic-bottle-ecological-ar |title=Birthing of Floating Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new island was initially {{convert|20|m|ft}} in diameter and contained about 100,000 bottles. It has since expanded to 25 metres (82 ft) due to various plants and mangroves growing from the island.  The new island has three beaches, a house, two ponds, a wave-powered washing machine, solar panels, a solar-powered waterfall and river. The island is a constant work in progress with volunteers and Sowa himself continually making improvements.

In May 2011, Reishee embarked on a project to berth his island out in Isla Mujeres Bay, as it was now too big for its current site off a pier in Laguna Majax. The Mexican Government also recognized Joyxee Island as an "Eco Boat" and therefore needed to comply with all current boating regulations, which involved the purchase of fire extinguishers, life ring buoys and emergency kits. The project was launched on kickstarter.com with a goal of $18,000 that it failed to reach. Reishee later successfully relaunched the project with a more conservative $9,000 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-of-recycled-plastic-bottle-eco-art-is |title=Grand Launch of Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">The [[Swiss Confederation]] comprises the 26 [[cantons of Switzerland]].

Each canton has its individual structure for further subdivisions.

==Regions==
{{main|NUTS of Switzerland}}
For statistical purposes, Switzerland is subdivided into seven regions at the [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]]-2 level:
{|
| [[Eastern Switzerland]]: || Cantons of [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Thurgau]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], [[Graubünden]]
|-
| [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]]: || Canton of [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]]
|-
| [[Central Switzerland]]: || Cantons of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Obwalden]], [[Nidwalden]], [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Canton of Zug|Zug]]
|-
| [[Northwestern Switzerland]]: || Cantons of [[Basel-Stadt]], [[Basel-Landschaft]], [[Aargau]]
|-
| [[Espace Mittelland]]: || Cantons of [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], [[Canton of Neuchatel|Neuchatel]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]]
|-
| [[Région lémanique]]: || Cantons of [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Vaud]], [[Valais]]
|-
| [[Ticino]]: || Canton of [[Ticino]]
|}

==Cantons==
{{main|Cantons of Switzerland}}
{{Switzerland Cantons Labelled Map|float=right}}
The 26 [[cantons of Switzerland]] are the [[State (administrative division)|member state]]s of the [[federation|federal state]] of [[Switzerland]]. Each [[canton (administrative division)|canton]] was a fully [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|26414&lt;!--Section 1-1--&gt;|Cantons, In the Old Confederation until 1798}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its own borders, army and currency from the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] (1648) until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848.

Each canton has its own [[constitution]], [[legislature]], [[government]] and [[court]]s.&lt;ref name="HDS Modern"&gt;{{HDS|26414&lt;!--Section 1-4--&gt;|Cantons, In the Federal State since 1848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the cantons' legislatures are [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[parliament]]s, their size varying between fifty-eight and two hundred seats. A few legislatures are general assemblies known as ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n''. The cantonal governments consist of either five or seven members, depending on the canton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ch.ch/karte/index.html?lang=en Swiss Government website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219135444/http://www.ch.ch/karte/index.html?lang=en |date=2008-12-19 }} with links to each cantonal government, accessed 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For the names of the institutions, see [[List of legislative and executive councils of the Cantons of Switzerland]].

The [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] declares the cantons to be sovereign to the extent their sovereignty is not limited by federal law.&lt;ref name="HDS Modern"/&gt; The cantons also retain all powers and competencies not delegated to the Confederation by the Constitution. Most significantly, the cantons are responsible for [[health care|healthcare]], [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], law enforcement and [[public education]]; they also retain the power of [[tax]]ation. The cantonal constitutions determine the degree of autonomy accorded to the [[municipality|municipalities]], which varies but almost always includes the power to levy taxes and pass municipal laws. The sizes of the cantons vary from 37&amp;nbsp;km² to 7,105&amp;nbsp;km²; the populations vary from 15,471 to 1,244,400.

==Districts==
{{main|Districts of Switzerland}}
In contrast to centrally organised states, in the federally constituted [[Switzerland]] each [[Cantons of Switzerland|Canton]] is
completely free to decide its own internal organisation. Therefore, there exists a variety of structures and terminology for the [[subnational entities]] between Canton and [[Municipalities of Switzerland|Municipality]], loosely termed [[district]]s (i.e. Urban Administration Districts).

Most Cantons are divided into ''Bezirke'' (German for districts). They are also termed ''Ämter'' ([[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]), ''Amtsbezirke'' ([[Canton of Bern|Bern]]), ''district'' (in French) or ''distretto'' ([[Ticino]] and part of [[Canton of Graubünden|Graubünden]]). The Bezirke generally provide only administration and court organization. However, for historical reasons districts in cantons Graubünden and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] are their own [[Juristic person|legal entities]] with jurisdiction over tax and often have their own [[Landsgemeinde]].

Eight of the 26 Cantons – [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Obwalden|Obwalden]], [[Canton of Nidwalden|Nidwalden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]],  [[Basel-City]] and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] – have always existed without the district level of government.
 
A number of further cantons have dispensed with the district level recently,  [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] in 1995, [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]]  in 1999, [[Canton of St Gallen|St Gallen]] in 2003 and [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] in 2007.

A number of further cantons are considering (or have already decided) an abolition of the district level in the future: [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] in 2006 voted on its abolition, but voted in favour of keeping the division. [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] in 2006 decided a reduction of its 26 districts to five administrative regions.
[[Vaud]] decided a reduction from 19 to 10 districts. [[Valais]] is planning a similar reduction and in [[Thurgau]], a reduction of eight to four districts is under discussion.

==Municipalities==
{{main|Municipalities of Switzerland}}
Communes ({{lang-de|Gemeinden}} / {{lang-fr|communes}} / {{lang-it|comuni}} / {{lang-rm|vischnancas}}), also known as municipalities, are the smallest government division in [[Switzerland]], numbering 2,636 as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Official list of Swiss municipalities, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; While many have a population of a few hundred citizens, the largest cities such as [[Zürich]] or [[Geneva]] also have the legal status of municipalities. The [[area]] of the municipalities varies between [[1 E5 m²|0.32 km²]] ([[Kaiserstuhl, Aargau|Kaiserstuhl]], [[Aargau]] and [[Rivaz]], [[Vaud]]) and [[1 E8 m²|439 km²]] ([[Scuol]], [[Graubünden]]).

Each canton defines their responsibilities. These may include providing local government services such as education, medical and social services, public transportation, and tax collection. The degree of centralization varies from one canton to another.

Communes are generally governed by a council (sometimes called Municipality) headed by a [[mayor]] as [[executive (government)|executive]] and the [[town meeting]] as [[legislature]]. Most cantons leave the option to larger municipalities to opt for a city [[parliament]]. In some cantons, foreign persons that have dwelled for a certain time in Switzerland are also allowed to participate in the municipal politics.

[[Swiss citizenship]] is based on the citizenship of a municipality. Every Swiss is citizen of one or several municipalities (i.e. the place of origin, ''lieu d'origine'', ''Heimatort'').

Communes are financed through direct taxes (e.g. [[income tax]]), with rates varying more or less within a framework set by the canton.

Many municipalities are having difficulties maintaining the civil services they need to perform the duties they are required to do. In an effort to reduce expenses, many municipalities are combining together (through mergers or the creation of [[special-purpose district]]s). This restructuring is generally encouraged by the cantonal governments and the rate of these unions is increasing&lt;!-- ? --&gt;.

"Cities" (''villes'' or ''Städte'') are the municipalities with more than 10'000 inhabitants or smaller places which had medieval town rights. There is no specific designation for smaller communities such as "village" or "town".

==Other subdivisions==
Some subdivisions that exist are:
* Region
** {{lang-de|Verwaltungsregionen}} (e.g. [[Subdivisions of the canton of Bern]])
* Electoral district
** {{lang-de|Amtei}} (e.g. [[Subdivisions of the canton of Solothurn]])
* Constituencies
** {{lang-de|Wahlkreis}} (e.g. [[Subdivisions of the canton of St. Gallen]])
* Sub-district or [[Circle (country subdivision)|circle]]
** {{lang-de|[[Circle (country subdivision)|Kreis]]}} (e.g. Graubünden)
** {{lang-it|[[Circolo]]}} (e.g. Ticino)
** {{lang-fr|[[circle (country subdivision)|Cercle]]}} (e.g. [[Subdivisions of the canton of Vaud]])

The '''Sundarbans''' is a [[mangrove]] area in the [[Delta (river)|delta]] formed by the confluence of [[Ganges]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Meghna River]]s in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. It spans from the [[Hooghly River]] in [[India]]'s state of [[West Bengal]] to the [[Baleswar River]] in [[Bangladesh]]. It comprises closed and open mangrove forests, agriculturally used land, [[mudflat]]s and barren land, and is intersected by multiple [[tidal]] streams and channels. Four protected areas in the Sundarbans are enlisted as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s, viz [[Sundarbans National Park]], [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans West]], [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans South]] and [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans East]] Wildlife Sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Giri, C., Pengra, B., Zhu, Z., Singh, A. and Tieszen, L.

The Sundarbans mangrove forest covers an area of about {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. In West Bengal, they extend over {{convert|4260|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} across the [[South 24 Parganas]] and [[North 24 Parganas district]]s.&lt;ref name=Pani_al2013&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pani, D.

The most abundant [[tree]] species are Sundri (''[[Heritiera fomes]]'') and Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]''). The forests provide habitat to 453 [[fauna]]l wildlife, including 290 bird, 120 fish, 42 mammal, 35 reptile and eight amphibian species.&lt;ref name=Iftekhar2004&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Iftekhar, M.

The name 'Sundarbans' {{Lang-bn|সুন্দর বন}} {{transl|bn|[[Romanisation of Bengali#Romanisation reference|''Shundorbôn'']]}} {{IPA-bn|ˈʃundorbɔn||}} means 'beautiful forest'.&lt;ref name=sundar&gt;{{cite book |author=Biswas, S. |year=2000 |title=Samsad Bengali-English dictionary |chapter=সুন্দর |location=Calcutta |publisher=Sahitya Samsad |page=1017 |chapterurl=https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/biswas-bengali_query.py?qs=%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%B0&amp;searchhws=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ban&gt;{{cite book |author=Biswas, S. |year=2000 |title=Samsad Bengali-English dictionary |chapter=বন |location=Calcutta |publisher=Sahitya Samsad |page=717 |chapterurl=https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/biswas-bengali_query.py?qs=%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%A8&amp;searchhws=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a total ban on all killing or capture of wildlife other than fish and some invertebrates, it appears that there is a consistent pattern of depleted biodiversity or loss of species in the 20th century, and that the ecological quality of the forest is declining.{{cn|date=November 2018}}
The Directorate of Forest is responsible for the administration and management of Sundarban National Park in West Bengal. In Bangladesh, a new Forest Circle was created in 1993 to preserve the forest, and Chief Conservators of Forests have been posted since. Despite preservation commitments from both Governments, the Sunderbans are under threat from both natural and human-made causes. In 2007, the landfall of [[Cyclone Sidr]] damaged around 40% of the Sundarbans. The forest is also suffering from increased [[salinity]] due to rising sea levels and reduced freshwater supply. The proposed coal-fired [[Rampal Power Station (Proposed)|Rampal power station]] situated {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the Sundarbans at Rampal Upazila of Bagerhat District in Khulna, Bangladesh is anticipated to further damage this unique mangrove forest according to a 2016 report by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/environment/news/122299/Unesco-calls-for-shelving-Rampal-project |title=Unesco calls for shelving Rampal project |author=Iftekhar Mahmud |journal=Prothom Alo |date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Etymology==
The [[Bengali language|Bengali]] name 'Sundarban' means 'beautiful forest'.&lt;ref name=sundar/&gt;&lt;ref name=ban/&gt; It may have been derived from the word 'Sundari', the local name of the mangrove species ''Heritiera fomes''. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the name is a corruption of ''Samudraban'', ''Shomudrobôn'' ("Sea Forest"), or ''Chandra-bandhe'' (name of a primitive tribe). However, the generally accepted view is the one associated with ''Sundari'' or ''Sundri'' trees.&lt;ref name="Bpedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |last=Siddiqui |first=N.

The history of the area can be traced back to 200–300 AD. A ruin of a city built by [[Chand Sadagar]] has been found in the Baghmara Forest Block. During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] period, the Mughal Kings leased the forests of the Sundarbans to nearby residents. Many criminals took refuge in the Sundarbans from the advancing armies of Emperor [[Akbar]]. Many have been known to be attacked by tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sunderban Mangroves |publisher=Geological Survey of India |url=http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/portal/page?_pageid=127,723772&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;linkId=1213 |accessdate=21 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210224353/http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/portal/page?_pageid=127,723772&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;linkId=1213 |archivedate=10 December 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the buildings which were built by them later fell to hands of Portuguese pirates, salt smugglers and [[Dacoity|dacoits]] in the 17th century.

The area was mapped first in Persian, by the [[Surveyor General]] as early as 1764 following soon after proprietary rights were obtained from the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Alamgir II]] by the British [[East India Company]] in 1757. Systematic management of this forest tract started in the 1860s after the establishment of a Forest Department in the Province of [[Bengal]], in [[British India]]. The management was entirely designed to extract whatever treasures were available, but labour and lower management mostly were staffed by locals, as the British had no expertise or adaptation experience in mangrove forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laskar Muqsudur |first=Rahman |title=The Sundarbans: A Unique Wilderness of the World |website=Wilderness.net |format=PDF |url=http://www.wilderness.net/library/documents/Rahman_2-18.pdf |accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Forest Management Division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as [[Nature reserve|reserved]] forests under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department. A Forest Division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in [[Khulna]], Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893–98.&lt;ref name=hussain&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Hussain |editor-first1=Z. |editor-last2=Acharya |editor-first2=G. |date=1994 |title=Mangroves of the Sundarbans |volume=Volume 2, Bangladesh |location=Bangkok |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |oclc=773534471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNDP (1998).

In 1911, it was described as a tract of waste country which had never been surveyed nor had the census been extended to it. It then stretched for about {{convert|165|mi|km|order=flip}} from the mouth of the [[Hooghly River]] to the mouth of the [[Meghna]] river and was bordered inland by the three settled districts of the [[24 Parganas]], Khulna and [[Bakerganj District|Bakerganj]]. The total area (including water) was estimated at {{convert|6526|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}. It was a water-logged jungle, in which tigers and other wild beasts abounded. Attempts at reclamation had not been very successful. The Sundarbans were intersected by river channels and creeks, some of which afforded water communication throughout the Bengal region both for [[steamboat]]s and ships.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
The Sundarban forest lies in the vast delta on the [[Bay of Bengal]] formed by the super confluence of the [[Ganges]], [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]], [[Padma]], [[Brahmaputra]] and [[Meghna]] rivers across southern [[Bangladesh]]. The seasonally flooded [[Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests]] lie inland from the mangrove forests on the coastal fringe. The forest covers {{convert|10000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of which about {{convert|6,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} are in Bangladesh. It became inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[world heritage]] site in 1997. The Indian part of Sundarbans is estimated to be about {{convert|4,110|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, of which about {{convert|1700|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} is occupied by waterbodies in the forms of river, canals and creeks of width varying from a few metres to several kilometres.

The Sundarbans is intersected by a complex network of [[tide|tidal]] waterways, [[mudflat]]s and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The interconnected network of waterways makes almost every corner of the forest accessible by boat. The area is known for the [[Bengal tiger]] (''Panthera tigris tigris''), as well as numerous fauna including species of birds, [[chital|spotted deer]], [[crocodile]]s and snakes. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, taken together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around [[Khulna]] and [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] against the floods that result from the [[cyclone]]s. The Sundarbans has also been enlisted among the finalists in the [[New7Wonders of Nature]].

The mangrove-dominated [[Ganges Delta]] – the Sundarbans – is a complex [[ecosystem]] comprising one of the three largest single tracts of mangrove forests of the world. Larger part is situated in Bangladesh, a smaller portion of it lies in India. The Indian part of the forest is estimated to be about 40 percent, while the Bangladeshi part is 60 percent. To the south the forest meets the Bay of Bengal; to the east it is bordered by the [[Baleswar River]] and to the north there is a sharp interface with intensively cultivated land. The natural drainage in the upstream areas, other than the main river channels, is everywhere impeded by extensive embankments and [[polder]]s. The Sundarbans was originally measured (about 200 years ago) to be of about {{convert|16700|km2|mi2}}. Now it has dwindled into about 1/3 of the original size. The total land area today is {{convert|4143|km2|mi2}}, including exposed [[sandbar]]s with a total area of {{convert|42|km2|mi2}}; the remaining water area of {{convert|1874|km2|mi2}} encompasses rivers, small streams and canals. Rivers in the Sundarbans are meeting places of salt water and freshwater. Thus, it is a region of transition between the freshwater of the rivers originating from the Ganges and the saline water of the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref name=Wahid/&gt;

The Sundarbans along the Bay of Bengal has evolved over the millennia through natural deposition of upstream sediments accompanied by intertidal segregation. The physiography is dominated by deltaic formations that include innumerable drainage lines associated with surface and subaqueous levees, splays and tidal flats. There are also marginal marshes above mean tide level, tidal sandbars and islands with their networks of tidal channels, subaqueous distal bars and proto-delta clays and silt sediments. The Sundarbans' floor varies from {{convert|0.9|to|2.11|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Katebi, M.N.A. and Habib, M.G. (1987). Sundarbans and Forestry in Coastal Area Resource Development and Management Part II, BRAC Printers, Dhaka, Bangladesh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotic factors here play a significant role in physical coastal evolution, and for [[wildlife]] a variety of [[habitat]]s have developed which include beaches, estuaries, permanent and semi-permanent swamps, tidal flats, [[tidal creek]]s, coastal dunes, back dunes and levees. The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays a significant role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop [[micromorphological]] features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the [[Aeolian processes|eolian]] dunes is controlled by an abundance of [[xerophytic]] and [[halophytic]] plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=Ari |date=20 May 2016 |title=Rising Tides Force Thousands To Leave Islands Of Eastern India |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/05/20/478915685/rising-tides-force-thousands-to-leave-islands-of-eastern-india |work=NPR |access-date=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves.

==Ecoregions==
Sundarbans features two [[ecoregion]]s — "Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests" (IM0162) and "Sundarbans mangroves" (IM1406).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.certisource.co.uk/Press_Articles/Article_Archive/articles/Ecoregions%20profile%20-%20pick%20from%20over%20100%20rain%20forests.htm Ecoregions: Indo-Malayan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628180622/http://www.certisource.co.uk/Press_Articles/Article_Archive/articles/Ecoregions%20profile%20-%20pick%20from%20over%20100%20rain%20forests.htm |date=28 June 2009 }}, [[World Wildlife Fund]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests===
The Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] ecoregion of Bangladesh. It represents the brackish swamp forests that lie behind the ''Sundarbans Mangroves'', where the salinity is more pronounced. The freshwater ecoregion is an area where the water is only slightly brackish and becomes quite fresh during the rainy season, when the freshwater plumes from the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers push the intruding salt water out and bring a deposit of silt.
It covers {{convert|14600|km2|sqmi}} of the vast [[Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta]], extending from the northern part of [[Khulna District]] and finishing at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal with scattered portions extending into India's [[West Bengal]] state. The Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests lie between the upland [[Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests]] and the [[brackish]]-water [[Sundarbans mangroves]] bordering the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref name=IM0162&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0162|name=Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A victim of large-scale clearing and settlement to support one of the densest human populations in Asia, this ecoregion is under a great threat of extinction. Hundreds of years of habitation and exploitation have exacted a heavy toll on this ecoregion's habitat and biodiversity. There are two protected areas – Narendrapur (110&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and Ata Danga Baor (20&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) that cover a mere 130&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the ecoregion. Habitat loss in this ecoregion is so extensive, and the remaining habitat is so fragmented, that it is difficult to ascertain the composition of the original vegetation of this ecoregion. According to Champion and Seth (1968), the freshwater swamp forests are characterised by ''Heritiera minor'', ''Xylocarpus molluccensis'', ''Bruguiera conjugata'', ''Sonneratia apetala'', ''[[Avicennia officinalis]]'', and ''[[Sonneratia caseolaris]]'', with ''[[Pandanus tectorius]]'', ''[[Hibiscus tiliaceus]]'', and ''[[Nipa fruticans]]'' along the fringing banks.&lt;ref name=IM0162/&gt;

===Sundarbans Mangroves===
{{See also|Mangrove}}
The Sundarbans Mangroves ecoregion on the coast forms the seaward fringe of the [[river delta|delta]] and is the world's largest mangrove ecosystem, with {{convert|20400|km2|sqmi}} of an area covered. The dominant mangrove species ''[[Heritiera fomes]]'' is locally known as ''sundri'' or ''sundari''. Mangrove forests are not home to a great variety of plants. They have a thick canopy, and the undergrowth is mostly seedlings of the mangrove trees. Besides the ''sundari'', other tree species in the forest include ''[[Avicennia]]'', ''[[Xylocarpus mekongensis]]'', ''[[Xylocarpus granatum]]'', ''[[Sonneratia apetala]]'', ''[[Bruguiera gymnorhiza]]'', ''[[Ceriops decandra]]'', ''[[Aegiceras corniculatum]]'', ''[[Rhizophora mucronata]]'', and ''[[Nypa fruticans]]'' palms.&lt;ref name=IM1406&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im1406|name=Sundarbans Mangroves}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Twenty-six of the fifty broad mangrove species found in the world grow well in the Sundarbans. The commonly identifiable vegetation types in the dense Sundarbans mangrove forests are salt water mixed forest, mangrove scrub, brackish water mixed forest, littoral forest, wet forest and wet alluvial grass forests. The Bangladesh mangrove vegetation of the Sundarbans differs greatly from other non-deltaic coastal mangrove forests and upland forests associations. Unlike the former, the [[Rhizophoraceae]] are of minor importance.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Ecological succession===
[[Ecological succession]] is generally defined as the successive occupation of a site by different plant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weaver |first1=J. E. |last2=Clements |first2=F. E. |date=1938 |title=Plant Ecology |edition=2nd |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |oclc=502944133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an accreting mudflats the outer community along the sequence represents the pioneer community which is gradually replaced by the next community representing the seral stages and finally by a climax community typical of the climatic zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=J.G. |year= 1928 |title=Mangrove swamps of the Malayan peninsula |journal=Malayan Forest Records |volume=6 |pages=1–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Scott Troup]] suggested that succession began in the newly accreted land created by fresh deposits of eroded soil. The pioneer vegetation on these newly accreted sites is ''[[Sonneratia]]'', followed by ''[[Avicennia]]'' and ''[[Nypa fruticans|Nypa]]''. As the ground is elevated as a result of soil deposition, other trees make their appearance. The most prevalent, though one of the late species to appear, is ''[[Excoecaria]]''. As the level of land rises through accretion and the land is only occasionally flooded by tides, ''[[Heritiera fomes]]'' begins to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Troup |first=R. S. |author-link=Robert Scott Troup |date=1921 |title=The Silviculture of Indian Trees |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISPxAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA155 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=155 |quote=On newly formed islands, flooded by every tide, ''Sonneratia'' usually springs up first, followed by ''Avicennia'' and the palm ''Nipa fruticans''. As the ground rises other trees make their appearance, the most prevalent, though one of the later species to appear, being ''Exaecaria Agallocha''. As the level rises by accretion, and the land is only occasionally flooded by the tide, the ''sundri'' makes its appearance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total 245 genera and 334 plant species were recorded by [[David Prain]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prain |first=David |author-link=David Prain |date=1903 |chapter=Flora of the Sundribuns |title=Records of the Botanical Survey of India |volume=Volume II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=pa251 |location=Calcutta |publisher=Allied Book Centre |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the mangroves in other parts of the world are characterised by members of the [[Rhizophoraceae]], Avicenneaceae or [[Combretaceae]], the mangroves of Bangladesh are dominated by the [[Malvaceae]] and [[Euphorbiaceae]].&lt;ref name=hussain/&gt;

The Sundarbans flora is characterised by the abundance of sundari (''[[Heritiera fomes]]''), gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]''), goran (''Ceriops decandra'') and keora (''Sonneratia apetala'') all of which occur prominently throughout the area. The characteristic tree of the forest is the ''sundari'' (''[[Heritiera littoralis]]''), from which the name of the forest had probably been derived. It yields a hard wood, used for building houses and making boats, furniture and other things. New forest accretions is often conspicuously dominated by keora (''Sonneratia apetala'') and tidal forests. It is an indicator species for newly accreted mudbanks and is an important species for wildlife, especially spotted deer (''[[Axis axis]]''). There is abundance of dhundul or passur (''[[Xylocarpus granatum]]'') and kankra (''[[Bruguiera gymnorhiza]]'') though distribution is discontinuous. Among palms, ''Poresia coaractata'', ''Myriostachya wightiana'' and golpata (''[[Nypa fruticans]]''), and among grasses spear grass (''[[Imperata cylindrica]]'') and khagra (''Phragmites karka'') are well distributed.

The varieties of the forests that exist in Sundarbans include mangrove scrub, [[Littoral zone|littoral forest]], [[saline water|saltwater]] [[mixed forest]], [[brackish water]] mixed forest and [[swamp forest]]. Besides the forest, there are extensive areas of brackish water and [[freshwater]] [[marshes]], [[intertidal]] [[mudflat]]s, [[sandflat]]s, [[sand dune]]s with typical dune vegetation, open [[grassland]] on sandy soils and raised areas supporting a variety of terrestrial shrubs and trees. Since Prain's report there have been considerable changes in the status of various mangrove species and taxonomic revision of the man-grove flora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khatun |first1=B.M.R. |last2=Hafiz |first2=Syed |date=1987 |title=Taxonomic studies in the genus ''Avicennia'' L. from Bangladesh |journal=Bangladesh J. Bot. |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, very little exploration of the botanical nature of the Sundarbans has been made to keep up with these changes. Differences in vegetation have been explained in terms of freshwater and low salinity influences in the Northeast and variations in [[Drainage basin|drainage]] and [[siltation]]. The Sundarbans has been classified as a moist tropical forest demonstrating a whole mosaic of [[Seral community|seres]], comprising primary colonisation on new [[Accretion (coastal management)|accretions]] to more mature beach forests. Historically vegetation types have been recognised in broad correlation with varying degrees of water salinity, freshwater flushing and physiography.

The Sundarbans provides a unique ecosystem and a rich wildlife habitat. According to the 2015 tiger census in Bangladesh, and the 2011 tiger census in India, the Sundarbans have about 180 tigers (106 in Bangladesh and 74 in India). Earlier estimates, based on counting unique [[pugmark]]s, were much higher. The more recent counts have used [[camera trap]]s, an improved methodology that yields more accurate results.&lt;ref name="tg27Jul2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Only 100 tigers left in Bangladesh's famed Sundarbans forest |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/27/only-100-tigers-left-in-bangladeshs-famed-sundarbans-forest |newspaper=The Guardian |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=India wild tiger census shows population rise|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12877560|work=BBC News|date=28 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bforest.gov.bd/highlights.php |title=Joint Tiger census-2004 in Sundarban Reserved Forests |website=Bangladesh Forest Department |publisher=Ministry of Environment and Forest |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207075333/http://www.bforest.gov.bd/highlights.php |archive-date=7 December 2004 |access-date=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger attacks are frequent in the Sundarbans. Between 0 and 50 people are killed each year.

There is much more wildlife here than just the endangered [[Bengal tiger]] (''Panthera tigris tigris''). Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as [[pneumatophore]]s, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. [[Fishing cat]]s, [[macaque]]s, [[wild boar]]s, common grey mongooses, foxes, [[jungle cat]]s, [[flying fox]]es, [[pangolin]]s, and [[spotted deer]] are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans.

A 1991 study has revealed that the Indian part of the Sundarbans supports diverse biological resources including at least 150 species of commercially important fish, 270 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 35 reptiles and 8 amphibian species, although new ones are being discovered. This represents a significant proportion of the species present in Bangladesh (i.e. about 30% of the reptiles, 37% the birds and 34% of the mammals) and includes many species which are now extinct elsewhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=D.

The management of wildlife is restricted to, firstly, the protection of fauna from poaching, and, secondly, designation of some areas as wildlife sanctuaries where no extraction of [[forest produce]] is allowed and where the wildlife face few disturbances. Although the fauna of Bangladesh have diminished in recent times&lt;ref name=hussain/&gt; and the Sundarbans has not been spared from this decline, the mangrove forest retains several good wildlife habitats and their associated fauna. Of these, the tiger and dolphin are target species for planning wildlife management and tourism development. There are high profile and vulnerable mammals living in two contrasting environments, and their statuses and management are strong indicators of the general condition and management of wildlife. Some species are protected by legislation, notably by the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024639/http://www.nishorgo.org/nishorgo/wildlife_Act/Amended_Wildlife_Order_Eng.pdf THE ORIGINAL BANGLADESH WILDLIFE PRESERVATION ORDER 1973 THE DRAFT]. nishorgo.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammals===
The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitats for the [[Bengal tiger]] (''Panthera tigris tigris'').&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;Khan, M. M. H. (2004). [http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/thesis/khan_2004_phd.pdf ''Ecology and conservation of the Bengal tiger in the Sundarbans Mangrove forest of Bangladesh'']. PhD thesis, University of Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; The forest also provides habitat for small wild cats such as the [[jungle cat]] (''Felis chaus''), [[fishing cat]] (''Prionailurus viverrinus''), and [[leopard cat]] (''P. bengalensis'').&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M.

Several predators dwell in the labyrinth of channels, branches and roots that poke up into the air. This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the [[chital]] deer (''Axis axis''), [[Indian muntjac]]s (''Muntiacus muntjak''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), and [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''). It is estimated that there are now 180 Bengal tigers&lt;ref name="tg27Jul2015" /&gt; and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30–100 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite iucn |author1=Goodrich, J. |author2=Lynam, A. |author3=Miquelle, D. |author4=Wibisono, H. |author5=Kawanishi, K. |author6=Pattanavibool, A. |author7=Htun, S. |author8=Tempa, T. |author9=Karki, J. |author10=Jhala, Y. &amp; Karanth, U. |title=''Panthera tigris'' |journal=[[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] |volume=2015 |page=e.T15955A50659951 |publisher=[[IUCN]] |date=2015 |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15955/50659951 |doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2015-2.RLTS.T15955A50659951.en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest inventories reveal a decline in standing volume of the two main commercial mangrove species – sundari (''[[Heritiera]]'' spp.) and [[Euphorbiaceae|gewa]] (''Excoecaria agallocha'') — by 40% and 45% respectively between 1959 and 1983.&lt;ref name=Forestal/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODA/&gt; Despite a total ban on all killing or capture of wildlife other than fish and some [[invertebrates]], it appears that there is a consistent pattern of depleted biodiversity or loss of species (notably at least six mammals and one important reptile) in the 20th century, and that the "ecological quality of the original mangrove forest is declining".&lt;ref name=hussain/&gt;

The endangered species that live within the Sundarbans and extinct species that used to be include the royal Bengal tigers, [[estuarine crocodile]], [[northern river terrapin]]s (''Batagur baska''), [[olive ridley sea turtle]]s, [[Gangetic dolphin]], ground turtles, [[hawksbill sea turtle]]s and king crabs (horse shoe). Some species such as hog deer (''[[Axis porcinus]]''), water buffalos (''[[Bubalus bubalis]]''), [[barasingha]] or swamp deer (''[[Cervus duvauceli]]''), Javan rhinoceros (''[[Rhinoceros sondaicus]]''), single horned rhinoceros (''[[Rhinoceros unicornis]]'') and the mugger crocodiles or marsh crocodiles (''[[Crocodylus palustris]]'') started to become extinct in the Sundarbans towards the middle of the 20th century, because of extensive poaching and man hunting by the British.&lt;ref name=sarakar&gt;Sarker, S.U. 1993.

The physical development processes along the coast are influenced by a multitude of factors, comprising wave motions, micro and macro-tidal cycles and long shore currents typical to the coastal tract. The shore currents vary greatly along with the [[monsoon]]. These are also affected by [[cyclonic]] action. Erosion and accretion through these forces maintains varying levels, as yet not properly measured, of physiographic change whilst the mangrove vegetation itself provides a remarkable stability to the entire system. During each monsoon season almost all the Bengal Delta is submerged, much of it for half a year. The sediment of the lower delta plain is primarily advected inland by monsoonal coastal setup and cyclonic events. One of the greatest challenges people living on the [[Ganges Delta]] may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by [[subsidence]] in the region and partly by climate change.

In many of the Bangladesh's mangrove wetlands, freshwater reaching the mangroves was considerably reduced from the 1970s because of diversion of freshwater in the upstream area by neighbouring [[India]] through the use of the [[Farakka Barrage]] bordering [[Rajshahi]], Bangladesh. Also, the Bengal [[Drainage basin|Basin]] is slowly tilting towards the east because of neo-[[tectonic]] movement, forcing greater freshwater input to the Bangladesh Sundarbans. As a result, the salinity of the Bangladesh Sundarbans is much lower than that of the Indian side. A 1990 study noted that there "is no evidence that environmental degradation in the [[Himalayas]] or a 'greenhouse' induced rise in sea level have aggravated floods in Bangladesh"; however, a 2007 report by UNESCO, "Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage" has stated that an anthropogenic {{convert|45|cm|in|adj=on}} rise in sea level (likely by the end of the 21st century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), combined with other forms of anthropogenic stress on the Sundarbans, could lead to the destruction of 75&amp;nbsp;percent of the Sundarbans mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/documents/publi_climatechange.pdf Case Studies of Climate Change], UNESCO, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Already, [[Lohachara Island]] and [[South Talpatti Island|New Moore Island/South Talpatti Island]] have disappeared under the sea, and [[Ghoramara Island]] is half submerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=George |first=Nirmala |date=24 March 2010 |title=Disputed isle in Bay of Bengal disappears into sea |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_india_disappearing_island |newspaper=Yahoo News |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329164736/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_india_disappearing_island |archive-date=29 March 2010 |access-date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted in 2012, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found out that the Sunderban coast was retreating up to {{convert|200|m}} in a year. Agricultural activities had destroyed around {{convert|17,179|ha}} of mangroves within three decades (1975–2010). Shrimp cultivation had destroyed another {{convert|7,554|ha}}.

Researches from the School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University, estimated the annual rise in sea level to be {{convert|8|mm}} in 2010. It had doubled from {{convert|3.14|mm}} recorded in 2000. The rising sea levels had also submerged around {{convert|7,500|ha}} of forest areas. This, coupled with an around {{convert|1.5|C-change}} rise in surface water temperatures and increased levels of salinity have posed a problem for the survival of the indigenous flora and fauna. The Sundari trees are exceptionally sensitive to salinity and are being threatened with extinction.

Loss of the mangrove forest will result in the loss of the protective biological shield against cyclones and tsunamis. This may put the surrounding coastal communities at high risk. Moreover, the submergence of land mass have rendered up to 6,000 families homeless and around 70,000 people are immediately threatened with the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mangrove forests threatened by Climate Change in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh and India|url=http://takvera.blogspot.in/2013/01/mangrove-forests-threatened-by-climate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Warming: Rising Seas creates 70,000 Climate Refugees|url=http://takvera.blogspot.com.au/2006/12/global-warming-rising-seas-creates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}&lt;!-- A self-published blog is not a reliable source.

The Sundarbans plays an important role in the economy of the southwestern region of Bangladesh as well as in the national economy. It is the single largest source of [[forest produce]] in the country. The forest provides raw materials for wood-based industries. In addition to traditional forest produce like timber, fuelwood, pulpwood etc., large-scale harvest of non-wood forest products such as thatching materials, [[honey]], beeswax, fish, crustacean and mollusc resources of the forest takes place regularly. The vegetated tidal lands of the Sundarbans function as an essential habitat, produces nutrients and purifies water. The forest also traps nutrient and sediment, acts as a storm barrier, shore stabiliser and energy storage unit. Last but not the least, the Sunderbans provides an aesthetic attraction for local and foreign tourists.

The forest has immense protective and productive functions. Constituting 51% of the total [[Reserve forest|reserved forest estate]] of Bangladesh, it contributes about 41% of total forest revenue and accounts for about 45% of all timber and fuel wood output of the country.&lt;ref name=FAO95/&gt; A number of industries (e.g., newsprint mill, match factory, hardboard, boat building, furniture making) are based on raw materials obtained from the Sundarbans ecosystem. [[Non-timber forest product]]s and [[plantation]]s help generate considerable employment and income opportunities for at least half a million poor coastal people. It provides natural protection to life and properties of the coastal population in [[cyclone]]-prone Bangladesh.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Flooded rice fields in monsoon.jpg|thumb|During monsoon the [[paddy field]]s in the Sunderbans are entirely flooded.]]
Part of the Sunderbans is shielded from tidal inflow by levees and there one finds villages and agriculture. During the [[monsoon]] season,  the low lying agricultural lands are waterlogged and the summer crop (''kharif'' crop) is therefore mainly [[deepwater rice]] or floating rice. In the dry winter season the land is normally uncropped and used for cattle grazing. However, the lands near the villages are irrigated from ponds that were filled up during monsoon, and vegetable crops (''rabi'' crops) can be grown here.&lt;ref&gt;H.S.Sen, 1992. ''Research on water management in the Sunderbans, West Bengal, India.'' Published in the Annual Report 1992 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and improvement, Wageningen, the Netherlands. On line:[https://www.waterlog.info/pdf/sunderbans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitation===
The Sundarbans has a population of over 4 million&lt;ref name=BBCSubir&gt;{{cite news |author=Subir Bhaumik |title=Fears rise for sinking Sundarbans |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3102948.stm |work=BBC News |date=15 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; but much of it is mostly free of permanent human habitation. Despite human habitations and a century of economic exploitation of the forest well into the late 1940s, the Sundarbans retained a forest closure of about 70% according to the [[Department for International Development|Overseas Development Administration]] (ODA) of the United Kingdom in 1979.

==Administration==
[[File:Sundarban police boat.jpg|thumb|Police Boat Patrolling in [[Sundarban National Park]], West Bengal]]

The Sundarbans area is one of the most densely populated in the world, and the population is increasing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} As a result, half of this ecoregion's mangrove forests have been cut down to supply fuelwood and other natural resources. Despite the intense and large-scale exploitation, this still is one of the largest contiguous areas of mangroves in the world. Another threat comes from deforestation and water diversion from the rivers inland, which causes far more silt to be brought to the estuary, clogging up the waterways.

The Directorate of Forest is responsible for the administration and management of Sundarban National Park in West Bengal. The [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF), Wildlife &amp; Bio-Diversity &amp; ex-officio Chief Wildlife Warden, West Bengal is the senior most executive officer looking over the administration of the park. The Chief Conservator of Forests (South) &amp; Director, Sundarban Biosphere Reserve is the administrative head of the park at the local level and is assisted by a Deputy Field Director and an Assistant Field Director. The park area is divided into two ranges, overseen by range forest officers. Each range is further sub-divided into beats. The park also has floating watch stations and camps to protect the property from poachers.

The park receives financial aid from the State Government as well as the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] under various Plan and Non-Plan Budgets. Additional funding is received under the [[Project Tiger]] from the Central Government. In 2001, a grant of US$20,000 was received as a preparatory assistance for promotion between India and Bangladesh from the [[World Heritage Fund]].

A new Khulna Forest Circle was created in Bangladesh back in 1993 to preserve the forest, and Chief Conservators of Forests have been posted since. The direct administrative head of the Division is the Divisional Forest Officer, based at Khulna, who has a number of professional, subprofessional and support staff and logistic supports for the implementation of necessary management and administrative activities. The basic unit of management is the compartment. There are 55 compartments in four Forest Ranges and these are clearly demarcated mainly by natural features such as rivers, canals and creeks.

===Protection===

The entire forested (dark green) area constitutes the Biosphere Reserve, with the remaining forests outside the national park and wildlife sanctuaries being given the status of a [[reserve forest]].]]

The Bangladesh part of the forest lies under two forest divisions, and four administrative ranges viz Chandpai (Khulna District), [[Sarankhola]] (Khulna), and [[Burigoalini]] ([[Satkhira District]]) and has sixteen forest stations. It is further divided into fifty-five compartments and nine blocks.&lt;ref name="Bpedia"/&gt; There are three wildlife sanctuaries established in 1977 under the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973). The West Bengal part of the forest lies under the district of South &amp; North 24 Parganas.

Protected areas cover 15% of the Sundarbans mangroves including [[Sundarbans National Park]] and [[Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary]], in West Bengal, [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans East]], [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans South]] and [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuaries]] in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=IM1406/&gt;

====Sundarban National Park====
{{main|Sundarbans National Park}}
The Sundarban National Park is a [[National Park]], [[Tiger Reserve]], and a [[Biosphere Reserve]] in West Bengal, India. It is part of the Sundarbans on the [[Ganges Delta]], and adjacent to the Sundarbans Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. The [[River delta|delta]] is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the [[Bengal tiger]]. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and [[invertebrate]] species, including the [[salt-water crocodile]]. The present Sundarbans National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a National Park.

====Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary====
{{main|Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary}}
Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region supports mangroves, including: sparse stands of Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') and dense stands of Goran (''[[Ceriops]] tagal''), with discontinuous patches of Hantal palm (''[[Phoenix paludosa]]'') on drier ground, river banks and levees. The fauna of the sanctuary is very diverse with some 40 species of mammals, 260 species of birds and 35 species of reptiles. The greatest of these being the Bengal tiger of which an estimated 350 remain in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Other large mammals are [[wild boar]], chital horin ([[spotted deer]]), Indian otter and [[macaque monkey]]. Five species of marine turtles frequent the coastal zone and two endangered reptiles are present – the [[estuarine crocodile]] and the [[Indian python]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Nomination, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary====
{{main|Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary}}
Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary extends over an area of {{convert|31227|ha|acre}}. Sundari trees (''Heritiera fomes'') dominate the flora, interspersed with Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') and Passur (''Xylocarpus mekongensis'') with Kankra (''[[Bruguiera gymnorhiza]]'') occurring in areas subject to more frequent flooding. There is an understory of Shingra (''Cynometra ramiflora'') where, soils are drier and Amur (''Aglaia cucullata'') in wetter areas and Goran (''[[Ceriops]] decandra'') in more saline places. Nypa palm (''Nypa fruticans'') is widespread along drainage lines.

====Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary====
{{main|Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary}}
Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary extends over an area of {{convert|36970|ha|acre}}. There is evidently the greatest seasonal variation in salinity levels and possibly represents an area of relatively longer duration of moderate salinity where Gewa (''[[Excoecaria agallocha]]'') is the dominant woody species. It is often mixed with Sundri, which is able to displace in circumstances such as artificially opened canopies where Sundri does not regenerate as effectively. It is also frequently associated with a dense understory of Goran (''[[Ceriops]] tagal'') and sometimes Passur.

====Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary====
{{main|Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary}}
Sajnakhali Wildlife Sanctuary is a {{convert|362|km2|mi2|adj=on}} area in the northern part of the Sundarbans delta in [[South 24 Parganas district]], West Bengal, India. The area is mainly mangrove scrub, forest and swamp. It was set up as a sanctuary in 1976. It is home to a rich population of different species of wildlife, such as [[water fowl]], [[heron]], [[pelican]], [[Chital|spotted deer]], [[rhesus macaque]]s, [[wild boar]], tigers, [[Asian water monitor|water monitor lizards]], [[fishing cat]]s, [[otter]]s, [[olive ridley turtle]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[Batagur baska|batagur terrapins]], and migratory birds.

The Sundarbans is celebrated through numerous Bengali folk songs and dances, often centred around the folk heroes, gods and goddesses specific to the Sunderbans (like [[Bonbibi]] and [[Dakshin Rai]]) and to the Lower Gangetic Delta (like [[Manasa]] and [[Chand Sadagar]]). The Bengali folk epic [[Manasamangal]] mentions ''Netidhopani'' and has some passages set in the Sundarbans during the heroine [[Behula]]'s quest to bring her husband ''Lakhindar'' back to life.

The area provides the setting for several novels by [[Emilio Salgari]], (e.g. ''[[The Mystery of the Black Jungle]]''). ''Sundarbaney Arjan Sardar'', a novel by Shibshankar Mitra, and ''[[Padma Nadir Majhi]]'', a novel by [[Manik Bandopadhyay]], are based on the rigors of lives of villagers and fishermen living in the Sunderbans region, and are woven into the Bengali psyche to a great extent. Part of the plot of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s [[Booker Prize]] winning novel, ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' is set in the Sundarbans. This forest is adopted as the setting of [[Kunal Basu]]'s short story "The Japanese Wife" and the subsequent [[The Japanese Wife|film adaptation]]. Most of the plot of an internationally acclaimed novelist, [[Amitav Ghosh]]'s 2004 novel, ''[[The Hungry Tide]]'', is set in the Sundarbans. The plot centres on a headstrong American cetologist who arrives to study a rare species of river dolphin, enlisting a local fisherman and translator to aid her. The book also mentions two accounts of the Bonbibi story of "Dukhey's Redemption".&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Amitav (2005). ''The Hungry Tide: A Novel.'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin, pp. 84–88, 292–97 {{ISBN|0-14-301556-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Manik Bandopadhyay's ''[[Padma Nadir Majhi]]'' was made into a movie by [[Goutam Ghose]].

The Sunderbans has been the subject of a detailed and well-researched scholarly work on Bonbibi (a 'forest goddess' venerated by Hindus), on the relation between the islanders and tigers and on conservation and how it is perceived by the inhabitants of the Sundarbans,&lt;ref&gt;Jalais, Annu. (2010).

In ''Up The Country'', [[Emily Eden]] discusses her travels through the Sunderbans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eden, Emily |title='Up the country': letters written to her sister from the upper provinces of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkQOAAAAQAAJ|year=1867|publisher=R. Bentley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous documentary movies have been made about the Sunderbans, including the 2003 [[IMAX]] production ''Shining Bright'' about the Bengal tiger. The acclaimed [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Ganges (BBC TV series)|Ganges]]'' documents the lives of villagers, especially [[honey collector]]s, in the Sundarbans.

The '''''São Gabriel''''' was the [[flagship]] of [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Naval fleet|armada]] on his first voyage to [[India]] in 1497-1499.

==The other three ships==
Velho indicated that the sources agreed that the armada contained four ships, but there was disagreement about the names. These were the other three ships according to him:&lt;ref name=velho&gt;{{cite book| title=A journal of the first voyage of Vasco da Gama, 1497-1499 |author=Alvaro Velho| pages=157–177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAU7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;vq=gabriel&amp;dq=%22S+o+Gabriel%22+da+gama| publisher=[[Hakluyt Society]] |year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''''São Rafael''''': The sister ship of the ''São Gabriel'',  built by the same builder at the same time for the same purpose. It was of similar dimensions as the ''São Gabriel''. [[Paulo da Gama]], Vasco's brother, was the captain, other people include João de Coimbra, pilot, and João de Sá, clerk.
* The '''''Bérrio''''', also known as the ''São Miguel'': This [[caravel]] was named after its former owner. Only carrying [[lateen sail]]s, it was the smallest and swiftest of the convoy with a tonnage of 50t-90t. Key people were: [[Nicolau Coelho]], captain, [[Pedro Escobar]] pilot, and Álvaro de Braga, clerk.
* A supply ship, name '''''São Miguel''''': The ship was a carrack of about 110 or 200 tons with Gonçalo Nunes as captain.

==Provisions==
The provisions of the convoy were based on the expectation that the voyage would last 3 years; also merchandise intended for the Indian market was brought along. This merchandise included wash basins, clothes, sugar, honey, corals, glass beads and trinkets, and turned out to be neither adequate in quality nor in quantity for its purpose.&lt;ref name=velho/&gt;&lt;ref name=akbar&gt;{{cite book | author=Akbar MJ |title=The Shade of Swords| pages=117–8|publisher=Routledge, 2002 |isbn=0-415-28470-8 | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daily rations were calculated to be 1.5 pounds [[biscuit]], 1&amp;nbsp;lb beef or 0.5&amp;nbsp;lb of pork, 2.5 [[pint]]s water, 1.25 pints wine (customary, also against [[scurvy]]), plus 0.3 [[Gill (volume)|gill]] of vinegar, and 0.6 gill of oil. On [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting]] days meat was substituted by rice, fish, or cheese. Other provisions included flour, lentils, sardines, plums, almonds, garlic, mustard, salt, honey, sugar. Also, fresh fish was caught en route, and supplies were replenished in harbors including [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] (against [[scurvy]]).&lt;ref  name=velho/&gt;

The ships also carried a number of [[padrão|padrões]], pillars of stone headed by the cross and bearing the seal of [[Portugal]] and used as markers to claim land.

==Operational history==
The armada left [[Restelo]], [[Lisbon]] on July 8, 1497. After rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]], the armada anchored at the Aguada de São Brás ([[Mossel Bay]]) where the supply ship was broken up and its contents distributed on the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A journal of the first voyage of Vasco da Gama, 1497-1499 |author=Alvaro Velho| pages=9–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAU7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 | publisher=[[Hakluyt Society]] |year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three ships sailed further North along the African coast to [[Malindi]], East Africa. After crossing the [[Indian Ocean]] they reached the harbor of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] at the [[Malabar coast]] in India on May 20, 1498.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Deutsche Welle |language=Portuguese |url= http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,319550,00.html |title=1498: Vasco da Gama chega a Calecute|accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The return crossing of the Indian Ocean took over three months and many of the crew members got sick from scurvy and died. With a diminished crew the ''São Rafael'' became superfluous; the vessel was burned at East Africa after the transfer of its crew and provisions.&lt;ref name=diffie&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Diffie BW, Shafer BC, Winius GD |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580|page=184|publisher=U of Minnesota Press, 1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=S%C3%A3o+Gabriel+gama+azores|isbn=0-8166-0782-6 |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two vessels got caught in a storm near the [[Colonial Cape Verde|Cape Verde]] islands and separated.&lt;ref name=fleming&gt;{{cite book| author=Fleming F |title=Off the Map| publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press, 2004 |page=50 |isbn=0-87113-899-9| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time both ships were leaking and in poor shape.

The ''Bérrio'' under Nicolau Coelho's command arrived at [[Cascais]] near Lisbon on July 10, 1499,&lt;ref name=diffie/&gt; and the ''São Gabriel'' without Gama and directed by João de Sá came in one month later.&lt;ref Name=fleming/&gt; Gama had left the ''São Gabriel'' on its final leg and commissioned another vessel to bring him with his dying brother Paulo to the [[Azores]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A journal of the first voyage of Vasco da Gama, 1497-1499 |author=Alvaro Velho| page=94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAU7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA94 | publisher=[[Hakluyt Society]] |year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before he returned to Portugal in early September, 1499.

==Cultural depictions==
''São Gabriel'' is depicted in the 2011 [[Indian film]], ''[[Urumi (film)|Vasco da Gama]]''.

After the ratification of the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] in 1821 the United States combined East Florida and what had been the remaining  Spanish-controlled rump of West Florida into the territory that comprised modern-day Florida.

'''Tuat''', or '''Touat''' ([[Berber languages|Berber]]: ⵜⵓⵡⴰⵜ, ''Tuwat''), is a [[natural region]] of [[desert]] in central [[Algeria]] that contains a string of small [[oasis|oases]]. In the past, the oases were important for [[Camel caravan|caravans]] crossing the [[Sahara]].

==Geography==
Tuat lies to the south of the [[Grand Erg Occidental]], to the east of the [[Erg Chech]] and to the south east of the [[Tademaït]] Plateau. It contains a string of small oases strung out along the eastern edge of the Wadi Messaoud, a continuation of the [[Saoura|Wadi Saoura]]. The oases extend over a distance of 160&amp;nbsp;km from the district of Bouda in the north to [[Reggane]] in the south. The largest town in the region is [[Adrar, Algeria|Adrar]], 20&amp;nbsp;km south east of Bouda. Adrar was established by the French after their conquest in 1900 and had a population of 43,903 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Répartition des sièges des assemblées populaires communales: 01 — Wilaya d'Adrar | year=2002 | journal=Journal Officiel de la République Algérienne | volume=47 | url=http://www.joradp.dz/JO2000/2002/047/FP6.pdf | language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with each oasis are small walled villages called ''[[ksar|ksour]]'' (singular ''ksar'' or ''gsar''). There are also some forts (''[[kasbah]]s''), most of which have been abandoned.{{sfn|Dubost|Moguedet|1998}}

There is almost no rainfall in the region and the agriculture depends on [[groundwater]] from the [[Continental Intercalary]] (''Continental Intercalaire'' in French), an enormous [[aquifer]] that extends for over 600,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an area that includes parts of Algeria, [[Libya]] and [[Tunisia]]. The Continental Intercalary is a layer of porous [[sandstone]] deposited between the [[Moscovian (Carboniferous)|Moscovian]] and the [[Cenomanian]] periods. It forms the deeper of the two aquifers of the North Western Sahara Aquifer System (NWSAS).{{sfn|Sokona|Diallo|2008}} Tuat is situated at the south western boundary of the Continental Intercalary where the aquifer lies only 2–6&amp;nbsp;m below the surface.{{sfn|Kassir|1983}}

The oases contain 700,000-800,000 date palms (''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]'') in an area of  4,500&amp;nbsp;hectare.{{sfn|Dubost|Moguedet|1998}} The palm groves are irrigated by a system of ''[[foggara]]''s. These are traditional gravity catchment systems which consist of a tunnel constructed with a gentle uphill gradient from the low ground near the wadi into the aquifer lying under the nearby higher ground. Vertical access holes every 10–20&amp;nbsp;m along the tunnel provide ventilation and facilitate the construction and maintenance.{{sfn|Khadraoui|2007}} Many of the ''foggaras'' are over a kilometre in length. They typically provide flow rates of between 2&amp;nbsp;L/s and 3&amp;nbsp;L/s. In 1963 the region of Tuat contained 531 ''foggaras'' of which only 358 were functioning.{{sfn|Dubost|Moguedet|1998}} The total combined flow rate was approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;L/s. Foggaras are expensive to construct and to maintain. As they collapse they are often not repaired. Instead, water is obtained using vertical wells and electric pumps allowing grain to be grown using a [[center pivot irrigation]] system. A single well can provide 30&amp;nbsp;L/s to 50&amp;nbsp;L/s of water.{{sfn|Dubost|Moguedet|1998}}

In addition to water, the rock beneath Tuat contains pockets of natural gas. [[Sonatrach]], the Algeria state-owned oil company, is collaborating with foreign companies in joint ventures to exploit these gas reserves. Sonatrach and the China National Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Development Corporation (CNODC) have constructed a refinery near the village of Sbaa, 40&amp;nbsp;km north of Adrar. This began operating in 2006. Separate projects led by [[Gaz de France]] (GDF Suez) and [[Total S.A.|Total]] are both scheduled to start supplying gas in 2013. A pipeline is being built to connect to [[Hassi R'Mel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Algeria: Country Analysis Brief | publisher= [[Energy Information Administration]] | url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Algeria/pdf.pdf | accessdate= 2010-11-28 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101117073914/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Algeria/pdf.pdf | archivedate= 2010-11-17 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north of Tuat is Gourara, a similar region also containing oases with date palms irrigated by ''foggaras''. The largest town, [[Timimoun]], is 162&amp;nbsp;km north east of Adrar.

==History==
The Tuat oases were important in the [[trans-Saharan trade]] because of their location at the northern end of the [[Tanezrouft]] route. Reggane is around 1150&amp;nbsp;km north of the town of [[Gao]] and a similar distance from [[Timbuktu]]. Caravans from the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] would continue northwards to towns such as [[Sijilmasa]] or [[Tlemcen]].

The oases are not mentioned by any of the early Arabic geographers,{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=9 n6}} but it appears that Jews lived in the oases at an early date as a tombstone discovered in a village of the Bouda region has an inscription in Hebrew with a date of 1329.{{sfn|Berger|1903}}{{sfn|Hunwick|2006|p=1}}

The earliest written reference to Tuat is by [[Ibn Battuta]]. He visited Bouda in 1353 after crossing the [[Sahara]] from [[Takedda]] in present-day [[Niger]], a distance of 1390&amp;nbsp;km.{{sfn|Levtzion|Hopkins|2000|pp=303-304}} He travelled with a large caravan that included 600 slave girls. He wrote: "Then we arrived at Būda, which is one of the biggest villages of the Tuwāt. Its land consists of sand and salt pans. It has many dates which are not good, but its people prefer them to the dates of Sijilmāsa. There is no cultivation there nor butter nor oil. Oil is only imported to it from the land of the Maghrib. The food of its people is dates and locusts. These are abundant with them; they store them as dates are stored and use them for food. They go out to hunt them before sunrise, for at that time they do not fly on account of the cold."{{sfn|Levtzion|Hopkins|2000|p=304}} Ibn Battuta stayed in Bouda for a few days and then continued on to [[Sijilmasa]] with a caravan.&lt;ref name=Ibn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouda, as well as Sijilmasa, Timbuktu and Gao, are marked on the 1375 [[Catalan Atlas]] of [[Abraham Cresques]].{{sfn|Hunwick|2006|p=1}} At some point Bouda was abandoned and replaced by [[Tamentit]] as the main ''ksour'' of the region. Tamentit was more centrally situated and perhaps easier to defend.{{sfn|Levtzion|Hopkins|2000|p=425 n79}} The Arabic geographer and historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] (born Tunis 1332, died Egypt 1406) provides a description of Tuat, a place he had not visited himself, in his ''Kitab al-'Ibar'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of their homelands lies three stages to the south of Sijilmāsa and is called Tuwāt. It consists of 200 ''qușūr'' strung out from west to east, of which the most easterly is called Tamanțīt, nowadays a flourishing place and a point of departure for merchants who pass to and fro between the Maghrib and the land of Māli of the Sūdān. ... The town of Būdā, the most westerly of these ''qușūr'', used to be the point of departure for Wālātan, the outpost of the Mālī territory, but it was abandoned when the bedouin Arabs from the desert of the Sūs took to acts of brigandry on the highway and molesting the caravans. They left that place and followed the route to the land of the Sudān by way of Tamanțīt.{{sfn|Levtzion|Hopkins|2000|p=339}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that in reality Adrar is 540&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Sijilmasa, considerably more than the three stages mentioned by Ibn Khaldun. Also, the oases are strung out from north-northwest to south-southeast rather than from west to east.

We learn more about Tuat from a letter written in Latin in 1447 by the Italian Antonio Malfante from 'Tueto' to a merchant in [[Genoa]]. Malfante describes a village which is believed to be Tamentit: "This locality is a mart of the country of the Moors, to which merchants come to sell their goods: gold is carried hither, and bought by those who come up from the coast. This place is De Amament [Tamentit], and there are many rich men here. The generality, however, are very poor, for they do not sow, nor do they harvest anything, save the dates upon which they subsist. They eat no meat but that of castrated camels, which are scarce and very dear."{{sfn|Crone|1937|p=86}} He also comments on the Jewish population: "There are many Jews, who lead a good life here, for they are under the protection of the several rulers, each of whom defends his own clients. Thus they enjoy very secure social standing. Trade is in their hands, and many of them are to be trusted with the greatest confidence."{{sfn|Crone|1937|p=86}}

Around 1490, encouraged by [[Muhammad al-Maghili]], a [[Maliki]] scholar from [[Tlemcen]], the Moslem population of Tamentit destroyed the Jewish [[synagogue]] and forced the Jews to move elsewhere.{{sfn|Hunwick|1985|p=65}}{{sfn|Hunwick|2006|pp=61, 65}}
&lt;!--In 1578, following raids on Tuat, the dignitaries of the oases sought the protection of the [[Ottomans]]. In 1579 and again in 1582, [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] troops from [[Algiers]] and [[Tunisia]] visited Tuat and established Ottoman authority. Possibly true by no reference. Would need to study Martin 1923 - but the book has no index and is heavy going.--&gt;

Sometime between 1583 and 1588 the forces of the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] sultan [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] took control of the Tuat and the Gourara oases.{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=309 n3}}&lt;!--Hunwick's footnote doesn't give a primary source but is probably reliable - he is translating a contemporary undated document --&gt;  The area remained politically dependent upon Morocco but the sovereignty of the [[Alaouite dynasty|Alaouite]]
sultans became almost nominal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunn|1977|pp=46–48}}. Dunn cites {{Harvnb|Martin|1923|pp=1–366}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the French administration and military called for the annexation of the Touat, the [[Gourara]] and the [[Tidikelt]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Trout, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/216479 ''Morocco's Boundary in the Guir-Zousfana River Basin''], in: African Historical Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1 (1970), pp. 37-56, Publ. Boston University African Studies Center: « The Algerian-Moroccan conflict can be said to have begun in the 1890s when the administration and military in Algeria called for annexation of the Touat-Gourara-Tidikelt, a sizable expanse of Saharan oases that was nominally a part of the Moroccan Empire (...) The Touat-Gourara-Tidikelt oases had been an appendage of the Moroccan Empire, jutting southeast for about 750 kilometers into the Saharan desert »&lt;/ref&gt; a complex that had been part of the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] Empire for many centuries prior to the arrival of the French in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Trout, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IO69HppDTDgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en ''Morocco's Saharan Frontiers''], Droz (1969), p.24 ({{ISBN|9782600044950}}) : « The Gourara-Touat-Tidikelt complex had been under Moroccan domination for many centuries prior to the arrival of the French in Algeria »&lt;/ref&gt;

An armed conflict opposed French 19th Corps Oran and Algiers divisions to the [[Aït Khabbash]], a fraction of the Aït Ounbgui ''khams'' of the [[Aït Atta]] confederation. The conflict ended by the annexation of the Touat-Gourara-Tidikelt complex to [[French Algeria|Algeria]] by France in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lefébure, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/remmm_0035-1474_1986_num_41_1_2114 ''Ayt Khebbach, impasse sud-est. L'involution d'une tribu marocaine exclue du Sahara''], in: Revue de l'Occident musulman et de la Méditerranée, N°41-42, 1986. Désert et montagne au Maghreb. pp. 136-157: « les Divisions d'Oran et d'Alger du 19e Corps d'armée n'ont pu conquérir le Touat et le Gourara qu'au prix de durs combats menés contre les semi-nomades d'obédience marocaine qui, depuis plus d'un siècle, imposaient leur protection aux oasiens »&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dunn|1977|p=146}}

Under French rule, the area was known as the "''Territoire des oasis sahariennes''".
