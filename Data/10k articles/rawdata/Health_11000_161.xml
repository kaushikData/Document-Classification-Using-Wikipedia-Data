'''2,4,5-Trihydroxyamphetamine''' ('''THM''') is a [[neurotoxin]] and a metabolite of [[MDMA]]. It comes from the ring-hydroxylation of [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]] (MDA).

In one paper, it was shown to reduce hippocampal [[tryptophan hydroxylase]] activity by 54% after short-term treatment.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov_July_8_2015c"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Short-term effects of 2,4,5-trihydroxyamphetamine, 2,4,5-trihydroxymethamphetamine and 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine on central tryptophan hydroxylase activity.| pmid=8496826 | volume=265 | issue=2 | date=May 1993 | journal=J Pharmacol Exp Ther | pages=813–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, it was shown to significantly reduce striatal [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = J Pharmacol Exp Ther | date = 1993 | volume = 265 | issue = 2 | pages = 813–818 | title = Short-term effects of 2,4,5-trihydroxyamphetamine, 2,4,5-trihydroxymethamphetamine and 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine on central tryptophan hydroxyls activity |vauthors=Elayan I, Gibb JW, Hanson GR, Lim HK, Foltz RL, Johnson M | pmid= 8496826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It gives patients the right to see reports written about them by a doctor for employment purposes or insurance purposes with whom they have a normal doctor-patient relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Access to medical reports |url=https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/confidentiality-and-health-records/access-to-medical-reports |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=British Medical Association |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients can see a report before it is submitted and request changes.  Access to a report can be withheld if the doctor thinks it likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the individual or others or indicate the intentions of the practitioner in respect of the individual, or to reveal the identity of another person who has supplied information.

==History==

Nearly half of all Americans live with at least one chronic condition and ~70% of all American deaths can be attributed directly to chronic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2011-03-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110227144520/http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/| archivedate= 27 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Care coordination is necessary to curb the progression and cost associated with chronic disease in The United States.
The ambulatist model of care coordination began in 2008 at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska.  The Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Prog ram (CVRRP) and Diabetes Risk Reduction Program (DMRRP) are employee wellness benefit programs for Creighton employees with the diagnoses of [[hypertension]], [[dyslipidemia]] and/or [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenz|first=Thomas L|title=A Lifestyle Medicine Clinic in a Community Pharmacy Setting.|journal=Innovations in Pharmacy|year=2010|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–12|url=http://www.pharmacy.umn.edu/innovations/prod/groups/cop/@pub/@cop/@innov/documents/article/cop_article_229570.pdf|accessdate=2011-03-13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs are run by a health care specialty position called the "ambulatist". An ambulatist can be any licensed health care provider who receives training in direct patient care and lifestyle medicine. The areas of lifestyle medicine emphasized can include physical activity, nutrition, weight control, stress management, sleep success and tobacco cessation. [[Creighton University]] is now developing an ambulatist training program to expand the use of ambulatist services across a variety of practice settings.&lt;ref name="Lifestyle Therapy "/&gt;

==Goals and responsibilities==
'''The goals of an ambulatist include:'''&lt;ref name="System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sumobrain.com/patents/wipo/System-methods-sourcing-managing-healthcare/WO2010141251.html|title=System and Methods for Sourcing and Managing Healthcare Related Resources|last=Lenz|first=Thomas|date=December 9, 2010|work=WIPO Patent Application|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Advocacy for improved patient outcomes.
* Integrating services and resources.
* Avoiding duplicated, contraindicated or incompatible treatments and unnecessary costs.
* Improving patient and caregiver education.
* Enhancing the overall care of the patient.

AGE has received research grants from the [[National Institutes of Health]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Detail for: AMERICAN AGING ASSOCIATION | work = Institution Detail for 2005 | publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]] | year = 2005 | url = http://report.nih.gov/award/trends/FindOrg_Detail.cfm?OrgID=2970601&amp;Year=2005 | accessdate = 2010-02-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090924194338/http://report.nih.gov/award/trends/FindOrg_Detail.cfm?OrgID=2970601&amp;Year=2005 | archive-date = 2009-09-24 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Detail for: AMERICAN AGING ASSOCIATION | work = Institution Detail for 2006 | publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]] | year = 2006 | url = http://report.nih.gov/award/trends/FindOrg_Detail.cfm?OrgID=2970601&amp;Year=2006 | accessdate = 2010-02-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090924194340/http://report.nih.gov/award/trends/FindOrg_Detail.cfm?OrgID=2970601&amp;Year=2006 | archive-date = 2009-09-24 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ellison Medical Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Ellison" /&gt; In 2016, AGE became a member of the [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]].&lt;ref name="AD"/&gt;

The vice-presidency of AGE is to be a [[layperson]] position focused on promoting the scientific goals of AGE to the general public.&lt;ref name="Springer" /&gt;

==Activities==
The primary activities of AGE are to:
#hold annual scientific conferences (every June)&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Springer" /&gt;
#give awards to researchers making significant contributions to the goals of AGE&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Springer" /&gt;
#promote interest among young scientists in the goals of AGE&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt;
#publish newsletters and journals&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Springer" /&gt;

The [[Scientific journal|journal]] of AGE is ''[https://link.springer.com/journal/11357 GeroScience]''.  Formerly called ''[[Age (journal)|AGE]]'', the journal name was officially changed at the beginning of 2017.

==Origins==
The controversy over aspartame safety originated in perceived irregularities in the aspartame approval process during the 1970s and early 1980s, including allegations of a [[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] relationship between regulators and industry and claims that aspartame producer [[G.D. Searle, LLC|G.D. Searle]] had withheld and falsified safety data. In 1996, the controversy reached a wider audience with a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' report&lt;ref name=60minutes&gt;{{cite news|work=[[60 Minutes]]|title=How Sweet Is It?|date=December 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; that discussed criticisms of the FDA approval process and concerns that aspartame could cause brain tumors in humans. The ''60 Minutes'' special stated that "aspartame's approval was one of the most contested in FDA history."&lt;ref name=60minutes/&gt;

Around the same time, a [[Usenet]] post was widely circulated under the pen name "Nancy Markle", creating the basis for a misleading and unverifiable hoax [[chain letter]] that was spread through the Internet.&lt;ref name=urbanlegends&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blasp.htm|title= Aspartame Warning|publisher=[[About.com]]}} – the Nancy Markle chain email.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous websites have spread the email's claims, which were not backed by scientific evidence, about safety issues purportedly linked to aspartame, including [[Gulf War Syndrome]] and [[lupus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should You Sour on Aspartame? |url=http://www.tuftshealthletter.com/ShowArticle.aspx?rowId=347 |publisher=Tufts University Health and Nutrition Letter |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224173306/http://tuftshealthletter.com/ShowArticle.aspx?rowId=347 |archivedate=December 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. FDA approval ==
Aspartame was originally approved for use in dry foods in 1974 by then FDA Commissioner Alexander Schmidt after review by the FDA's [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]]. Searle had submitted 168 studies&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|20|date=May 2009}} on aspartame, including seven animal studies that were considered crucial by the FDA.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|21|date=May 2009}} Soon afterwards, [[John Olney]], a professor of psychiatry and prominent critic of [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]], along with James Turner, a public-interest lawyer and author of an anti-food-additive book, filed a petition for a public hearing, citing safety concerns.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|38|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Andrew Cockburn|Cockburn A.]]|year=2007|title=Rumsfeld: His Rise, Fall, and Catastrophic Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Di2D4R25bEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA63,M1|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-3574-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|63–4|date=May 2009}} Other criticisms presented in the 1996 ''60 Minutes'' special of the Searle studies included assertions of unreported medical treatments that may have affected the study outcomes and discrepancies in the reported data.&lt;ref name=60minutes/&gt; Schmidt agreed, pending an investigation into alleged improprieties in safety studies for aspartame and several drugs.
&lt;!-- Pulled for now, see below comment and talk page. The [[United States Department of Justice]] instituted [[grand jury]] proceedings against Searle for fraud in one of its drug studies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} --&gt;
In December 1975, the FDA placed a stay on the aspartame approval, preventing Searle from marketing aspartame.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|28|date=May 2009}} The Searle studies were criticized by the FDA commissioner as "...&amp;nbsp;at best&amp;nbsp;... sloppy and suffering from "...&amp;nbsp;a pattern of conduct which compromises the scientific integrity of the studies."&lt;ref name=60minutes/&gt;
&lt;!--

There is a substantial difference between what we have stated ("...&amp;nbsp;instituted [[grand jury]] proceedings" and "one"&amp;nbsp;... "drug studies") and the following. The discrepancy needs to be cleared up:

"In response to the report, the F.D.A. asked the Justice Department to open a grand jury investigation into whether two of Searle's aspartame studies had been falsified or were incomplete. In a 33-page letter in 1977, Richard A. Merrill, the F.D.A.'s chief counsel at the time, recommended to Samuel K. Skinner, then the United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, that a grand jury investigate the company, which was based in the Chicago suburb of Skokie, for "concealing material facts and making false statements in reports of animal studies conducted to establish the safety of the drug Aldactone and the food additive aspartame."&lt;br&gt; A grand jury was never convened, however."&lt;ref name=lowdown/&gt;

--&gt;

U.S. Attorney [[Samuel Skinner]] was requested to "open a grand jury investigation into whether two of Searle's aspartame studies had been falsified or were incomplete."&lt;ref name=lowdown/&gt; Skinner withdrew from the case when he was considering a job offer from the law firm [[Sidley &amp; Austin]], Searle's Chicago-based law firm, a job he later took.&lt;ref name=60minutes/&gt; The investigation was delayed and eventually the [[statute of limitations]] on the charges against Searle expired&lt;ref name=60minutes/&gt; and a grand jury was never convened.&lt;ref name=lowdown/&gt;

In 1977 and 1978, an FDA task force and a panel of academic pathologists reviewed 15 aspartame studies by Searle, and concluded that, although there were major lapses in quality control, the resulting inconsistencies would not have affected the studies' conclusions.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|4|date=May 2009}} In 1980, a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) heard testimony from Olney and disagreed with his claims that aspartame could cause brain damage, including in the developing fetus.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|40–41|date=May 2009}} The board decided that further study was needed on a postulated connection between aspartame and brain tumors, and revoked approval of aspartame.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|47|date=May 2009}}

In 1981, FDA Commissioner [[Arthur Hull Hayes]] sought advice on the issue from a panel of FDA scientists and a lawyer. The panel identified errors underlying the PBOI conclusion that aspartame might cause brain tumors, and presented arguments both for and against approval.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|53|date=May 2009}} Hayes approved the use of aspartame in dry foods. Hayes further justified his approval by citing the results of a Japanese brain tumor study,&lt;ref name=Ishii1981&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hiroyuki |first1=I |title=Incidence of brain tumors in rats fed aspartame |journal=[[Toxicology Letters]] |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=433–7 |year=1981 |pmid=7245229 |doi=10.1016/0378-4274(81)90089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the results of which, the PBOI chairman later said, would have resulted in an "unqualified approval" from the PBOI panel.&lt;ref name=FDA1996&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041128020903/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/answers/ans00772.html FDA Statement on Aspartame], November 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Several objections followed, but all were denied.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|13|date=May 2009}} In November 1983, about a year after approving aspartame, Hayes left the FDA and joined the public-relations firm [[Burson-Marsteller]], Searle's public relations agency at the time, as a senior medical adviser.&lt;ref name="GAO86"/&gt;

The actions of Samuel Skinner, in taking a job with a law firm retained by Searle during an investigation into Searle, and Arthur Hull Hayes, in taking a job with Searle's public relations agency following aspartame's approval, fueled conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name=lowdown/&gt;

Because of the approval controversy, Senator [[Howard M. Metzenbaum]] requested an investigation by the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) of aspartame's approval. In 1987, the GAO reported that protocol had been followed and provided a time-line of events in the approval process.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|13|date=May 2009}} The GAO review included a survey of scientists who had conducted safety reviews; of the 67 scientists who responded to a questionnaire, 12 had major concerns about aspartame's safety, 26 were somewhat concerned but generally confident in aspartame safety, and 29 were very confident in aspartame safety.&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;{{Rp|16,76–81|date=May 2009}}

Food additive safety evaluations by many countries have led to approval of aspartame, citing the general lack of adverse effects following consumption in reasonable quantities.&lt;ref name=FSANZ2&gt;{{cite web |title=Aspartame – what it is and why it's used in our food |publisher=[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]]|accessdate=2008-12-09|url= http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/consumers/chemicals-nutrients-additives-and-toxins/aspartame/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216093929/http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/consumers/chemicals-nutrients-additives-and-toxins/aspartame/|archivedate= 2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on government research reviews and recommendations from advisory bodies such as those listed above, aspartame has been found to be safe for human consumption by more than ninety countries worldwide.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FSANZ/&gt;

==Alleged conflict of interest prior to 1996==
In 1976, the FDA notified then-U.S. attorney for Chicago, Sam Skinner, of the ongoing investigation of Searle, and in January 1977, formally requested that a grand jury be convened. In February, 1977, Searle's law firm, [[Sidley &amp; Austin]] offered Skinner a job and Skinner recused himself from the case.&lt;ref name=CongRec1989&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r101:7:./temp/~r101nc8vPN:e1:|periodical=Congressional Record 101st congress 1st session |title=DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION|page=s832|volume=135|date=January 31, 1989|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Skinner's successor was in place several months later, and the statute of limitations for the alleged offenses expired in October 1977. Despite complaints and urging from DOJ in Washington, neither the interim U.S. attorney for Chicago, William Conlon, nor Skinner's successor, Thomas Sullivan, convened a grand jury.&lt;ref name=WSJ1986&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Ex-U.S. Prosecutors' Roles in Case Against Searle Are Questioned in Probe|author1=Andy Pasztor |author2=Joe Davidson |periodical=Wall Street Journal|date=February 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 1977, Sullivan ordered the case dropped for lack of evidence. A year and a half later, Conlon also was hired by Sidley &amp; Austin.&lt;ref name=lowdown/&gt; Concern about conflict of interest in this case inflamed the controversy, and Senator Metzenbaum investigated in 1981 Senate Hearings.&lt;ref name=GAO87 /&gt; In 1989, the U.S. Senate approved the nomination of Sam Skinner to be [[Secretary of Transportation]], noting that both Sullivan and Senator Metzenbaum had concluded that Skinner had not acted improperly.&lt;ref name=CongRec1989 /&gt;

Ralph G. Walton, a psychiatrist at [[Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine]], stated in a self-published 1996 analysis of aspartame research that industry-funded studies found no safety concerns while 84 of 92 independent studies did identify safety concerns.&lt;ref name=lowdown&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/business/yourmoney/12sweet.html?ei=5090&amp;en=f5f173a4cc33d534&amp;ex=1297400400&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all "The Lowdown on Sweet?"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/15/foodanddrink.immigrationpolicy "Safety of artificial sweetener called into question by MP"] ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis by Walton was submitted to the television show ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and has been extensively discussed on the Internet. An analysis of Walton's claims showed that Walton left out at least 50 [[peer-reviewed]] safety studies from his review of the literature and that most of the research he cites as non-industry funded were actually letters to the editors, case reports, review articles or book chapters rather than published studies.&lt;ref name=Kotsonis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kotsonis |first1=Frank | last2= Mackey |first2= Maureen |title= Nutritional toxicology |edition= 2nd | year=2002 |isbn= 0-203-36144-X |page= 299}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a rebuttal to Walton's statements, the Aspartame Information Service (a service provided by [[Ajinomoto]], a primary producer and supplier of aspartame), reviewed the publications Walton cites as critical of aspartame, arguing that most of them do not involve aspartame or do not draw negative conclusions, are not peer-reviewed, are anecdotal, or are duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aspartame Information replies to the New York Times |url=http://www.aspartame.info/news/aspartame_information_replies_to_the_new_york_times_(distributed_with_the_daily_telegraph).asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412235132/http://www.aspartame.info/news/aspartame_information_replies_to_the_new_york_times_(distributed_with_the_daily_telegraph).asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-12 |publisher=Aspartame Information Service |date=2006-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government action and voluntary withdrawals==
In 1997, due to public concerns, the U.K. government introduced a new regulation obliging food makers who use sweeteners to state clearly next to the name of their product the phrase "with sweeteners."&lt;ref name=UK1998&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC |url=http://news2.thls.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_194000/194938.stm |title=Sweeteners, sweeteners everywhere|date=October 16, 1998 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000517011001/http://news2.thls.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_194000/194938.stm |archivedate = May 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) commenced a re-evaluation of aspartame as part of the systematic re-evaluation of all food additives authorised in the EU prior to 20 January 2009. In May 2011, EFSA was asked by the European Commission to bring forward the full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame (E 951), which was previously planned for completion by 2020.&lt;ref name=EFSA2013Jan&gt;[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130108 EFSA Press Release January 8, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, the EFSA made all 600 datasets it is using in its full re-evaluation available publicly.

==Ramazzini studies==
The Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Center of the [[European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences]] has released several studies which claim that aspartame can increase several malignancies in rodents, concluding that aspartame is a potential carcinogen at normal dietary doses.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |year= 2006 |volume= 114 |issue= 3 |pages= 379–385 |title=First Experimental Demonstration of the Multipotential Carcinogenic Effects of Aspartame Administered in the Feed to Sprague-Dawley Rats| first1= M. |last1= Soffritti |first2= F. |last2= Belpoggi |first3= D.D. |last3= Esposti |first4= L. |last4= Lambertini |first5= E. |last5= Tibaldi |first6= A. |pmc= 1392232 |last6= Rigano |doi= 10.1289/ehp.8711 |pmid=16507461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |year= 2007 |volume= 115 | issue= 9 |pages= 1293–1297 |title= Life-span exposure to low doses of aspartame beginning during prenatal life increases cancer effects in rats |last1= Soffritti |first1= M. |last2= Belpoggi |first2= F. |last3= Tibaldi |first3= E. |last4= Esposti |first4= D.D. |last5= Lauriola |first5= M. |pmid= 17805418 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.10271 |pmc=1964906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although thirteen [[occupational safety and health]] experts signed an open letter from CSPI to the FDA expressing that the 2007 ERF study merited a reevaluation of aspartame's safety in humans,&lt;ref name=CSPItoFDA&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abdo |first1=KM |last2=Camargo Jr |first2=CA |last3=Davis |first3=D |last4=Egilman |first4=D |last5=Epstein |first5=SS |last6=Froines |first6=J |last7=Hattis |first7=D |last8=Hooper |first8=K |last9=Huff |first9=J |title=Letter to U.S. FDA commissioner.

After reviewing the foundation's claims, the EFSA&lt;ref name="EFSA report"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) related to a new long-term carcinogenicity study on aspartame |journal=The EFSA Journal |year=2006 |volume=356 |pages=1–44 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2006.356}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the FDA&lt;ref name=FDAstatement/&gt; discounted the study results and found no reason to revise their previously established acceptable daily intake levels for aspartame. Reported flaws were numerous and included, but were not limited to, the following: comparing cancer rates of older aspartame-consuming rats to younger control rats; unspecified composition of the "Corticella" diet and method of adding aspartame, leading to possible nutritional deficiencies; unspecified aspartame storage conditions; lack of animal randomization; overcrowding and a high incidence of possibly carcinogenic infections; and the U.S. [[National Toxicology Program]]'s finding that the ERF had misdiagnosed [[hyperplasia]]s as malignancies.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; Reviews by the FDA and EFSA were hampered by the refusal of the Ramazzini Foundation to release all data and pathology slides, but from the materials received, the FDA&lt;ref name=FDAstatement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm208580.htm |title=US FDA/CFSAN – FDA Statement on European Aspartame Study |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923210555/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm208580.htm |archivedate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and EFSA&lt;ref name=EFSAReview2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food |title=Updated opinion on a request from the European Commission related to the 2nd ERF carcinogenicity study on aspartame, taking into consideration study data submitted by the Ramazzini Foundation in February 2009 |journal=The EFSA Journal |year=2009 |volume=1015 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1015}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the data did not support the researcher's published conclusions. Evaluation of this research by Health Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Canada Comments on the Recent Study Relating to the Safety of Aspartame|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/addit/sweeten-edulcor/aspartame_statement-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British government's Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on a Carcinogenicity Study of Aspartame by the European Ramazzini Foundation|url=http://www.iacoc.org.uk/statements/documents/COC06S2AspartamestatementDec2006_000.pdf|publisher=Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise found methodological problems with the research and did not recommend any further reconsideration of the recommended intake of aspartame in their respective countries.

A review of the literature concurred with these evaluations, finding many possible flaws in the study's design and conclusions. These conclusions are also contradicted by other carcinogenicity studies which found no significant danger. This review therefore concluded this research did not constitute credible evidence for the carcinogenicity of aspartame.&lt;ref name=Magnuson /&gt; Another review criticized the Ramazzini Foundation for relying on "[[science by press conference]]" with its release of results through the media before being published in a proper [[peer-review]]ed journal, thus helping fuel the controversy and publicity about the study in the media.&lt;ref name=Lofstedt&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lofstedt |first1= Ragnar E |authorlink= Ragnar Löfstedt |title=Risk Communication, Media Amplification and the Aspartame Scare |journal=Risk Management |volume=10 |pages=257–84 |year=2008 |doi=10.1057/rm.2008.11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another carcinogenicity study in rodents published by this foundation in 2010 was evaluated by the EFSA and was found to have multiple significant design flaws and could not be interpreted. The EFSA therefore concluded this study did not provide enough evidence to reconsider previous evaluation of aspartame safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EFSA reviews two publications on the safety of artificial sweeteners|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/ans110228|publisher=EFSA|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first episode of the four-part series '''Bedlam''' was broadcast on Thursday, 31 October 2013 at 9&amp;nbsp;pm on C4.

The first programme, '''Anxiety''', follow patients through the 18-bed Anxiety and Disorders Residential Unit at [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]. This national unit treats the most anxious people in the country - the top one per cent - and claims a success rate of three in four patients. Some are consumed by irrational fears they’ve caused a road accident in their sleep, harmed strangers or have intrusive thoughts.

The second programme is called '''Crisis'''. Cameras are allowed in [[Lambeth Hospital]] Triage ward for the first time. This is the Accident and Emergency of mental health - where patients are at their most unwell. This episode features Medical Director Dr Martin Baggaley who has spoken out about the pressure facing mental health services in England.&lt;ref&gt;BBC [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24537304 / England’s mental health services ‘in crisis’]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third programme, '''Psychosis''', films a community mental health team. [[South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust]] provides support for more than 35,000 people with mental health problems.

The final programme, '''Breakdown''', focuses on older adults, including the inpatient ward for people over 65 with mental health problems at [[Maudsley Hospital]].

==Name==
The title ‘Bedlam’ was decided upon both by SLaM, Channel 4 and The Garden Productions. It is based on the fact that SLaM can trace its roots back to 1247 when the Priory of St Mary of Bethlehem was established in the City of London. The priory, which became a refuge for the sick and infirm, was known as ‘Bedlam’ and was the earliest form of what is now Bethlem Royal Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrews|Briggs|Porter|Tucker|1997|pp=15, 23}}; {{harvnb|Vincent|1998|p=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The title has generated concern and criticism from some mental health campaigners because of what is seen as the negative, stigmatising associations with the term ‘Bedlam’.&lt;ref&gt;Sectioned [http://sectioneduk.wordpress.com/2013/10/02/can-stigma-be-challenged-by-evoking-negative-steretypes-bedlam/ Can stigma be challenged by evoking stigmatising stereotypes? From the Maudsley to Bethlem]&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Trust set out the process and thinking which led to the name being agreed.&lt;ref&gt;South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust [http://www.slam.nhs.uk/media/bedlam-on-c4/behind-the-scenes/whats-behind-the-name/ What’s behind the name]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Capital punishment]] in [[Gibraltar]]''' included public execution in the nineteenth century until 1864. The last sentence of death was passed in 1952. Under British law, capital punishment was almost abolished in 1965,&lt;ref name=Today/&gt; in line with [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|British practice]].

==History==
During the 18th and 19th centuries a [[gallows]] was accessible from within the 18th century tunnels inside [[Willis' Gallery]] in the northeastern part of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. The nearest entrance to this part of the tunnel system is by [[Princess Anne's Battery]]. The gallows and floggings were administered in sight of the Spanish troops&lt;ref name=flog&gt;{{cite web|title=Willis's Gallery (B)|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com/pages/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|publisher=DiscoverGibraltar.com|accessdate=24 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905140025/http://www.discovergibraltar.com/pages/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who manned the [[Spanish Lines]] across the [[isthmus]] (the Spanish fortifications were later dismantled).

Prior to the foundation of the [[Alameda Gardens]] in 1816, its location (the [[Grand Parade, Gibraltar|Grand Parade]], an assembly ground situated to the south of the town, beyond [[Southport Gates]]) was the place of public executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Our Gibraltar | first=Dorothy | last=Ellicott | year=1975 | publisher=Gibraltar Museum Committee | authorlink=Dorothy Ellicott | pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, public military [[hanging]]s were carried out at [[Grand Casemates Square]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/travel/the-original-rock-star-20090212-85qm.html The Sydney Morning Herald - The Original Rock Star (15 February 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; with the last one held in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=William Jackson (British Army officer) | last=Jackson | first=William | year=1990 | title=The Rock of the Gibraltarians.

Subsequent hangings took place at the HM Prison [[Moorish Castle]].

Gibraltar's last hanging for [[murder]] took place on 3 July 1931 when 31-year-old [[Ernest Opisso]] went to the [[gallows]]. He was [[execution|executed]] for the murder of his employer in the flat above her shop where they both worked. It was the first execution in Gibraltar since 1896.&lt;ref name=CPUK/&gt;

Two [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] from [[La Línea de la Concepción]] recruited by the German intelligence service, the [[Abwehr]], 23-year-old [[Luis López Cordón Cuenca]] and 19-year-old [[José Martín Muñoz]], were hanged on 11 January 1944&lt;ref name=Today/&gt; for [[Offence (law)|offences]] committed during [[World War II]].

===International career===
Steen won his first national title as a teenager in 1960, winning the [[hammer throw]], which was not very developed at a national level at that point. His first national title in the shot put came at the [[Canadian Track and Field Championships]] in 1962. His winning mark of {{T&amp;Fcalc|17.20}} was by far the best ever performance in the competition's history at that point.&lt;ref name=NC&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/nc/can.htm Canadian Championships]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2015-04-03.&lt;/ref&gt; This earned him his first major international call-up for the [[Athletics at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]], held in [[Perth, Australia]]. There he had a throw of {{T&amp;Fcalc|17.90}}, which would have won all previous titles but on this occasion was a close third behind [[Martyn Lucking]] and [[Mike Lindsay]].&lt;ref name=CWG&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cg.htm Commonwealth Games]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2015-04-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1963 [[track and field]] season he achieved a [[Canadian records in athletics|Canadian record]] of {{T&amp;Fcalc|18.88}},&lt;ref name=Brink/&gt; having previously become the first Canadian to clear the sixty foot mark. This mark ranked him seventh globally that year.&lt;ref name=HOF/&gt; He was among Canada's top prospects for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], but in 1963 he criticised the attitude of officials at the [[Canadian Amateur Athletic Union]], saying that they were not sufficiently concerned with the well-being of the nation's athletes.&lt;ref name=Varsity/&gt; Suffering heavily from [[infectious mononucleosis]], he ultimately missed the entire 1964 season, including the Olympic competition. The launch of the [[Canada Fitness Council]], supported by the [[Royal Canadian Legion]], marked a turnaround in his fortunes. Steen credited the organisation with improving his career by assisting with living costs and subsidising travel to international competitions.&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

Steen returned to form in 1965 with a second career title at the Canadian Championships and a season's best of {{T&amp;Fcalc|18.52}}. He also won his first national title in the discus throw, doing so with {{T&amp;Fcalc|51.62}}. The following year he set a new shot put personal best of {{T&amp;Fcalc|19.12}} to win the Canadian title in a championship record. This mark ranked him eleventh in the world that season and went unbettered nationally until [[Bruce Pirnie]]'s 1972 win.&lt;ref name=Brink/&gt;&lt;ref name=NC/&gt;  The [[Athletics at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] saw Steen became Canada's first ever shot put gold medallist at the competition. His winning throw of {{T&amp;Fcalc|18.79}} was a large improvement on the [[List of Commonwealth Games records in athletics|Commonwealth Games record]] set by Lucking four years earlier.&lt;ref name=CWG/&gt; In addition to the shot put, he competed in the discus event and placed fourth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecgf.com/games/results.asp?gameid=3036&amp;sportid=1469-publisher= 1966 Results for Athletics - Discus Throw - Men].

He took a shot put and discus double at the 1967 national championships and his best throw that year was {{T&amp;Fcalc|18.55}}.&lt;ref name=Brink/&gt;&lt;ref name=NC/&gt; He came close to that seasonal peak at the [[Athletics at the 1967 Pan American Games|1967 Pan American Games]], which were held on home turf in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, Canada. He was the bronze medallist behind two Americans who were world leaders at that point: [[Randy Matson]], who was Olympic champion the year after, and [[Neal Steinhauer]], the top ranked putter in 1969. Steen's 1967 medal was Canada's first in the Pan American men's shot put (his compatriot [[Nancy McCredie]] won the women shot that year).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/pag.htm Pan American Games]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2015-04-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steen was Canadian champion in the shot put in both 1968 and 1969, solidifying an unbeaten run from 1965. The latter title was his last at national level.&lt;ref name=NC/&gt; He was selected for the Canadian team for the inaugural [[1969 Pacific Conference Games]] and a performance of {{T&amp;Fcalc|18.54}} in the shot put and {{T&amp;Fcalc|54.94}} in the discus brought him two bronze medals.

The 28-year-old successfully topped the podium again, winning the gold medal with a new games record (and lifetime best) of {{T&amp;Fcalc|19.21}}. He was the first man to defend that title since [[Harry Hart (athlete)|Harry Hart]] did so in 1934.&lt;ref name=CWG/&gt; He again competed in the discus throw as well, and ranked tenth with a mark of {{T&amp;Fcalc|50.64}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecgf.com/search/athlete.asp?athleteid=38445 Dave Steen].

==Overview==
The 1940s and 1950s were considered a period of widespread poverty, few social services, and Catholic predominance in Quebec. The [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s had not yet occurred, so the [[Roman Catholic Church]] still held major social power.&lt;ref name=Farnsworth&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farnsworth|first1=Clyde H.|title=Orphans of 1950s, Telling of Abuse, Sue Quebec|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/world/orphans-of-the-1950-s-telling-of-abuse-sue-quebec.html?pagewanted=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=February 3, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=May 21, 1993|ref=power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Duplessis]], the [[premier of Quebec]], was a strict Catholic. The Church in Canada, as elsewhere in the world, was inclined to be a caretaker of the poor, alcoholics, unwed mothers, and orphans.&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pauin|first1=Marguerite|title=Maurice Duplessis: Powerbroker, Politician|date=2005|publisher=XYZ Publishing|location=Montreal: QC|isbn=1-894852-17-6|page=46|ref=orphans}}&lt;/ref&gt; He put the schools, orphanages, and hospitals in the hands of religious orders, noting he "trusted them completely". He signed an [[order-in-council]], changing orphanages into hospitals in order to provide them with federal [[subsidies]].&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pauin|title=Maurice Duplessis: Powerbroker, Politician|page=196|ref=subsidies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many children were admitted to orphanages because they were abandoned by their parents, not because they were orphans, but often because their parents were unmarried. Children born out of [[Marriage|wedlock]] suffered from poor care.&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thifault|first1=Marie-Claude|last2=Perreault|first2=Isabelle|title=The Social Integration of the Mentally Ill in Quebec Prior to the Bédard Report of 1962|journal=Canadian Bulletin of Medical History|date=2002|volume=29|issue=1|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quebec government received subsidies from the federal government for building hospitals, but hardly anything for having orphanages. Government contributions were only $1.25 a day for orphans, but $2.75 a day for psychiatric patients,&lt;ref name=Farnsworth/&gt; providing a strong financial incentive for reclassification.

The ''Loi sur les Asiles d'aliénés'' (Lunatic Asylum Act) of 1909 governed mental institution admissions until 1950. The law stated the [[insane]] could be committed for three reasons: to care for them, to help them, or as a measure to maintain social order in public and private life. However, the act did not define what a disruption of social order was, leaving the decision to admit patients up to the psychiatrists.{{sfn|Thifault, p.133}}

The doctors falsely{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source of when the diagnosis was declared "falsely". |date=October 2017}} diagnosed the children with various [[mental illnesses]] while ignoring their actual mental state. Children in Quebec orphanages were therefore declared "mentally deficient". Schooling stopped, and the orphans became inmates in a mental institution where they were sexually, physically, and mentally abused by lay monitors and nuns. Children who complained about the conditions were sent to local [[reform schools]].&lt;ref name=Farnsworth/&gt;

Seven religious orders participated: the [[Sisters of Providence (Montreal)|Sisters of Providence]], the [[Sisters of Mercy]], the Gray Nuns of Montreal, the [[Sisters of Charity of Quebec]], the [[Little Franciscans of Mary]], the [[Brothers of Notre-Dame-de-la-Misericorde]], and the [[Brothers of Charity]].&lt;ref name=Farnsworth/&gt;

A [[:wikt:commission|commission]] in the early 1960s investigating mental institutions after Duplessis' death revealed one-third of the 22,000 patients did not belong.&lt;ref name=Farnsworth/&gt;

The Bédard report of 1962 put an end to the outdated concept of an "asylum," while many of the orphans reached adulthood and could leave the facility.{{sfn|Thifault, p.133}}

Years later, long after these institutions were closed, the children who had survived them and become adults began to speak out about the harsh treatment and [[sexual abuse]] they endured at the hands of some members of institutions and medical personnel.&lt;ref name="Ref 13"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 Protesters in straitjackets demand inquiry of Duplessis Orphans era February 19, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 Allegations of child abuse April 2, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 Orphans sue Catholic orders over mistreatment May 21, 1993 B/W Photo of Denis Coque, Silvio Day, Hervé Bertrand, Yvette Gascon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a psychiatric study completed by one of the involved hospitals, middle-aged Duplessis Orphans reported more physical and mental impairments than the control group. In addition, the orphans were less likely to be married or to have a healthy social life. 80% reported they had suffered a traumatic experience between the ages of 7 to 18.  Over 50% said they had undergone physical, mental, or sexual abuse. About 78% reported difficulty functioning socially or emotionally in their adult life.&lt;ref name="Ref 14"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigal|first1=John|last2=Christopher|first2=J.|last3=Rossignal|first3=Michel|last4=Ouimet|first4=Marie-Claude|last5=Boucher|first5=Sophie|last6=Paré|first6=Nikolas|title=Health and Psychological Adaptation of les Enfants du Duplessis as Middle-Aged Adults|date=July 31, 2002|pages=15–16|ref=life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal recourse in the 1990s==
By the 1990s, there remained about 3,000 survivors and a large group formed to start a campaign. They called themselves the ''Duplessis Orphans'' after Maurice Duplessis, the Premier of Quebec during that time whose government was responsible for their plight. In addition to government and Church responsibility, the College of Physicians of Quebec came under fire after some of the orphans found copies of their medical records that had been falsified. Labelled as mentally deficient, many of these children were subjected to electroshock, a variety of drug testing and used in other [[Human experimentation|medical experiments]].&lt;ref name = "CBC Digital Archives"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/youth/the-duplessis-orphans/medical-experimentation.html Medical Experimentation] at Duplessis Orphans' CBC Digital Archives&lt;/ref&gt; Released upon reaching the legal age of maturity, they were uneducated and ill-equipped to cope with life as adults.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

At first, the [[government of Quebec]] [[wikt:stonewall|stonewall]]ed them, but after they started gaining widespread publicity in March 1999, the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' government made a token offer of approximately $15,000 as full compensation to each of the victims. The offer was rejected and the government was harshly criticized by the public and even the provincial Ombudsman, Daniel Jacoby, came out saying that the government's handling of the situation had [[minimisation (psychology)|trivialized]] the abuse the victims alleged.&lt;ref name = "CBC 1999"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/youth/the-duplessis-orphans/a-modest-offer-and-apology-rejected.html Modest Offer, Apology Rejected] at Duplessis Orphans' CBC Digital Archives&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the government still refused to hold an inquiry. In 2001, the claimants received an increased offer from the Quebec government for a flat payment of $10,000 per person, plus an additional $1,000 for each year of wrongful confinement to a mental institution.&lt;ref name = "CBC"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2001/06/30/orphans_010630.html "Duplessis orphans accept Quebec's final offer"], CBC News, July 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The offer amounted to approximately $15,000 per orphan; however, it was limited to each of the surviving 1,100 orphans the government had labeled as mentally deficient, but did not include any compensation for victims of sexual or other abuse.

The offer was accepted by those eligible while the remainder received nothing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The vote on the offer was taken by a show of hands in a closed-door session overseen by Committee chief, the author [[Bruno Roy]], one of very few orphans who enjoyed a successful career following the traumatic experience of youth detention. The results of the vote were later bitterly contested by a group which believed the victims should have received more.&lt;ref name = "Mirror2002"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2002/070402/ncity.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120603155543/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2002/070402/ncity.html |title= Orphans oust controversial |work= [[Montreal Mirror]] |archivedate= June 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe that justice was not done and criminal wrongdoing was allowed to go unpunished.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;[http://91.190.232.206:8080/predmet/inostr/deti-siroty/Children.pdf "Seven Institutionalized Children and Their Adaptation in Late Adulthood: The Children of Duplessis"J.Christopher Perry, John J.Sigal, Sophie Boucher, and Nikolas Paré] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065319/http://91.190.232.206:8080/predmet/inostr/deti-siroty/Children.pdf |date=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quebec Government declined to prosecute the criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=20010703&amp;id=Eto0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JCEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7064,243210 Orphans accept settlement July 3, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
Opponents of the judgment led by [[Rod Vienneau]] of [[Joliette]], Quebec, pointed out that three of the bureaucrats running the compensation program were being paid over $1,000 per day of work,&lt;ref name = "Mirror2003"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2003/070303/front.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120630174514/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2003/070303/front.html | work= [[Montreal Mirror]] | title= Everyone gets rich except Orphans |archivedate= June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the orphans themselves received the same amount for an entire year of their childhood confined illegally to insane asylums.

The Catholic Church publicly announced that they played no responsibility in the orphans' situation and refused to apologize.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Victoria|title=The Duplessis Orphans at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights: Healing through Representation|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2013|volume=19|issue=4|page=377|ref=apologize}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representative for the seven orders, Sister Gisele Fortier, called the allegations "upsetting ... but very much sensationalized, and needs to be put into context."&lt;ref name="ref 2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farnsworth|title=Orphans of the 1950s, Telling of Abuse, Sue Quebec|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/world/orphans-of-the-1950-s-telling-of-abuse-sue-quebec.html?pagewanted=2&amp;pagewanted=all|ref=context}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Jean-Claude Turcotte]], [[archbishop of Montreal]], asserted that the religious orders "deserve our respect and have a right to their good name." This offended many of the Duplessis Orphans. In 2006, one of the Orphans, Martin Lécuyer, stated "it's important for me, that the church, the priests, that they recognize they were responsible for the sexual abuse, and the aggression. It's not for the government to set that peace ... It's an insult, and it's the biggest proof that the government is an accomplice of the church."&lt;ref name="ref 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|title=The Duplessis Orphans at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights|page=376|accessdate=February 3, 2015|ref=government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 1999, Researchers Léo-Paul Lauzon and Martin Poirier issued a report arguing that the Quebec government and the Roman Catholic Church made substantial profits by falsely certifying thousands of Quebec orphans as mentally ill during the 1940s and 1950s. The authors made a conservative estimate that religious groups received $70&amp;nbsp;million in subsidies (measured in 1999 dollars) by claiming the children as "mentally deficient," while the government saved $37&amp;nbsp;million simply by having one of its orphanages redesignated from an educational institution to a psychiatric hospital. A representative of a religious order involved with the orphanages accused the authors of making "false assertions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Léo-Paul Lauzon#Other writings]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the remains==
In 2004, members of the "Duplessis Orphans" asked the Quebec government to unearth an abandoned cemetery in the east end of Montreal which they believed held the remains of orphans who may have been the subject of medical experiments. According to testimony by individuals who were at the Cité de St-Jean-de-Dieu insane asylum, the orphans were routinely experimented upon and many died. The group wants the government to exhume the bodies so that autopsies may be performed.&lt;ref name = "CBC 2004"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/06/18/duplessis_cemetery040618.html | publisher= CBC | title= Duplessis orphans seek proof of medical experiments |date= June 18, 2004 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100409014034/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/06/18/duplessis_cemetery040618.html | archivedate= April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 13, 2015, a new interview with one of the survivors was conducted on RT.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/shows/in-the-now-summary/325769-duplessis-orphans-atrocity-children/ Duplessis Orphans (S3E8)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14931">'''Extracellular digestion''' is a process in which [[saprobionts]] feed by secreting [[enzymes]] through the [[cell membrane]] onto the food. The enzymes catalyze the digestion of the food into [[molecule]]s small enough to be taken up by passive diffusion, transport, or [[phagocytosis]]. Since [[digestion]] occurs outside the cell, it is said to be extracellular. It takes place either in the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[digestive system]], in a gastric cavity or other digestive organ, or completely outside the body.

The prefix "extra" means "outside", and indicates that extracellular digestion must occur outside the cell. During extracellular digestion, food is broken down outside the cell either mechanically or with acid by special molecules called enzymes. Then the newly broken down nutrients can be absorbed by the cells nearby. Humans use extracellular digestion when they eat. Their teeth grind the food, enzymes and acid in the [[stomach]] liquefy it, and additional enzymes in the [[small intestine]] break the food down into parts their cells can use.

Although [[fungi]] do not have a digestive tract like humans, they still use extracellular digestion. Fungi and other decomposers utilize nutrients derived from breaking down the substrate they grow on. Another example of extracellular digestion being used is in the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], or [[sea anemone]]. A large cavity, called the [[gastrovascular cavity]], fills the center of the animal, with one opening for both food and waste. When unsuspecting prey swim into the opening, [[stinging cell]]s paralyze the prey. The hydra uses its tentacles to push the prey further into the cavity, where enzymes are secreted to break down the food. Once the food is broken down extracellularly into nutrients, the cells of the hydra can absorb it for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=James|title=How Life Works|date=2013|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extracellular digestion is a form of digestion found in all saprobiontic [[annelids]], [[crustacean]]s, [[arthropod]]s, [[lichen]]s and [[chordates]], including [[vertebrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Biology Principles, p296, fig 14.16—Diagram detailing the re-absorption of substrates within the hypha.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Advanced biology principles, p 296—states the purpose of saprotrophs and their internal nutrition, as well as the main two types of fungi that are most often referred to, as well as describes, visually, the process of saprotrophic nutrition through a diagram of hyphae, referring to the Rhizobium on damp, stale whole-meal bread or rotting fruit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, C. J.; Mackean, D. G. (2006). Advanced Biology: Principles and Applications, 2nd ed. Hodder Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fungi ==

Fungi are [[heterotrophic]] organisms. Heterotrophic nutrition means that fungi utilize extracellular sources of organic energy, [[organic material]] or organic matter, for their maintenance, growth and reproduction. Energy is derived from the breakdown of the chemical bond between carbon and either carbon or other components of compounds such as a [[phosphate ion]]. The extracellular sources of energy may be [[simple sugar]]s, [[polypeptide]]s or more [[complex carbohydrate]].

Fungi can only absorb small molecules through their walls. For fungi to gain their energy needs, they find and absorb organic molecules appropriate to their needs, either immediately or following some form of enzyme diminution outside the [[thallus]]. The small molecules are then absorbed, used directly or reconstituted (transformed) into organic molecules within the cell.

When a [[skeletonization|skeletonized]] leaf is seen in the litter, it is because [[wikt:recalcitrant|recalcitrant]] materials remain and digestion is continuing. The fungi that utilize a variety of energy sources usually absorb the simplest compounds first, then the more complex. For instance, the formation of [[cellulose]] is repressed by high concentrations of [[glucose]] in the [[cytoplasm]]. On depletion of primary sources of glucose, enzymes to degrade more complex molecules such as cellulose and [[starch]], are then released. Thus soluble sugars and [[amino acid]]s are removed first from a leaf released from a tree. Starch is then broken down and absorbed. Subsequently, [[pectin]] and cellulose are digested. Finally, [[wax]]es are degraded and [[lignin]] [[Redox|oxidized]]. The staggering of energy acquisition results in the efficient utilization of available energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Ingold|first1 = C. T.|title = The Biology of Fungi|date = 1993|location = London|publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall|first2 = Harry J.|last2 = Hudson|isbn = 978-0412490408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detection of digestive enzymes in fungi ==

The regulation of nutrient acquisition appears to be controlled by general phenomena. Only a small group of enzymes, mostly [[hydrolase]]s, can be detected in the culture filtrate of well-fed fungi. This suggests that specific inducers control the manufacture and release of enzymes for degradation. The most common complex carbohydrate available in the environment is cellulose. In the absence of glucose, detection of cellulose, for instance, induces the expression of celluloses. As a consequence, fungi specifically target the breakdown of the cellulose in their environment, and do not waste energy on the unnecessary formation of enzymes for degradation of molecules that may not be present. Fungi have an efficient process to gain energy.

Because of the huge range of potential food sources, fungi have evolved enzymes suitable for the environments in which they are usually found. The range of enzymes, though wide in many species, is not sufficient for survival in all environments. Fungi require other competitive attributes to ensure continued survival.

The opposite is also true. Some fungi have highly specific metabolic capabilities which enable occupation of specific habitats, utilizing molecules which are unavailable to other fungi. Further, utilization of a common and abundant [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] has led many fungi to evolve a range of highly specific degradative enzymes. Among the fungi are species that are generalist in their nutrient requirements, some that have specific nutrient requirements, and many that are in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Jennings|first1 = D. H.|title = The Physiology of Fungal Nutrition|date = March 1995|publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge|isbn = 9780521038164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Execration of digestive enzymes ==

[[File:Single lycoperdon perlatum.jpg|thumb|''[[Lycoperdon perlatum]]'']]
Enzymes are manufactured close to the hyphal tip. Some are packaged in vesicles associated with the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] and then delivered to the hyphal tip. The contents are released at the tip. Some enzymes are actively excreted through the [[plasma membrane]], where they diffuse through or act in the cell wall.  Note that the enzymes released from the hyphal tip require an aqueous environment for release and subsequent degradative activity.

=== Absorption of digested products ===

The molecules absorbed through the plasma membrane tend to be smaller than 5,000 Da, so only simple sugars, amino acids, [[fatty acid]]s and other small molecules can be taken up following digestion. The molecules are taken up in solution. In some cases, the molecules are processed by enzymes located within the cell wall. For instance, sucrose inverters have been localized in walls of yeasts. Glucose appears to be the sugar preferred by most fungi. Uptake of other sugars is repressed when glucose is available. Similarly, [[ammonium]], [[glutamine]] and [[asparagine]] regulate the uptake of nitrogen compounds, and [[cysteine]] of sulphur compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Neville J|title = Fungal Ecology|date = 1995|location = London|isbn = 978-94-010-4299-4|page=278|first2 = John|last = Dix|last2 = Webster|publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joint intracellular and extracellular digestion in cnidarians ==

[[File:Cnidarian Polyp.jpg|thumb|Cnidarian polyp]]
Joint intracellular and extracellular digestion In hydra and other [[cnidarian]]s, the food is caught by the tentacles and ingested through the mouth into the single large digestive cavity, the [[gastrovascular cavity]]. Enzymes are secreted from the cells bordering this cavity and poured on the food for extracellular digestion. Small particles of the partially digested food are engulfed into the [[vacuole]]s of the digestive cells for [[intracellular digestion]]. Any undigested and un-absorbed food is finally thrown out of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=B. Reece|first1=Jane|title=Campbell Biology|publisher=Wolher and creck company|location=United states|page=276|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invert digestive systems are bags and tubes ==
[[Single-celled organism]]s as well as [[sponge]]s digest their food intracellularly. Other [[Multicellular organism|multi-cellular organisms]] digest their food extracellularly, within a digestive cavity. In this case the [[digestive enzyme]]s are released into a cavity that is continuous with the animal's external environment. In cnidarians and in [[flatworm]]s such as [[planarian]]s, the digestive cavity, called a gastrovascular cavity, has only one opening that serves as both mouth and anus. There is no specialization within this type of digestive system because every cell is exposed to all stages of food digestion.

Specializing occurs when the digestive tract or alimentary canal has a separate mouth and anus so that transport of food is one-way. The most primitive digestive tract is seen in [[nematode]]s (phylum Nematode), where it is simply a tubular gut lined by an [[epithelial]] membrane. Earthworms (phylum Annelids) have a digestive tract specialized in different regions for the ingestion, storage, fragmentation, digestion and absorption of food. All more complex animal groups, including all vertebrates,  show similar specializations. 

The ingested food may be stored in a specialized region of the digestive tract or subjected to physical fragmentation. This fragmentation may occur through the chewing action of teeth (in the mouth of many vertebrates) or the grinding action of pebbles (in the gizzard of earthworms and birds).
Chemical digestion then occurs, breaking down the larger food molecules of [[polysaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s, fats, and proteins into their smallest sub-units.

Chemical digestion involves [[hydrolysis]] reactions that liberate the sub unit molecules—primarily [[monosaccharide]]s, amino acids and fatty acids—from the food. These products of chemical digestion pass through the epithelial lining of the gut into the blood, in a process known as absorption. Any molecules in the food that are not absorbed cannot be used by the animal. These waste products are excreted, or defecated from the anus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Susan|first1=Singer|title=Biology|date=2009|publisher=Library of congress cataloging|location=Harvard University|page=92|edition=ninth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracellular digestion in other animals ==

=== Annelids ===

[[File:Pontobdella muricata.png|thumb|A piscicolid leech]]
The [[echiuran]] gut is long and highly convoluted, and there is no gut in [[Siboglinidae|pogonophoran]] adults. Among other annelids, the gut is linear and unsegmented, with a mouth opening on the [[peristomium]] and an anus opening at the posterior end of the animal ([[pygidium]]). Food is moved through the gut by cilia and/or by [[muscular contraction]]s. Digestion is primarily extracellular, although some species show an intracellular component as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pechenik|first1=Jan|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|date=1976|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Tufs University|page=305|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arthropods ===

The [[arthropod]] digestive system is divisible into three areas: the fore gut, mid gut, and hind gut. All free-living species exhibit a distinct and separate mouth and anus, and in all species, food must be moved through the digestive tract by muscular activity rather than [[cilia]] activity since the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the fore gut and hind gut is lined with [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]]. Digestion is generally extracellular. Nutrients are distributed to the tissues through the hemal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Susan|first1=Singer|title=Biology|date=2009|publisher=Library of congress cataloging|location=Harvard University|page=374|edition=ninth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molluscs ===

[[File:Chiton-bottom-view.jpg|thumb|Bottom view of a [[chiton]]]]
Most [[mollusc]]s have a complete digestive system with a separate mouth and anus. The mouth leads into a short [[esophagus]] which leads to a stomach. Associated with the stomach are one or more [[digestive gland]]s or digestive [[Cecum|caeca]]. Digestive enzymes are secreted into the lumen of these glands. Additional extracellular digestion takes place in the stomach. In [[cephalopod]]s, digestion is entirely extracellular. In the most other mollusks, the terminal stages of digestion are completed intracellularly, within the tissue of the digestive glands. The absorbed nutrients enter the [[circulatory system]] for distribution throughout the body or are stored in the digestive glands for later use. Undigested waste pass through an intestine and out through the anus. Other aspects of food collection and processing have already been discussed where appropriate for each group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pechenik|first1=Jan|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|date=1976|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Tufs University|page=257|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humans ===

[[File:Aparato digestivo.jpg|thumb|Extracellular digestion in humans occurs from the ''boca'' to the ''estómago'' (mouth and stomach respectively in Spanish)]]
The initial components of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] are the mouth and the [[pharynx]], which is the common passage of the oral and nasal cavities. The pharynx leads to the esophagus, a muscular tube that delivers food to the stomach, where some preliminary digestion occurs; here, the digestion is extracellular.

From the stomach, food passes to the [[small intestine]], where a battery of digestive enzymes continue the digestive process. The products of digestion are absorbed across the wall of the intestine into the [[bloodstream]]. What remains is emptied into the [[large intestine]], where some of the remaining water and minerals are absorbed; here the digestion is intracellular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Susan|first1=Singer|title=Biology|date=2009|publisher=Library of congress cataloging|location=Harvard University|page=989|edition=ninth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Mechanical failure modes}}

'''Fouling''' is the accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces to the detriment of function. The fouling materials can consist of either living organisms ([[biofouling]]) or a non-living substance (inorganic and/or organic). Fouling is usually distinguished from other surface-growth phenomena, in that it occurs on a surface of a component, system or plant performing a defined and useful function, and that the fouling process impedes or interferes with this function.

Other terms used in the literature to describe fouling include: deposit formation, encrustation, crudding, deposition, scaling, scale formation, slagging, and sludge formation. The last six terms have a more narrow meaning than fouling within the scope of the fouling science and technology, and they also have meanings outside of this scope; therefore, they should be used with caution.

Fouling phenomena are common and diverse, ranging from fouling of ship hulls, natural surfaces in the marine environment ([[fouling community|marine fouling]]), fouling of [[heat exchanger|heat-transfer]] components through ingredients contained in the [[cooling water]] or gases, and even the development of [[dental plaque|plaque]] or [[Calculus (dental)|calculus]] on teeth, or deposits on solar panels on Mars, among other examples.

This article is primarily devoted to the fouling of industrial heat exchangers, although the same theory is generally applicable to other varieties of fouling. In the cooling technology and other technical fields, a distinction is made between macro fouling and micro fouling. Of the three, micro fouling is the one which is usually more difficult to prevent and therefore less important.

==Components subject to fouling==

Following are examples of components that may be subject to fouling and the corresponding effects of fouling:

*[[Heat exchanger]] surfaces – reduces thermal efficiency, decreases heat flux, increases temperature on the hot side, decreases temperature on the cold side, induces under-deposit corrosion, increases use of cooling water;
*Piping, flow channels – reduces flow, increases pressure drop, increases upstream pressure, increases energy expenditure, may cause flow oscillations, slugging in two-phase flow, cavitation; may increase flow velocity elsewhere, may induce vibrations, may cause flow blockage;
*Ship hulls – creates additional [[drag (physics)|drag]], increases fuel usage, reduces maximum speed;&lt;ref&gt;"Marine fouling and its prevention"; prepared for Bureau of Ships, Navy Dept, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, United States, Navy Dept. Bureau of Ship, 1952. [https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/191 (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Turbine]]s – reduces efficiency, increases probability of failure;
*Solar panels – decreases the electrical power generated;
*[[Membrane fouling|Reverse osmosis membranes]] – increases pressure drop, increases energy expenditure, reduces flux, membrane failure (in severe cases);&lt;ref name="memfoul"&gt;Siobhán Francesca E. Boerlage, "Scaling and Particulate Fouling in Membrane Filtration Systems", Taylor &amp; Francis; 2001, {{ISBN|90-5809-242-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=SqHUSd3vk1oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false (Google books)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Electrical [[heating element]]s – increases temperature of the element, increases corrosion, reduces lifespan;
*Nuclear fuel in [[pressurized water reactor]]s – axial offset anomaly,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua M. Hawkes, "The Simulation and Study of Conditions Leading to Axial Offset Anomaly in Pressurized Water Reactors", Georgia Institute of Technology Master of Science Thesis, December 2004.

*Injection/spray nozzles (e.g., a nozzle spraying a fuel into a furnace) – incorrect amount injected, malformed jet, component inefficiency, component failure;
*[[Venturi tube]]s, [[orifice plate]]s – inaccurate or incorrect measurement of flow rate;
*[[Pitot tube]]s in airplanes – inaccurate or incorrect indication of airplane speed;
*[[Spark plug]] electrodes in cars – engine misfiring;&lt;ref&gt;"Spark Plug Faces", brochure "Bosch Spark Plugs 0307", Part 1 [http://www.boschautoparts.com/Technical%20Resources/Spark%20Plugs/SparkPlugFaces.pdf (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229143026/http://www.boschautoparts.com/Technical%20Resources/Spark%20Plugs/SparkPlugFaces.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Production zone of [[petroleum reservoir]]s and [[oil well]]s – decreased [[Extraction of petroleum|petroleum production]] with time; plugging; in some cases complete stoppage of flow in a matter of days;&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Mansoori "Physicochemical Basis of Arterial Blockage / Fouling. Prediction and Prevention." Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, on-line publication, September 2001 [http://www.uic.edu/labs/trl/PhysicochemicalBasisOfFouling.pdf (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530224513/http://www.uic.edu/labs/trl/PhysicochemicalBasisOfFouling.pdf |date=2010-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Teeth – promotes tooth or gum disease, decreases aesthetics;
*Living organisms –  deposition of excess minerals (e.g., calcium, iron, copper) in tissues is (sometimes controversially) linked to [[aging]]/[[senescence]].

==Macro fouling==
Macro fouling is caused by [[debris|coarse]] matter of either biological or inorganic origin, for example industrially produced [[refuse]]. Such matter enters into the cooling water circuit through the cooling [[water pump]]s from sources like the open [[sea]], [[river]]s or [[lake]]s. In closed circuits, like [[cooling tower]]s, the ingress of macro fouling into the cooling tower basin is possible through open canals or by the wind. Sometimes, parts of the cooling tower internals detach themselves and are carried into the cooling water circuit. Such substances can foul the surfaces of heat exchangers and may cause deterioration of the relevant [[heat transfer coefficient]]. They may also create flow blockages, redistribute the flow inside the components, or cause [[fretting]] damage.
; Examples:
*Manmade refuse;
*Detached internal parts of components;
*Tools and other "foreign objects" accidentally left after maintenance;
*[[Algae]];
*[[Mussel]]s;
*[[Leaf|Leaves]], parts of plants up to entire [[trunk (botany)|trunk]]s.

==Micro fouling==
As to micro fouling, distinctions are made between:&lt;ref name="bott"&gt;T.R. Bott, "Fouling of Heat Exchangers (Chemical Engineering Monographs)", Elsevier Science, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scaling or precipitation fouling, as [[crystallization]] of solid [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, [[oxide]]s and [[hydroxide]]s from water [[solution]]s, for example, calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate;
*[[Particulate]] fouling, i.e., accumulation of particles, typically  [[colloidal]] particles, on a surface;
*Corrosion fouling, i.e., in-situ growth of [[corrosion]] deposits, for example, magnetite on [[carbon steel]] surfaces;
*Chemical reaction fouling, for example, decomposition or polymerization of organic matter on heating surfaces;
*Solidification fouling - when components of the flowing fluid with a high-melting point freeze onto a subcooled surface;
*[[Biofouling]], like settlements of [[bacteria]] and algae;
*Composite fouling, whereby fouling involves more than one foulant or fouling mechanism.

===Precipitation fouling===
[[File:Limescale-in-pipe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Limescale]] buildup inside a pipe both reduces liquid flow through the pipe, as well as reduces thermal conduction from the liquid to the outer pipe shell. Both effects will reduce the pipe's overall thermal efficiency when used as a [[heat exchanger]].]]
[[File:Temperature dependence calcium sulfate solubility.svg|thumb|400px|Temperature dependence of the solubility of calcium sulfate (3 phases) in pure water. The water is pressurized so that it can be maintained in the liquid state at the elevated temperatures.]]
Scaling or precipitation fouling involves [[crystallization]] of solid [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, [[oxide]]s and [[hydroxide]]s from [[solution]]s. These are most often water solutions, but non-aqueous precipitation fouling is also known. Precipitation fouling is a very common problem in boilers and heat exchangers operating with [[hard water]] and often results in [[limescale]].

Through changes in temperature, or solvent [[evaporation]] or [[degasification]], the concentration of salts may exceed the [[Supersaturation|saturation]], leading to a [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of solids (usually crystals).

As an example, the equilibrium between the readily soluble [[calcium bicarbonate]] - always prevailing in natural water - and the poorly soluble [[calcium carbonate]], the following chemical equation may be written:

:&lt;chem&gt;\mathsf{{Ca(HCO3)2}_{(aqueous)} -&gt; {CaCO3(v)} + {CO2}\!{\uparrow} + H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;

The calcium carbonate that forms through this reaction precipitates. Due to the temperature dependence of the reaction, and increasing volatility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with increasing temperature, the scaling is higher at the hotter outlet of the heat exchanger than at the cooler inlet.

In general, the dependence of the salt [[solubility]] on temperature or presence of evaporation will often be the driving force for precipitation fouling. The important distinction is between salts with "normal" or "retrograde" dependence of solubility on temperature. The salts with the "normal" solubility increase their solubility with increasing temperature and thus will foul the cooling surfaces. The salts with "inverse" or "retrograde" solubility will foul the heating surfaces. An example of the temperature dependence of solubility is shown in the figure.  Calcium sulfate is a common precipitation foulant of heating surfaces due to its retrograde solubility.

Precipitation fouling can also occur in the absence of heating or vaporization. For example, calcium sulfate decreases it solubility with decreasing pressure. This can lead to precipitation fouling of reservoirs and wells in oil fields, decreasing their productivity with time.&lt;ref&gt;J. Moghadasi, H. Müller-Steinhagen, M. Jamialahmadi, and A. Sharif, "Scale Deposition in Porous Media and their Removal by EDTA Injection ", ECI Engineering Conferences International Symposium Series, Heat Exchanger Fouling and Cleaning VII, July 1–6, 2007 - Tomar, Portugal. [http://services.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=eci/heatexchanger2007 (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512042917/http://services.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=eci%2Fheatexchanger2007 |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fouling of membranes in [[reverse osmosis]] systems can occur due to differential solubility of barium sulfate in solutions of different [[ionic strength]].&lt;ref name="memfoul"/&gt; Similarly, precipitation fouling can occur because of solubility changes induced by other factors, e.g., liquid [[Flash evaporation|flashing]], liquid degassing, redox potential changes, or mixing of incompatible fluid streams.

The following lists some of the industrially common phases of precipitation fouling deposits observed in practice to form from aqueous solutions:
*[[Calcium carbonate]] ([[calcite]], [[aragonite]] usually at t &gt; ~50&amp;nbsp;°C, or rarely [[vaterite]]);
*[[Calcium sulfate]] ([[anhydrite]], [[Plaster of Paris|hemihydrate]], [[gypsum]]);
*[[Calcium oxalate]] (e.g., beerstone);
*[[Barium sulfate]] ([[barite]]);
*[[Magnesium hydroxide]] ([[brucite]]); [[magnesium oxide]] ([[periclase]]);
*[[Silicate]]s ([[serpentine group|serpentine]], [[Aegirine|acmite]], [[gyrolite]], [[gehlenite]], amorphous [[silica]], [[quartz]], [[cristobalite]], [[pectolite]], [[xonotlite]]);
*[[Aluminium oxide hydroxide]]s ([[boehmite]], [[gibbsite]], [[diaspore]], [[corundum]]);
* [[Aluminosilicate]]s ([[analcite]], [[cancrinite]], [[noselite]]);
*Copper (metallic [[copper]], [[cuprite]], [[tenorite]]);
*Phosphates ([[hydroxyapatite]]);
*Magnetite or [[nickel ferrite]] (NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) from extremely pure, low-iron water.&lt;ref&gt;"Modeling PWR Fuel Corrosion Product Deposition and Growth Processes (5)", Technical Report 1009734, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deposition rate by precipitation is often described by the following equations:
:Transport:  &lt;math&gt;\frac {dm} {dt} = k_t (C_b-C_i)&lt;/math&gt;
:Surface crystallisation:  &lt;math&gt;\frac {dm} {dt} = {k_r} (C_i-C_e)^{n1}&lt;/math&gt;
:Overall:  &lt;math&gt;\frac {dm} {dt} = k_d (C_b-C_e)^{n2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: m - mass of the material (per unit surface area), kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: t - time, s
: C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; - concentration of the substance in the bulk of the fluid, kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
: C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - concentration of the substance at the interface, kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
: C&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; - equilibrium concentration of the substance at the conditions of the interface, kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
: n1, n2 - [[order of reaction]] for the crystallisation reaction and the overall deposition process, respectively, dimensionless
: k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; - kinetic rate constants for the transport, the surface reaction, and the overall deposition reaction, respectively; with the dimension of m/s (when n1 and n2 = 1)

===Particulate fouling===
Fouling by particles suspended in water ("[[Waste|crud]]") or in gas progresses by a mechanism different than precipitation fouling. This process is usually most important for [[colloidal]] particles, i.e., particles smaller than about 1 μm in at least one dimension  (but which are much larger than atomic dimensions). Particles are transported to the surface by a number of mechanisms and there they can attach themselves, e.g., by [[flocculation]] or [[coagulation]]. Note that the attachment of colloidal particles typically involves electrical forces and thus the particle behaviour defies the experience from the macroscopic world. The probability of attachment is sometimes referred to as "[[sticking probability]]", P:&lt;ref name="bott"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_d = P k_t&lt;/math&gt;

where k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are the kinetic rate constants for deposition and transport, respectively.  The value of P for colloidal particles is a function of both the surface chemistry, geometry, and the local [[thermohydraulic]] conditions.

An alternative to using the sticking probability is to use a kinetic attachment rate constant, assuming the first order reaction:&lt;ref&gt;Eli Ruckenstein and Dennis C. Prieve, "Rate of deposition of Brownian particles under the action of London and double-layer forces", J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. 2, 1973, 69, 1522-1536 [http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1973/F2/F29736901522 (abstract)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce D. Bowen and Norman Epstein, "Fine particle deposition in smooth parallel-plate channels", Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, Volume 72, Issue 1,15 October 1979, Pages 81-97 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002197977990184X (abstract)]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dm} {dt} = {k_a} C_i&lt;/math&gt;

and then the transport and attachment kinetic coefficients are combined as two processes occurring in series:
: &lt;math&gt;k_d = \left( \frac 1 {k_a} + \frac 1 {k_t} \right) ^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dm} {dt} = {k_d} C_b&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* dm/dt is the rate of the deposition by particles, kg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;,
* k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; are the kinetic rate constants for deposition, m/s,
* C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; are the concentration of the particle foulant at the interface and in the bulk fluid, respectively; kg m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Being essentially a [[surface chemistry]] phenomenon, this fouling mechanism can be very sensitive to factors that affect colloidal stability, e.g., [[zeta potential]]. A maximum fouling rate is usually observed when the fouling particles and the substrate exhibit opposite electrical charge, or near the [[point of zero charge]] of either of them.

Particles larger than those of colloidal dimensions may also foul e.g., by sedimentation ("sedimentation fouling") or straining in small-size openings.

With time, the resulting surface deposit may harden through processes collectively known as "deposit consolidation" or, colloquially, "aging".

The common particulate fouling deposits formed from aqueous suspensions include:
*[[Iron oxide|iron oxides and iron oxyhydroxides]] ([[magnetite]], [[hematite]], [[lepidocrocite]], [[maghemite]], [[goethite]]);
*[[Sedimentation]] fouling by [[silt]] and other relatively coarse suspended matter.

Fouling by particles from gas [[aerosol]]s is also of industrial significance. The particles can be either solid or liquid. The common examples can be fouling by [[flue gas]]es, or fouling of air-cooled components by dust in air. The mechanisms are discussed in article on [[deposition (Aerosol physics)|aerosol deposition]].

===Corrosion fouling===
Corrosion deposits are created in-situ by the corrosion of the [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]]. They are distinguished from fouling deposits, which form from material originating ex-situ. Corrosion deposits should not be confused with fouling deposits formed by ex-situ generated corrosion products. Corrosion deposits will normally have composition related to the composition of the substrate. Also, the geometry of the metal-oxide and oxide-fluid interfaces may allow practical distinction between the corrosion and fouling deposits. An example of corrosion fouling can be formation of an iron oxide or oxyhydroxide deposit from corrosion of the carbon steel underneath. Corrosion fouling should not be confused with fouling corrosion, i.e., any of the types of corrosion that may be induced by fouling.

===Chemical reaction fouling===
Chemical reactions may occur on contact of the chemical species in the process fluid with heat transfer surfaces. In such cases, the metallic surface sometimes acts as a [[catalyst]]. For example, corrosion and [[polymerization]] occurs in cooling water for the chemical industry which has a minor content of hydrocarbons. Systems in petroleum processing are prone to polymerization of [[Alkene|olefin]]s or deposition of heavy fractions ([[asphaltene]]s, waxes, etc.). High tube wall temperatures may lead to [[carbonization|carbonizing]] of organic matter.  Food industry, for example milk processing, also experiences fouling problems by chemical reactions.

Fouling through an ionic reaction with an evolution of an inorganic solid is commonly classified as precipitation fouling (not chemical reaction fouling).

===Solidification fouling===
Solidification fouling occurs when a component of the flowing fluid "freezes" onto a surface forming a solid fouling deposit. Examples may include solidification of wax (with a high melting point) from a hydrocarbon solution, or of molten ash (carried in a furnace exhaust gas) onto a heat exchanger surface. The surface needs to have a temperature below a certain threshold; therefore, it is said to be subcooled in respect to the solidification point of the foulant.

===Biofouling===
{{main|Biofouling}}
[[File:MouleZébréeDreissena polymorphaPieceOfCanalLocks.jpg|thumb|right|A fragment of a [[Lock (water transport)|canal lock]] in Northern France, covered with [[zebra mussel]]s]]
[[Biofouling]] or biological fouling is the undesirable accumulation of micro-organisms, algae and [[diatoms]], plants, and animals on surfaces, for example ships' hulls, or piping and reservoirs with untreated water. This can be accompanied by [[microbial corrosion|microbiologically influenced corrosion]] (MIC).

Bacteria can form biofilms or slimes. Thus the organisms can aggregate on surfaces using colloidal hydrogels of water and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) ([[polysaccharide]]s, lipids, nucleic acids, etc.). The biofilm structure is usually complex.

Bacterial fouling can occur under either aerobic (with oxygen dissolved in water) or anaerobic (no oxygen) conditions. In practice, aerobic bacteria prefer open systems, when both oxygen and nutrients are constantly delivered, often in warm and sunlit environments. Anaerobic fouling more often occurs in closed systems when sufficient nutrients are present. Examples may include [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] (or [[sulfur-reducing bacteria]]), which produce sulfide and often cause corrosion of ferrous metals (and other alloys).  Sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (e.g., [[Acidithiobacillus]]), on the other hand, can produce sulfuric acid, and can be involved in corrosion of concrete.

[[Zebra mussel]]s serve as an example of larger animals that have caused widespread fouling in North America.

===Composite fouling===
Composite fouling is common. This type of fouling involves more than one foulant or more than one fouling mechanism&lt;ref&gt;Hong Lu, "Composite Fouling of Heat Exchanger Surfaces", Nova Science Books, New York, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; working simultaneously. The multiple foulants or mechanisms may interact with each other resulting in a synergistic fouling which is not a simple arithmetic sum of the individual components.

===Fouling on Mars===
NASA [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s ([[Spirit rover|Spirit]] and [[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]) experienced (presumably) abiotic fouling of solar panels by dust particles from the Martian atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/ops/mae.html Mars Pathfinder - Dust Settling (MAE)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the deposits subsequently [[Cleaning event|spontaneously cleaned off]]. This illustrates the universal nature of the fouling phenomena.

==Quantification of fouling==
The most straightforward way to quantify fairly uniform fouling is by stating the average deposit surface loading, i.e., kg of deposit per m² of surface area. The fouling rate will then be expressed in kg/m²s, and it is obtained by dividing the deposit surface loading by the effective operating time. The normalized fouling rate (also in kg/m²s) will additionally account for the concentration of the foulant in the process fluid (kg/kg) during preceding operations, and is useful for comparison of fouling rates between different systems. It is obtained by dividing the fouling rate by the foulant concentration. The fouling rate constant (m/s) can be obtained by dividing the normalized fouling rate by the mass density of the process fluid (kg/m³).

Deposit thickness (μm) and porosity (%) are also often used for description of fouling amount. The relative reduction of diameter of piping or increase of the [[surface roughness]] can be of particular interest when the impact of fouling on pressure drop is of interest.

In heat transfer equipment, where the primary concern is often the effect of fouling on heat transfer, fouling can be quantified by the increase of the resistance to the flow of heat (m²K/W) due to fouling (termed "[[Thermal conductivity#Related terms|fouling resistance]]"), or by development of [[heat transfer coefficient]] (W/m²K) with time.

If under-deposit or [[crevice corrosion]] is of primary concern, it is important to note non-uniformity of deposit thickness (e.g., deposit [[waviness]]), localized fouling, packing of confined regions with deposits, creation of occlusions, "crevices", "deposit tubercles",&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Herro (Nalco Chemical Company), "Deposit-Related Corrosion in Industrial Cooling Water Systems", Presented at the National Association of Corrosion Engineers Corrosion ’89 meeting, New Orleans, Louisiana, April 17–21, 1989 ([http://www.onlinewatertreatment.com/literature/Nalco/docs/R-482.pdf (pdf)].&lt;/ref&gt; or sludge piles. Such deposit structures can create environment for underdeposit corrosion of the substrate material, e.g., [[Intergranular corrosion|intergranular attack]], [[pitting corrosion|pitting]], [[stress corrosion cracking]], or localized wastage. [[Porosity]] and [[Permeation|permeability]] of the deposits will likely influence the probability of underdeposit corrosion. Deposit composition can also be important - even minor components of the deposits can sometimes cause severe corrosion of the underlying metal (e.g., vanadium in deposits of fired boilers causing [[hot corrosion]]).

There is no general rule on how much deposit can be tolerated, it depends on the system. In many cases, a deposit even a few micrometers thick can be troublesome. A deposit in a millimeter-range thickness will be of concern in almost any application.

==Progress of fouling with time==
Deposit on a surface does not always develop steadily with time. The following fouling scenarios can be distinguished, depending on the nature of the system and the local thermohydraulic conditions at the surface:

* '''[[Induction period]].''' Sometimes, a near-nil fouling rate is observed when the surface is new or very clean. This is often observed in biofouling and precipitation fouling. After the "induction period", the fouling rate increases.
* '''"Negative" fouling.''' This can occur when fouling rate is quantified by monitoring heat transfer. Relatively small amounts of deposit can improve heat transfer, relative to clean surface, and give an appearance of "negative" fouling rate and negative total fouling amount. Negative fouling is often observed under nucleate-boiling heat-transfer conditions (deposit improves bubble nucleation) or forced-convection (if the deposit increases the surface roughness and the surface is no longer "hydraulically smooth"). After the initial period of "surface roughness control", the fouling rate usually becomes strongly positive.
* '''Linear fouling.'''  The fouling rate can be steady with time. This is a common case.
* '''Falling fouling.''' Under this scenario, the fouling rate decreases with time, but never drops to zero. The deposit thickness does not achieve a constant value. The progress of fouling can be often described by two numbers: the initial fouling rate (a [[tangent]] to the fouling curve at zero deposit loading or zero time) and the fouling rate after a long period of time (an [[oblique asymptote]] to the fouling curve).
* '''Asymptotic fouling.''' Here, the fouling rate decreases with time, until it finally reaches zero. At this point, the deposit thickness remains constant with time (a horizontal [[asymptote]]). This is often the case for relatively soft or poorly adherent deposits in areas of fast flow. The asymptote is usually interpreted as the deposit loading at which the deposition rate equals the deposit removal rate.
* '''Accelerating fouling.''' Under this scenario, the fouling rate increases with time; the rate of deposit buildup accelerates with time (perhaps until it becomes transport limited). Mechanistically, this scenario can develop when fouling increases the surface roughness, or when the deposit surface exhibits higher chemical propensity to fouling than the pure underlying metal.
* '''Seesaw fouling'''.  Here, fouling loading generally increases with time (often assuming a generally linear or falling rate), but, when looked at in more detail, the fouling progress is periodically interrupted and takes the form of [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth curve]]. The periodic sharp variations in the apparent fouling amount often correspond to the moments of system shutdowns, startups or other transients in operation. The periodic variations are often interpreted as periodic removal of some of the deposit (perhaps deposit re-suspension due to pressure pulses, spalling due thermal stresses, or exfoliation due to redox transients). Steam blanketing has been postulated to occur between the partially spalled deposits and the heat transfer surface. However, other reasons are possible, e.g., trapping of air inside the surface deposits during shutdowns, or inaccuracy of temperature measurements during transients ("temperature streaming").&lt;ref&gt;"Steam Generator Thermal Performance Degradation Case Studies", Report TR-110018, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA, 1998 [http://my.epri.com/portal/server.pt?Abstract_id=TR-110018 (abstract)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710210834/http://my.epri.com/portal/server.pt?Abstract_id=TR-110018 |date=2011-07-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fouling modelling==
[[File:Fouling diagram.png|thumb|right|Schematics of the fouling process consisting of simultaneous foulant deposition and deposit removal.]]
Fouling of a system can be modelled as consisting of several steps:
* Generation or ingress of the species that causes fouling ("foulant sourcing");
* Foulant transport with the stream of the process fluid (most often by [[advection]]);
* Foulant transport from the bulk of the process fluid to the fouling surface.  This transport is often by [[diffusion|molecular]] or [[eddy diffusion|turbulent-eddy diffusion]], but may also occur by inertial coasting/impaction, particle interception by the surface (for particles with finite sizes), [[electrophoresis]], [[thermophoresis]], [[diffusiophoresis]], [[Stefan flow]] (in condensation and evaporation), [[sedimentation]], [[Magnus force]] (acting on rotating particles), [[thermoelectric effect]],&lt;ref&gt;V.P. Brusakov, "Law for the Deposition of Materials on Heat-Transmitting Surfaces under the Action of Thermoelectric Effects", Atomnaya Energiya, Vol.30, No.1, pp.10-14, January 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.H. Lister, ""Corrosion products in power generating systems". In: Fouling of Heat Exchanger Equipment", E.F. Somerscales and J.G. Knudsen (eds.), Hemisphere Pub. Corp., Washington, DC, USA, 1981, pp.135-200.&lt;/ref&gt; and other mechanisms.
* Induction period, i.e., a near-nil fouling rate at the initial period of fouling&lt;ref name=WarsingerFramework&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Warsinger|first1=David M.|last2=Tow|first2= Emily W.|last3=Swaminathan|first3= Jaichander|last4=Lienhard V|first4=John H.|title=Theoretical framework for predicting inorganic fouling in membrane distillation and experimental validation with calcium sulfate|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=528|pages=381–390|doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.031|date=2017|hdl=1721.1/107916}}&lt;/ref&gt; (observed only for some fouling mechanisms);
* Foulant crystallisation on the surface (or attachment of the colloidal particle, or chemical reaction, or bacterial growth);
* Sometimes fouling autoretardation, i.e., reduction (or potentially enhancement) of crystallisation/attachment rate due to changes in the surface conditions caused by the fouling deposit;
* Deposit dissolution (or re-entrainment of loosely attached particles);
* Deposit consolidation on the surface (e.g., through [[Ostwald ripening]] or differential solubility in temperature gradient) or [[Cementation (geology)|cementation]], which account for deposit losing its porosity and becoming more tenacious with time;
* Deposit [[spallation|spalling]], [[wear|erosion wear]], or [[Exfoliation joint|exfoliation]].

[[Deposition (chemistry)|Deposition]] consists of transport to the surface and subsequent attachment. Deposit removal is either through deposit dissolution, particle re-entrainment, or deposit spalling, erosive wear, or exfoliation. Fouling results from foulant generation, foulant deposition, deposit removal, and deposit consolidation.

For the modern model of fouling involving deposition with simultaneous deposit re-entrainment and consolidation,&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Turner, S.J. Klimas, "Modelling the Effect of Surface Chemistry on Particle Fouling Under Flow-Boiling Conditions", Proceeding of Heat Exchanger Fouling: Fundamental Approaches and Technical Solutions, 2001, July 8–13, Davos, Switzerland, AECL Report 12171.&lt;/ref&gt; the fouling process can be represented by the following scheme:

{{in5}}
[
rate of
deposit
accumulation
] =
[
rate of
deposition
] -
[
rate of
re-entrainment of
unconsolidated deposit
]

{{in5}}
[
rate of
accumulation of
unconsolidated deposit
] =
[
rate of
deposition
] -
[
rate of
re-entrainment of
unconsolidated deposit
] -
[
rate of
consolidation of
unconsolidated deposit
]

Following the above scheme, the basic fouling equations can be written as follows (for steady-state conditions with flow, when concentration remains constant with time):

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{cases}
{dm/dt}=k_d C_m \rho - \lambda_r m_r(t) \\
{dm_r/dt}=k_d C_m \rho - \lambda_r m_r(t) - \lambda_c \cdot m_r(t)
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* m is the mass loading of the deposit (consolidated and unconsolidated) on the surface (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;);
* t is time (s);
* k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the deposition rate constant (m/s);
* ρ is the fluid density (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;);
* C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; - mass fraction of foulant in the fluid (kg/kg);
* λ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the re-entrainment rate constant (1/s);
* m&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass loading of the removable (i.e., unconsolidated) fraction of the surface deposit (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); and
* λ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the consolidation rate constant (1/s).

This system of equations can be integrated (taking that m = 0 and m&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 at t = 0) to the form:

:&lt;math&gt;m(t) = {{k_d C_m \rho} \over {\lambda}}  \left( t \lambda_c + {{\lambda_r} \over {\lambda}} \left( 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where λ = λ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; + λ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.

This model reproduces either linear, falling, or asymptotic fouling, depending on the relative values of k, λ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and λ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. The underlying physical picture for this model is that of a two-layer deposit consisting of consolidated inner layer and loose unconsolidated outer layer. Such a bi-layer deposit is often observed in practice. The above model simplifies readily to the older model of simultaneous deposition and re-entrainment&lt;ref&gt;D.O.Kern and R.E. Seaton, "A theoretical analysis of thermal surface fouling", Brit. Chem. Eng., 14, 5, 258, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  (which neglects consolidation) when λ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=0. In the absence of consolidation, the asymptotic fouling is always anticipated by this older model and the fouling progress can be described as:

:&lt;math&gt;m(t) = m^* \left( 1 - e^{-\lambda_r t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where m&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the maximum (asymptotic) mass loading of the deposit on the surface (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Economic and environmental importance of fouling==
Fouling is ubiquitous and generates tremendous operational losses, not unlike corrosion. For example, one estimate puts the losses due to fouling of heat exchangers in industrialized nations to be about 0.25% of their [[gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Mueller-Steinhagen and A.P. Watkinson, "Fouling of Heat Exchanger--New Approaches to Solve Old Problem", Heat Transfer Engineering, 26(2), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Another analysis&lt;ref&gt;Xu Zhi-Ming, ZHANG Zhong-Bin, and YANG Shan-Rang, "Costs due to utility fouling in China", ECI Engineering Conferences International Symposium Series, Heat Exchanger Fouling and Cleaning VII, July 1–6, 2007 - Tomar, Portugal. [http://services.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=eci/heatexchanger2007 (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512042927/http://services.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=eci%2Fheatexchanger2007 |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated (for 2006) the economical loss due to boiler and turbine fouling in China utilities at 4.68 billion dollars, which is about 0.169% the country GDP .

The losses initially result from impaired heat transfer, [[corrosion]] damage (in particular under-deposit and [[crevice corrosion]]), increased pressure drop, flow blockages, flow redistribution inside components, flow instabilities, induced vibrations (possibly leading to other problems, e.g., [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurosafe-forum.org/files/Presentations2008/Seminar%201/Abstracts/1.5%20Tubes%20support%20plates%20clogging%20up%20of%20French%20PWR%20steam%20generators%20V5%20correct%20figures%20Bodineau_20080923.pdf Herve BODINEAU and Thierry SOLLIER, "Tube support plate clogging up of French steam generators", Eurosafe webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042038/http://www.eurosafe-forum.org/files/Presentations2008/Seminar%201/Abstracts/1.5%20Tubes%20support%20plates%20clogging%20up%20of%20French%20PWR%20steam%20generators%20V5%20correct%20figures%20Bodineau_20080923.pdf |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[fretting]], premature failure of electrical heating elements, and a large number of other often unanticipated problems. In addition, the [[ecological]] costs should be (but typically are not) considered. The ecological costs arise from the use of [[biocide]]s for the avoidance of biofouling, from the increased [[fuel]] input to compensate for the reduced output caused by fouling, and an increased use of cooling water in once-through cooling systems.

For example, "normal" fouling at a conventionally fired 500 [[Watt|MW]] (net electrical power) [[power station]] unit accounts for output losses of the [[steam turbine]] of 5 MW and more. In a 1,300 MW [[nuclear power]] station, typical losses could be 20 MW and up (up to 100% if the station shuts down due to fouling-induced component degradation). In seawater [[desalination]] plants, fouling may reduce the gained output ratio by two-digit percentages (the gained output ratio is an equivalent that puts the mass of generated distillate in relation to the steam used in the process). The extra electrical consumption in [[gas compressor|compressor]]-operated coolers is also easily in the two-digit area. In addition to the operational costs, also the [[capital cost]] increases because the heat exchangers have to be designed in larger sizes to compensate for the heat-transfer loss due to fouling. To the output losses listed above, one needs to add the cost of down-time required to inspect, clean, and repair the components (millions of dollars per day of shutdown in lost revenue in a typical power plant), and the cost of actually doing this maintenance. Finally, fouling is often a [[root cause]] of serious degradation problems that may limit the life of components or entire plants.

==Fouling control==
The most fundamental and usually preferred method of controlling fouling is to prevent the ingress of the fouling species into the cooling water circuit. In [[Power station|steam power stations]] and other major industrial installations of [[water]] [[technology]], macro fouling is avoided by way of pre-[[filtration]] and cooling water [[filter (water)|debris filters]]. Some plants employ foreign-object exclusion program (to eliminate the possibility of salient introduction of unwanted materials, e.g., forgetting tools during maintenance). Acoustic monitoring is sometimes employed to monitor for fretting by detached parts. In the case of micro fouling, water purification is achieved with extensive methods of water treatment, [[microfiltration]], [[artificial membrane|membrane]] technology ([[reverse osmosis]], [[electrodeionization]]) or [[ion-exchange resins]]. The generation of the corrosion products in the water piping systems is often minimized by controlling the [[pH]] of the process fluid (typically alkanization with [[ammonia]], [[morpholine]], [[ethanolamine]] or [[sodium phosphate]]), control of oxygen dissolved in water (for example, by addition of [[hydrazine]]), or addition of [[corrosion inhibitor]]s.

For water systems at relatively low temperatures, the applied [[biocide]]s may be classified as follows: [[inorganic]] [[chlorine]] and [[bromide]] compounds, chlorine and bromide [[Bond cleavage|cleaver]]s, [[ozone]] and [[oxygen]] cleavers, unoxidizable [[biocide]]s. One of the most important unoxidizable biocides is a mixture of chloromethyl-isothiazolinone and [[methyl]]-isothiazolinone. Also applied are dibrom nitrilopropionamide and quaternary [[ammonium]] compounds. For underwater ship hulls [[bottom paint]]s are applied.

[[Chemical fouling inhibitor]]s&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Cowan and D.J. Weintritt, "Water-Formed Scale Deposits. A Comprehensive Study of the Prevention, Control, Removal and Use of Mineral Scale", Gulf Publishing Company, Houston, Texas, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; can reduce fouling in many systems, mainly by interfering with the crystallization, attachment, or consolidation steps of the fouling process. Examples for water systems are: [[chelating agent]]s (for example, [[EDTA]]), long-chain aliphatic amines or [[polyamine]]s (for example, [[octadecylamine]], [[helamin]], and other "film-forming" amines), organic [[phosphonic acid]]s (for example, [[etidronic acid]]), or [[polyelectrolyte]]s (for example, [[polyacrylic acid]],&lt;ref&gt;"Dispersants for Tube Fouling Control: Volume 2: Short-Term Trial at ANO-2", Report 1003144, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA, 2001 [http://my.epri.com/portal/server.pt?space=CommunityPage&amp;cached=true&amp;parentname=ObjMgr&amp;parentid=2&amp;control=SetCommunity&amp;CommunityID=404&amp;RaiseDocID=000000000001003144&amp;RaiseDocType=Abstract_id (abstract)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710210855/http://my.epri.com/portal/server.pt?space=CommunityPage&amp;cached=true&amp;parentname=ObjMgr&amp;parentid=2&amp;control=SetCommunity&amp;CommunityID=404&amp;RaiseDocID=000000000001003144&amp;RaiseDocType=Abstract_id |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; polymethacrylic acid, usually with a molecular weight lower than 10000). For fired boilers, aluminum or magnesium additives can lower the melting point of ash and promote creation of deposits which are easier to remove. See also [[process chemicals]].

[[Magnetic water treatment]] has been a subject of controversy as to its effectiveness for fouling control since the 1950s. The prevailing opinion is that it simply "does not work".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/ARMYCOE/PWTB/pwtb_420_49_34.pdf Magnetic Water Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215092211/http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/ARMYCOE/PWTB/pwtb_420_49_34.pdf |date=2011-12-15 }}", Public Works Technical Bulletin 420-49-34, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 15 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some studies suggest that it may be effective under some conditions to reduce buildup of calcium carbonate deposits.&lt;ref&gt;A. Szkatula, M. Balanda, M. Kopec, "Magnetic treatment of industrial water. Silica activation". Eur. Phys. J.Applied Physics, 1, vol. 18, p. 41-49, 2002 [http://www.epjap.org/index.php?option=article&amp;access=doi&amp;doi=10.1051/epjap:2002025 (abstract)]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the component design level, fouling can often (but not always) be minimized by maintaining a relatively high (for example, 2&amp;nbsp;m/s) and uniform fluid velocity throughout the component. Stagnant regions need to be eliminated. Components are normally overdesigned to accommodate the fouling anticipated between cleanings. However, a significant overdesign can be a design error because it may lead to increased fouling due to reduced velocities. Periodic on-line pressure pulses or backflow can be effective if the capability is carefully incorporated at the design time. [[Boiler#Boiler fittings|Blowdown]] capability is always incorporated into steam generators or evaporators to control the accumulation of non-volatile impurities that cause or aggravate fouling.  [[Ultra-low fouling|Low-fouling surfaces]] (for example, very smooth, [[Ion implantation|implanted with ions]], or of low surface energy like [[PTFE|Teflon]]) are an option for some applications. Modern components are typically required to be designed for ease of inspection of internals and periodic cleaning. On-line fouling monitoring systems are designed for some application so that blowing or cleaning can be applied before unpredictable shutdown is necessary or damage occurs.

Chemical or mechanical cleaning processes for the removal of deposits and scales are recommended when fouling reaches the point of impacting the system performance or an onset of significant fouling-induced degradation (e.g., by corrosion). These processes comprise pickling with [[acid]]s and [[chelate|complexing agents]], cleaning with high-velocity water jets ("water lancing"), recirculating ("blasting") with metal, sponge or other balls, or propelling offline mechanical "bullet-type" tube cleaners.  Whereas chemical cleaning causes environmental problems through the handling, application, storage and disposal of chemicals, the mechanical cleaning by means of circulating cleaning balls or offline "bullet-type" cleaning can be an [[environmentally friendlier]] alternative. In some heat-transfer applications, mechanical mitigation with [[dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger]]s is an option. Also ultrasonic or [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasive]] cleaning methods are available for many specific applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6264">The '''glass delusion''' is an external manifestation of a [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorder]] recorded in Europe mainly in the late [[Middle Ages]] and [[early modern period]] (fifteenth to seventeenth centuries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Speak | first=Gill | title=An odd kind of melancholy: reflections on the glass delusion in Europe (1440–1680) | journal=History of Psychiatry | year=1990 | volume=2 | issue=2 | pages=191–206 | doi=10.1177/0957154X9000100203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People feared that they were made of [[glass]] "and therefore likely to shatter into pieces". One famous early sufferer was King [[Charles VI of France]] who refused to allow people to touch him, and wore reinforced clothing to protect himself from accidental "shattering".

==The delusion==

Concentration of the glass delusion among the wealthy and educated classes allowed modern scholars to associate it with a wider and better described disorder of scholar's melancholy.&lt;ref name=LIC1&gt;Speak, "El licenciado...", p.850&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary accounts==
[[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1621) touches on the subject in the commentary as one of many related manifestations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] | title=The Anatomy of Melancholy | year=1621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the same anxiety: "Fear of devils, [[Thanatophobia|death]], that they shall be so sick, of some such or such disease, ready to tremble at every object, they shall die themselves forthwith, or that some of their dear friends or near allies are certainly dead; imminent danger, loss, disgrace still torment others; that they are all glass, and therefore will suffer no man to come near them; that they are all [[Cork (material)|cork]], as light as feathers; others as heavy as [[lead]]; some are afraid their heads will fall off their shoulders, that they have frogs in their bellies, Etc."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Com.1 Sec.3 comment no. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miguel de Cervantes]] based one of his short ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'', ''The Glass Graduate'' ({{lang-es|[[El licenciado Vidriera]]}}, 1613), on the delusion of the title subject, an aspiring young lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Cervantes]] | title=The Glass Graduate (also known as ''The Glass Licenciate'', ''The Glass Lawyer''; Spanish: [[El licenciado Vidriera]]) | year=1613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Rodaja fell into a grave depression after being bedridden for six months subsequent to being poisoned with a purportedly [[aphrodisiac]] potion. He claimed that, being of glass, his perceptions are clearer than those of men of flesh and demonstrated by offering witty comments. After two years of illness, Rodaja was cured by a monk; no details of the cure are provided except that the monk was allegedly a miracle-maker.

Dutch poet [[Constantijn Huygens]] wrote a ''Costly Folly'' (1622) centered on a subject who "fears everything that moves in his vicinity... the chair will be the death for him, he trembles at the bed, fearful that one will break his bum, the other smash his head".&lt;ref name="LIC1"/&gt;

French philosopher [[René Descartes]] wrote ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (1641), using the glass [[delusion]] as an example of an [[Insanity|insane]] person whose perceived knowledge of the world differs from the majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[René Descartes]] | title=Meditations on First Philosophy | year=1641 | isbn=0-87484-893-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the glass delusion has not completely disappeared. There are still isolated cases today. "Surveys of modern psychiatric institutions have only revealed two specific (uncorroborated) cases of the glass delusion. Foulché-Delbosc reports finding one Glass Man in a Paris [[Bicêtre Hospital|asylum]], and a woman who thought she was a potsherd was recorded at an asylum in [[Merenberg]]." Andy Lameijn, a psychiatrist from the Netherlands, reports that he has a male patient suffering from the delusion in [[Leiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The people who think they are made of glass|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32625632|website=BBC News|date=8 May 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tchaikovsky==
The neurotic behavior of the nineteenth-century Russian composer [[Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] seems reminiscent of the glass delusion, centering as it did around his difficulties caused by his belief that his head would fall off while conducting if he did not hold his chin. While the legend may be exaggerated, it seems to have some basis in fact:

{{quote|In March 1868 in his first attempt [at conducting], Tchaikovsky conducted dances from ''[[The Voyevoda (opera)|The Voevoda]]'', "and had felt that his head would fall sideways unless he fought to keep it upright"&amp;nbsp;... (per David Brown, ''The Final Years'' page 97)&amp;nbsp;... and so he avoided conducting&amp;nbsp;... In October 1886 Tchaikovsky pointed out to his patroness "all my life I have been tormented by awareness of my inability to conduct. It has seemed to me there is something shameful and disreputable in not being able to stop myself trembling with fear and horror at the very thought of going out in front of the public with a baton"&amp;nbsp;... However on Jan. 31, 1887 Tchaikovsky in his third attempt overcame his fear and conducted the premier of ''[[The Enchantress (opera)|The Enchantress]]''&amp;nbsp;... as a further inducement "he was not unaware that a conductor could enjoy more celebrity in his own time than a composer."{{cn|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--appears to be a copyvio of http://www.tchaikovsky-research.net/en/forum/forum0079.html, quoting "Tchaikovsky, The Quest for the Inner Man" by Alexander Poznansky--&gt;}}

'''Glossitis''' can mean soreness of the tongue, or more usually inflammation with depapillation of the dorsal surface of the tongue (loss of the [[lingual papilla]]e), leaving a smooth and [[erythema]]tous (reddened) surface,&lt;ref name="Scully 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0443068188|edition=2nd|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers 2010" /&gt; (sometimes specifically termed '''atrophic glossitis'''). In a wider sense, glossitis can mean inflammation of the tongue generally.&lt;ref name="Domino 2012" /&gt; Glossitis is often caused by [[nutritional deficiency|nutritional deficiencies]] and may be painless or cause discomfort. Glossitis usually responds well to treatment if the cause is identified and corrected. Tongue soreness caused by glossitis is differentiated from [[burning mouth syndrome]], where there is no identifiable change in the appearance of the tongue, and there are no identifiable causes.&lt;ref name=McMillan2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McMillan|first=Roddy|last2=Forssell|first2=Heli|last3=Buchanan|first3=John Ag|last4=Glenny|first4=Anne-Marie|last5=Weldon|first5=Jo C.|last6=Zakrzewska|first6=Joanna M.|date=2016|title=Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=11|pages=CD002779|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002779.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27855478|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
[[File:Glossite.jpg|thumbnail|right|Patchy depapillation of filiform papillae with prominence of the fungiform papillae.]]
Depending upon what exact meaning of the word glossitis is implied, signs and symptoms might include:

* Smooth, shiny appearance of the tongue, caused by loss of lingual papillae.
* Tongue color changes, usually to a darker red color than the normal white-pink color of a healthy tongue.
* Tongue swelling.
* Difficulty with chewing, [[Dysphagia|swallowing]], or speaking (either because of tongue soreness of tongue swelling).
* Burning sensation.&lt;ref name="Scully 2008" /&gt; Some use the term secondary burning mouth syndrome in cases where a detectable cause, such as glossitis, for an oral burning sensation.&lt;ref name=McMillan2016 /&gt;

Depending upon the underlying cause, there may be additional signs and symptoms such as [[pallor]], oral ulceration and angular cheilitis.&lt;ref name="Scully 2008" /&gt;

== Causes ==

===Anemias===
[[Iron-deficiency anemia]] is mainly caused by blood loss, such as may occur during [[menses]] or [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage]]. This often results in a depapilled, atrophic glossitis, giving the tongue a bald and shiny appearance, along with [[pallor]] (paleness) of the lips and other mucous membranes a tendency towards recurrent [[oral ulceration]],&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010" /&gt; and [[cheilosis]] (swelling of the lips).&lt;ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /&gt; The appearance of the tongue in iron deficiency anemia has been described as diffuse or patchy atrophy with tenderness or burning.&lt;ref name="Neville 2001" /&gt; One cause of iron deficiency anemia is [[sideropenic dysphagia]] (Plummer–Vinson or Paterson–Brown–Kelly syndrome) which is also characterized by [[esophageal web]]bing and dysphagia.&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010" /&gt;

[[Pernicious anemia]] is usually caused by [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] destruction of [[stomach|gastric]] [[parietal cell]]s. Parietal cells secrete [[intrinsic factor]] which is required for the absorption of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency results in [[megaloblastic anemia]] and may present as glossitis. The appearance of the tongue in vitamin B12 deficiency is described as "beefy"
or "fiery red and sore".&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Treister NS, Bruch JM |title=Clinical oral medicine and pathology|year=2010|publisher=Humana Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60327-519-4|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be linear or patchy red lesions.&lt;ref name="Scully 2008" /&gt;

===Vitamin B deficiencies===
[[Vitamin B1 deficiency]] ([[thiamin]] deficiency) can cause glossitis.&lt;ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /&gt; [[Vitamin B2 deficiency]] (ariboflavinosis) can cause glossitis, along with [[angular cheilitis]], [[cheilosis]], [[peripheral neuropathy]] and other signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name="Yamada GI textbook"&gt;{{cite book|veditors = ((Tadataka Yamada)), ((David H.

===Infections===
[[Bacteria]]l, [[virus|viral]] or [[fungal]] infections can cause glossitis. ''Candida'' species are involved in median rhomboid glossitis.

===Other causes===
Many conditions can cause glossitis via [[malnutrition]] or [[malabsorption]],&lt;ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /&gt; which creates the nutritional deficiencies described above, although other mechanisms may be involved in some of those conditions listed.

* [[Alcoholism]]&lt;ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /&gt;
* [[Sprue (disambiguation)|Sprue]] ([[celiac disease]],&lt;ref name="Pastore 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pastore L, Carroccio A, Compilato D, Panzarella V, Serpico R, Lo Muzio L | title = Oral manifestations of celiac disease | journal = J.

*Exposure to irritants such as [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], hot foods, or [[spice]]s
*Allergic reaction to [[toothpaste]], [[mouthwash]], breath fresheners, dyes in confectionery, plastic in dentures or retainers, or certain blood-pressure medications ([[ACE inhibitors]])
*Administration of [[ganglion blockers]] (e.g., [[Tubocurarine]], [[Mecamylamine]]).
*Oral [[lichen planus]], [[erythema multiforme]], [[aphthous ulcer]], [[pemphigus]] vulgaris
*Heredity
*[[Albuterol]] (bronchodilator medicine)
A painful tongue may be an indication of an underlying serious medical condition and nearly always merits assessment by a [[physician]] or [[dentist|dental surgeon]].

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
[[File:Glossitis.jpg|thumbnail|right|Median rhomboid glossitis]]
[[File:Landkartenzunge 005.jpg|thumbnail|right|Geographic tongue (benign migratory glossitis)]]
Glossitis could be classified as a group of [[tongue disease]]s or [[gastrointestinal disease]]s.&lt;ref name="Domino 2012"&gt;{{cite book|veditors = ((Frank J. Domino (editor-in-chief))), ((Robert A.

====Atrophic glossitis====
Atrophic glossitis, also known as bald tongue,&lt;ref name="Rogers 2010" /&gt; smooth tongue, Hunter glossitis, Moeller glossitis, or Möller-Hunter glossitis,&lt;ref name="Falco" &gt;{{cite book|author=O. Braun-Falco|title=Dermatology|year=2000|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=3540594523|page=1173|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a condition characterized by a smooth glossy tongue that is often tender/painful,&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; caused by complete atrophy of the lingual papillae (depapillation).&lt;ref name="Rogers 2010" /&gt; The dorsal tongue surface may be affected totally, or in patches, and may be associated with a burning sensation, pain and/or erythema.&lt;ref name="Chi 2010" /&gt; Atrophic glossitis is a non-specific finding,&lt;ref name="Chi 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chi AC, Neville BW, Krayer JW, Gonsalves WC | title = Oral manifestations of systemic disease | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 82 | issue = 11 | pages = 1381–8 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21121523|type = review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a great many causes, usually related to [[iron-deficiency anemia]], [[pernicious anemia]], [[B vitamins|B vitamin complex]] deficiencies,&lt;ref name="Chi 2010"/&gt; unrecognized and untreated [[celiac disease]] (which often presents without gastrointestinal symptoms),&lt;ref name=RashidZarkadas2011&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Rashid M, Zarkadas M, Anca A, Limeback H|title= Oral manifestations of celiac disease: a clinical guide for dentists|date= 2011|journal= J Can Dent Assoc|volume= 77|pages=b39|url= http://www.jcda.ca/article/b39|pmid= 21507289|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celiac.nih.gov/PDF/Dental_Enamel_Defects_508.pdf|title=Dental Enamel Defects and Celiac Disease|publisher=National Institute of Health (NIH)|access-date=Mar 7, 2016|quote=Tooth defects that result from celiac disease may resemble those caused by too much fluoride or a maternal or early childhood illness.

Although the terms Möller and Hunter glossitis were originally used to refer to specifically the glossitis that occurs in vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to pernicious anemia, they are now used as synonyms for atrophic glossitis generally.&lt;ref name="Falco" /&gt; In this article, the term glossitis, unless otherwise specified, refers to atrophic glossitis.

Candidiasis may be a concurrent finding or an alternative cause of erythema, burning, and atrophy.

====Median rhomboid glossitis====
{{Main article|Median rhomboid glossitis}}
This condition is characterized by a persistent erythematous, rhomboidal depapillated lesion in the central area of the dorsum of the tongue, just in front of the [[circumvallate papilla]]e.&lt;ref name="Scully 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology|year=2006|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|isbn=0721629210|page=803|edition=14th|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Median rhomboid glossitis is a type of [[oral candidiasis]], and rarely causes any symptoms. It is treated with [[antifungal medication]]. Predisposing factors include use of [[corticosteroid]] sprays or inhalers or [[immunosuppression]].

====Benign migratory glossitis====
{{main article|Geographic tongue}}
Geographic tongue, also termed benign migratory glossitis, is a common condition which usually affects the dorsal surface of the tongue. It is characterized by patches of depapillation and erythema bordered by a whitish peripheral zone. These patches give the tongue the appearance of a map, hence the name. Unlike glossitis due to nutritional deficiencies and anemia, the lesions of geographic tongue move around the tongue over time.&lt;ref name="Adeyemo 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adeyemo|first=TA|author2=Adeyemo, WL |author3=Adediran, A |author4=Akinbami, AJ |author5= Akanmu, AS |title=Orofacial manifestations of hematological disorders: anemia and hemostatic disorders.|journal=Indian Journal of Dental Research |date=May–Jun 2011|volume=22|issue=3|pages=454–61|pmid=22048588|url=http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2011;volume=22;issue=3;spage=454;epage=461;aulast=Adeyemo|doi=10.4103/0970-9290.87070}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in geographic tongue, new areas of the tongue become involved with the condition whilst previously affected areas heal, giving the appearance of a moving lesion.&lt;ref name="Rogers 2010" /&gt; The cause is unknown,&lt;ref name="Reamy 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reamy|first=BV|author2=Derby, R |author3=Bunt, CW |title=Common tongue conditions in primary care.|journal=American Family Physician|date=Mar 1, 2010|volume=81|issue=5|pages=627–34|pmid=20187599|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0301/p627.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no curative treatment. Rarely are there any symptoms associated with the lesions, but occasionally a burning sensation may be present, which is exacerbated by eating hot, spicy or acidic foodstuffs. Some consider geographic tongue to be an early stage of [[fissured tongue]], since the two conditions often occur in combination.&lt;ref name="Greenberg 2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Greenberg, MS |author2=Glick, M |author3=Ship, JA |title=Burket's oral medicine|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton, Ont.|isbn=1550093452|pages=|edition=11th|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q2SP8cOZPvkC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=geographic+tongue#v=onepage&amp;q=geographic%20tongue&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geometric glossitis====
Geometric glossitis, also termed herpetic geometric glossitis,&lt;ref name="Domino 2012" /&gt; is a term used by some to refer to a chronic lesion associated with [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV) type I infection,&lt;ref name="Cohen 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=PR|author2=Kazi, S |author3=Grossman, ME |title=Herpetic geometric glossitis: a distinctive pattern of lingual herpes simplex virus infection.|journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=December 1995|volume=88|issue=12|pages=1231–35|pmid=7502116|doi=10.1097/00007611-199512000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which there is a deep fissure in the midline of the tongue, which gives off multiple branches.&lt;ref name="Neville 2001" /&gt; The lesion is usually very painful, and there may be erosions present in the depths of the fissures. Similar fissured lesions which are not associated with HSV, as may occur in fissured tongue, do not tend to be painful.&lt;ref name="Cohen 1995" /&gt; The name comes from the geometric pattern of the fissures which are longitudinal, crossed or branched.&lt;ref name="Grossman 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=ME|author2=Stevens, AW |author3=Cohen, PR |title=Brief report: herpetic geometric glossitis.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=Dec 16, 1993|volume=329|issue=25|pages=1859–60|pmid=8247038|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199312163292506|doi=10.1056/NEJM199312163292506}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is described as occurring in immunocompromized persons, e.g. who have [[leukemia]]. However, the association between herpes simplex and geometric glossitis is disputed by some due to a lack of gold standard techniques for diagnosis of intraoral herpetic lesions, and the high prevalence of asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompromized individuals.&lt;ref name="Neville 2001" /&gt; Treatment is with systemic [[aciclovir]].&lt;ref name="Cohen 1995" /&gt;

====Strawberry tongue====
Strawberry tongue (also called raspberry tongue),&lt;ref name="Mosby's"&gt;{{cite book|veditors = ((Scott Stocking, associate editor)), ((Jyothimai Gubili))|title=Mosby's dental dictionary|year=2004|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0323025102}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to glossitis which manifests with [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] (enlarged) [[fungiform papilla]]e, giving the appearance of a strawberry. White strawberry tongue is where there is a white coating on the tongue through which the hyperplastic fungiform papillae protrude.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Neville 2001" /&gt; --&gt; Red strawberry tongue is where the white coating is lost and a dark red, erythematous surface is revealed, interspaced with the hyperplastic fungiform papillae.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Neville 2001" /&gt; --&gt; White strawberry tongue is seen in early [[scarlet fever]] (a systemic infection of [[Streptococcus#Group A|group A β- hemolytic streptococci]]),&lt;ref name="pmid17719644"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang SG, Dong HJ, Li FR |title=Report and analysis of a scarlet fever outbreak among adults through food-borne transmission in China |journal=J.

== Prevention ==
Good [[oral hygiene]] (thorough tooth brushing and flossing and regular professional cleaning and examination) may be helpful to prevent these disorders. Drinking plenty of water and the production of enough saliva, aid in the reduction of bacterial growth. Minimizing irritants or injury in the mouth when possible can aid in the prevention of glossitis. Avoiding excessive use of any food or substance that irritates the mouth or tongue may also help.

== Treatment ==
The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation. Treatment usually does not require hospitalization unless tongue swelling is severe. Good [[oral hygiene]] is necessary, including thorough tooth brushing at least twice a day, and flossing at least daily. Corticosteroids such as prednisone may be given to reduce the inflammation of glossitis. For mild cases, topical applications (such as a prednisone mouth rinse that is not swallowed) may be recommended to avoid the side effects of swallowed or injected corticosteroids. Antibiotics, antifungal medications, or other antimicrobials may be prescribed if the cause of glossitis is an infection. Anemia and nutritional deficiencies (such as a [[pellagra|deficiency in niacin]], [[riboflavin]], iron, or [[Vitamin E]]) must be treated, often by dietary changes or other supplements. Avoid irritants (such as hot or spicy foods, alcohol, and tobacco) to minimize the discomfort. 
In some cases, tongue swelling may threaten the airway, a [[medical emergency]] that needs immediate attention.

==Epidemiology==
One review reported overall [[prevalence]] ranges of 0.1–14.3% for geographic tongue, 1.3–9.0% for "atrophy tongue" (atrophic glossitis), and 0.0–3.35% for median rhomboid glossitis.&lt;ref name="pmid1291323"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dombi C, Czeglédy A | title = [Incidence of tongue diseases based on epidemiologic studies (review of the literature)] | language = Hungarian | journal = Fogorv Sz | volume = 85 | issue = 11 | pages = 335–41 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1291323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gota de Leche''' (lit. A Drop of Milk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gota de Leche|url=http://gotadeleche.com/about/|website=Gota de Leche June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a foundation started by Trinidad Rizal (sister of Philippine National Hero, Dr. [[José Rizal]]) and [[Concepción Felix]] on 1906 that primarily aims to provide nutritional and medical needs of indigent Filipino mothers and their children. Founded by La Protección de la Infancia Inc., the foundation continues to deliver daily milk rations to Filipino infants

Its headquarters, the Gota de Leche building located at 859 S. Loyota St., Sampaloc, Manila, Philippines, designed by architects [[Juan Arellano]] and Arcadio Arellano (founding father of Philippine architecture), was awarded Honourable Mention by the [[UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards]] for [[Cultural Heritage]] Conservation in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners for the 2003 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/culture/wh/asia-pacific-heritage-awards/previous-heritage-awards-2000-2013/2003/|website=UNESCO Bangkok|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened further support from the [[National Commission on Culture and the Arts]].

== History ==
[[File:Gota de Leche 09.jpg|thumb|The [[Gota de Leche Building]]]]
[[File:Milk and Brown Rice Canisters.jpg|thumb|''Milk and Brown Rice Canisters''|300x200px]]
''[[Beriberi]]'', a sickness caused by a nutritional deficit in Vitamin B1 or Thiamine, was discovered among Filipino women after the Philippine–American War in 1902. Hundreds of infants died before ever reaching 3 months old and it was found that the milk coming from affected mothers were causing these deaths. This distressing condition moved a group of women to address the situation. And so in 1905, Asosación Feminista Filipina was born. It was led by Trinidad Rizal and Concepcion Felix, together with other educated women of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gota de Leche|url=http://gotadeleche.com/timeline/|website=Gota de Leche|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gota de Leche was established the year after, in 1906, as station that manages the daily distribution of pasteurized cow’s milk to Filipino infants. They also provide nutrition education programs to Filipino mothers.

This project was recognized as heroic and in order for it to further succeed, the founders needed to collaborate with other professionals who were willing to lend a helping hand to the cause. The collaboration subsequently led to the formation of La Protección de la Infacia Inc., the Philippines’ first independent charity organization constituted by doctors and business leaders among others.

La Protección de la Infancia Inc. opened Gota de Leche, the brainchild of Dr. Calderon, who was inspired after witnessing the noble act of the organization.

Initially headquartered on ''Calle San Pedro'' (now Evangelista Street) in [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]] near [[Plaza Miranda]], the society moved to its present location in Sampaloc upon the completion of the Gota de Leche Building in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924023437738 |title=The Philippines, the land of palm and pine: an official guide and hand book (1912) |publisher=Manila Bureau of Print |accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gota de Leche continues its charitable activities. It still provides nutritional and medical assistance to qualified Filipino mothers and children while closely monitoring their improvement. This landmark building also houses the first national center for women’s rights that provides counselling services. Other services include dental assistance, educating families on common illnesses, and playing educational games with the children.

Gota de Leche has also started their Brown Rice program, for impoverished families ensuring access to complementary food rations for both mother and child. Volunteers come and provide information on diet and keeping healthy to their parents.

In the wake of the recent disaster caused by Typhoon Yolanda, the institution has also opened its doors, literally, to those displaced by the typhoon.

The careful restoration of Gota de Leche established the importance of heritage structures and the value of historical buildings as an alternative to demolition.

[[File:Lubieniecki Gourmands.jpg|thumb|''Gourmands'' by [[Krzysztof Lubieniecki]], [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]
A '''gourmand''' is a person who takes great pleasure and interest in consuming good food and drink.&lt;ref name="Brein"/&gt; A gourmand has also been defined as a person who is "a [[Gluttony|glutton]] for food and drink",&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; a person who eats and drinks excessively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gourmand gourmand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The word has different connotations from the similar word [[gourmet]], which emphasises an individual with a ''refined'' discerning palate,&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1984"/&gt; but in practice the two terms are closely linked, as both imply the enjoyment of good food.

An alternative and older usage of the word is to describe a person given to excess in the consumption of food and drink, as a glutton&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;  or a [[trencherman]].{{cn|date=March 2015}}

Another alternative use has gained popularity among parfumes and fragrance designers. In this realm, gourmand is a category of scents related to foods, such as cocoa, apple, or plum. 
 
Regarding the latter usage of the term, there is a parallel concern among the French that their word for the appreciation of gourmet cuisine (gourmandise) is historically included in the French [[Catholicism|Catholic]] list of the [[Seven deadly sins|Seven Deadly Sins]].{{cn|date=March 2015}} With the evolution in the meaning of gourmand (and gourmandise) away from gluttony, towards the appreciation of good food, French culinary proponents are advocating that the Catholic Church update said list to refer to "gloutonnerie" rather than "gourmandise."{{cn|date=March 2015}}

'''Health in Indonesia''' is affected by [[air pollution|air quality]], disease, poverty and smoking.

29% of the population of Indonesia are under 15 years old, and only 5% are over 65. Life expectancy at birth is 70.8 years. It has been suggested that over a third of the children under 5 have stunted growth.  More than 28 million live below the poverty line of US$17 a month and about half the population have incomes not much above it.  The rate of smoking is the highest in the world - 76%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 400,000 die each year from smoking related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water quality==
Unsafe [[drinking water]] is a major cause of [[diarrhoea]], which is a major killer of young children in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Indonesia.pdf Indonesia country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 2004). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UNICEF]] diarrhoea caused by untreated drinking water contributed to the death of 31% of children between the age of 1 month to a year, and 25% of children between a year to 4 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/indonesia/A8-_E_Issue_Brief_Water_Sanitation_REV.pdf|title=IssueBriefs: Water, sanitation &amp; hygiene|publisher=UNICEF Indonesia|date=October 2012|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
[[Image:Polio worldwide 2005.png|thumb|In 2005 there were 303 reported cases of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] in Indonesia.]]
[[HIV/AIDS]] has posed a major public health threat since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In 2003 Indonesia ranked third among ASEAN nations in Southeast Asia, after [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]], with a 0.1 percent adult prevalence rate, 130,000 HIV/AIDS cases, and 2,400 deaths.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In Jakarta it is estimated that 17 percent of prostitutes have contracted HIV/AIDS; in some parts of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], it is thought that the rate of infection among village women who are not prostitutes may be as high as 26 percent.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Three other health hazards facing Indonesia in 2004 were [[dengue fever]], [[dengue haemorrhagic fever]] (DHF) and [[avian influenza]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; All 30 provincial-level units were affected by dengue fever and DHF, according to the WHO. The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (A/H5N1) in chickens and ducks in Indonesia was said to pose a significant threat to human health.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

By 2010, there were three [[malaria]] regions in Indonesia: [[Nusa Tenggara Barat]] with 20 cases per 1,000 citizens, [[Nusa Tenggara Timur]] with 20-50, and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Papua (province)|Papua]] with more than 50 cases per thousand. The medium endemicity in [[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]] and [[Sulawesi]], whereas low endemicity is in [[Java]] and [[Bali]] which almost 100 percent of malaria cases have been confirmed clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leksono|first=Ageng Wibowo|title=Malignant malaria still haunts Indonesia|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/70567/malignant-malaria-still-haunts-indonesia|agency=[[Antara (news agency)|Antara]]|date=23 April 2011|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 1990 malaria '''average''' incidence was 4.96 per 1,000 and declined to 1.96 per 1000 at 2010.

==Air quality==
[[1997 Southeast Asian haze]], [[2006 Southeast Asian haze]], [[2013 Southeast Asian haze]] and [[2015 Southeast Asian haze]] - In all countries affected by the smoke haze, an increase of acute health outcomes was observed. Health effects including emergency room visits due to respiratory symptoms such as [[asthma]], upper respiratory infection, decreased lung function as well as eye and skin irritation, were caused mainly by this particulate matter.

==Vaccination==
Indonesia has routine vaccination to children below age 5 years as [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommendations including vaccination of [[Hepatitis B]] which has high prevalency in Indonesia. Almost all of the vaccines provided by [[Bio Farma]] which one of the 29 companies with a prequalification certificate from the WHO among 200 vaccine company in the world. It also has been exported to 110 countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitipeuw|first=Jimmy|title=Indonesian Company Exports Vaccines to 110 Countries|url=http://english.kompas.com/read/2011/03/10/06253496/Indonesian.Company.Exports.Vaccines.to.110.Countries|work=[[Kompas]]|agency=Antara|date=10 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713164325/http://english.kompas.com/read/2011/03/10/06253496/Indonesian.Company.Exports.Vaccines.to.110.Countries|archivedate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bio Farma as a global vaccine producer will produce [[pentavalent vaccine]] ([[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], [[tetanus]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[Influenzavirus B|haemophilus influanzae type B]] or HiB). In 2012 the GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization) will donate 80 percent of the needs of pentavalent vaccine and in the third year government should self-fulfilment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biofarma ready to produce new vaccines|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71328/biofarma-ready-to-produce-new-vaccines|accessdate=4 February 2017|agency=Antara|date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the third phase test of dengue vaccine involving 800 humans with ages of 2 and 14 years old have been held in 5 community health centre around [[Jakarta]] and will be conducted also in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]] and [[Denpasar]], [[Bali]] with 800 and 400 participants, respectively. The first test was performed on a limited number of soldiers and the second phase was conducted on a small number of children and if within the next 5 years the vaccine is found to be safe for humans, government will apply the dengue vaccine to public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aditya|first=Andreas D.|title=Jakarta begins testing new dengue vaccine|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/08/jakarta-begins-testing-new-dengue-vaccine.html|work=The Jakarta Post|date=8 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608032152/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/08/jakarta-begins-testing-new-dengue-vaccine.html|archivedate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maternal and child health care==
[[File:Indonesian midwives.jpg|thumb|right|Newly certified midwives in [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]]]
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Indonesia is 240. This is compared with 228.6 in 2008 and 252.9 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 41 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 49. In Indonesia the number of [[midwives]] per 1,000 live births is unavailable and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 190.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births is 359 deaths, a significant increased from 2010 data with 220 deaths and far from the MDGs goal of 102 deaths by the end of 2015. The main cause of deaths are severe post-natal bleeding due to lack of pregnancy regular control, although National Family Planning Coordination Board and the Central Statistics Agency data showed improvement from 93 percent of women received prenatal care in 2007 increased to 96 percent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/indonesia-still-haunted-by-high-number-of-maternal-and-post-natal-deaths/ |title=Indonesia Still Haunted by High Number of Maternal and Post-Natal Deaths |first=Basten |last=Gokkon |work=[[Jakarta Globe]] |date=29 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130202316/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/indonesia-still-haunted-by-high-number-of-maternal-and-post-natal-deaths/ |archivedate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus''' ('''KSHV''') is the ninth known human [[herpesvirus]]; its formal name according to the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) is '''HHV-8'''. Like other herpesviruses, its informal name (KSHV) is used interchangeably with its more formal ICTV name. This virus causes [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], a cancer commonly occurring in [[AIDS]] patients,&lt;ref name=aids /&gt; as well as [[primary effusion lymphoma]],&lt;ref name=lymph &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cesarman | first1 = E. | last2 = Chang | first2 = Y. | last3 = Moore | first3 = P.

==History==
In 1872, [[Moritz Kaposi]] described a blood vessel tumor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaposi |first=M |year=1872 |title=Idiopathisches multiples Pigmentsarkom der Haut |journal=Archiv für Dermatologie und Syphilis |volume=4 |issue= 2|pages=265–273 | url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1007/BF01830024}}&lt;br&gt;Translated in {{cite journal |author=Kaposi |first=M |title=Idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma of the skin |journal=CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=342–347 |year=2008 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.32.6.342}}&lt;/ref&gt; (originally called "idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma of the skin") that has since been eponymously named [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] (KS). KS was at first thought to be an uncommon tumor of Jewish and Mediterranean populations until it was later determined to be extremely common throughout sub-Saharan African populations. This led to the first suggestions in the 1950s that this tumor might be caused by a virus. With the onset of the [[AIDS]] epidemic in the early 1980s, there was a sudden resurgence of KS affecting primarily gay and bisexual AIDS patients,with up to 50% of reported AIDS patients having this tumor—an extraordinary rate of cancer predisposition. Careful analysis of epidemiologic data by Valerie Beral, Thomas Peterman and Harold Jaffe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beral V, Peterman TA, Berkelman RL, Jaffe HW |title=Kaposi's sarcoma among persons with AIDS: a sexually transmitted infection? |journal=Lancet |volume=335 |issue=8682 |pages=123–8 |year=1990 |pmid=1967430 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(90)90001-L|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1258307 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; led these investigators to propose that KS is caused by an unknown sexually transmitted virus that rarely causes tumors unless the host becomes [[immunosuppressed]], as in AIDS.

[[Image:Kaposi sarcoma high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of Kaposi sarcoma. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
As early as 1984, scientists reported seeing herpesvirus-like structures in KS tumors examined under [[electron microscopy]]. Scientists had been searching for the agent causing KS, and over 20 agents were proposed as the possible cause, including [[cytomegalovirus]] and [[HIV]] itself. The pathogen was ultimately identified in 1994 by [[Yuan Chang]] and [[Patrick S. Moore]], a wife and husband team at [[Columbia University]], through the isolation of DNA fragments from a [[herpesvirus]] found in a KS tumor in an AIDS patient.&lt;ref name=chang1 &gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7997879 | last1 = Chang | first1 = Y. | last2 = Cesarman | first2 = E. | last3 = Pessin | first3 = M.

The idea behind this experiment was that if a virus causes KS, the genomic DNA in the two samples should be precisely identical except for DNA belonging to the virus. In their initial RDA experiment, they isolated two small DNA fragments that represented less than 1% of the actual viral genome. These fragments were similar (but still distinct from) the known herpevirus sequences, indicating the presence of a new virus. Starting from these fragments, this research team was then able to sequence the entire genome of the virus less than two years later.

The discovery of this [[herpesvirus]] sparked considerable controversy and scientific in-fighting until sufficient data had been collected to show that indeed KSHV was the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boshoff C, Weiss RA |title=Addressing Controversies Over Kaposi's Sarcoma |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=677–679 |pmid=10793096 |doi=10.1093/jnci/92.9.677 |date=May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The virus is now known to be a widespread infection of people living in sub-Saharan Africa; intermediate levels of infection occur in Mediterranean populations (including Israel, Saudi Arabia, Italy and Greece) and low levels of infection occur in most Northern European and North American populations.  Gay and bi-sexual men are more susceptible to infection (through still unknown routes of sexual transmission) whereas the virus is transmitted through non-sexual routes in developing countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Virology==
KSHV is a [[herpesvirus]], and is a large double-stranded DNA virus with a protein covering that packages its nucleic acids, called the [[capsid]], which is then surrounded by an amorphous protein layer called the [[viral tegument|tegument]], and finally enclosed in a lipid envelope derived in part from the cell membrane. KSHV has a [[genome]] which is approximately 165,000 nucleic acid bases in length. KSHV is a [[rhadinovirus]], and is remarkable since it has stolen numerous genes from host cells including genes that encode for [[Complement system|complement]]-binding protein, [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], [[BCL-2]], [[cyclin]]-D, a [[G protein-coupled receptor]], [[interferon regulatory factor]] and Flice inhibitory protein ([[CFLAR|FLIP]]), as well as DNA synthesis proteins including [[dihydrofolate reductase]], [[thymidine kinase]], [[thymidylate synthetase]], DNA [[polymerase]] and many others. While no other human tumor virus possesses these same genes, other tumor viruses target the same cellular pathways illustrating that at a basic level, all tumor viruses appear to attack the same cellular control pathways, so-called tumor suppressor pathways.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

After infection, the virus enters into lymphocytes via [[macropinosome]]s where it remains in a latent ("quiet") state expressing the viral latency-associated nuclear antigen, [[LANA]].

The viral episome is chromatinized upon entry into the host cell nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Purushothaman, etal |title=KSHV Genome Replication and Maintenance |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=7 |pages=54 |date=February 2016 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.00054|pmid=26870016 |pmc=4740845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LANA tethers the viral DNA to cellular chromosomes, inhibits [[p53]] and [[retinoblastoma protein]] and suppresses viral genes needed for full virus production and assembly ("lytic replication"). Various signals such as inflammation may provoke the virus to enter into lytic replication. When lytic replication occurs, the viral episome starts replicating itself in the form of linear DNA molecules that are packaged into virus particles which are expelled from the cell, to infect new cells or to be transmitted to a new host. When the virus enters into lytic replication, thousands of virus particles can be made from a single cell, which usually results in death of the infected cell.

The viral genome consists of a ~145 kbase long unique region, encoding all of expressed viral genes, which is flanked by ~20-30 kbases of terminal repeat sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Russo JJ, Bohenzky RA, Chien MC, etal |title=Nucleotide sequence of the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV8) |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=93 |issue=25 |pages=14862–7 |date=December 1996 |pmid=8962146 |pmc=26227 |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.25.14862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each terminal repeat unit is 801 bp in length, has 85% G+C content and is oriented in a repetitive head-to-tail fashion. During latency, the virus genome depends on the host replication machinery and replicates as closed circular episome ("plasmid") using sequences within the terminal repeats as a replication origin. When the virus reactivates into lytic replication, it is believed that the virus genome is replicated as a continuous linear molecule off from an episome (so called rolling circle model). As each unit genome is replicated, it is cut within the terminal repeat region, and then packaged into a virus particle (virion). The virus then becomes enveloped with a lipid membrane as it transits the nucleus and the cytoplasm to exit the cell. Thus, whereas KSHV genome is circular in the nucleus of latently infected cells, it is packaged into infectious viruses as a linear molecule. Once the virus newly infects a cell, the lipid membrane is shed and the virion travels to the nucleus. The viral genome is released where it recircularizes through a poorly understood process that appears to involve [[homologous recombination]].

The primary viral protein responsible for the switch between latent and lytic replication is known as the ORF50 Replication Transactivation Activator (RTA).  When cell signaling conditions activate the generation of RTA, it in turn activates synthesis of a stereotypic cascade of secondary and tertiary viral proteins that ultimately make components of the virus capsid and also the DNA synthesis enzymes required to replicate the virus genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bu W, Palmeri D, Krishnan R, etal |title=Identification of Direct Transcriptional Targets of the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Rta Lytic Switch Protein by Conditional Nuclear Localization |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=82 |issue=21 |pages=10709–23 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18715905 |pmc=2573185 |doi=10.1128/JVI.01012-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The mechanisms by which the virus is contracted are not well understood. Healthy individuals can be infected with the virus and show no signs or symptoms, due to the immune system's ability to keep the infection in check. Infection is of particular concern to the [[immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]]. Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, AIDS patients, and organ transplant patients are all at a high risk of showing signs of infection.

Infection with this virus is thought to be lifelong, but a healthy immune system will keep the virus in check. Many people infected with KSHV will never show any symptoms. Kaposi's sarcoma occurs when someone who has been infected with KSHV becomes immunocompromised due to AIDS, medical treatment, or very rarely aging.

KSHV is a known causative agent of four diseases:&lt;ref name=Goncalves2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goncalves|first1=Priscila H.|last2=Ziegelbauer|first2=Joseph|last3=Uldrick|first3=Thomas S.|last4=Yarchoan|first4=Robert|title=Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus-associated cancers and related diseases|journal=Curr Opin HIV AIDS|date=2017|volume=12|issue=1|pages=47–56|doi=10.1097/COH.0000000000000330|pmid=27662501|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1234919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[HHV-8-associated MCD|HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman's disease]] – a [[lymphoproliferative disorder]],
* [[Primary effusion lymphoma]] – KSHV-associated aggressive mature monoclonal B-cell lymphoma,
* [[KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome]] – a syndrome with MCD-like symptoms but without associated pathology.

==Epidemiology==

==Evolution==

The [[most recent common ancestor]] of this virus in the Mediterranean, Iran, and Xinjiang, China, has been estimated to have evolved 29,872 years (95% highest probability density 26,851-32,760 years) ago.&lt;ref name=Liu2017&gt;Liu Z, Fang Q, Zuo J, Minhas V, Wood C, He N, Zhang T (2017) Was Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus introduced into China via the ancient Silk Road? An evolutionary perspective. Arch Virol&lt;/ref&gt; the most recent common ancestor for viruses isolated in Xinjiang was 2037 years (95% highest probability density 1843–2229 years) ago. Given the historical links between the Mediterranean and Xinjiang during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period it seems likely that this virus was introduced to Xinjiang along the [[Silk Road]]. The mutation rate was estimated to be  3.44 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; substitutions per site per year (95% highest probability density 2.26 × 10-6 to 4.71 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;). However, the global distribution of different genotypes of KSHV and the potential transmission path need further studies.

==Prevention==
Since persons infected with KSHV will asymptomatically give the virus, caution should be used by [[sex partner]]s in having [[unprotected sex]] and activities where saliva might be shared during sexual activity. Prudent advice is to use [[condom]]s when needed and avoid [[deep kissing]] with partners with KSHV and HIV infections or whose status is unknown. Blood tests to detect antibodies to virus exist.

==Treatment==
Kaposi's sarcoma is usually a localized tumor that can be treated either surgically or through local irradiation. Chemotherapy with drugs such as liposomal [[anthracycline]]s or [[paclitaxel]] may be used, particularly for invasive disease. Antiviral drugs, such as [[ganciclovir]], that target the replication of herpesviruses such as KSHV have been used to successfully prevent development of Kaposi's sarcoma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin DF, Kuppermann BD, Wolitz RA, Palestine AG, Li H, Robinson CA |title=Oral ganciclovir for patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis treated with a ganciclovir implant. Roche Ganciclovir Study Group |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=340 |issue=14 |pages=1063–70 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10194235 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199904083401402}}&lt;/ref&gt; although once the tumor develops these drugs are of little or no use. For patients with AIDS-KS, the most effective therapy is [[Antiretroviral drug|highly active antiretroviral therapy]] to reduce HIV infection.&lt;ref name=haart &gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncponc0253 | last1 = Yarchoan | first1 = R. | last2 = Tosato | first2 = G. | last3 = Little | first3 = R.

== KSHV genes ==
KSHV encodes for ~90 genes and multiple non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs.&lt;ref name="Samols"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Samols MA, Hu J, Skalsky RL, Renne R | title = Cloning and identification of a microRNA cluster within the latency-associated region of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 79 | issue = 14 | pages = 9301–5 | date = Jul 2005 | pmid = 15994824 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.79.14.9301-9305.2005 | pmc=1168752}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "ORF" genes are named based on genome position of the homologous genes in the first rhadinovirus described, herpesvirus saimiri. The "K" genes are unique to KSHV, Some KSHV genes have well-characterized functions, while others remain uncharacterized.

==Summary==

===History===
Founded in 1947, Koo In-Hwoi (Founder of LG Corp) established Lucky Chemical Industrial Corp, and launched "Lucky Cream," the very first cosmetics product in Korea. In 1954, the company also launched Korea’s first toothpaste brand, ‘Lucky Toothpaste’. In February 1995, the company changed its name to [[LG Chemical]] Ltd. In April 2001, LG Household &amp; Health Care spun off from [[LG Chemical]], and was listed on the Korean Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://localbusinessreports.net/lg-household-health-care-leading-way-cosmetics/ |title=LG Household &amp; Health Care: Leading the Way in Cosmetics |access-date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119023714/http://localbusinessreports.net/lg-household-health-care-leading-way-cosmetics/ |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since current CEO &amp; Vice Chairman, Suk Y. Cha joined the company in 2005, the business made a successful turnaround, and the company’s growth was further driven by strategic M&amp;As.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khnews.kheraldm.com/view.php?ud=20141208000888&amp;md=20141208211421_BL Cha’s success reveals secret of CEO longevity]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, LG Household &amp; Health Care is expanding its cosmetics and personal care business into global market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khnews.kheraldm.com/view.php?ud=20150316001020&amp;md=20150317003306_BL LG’s cosmetics unit bets big on Chinese market]&lt;/ref&gt;

===M&amp;A===
When LG Household &amp; Health Care was established, there were only two business divisions of [[cosmetics]] and [[household goods]]. From the acquisition of [[Coca-Cola]] Beverage(former Coca-Cola Korea Bottling Co., Ltd) in 2007, the company completed its current business structure of [[cosmetics]], [[household goods]], and [[beverages]]. Currently, LG Household &amp; Health Care is an exclusive manufacturer and distributor of [[Coca-Cola]] brand products in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcare.com/global/news/press/view.jsp?seq=82&amp;title= Acquisition of CCKBC Finalized]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the company acquired Diamond Water Co., Ltd to strengthen its drinking water business, and in 2011, the company acquired Haitai Beverage Co., Ltd, the third largest beverages company in Korea at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcare.com/global/news/press/view.jsp?seq=106&amp;title= LG HH Announces Takeover of Haitai Beverage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, cosmetics business made a successful turnaround through new high-end brand launches including ‘The History of Whoo’, ‘SU:M37’, and ‘belif’. In 2010, the company acquired low-end cosmetics brandshop, ‘[[TheFaceShop]]’, and a complete cosmetics product portfolio consisting of high-end, mid-end, to low-end was achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcare.com/global/news/press/view.jsp?seq=93&amp;title= LG H&amp;H Takes over Korea’s No. 3 Cosmetics Brand]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, LG Household &amp; Health Care acquired cosmetics brand, ‘Violet Dream’ (former VOV) to strengthen its color cosmetics business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcare.com/global/news/press/view.jsp?seq=120&amp;title= LG H&amp;H Concludes an Agreement to Acquire VOV]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the company acquired local cosmeceutical firm, CNP Cosmetics Co., Ltd, in order to expand into newly growing cosmeceutical category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2014/10/22/53/0501000000AEN20141022008100320F.html LG Household to acquire local cosmeceuticals maker CNP Cosmetics ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Division==

===Cosmetics===
LG Household &amp; Health Care is the second largest [[cosmetics]] company in [[South Korea]], and it has continued to narrow the gap with its competitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/05/618_179398.html Cosmetics vs. creative economy]&lt;/ref&gt; Its major high-end cosmetics brands include ‘The History of Whoo’, ‘O Hui’, ‘SU:M37’, and ‘belif’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcare.com/global/brand/list.jsp?type=BEAUTIFUL LG Household &amp; Health Care official site]&lt;/ref&gt; The high-end cosmetics business is growing fast with ‘The History of Whoo’ recording the highest sales among all other brands in major duty-free stores in Korea.&lt;ref name="lgcare.com"&gt;[http://www.lgcare.com/global/news/press/view.jsp?seq=181&amp;title= LG H&amp;H reports net sales of 1.3 trillion won, and operating profit of 178 billion won for 1Q 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The major brands in mid-to-low end cosmetics include ‘ISA KNOX’, ‘Sooryehan’, ‘BEYOND’, and ‘THEFACESHOP’, the number one brandshop in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khnews.kheraldm.com/view.php?ud=20150122000710&amp;md=20150122213254_BL Missha announces domestic downsizing, global expansion]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Household Goods===
LG Household &amp; Health Care has maintained a dominant number one position in Korean [[household goods]] industry, and still continues to increase its market share through product differentiation, and category expansion.&lt;ref name="lgcare.com"/&gt; The major business units are personal care and home care. Personal care includes oral care, hair care, and body care, while home care includes dishwashing detergent, laundry detergent, and fabric softener. The major brands are ‘Perioe’·’Bamboo Salt’(oral care), ‘Elastine’·’Reen’(hair care), ‘ON: THE BODY’(body care), ‘TECH’(laundry detergent), ‘Jayeonpong’(dishwashing detergent), and ‘Saffron’(fabric softner).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcare.com/global/brand/list.jsp?type=HEALTHY LG Household &amp; Health Care official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beverages===
Beverages business division was established through the M&amp;A of [[Coca-Cola]] Beverage(former Coca-Cola Korea Bottling Co., Ltd) in 2007, and is currently the second largest beverage company in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=awoWdM5rHQw8&amp;refer=home LG Household to Buy Coca-Cola Amatil's Korean Unit (Update3) ]&lt;/ref&gt; The major brands are ‘[[Coca-Cola]]’, ‘[[Fanta]]’, ‘[[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]]’, ‘Minute-Maid’, ‘Sunkist’, ‘Georgia’, and ‘POWERADE’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcare.com/global/brand/list.jsp?type=REFRESHING LG Household &amp; Health Care official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laminopathies''' (''[[wikt:lamino-|lamino-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-pathy|-opathy]]'') are a group of rare [[genetic disorder]]s caused by [[mutation]]s in genes encoding proteins of the [[nuclear lamina]]. They are included in the more generic term ''nuclear envelopathies'' that was coined in 2000 for diseases associated with defects of the [[nuclear envelope]].&lt;ref name=Nagano&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nagano A, Arahata K | title = Nuclear envelope proteins and associated diseases | journal = Curr. Opin. Neurol. | year = 2000 | volume = 13 |pages=533–9 | pmid = 11073359 | doi = 10.1097/00019052-200010000-00005|issue= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first reports of laminopathies in the late 1990s, increased research efforts have started to uncover the vital role of nuclear envelope proteins in cell and tissue integrity in animals.

==Symptoms==
Laminopathies and other nuclear envelopathies have a large variety of clinical symptoms including skeletal and/or cardiac [[muscular dystrophy]], [[lipodystrophy]] and [[diabetes]], [[dysplasia]], dermo- or [[neuropathy]], [[leukodystrophy]], and [[progeria]] (premature aging). Most of these symptoms develop after birth, typically during childhood or adolescence. Some laminopathies however may lead to an early death, and mutations of lamin B ([[LMNB1]] gene) may be lethal before or at birth.&lt;ref name=Vergnes&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vergnes L, Peterfy M, Bergo MO, Young SG, Reue K | title = Lamin B1 is required for mouse development and nuclear integrity | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | year = 2004 | volume = 101 |pages=10428–33 | pmid = 15232008 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401424101|issue= 28|pmc= 478588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
Patients with classical laminopathy have mutations in the gene coding for [[lamin]] A/C ([[LMNA]] gene).

More recently, mutations in [[lamin B]] (LMNB2 gene) or genetic defects leading to changes in lamin B abundance were identified as cause for laminopathies.

Mutations implicated in other nuclear envelopathies were found in genes coding for lamin-binding proteins such as [[lamin B receptor]] (LBR gene), [[emerin]] (EMD gene) and [[LEM domain-containing protein 3]] (LEMD3 gene) and prelamin-processing enzymes such as the [[zinc metalloproteinase STE24]] (ZMPSTE24 gene).

Mutations causing laminopathies include [[Recessive gene|recessive]] as well as [[Dominant gene|dominant]] [[allele]]s with rare ''de novo'' mutations creating dominant alleles that do not allow their carriers to reproduce before death.

The nuclear envelopathy with the highest frequency in human populations is [[Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy]] caused by an [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] mutation in the EMD gene coding for emerin and affecting an estimated 1 in 100,000 people.

==Molecular action==
Lamins are [[intermediate filament]] proteins that form the [[nuclear lamina]] scaffold underneath the [[nuclear envelope]] in animal cells. They are attached to the nuclear envelope membrane via farnesyl anchors and interaction with [[inner nuclear membrane proteins]] such as lamin B receptor and emerin. The nuclear lamina appears to be an adaptation to mobility in animals as sessile organisms such as [[plant]]s or [[Fungus|fungi]] do not have lamins&lt;ref name=Mans&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mans BJ, Anantharaman V, Aravind L, Koonin EV | title = Comparative genomics, evolution and origins of the nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complex | journal = Cell Cycle | year = 2004 | volume = 3 |pages=1612–37 | pmid = 15611647|issue= 12 | doi = 10.4161/cc.3.12.1316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the symptoms of many laminopathies include [[muscle]] defects. Mutations in these genes might lead to defects in filament assembly and/or attachment to the nuclear envelope and thus jeopardize nuclear envelope stability in physically stressed tissues such as [[muscle fiber]]s, [[bone]], [[skin]] and [[connective tissue]].&lt;ref name=Houben&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Houben F, Ramaekers FC, Snoeckx LH, Broers JL | title = Role of nuclear lamina-cytoskeleton interactions in the maintenance of cellular strength | journal = Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1773 |issue=5 |pages=675–86 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17050008 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.09.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Messenger RNA]] produced from the LMNA gene undergoes [[alternative splicing]] and is [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into lamins A and C. Lamin A undergoes [[Prenylation|farnesylation]] to attach a membrane anchor to the protein. This version of the protein is also referred to as prelamin A. Farnesylated prelamin A is further [[Posttranslational modification|processed]] into mature lamin A by a [[metalloproteinase]] removing the last 15 [[amino acid]]s and its farnesylated [[cysteine]]. This allows lamin A to dissociate from the nuclear envelope membrane and fulfill nuclear functions. Mutations causing laminopathies interfere with these processes on different levels.

===Nonsense and missense mutations===
[[Missense mutation]]s in the lamin A/C rod and tail domains are the cause for a wide array of genetic disorders, suggesting that lamin A/C protein contains distinct functional domains that are essential for the maintenance and integrity of different cell lineages. Interaction between lamin A and the nuclear envelope protein emerin appears to be crucial in muscle cells, with certain mutations in lamin mimicking mutations in emerin and causing [[Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy]]. Different mutations lead to dominant-negative and recessive alleles. Mutations in the lamin rod domain leading to mislocalization of both lamin A and emerin occur in patients with [[autosomal dominant]] forms of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy.

Most lamin B mutations appear to be lethal with mutations in lamin B1 causing death at birth in mice.&lt;ref name=Vergnes/&gt; In 2006, lamin B2 missense mutations were identified in patients with acquired partial lipodystrophy.&lt;ref name=Hegele/&gt;

===Point mutations===
The most common mutation in the lamin A/C is the homozygous Arg527His (arginine replaced by histidine at position 527) substitution in 
exon 9 of the LMNA gene&lt;ref name=Novelli&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Novelli G, Muchir A, Sangiuolo F, Helbling-Leclerc A, D'Apice MR, Massart C, Capon F, Sbraccia P, Federici M, Lauro R, Tudisco C, Pallotta R, Scarano G, Dallapiccola B, Merlini L, Bonne G | title = Mandibuloacral dysplasia is caused by a mutation in LMNA-encoding lamin A/C | journal = Am. J. Hum. Genet. | year = 2002 | volume = 71 |pages=426–31 | pmid = 12075506 | doi = 10.1086/341908|issue= 2|pmc= 379176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other known mutations are Ala529Val and Arg527His/Val440Met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zirn B, Kress W, Grimm T, Berthold LD, etal |year= 2008|title= Association of homozygous LMNA mutation R471C with new phenotype: mandibuloacral dysplasia, progeria, and rigid spine muscular dystrophy.|url= |journal= Am J Med Genet A|volume= 146A|pages= 1049–1054|doi= 10.1002/ajmg.a.32259|pmid=18348272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some mutations such as Arg527Cys, Lys542Asn, Arg471Cys, Thr528Met/Met540Thr, and Arg471Cys/Arg527Cys, Arg527Leu
result in [[mandibuloacral dysplasia]] with [[progeria]]-like features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Haggar M, Madej-Pilarczyk A, Kozlowski L, Bujnicki JM, Yahia S, Abdel-Hadi D, Shams A, Ahmad N, Hamed S, Puzianowska-Kuznicka M |year= 2012|title= A novel homozygous p.Arg527Leu LMNA mutation in two unrelated Egyptian families causes overlapping mandibuloacral dysplasia and progeria syndrome.|url= http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v20/n11/full/ejhg201277a.html|journal= Eur J Hum Genet|publisher= |volume= 20|issue= 11|pages= 1134–40|doi= 10.1038/ejhg.2012.77|pmc= 3476705|pmid= 22549407}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Splicing defects===
Mutations causing [[progeria]] are defective in [[Splicing (genetics)|splicing]] LMNA mRNA, therefore producing abnormal lamin A protein, also known as ''progerin''. The mutations activate a cryptic splice site within [[exon]] 11 of the gene, thereby causing the deletion of the processing site on prelamin A.&lt;ref name=Eriksson/&gt; This results in an accumulation of progerin that is unable to mature into lamin A, leading to misshapen nuclei. Missplicing also leads to the complete or partial loss of exon 11 and results in a truncated prelamin A protein in the neonatal lethal [[tight skin contracture syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Navarro/&gt;

===Processing defects===
Since the metalloproteinase STE24 is required to process prelamin A into mature lamin A, mutations in this gene abolishing [[protease]] activity cause defects similar to laminopathies caused by prelamin A with truncated processing sites. Symptoms in patients with ZMPSTE24 mutation range from mandibuloacral dysplasia, progeroid appearance, and generalized lipodystrophy to infant-lethal restrictive dermopathy.

===Gene dosage effects===
In the case of [[autosomal dominant]] leukodystrophy, the disease is associated with a duplication of the lamin B gene LMNB1. The exact [[Gene dosage|dosage]] of lamin B in cells appears to be crucial for nuclear integrity as increased expression of lamin B causes a degenerative phenotype in [[Drosophila|fruit flies]] and leads to abnormal nuclear morphology.&lt;ref name=Padiath/&gt;

===Autoimmune antibodies===
Antibodies against lamin B have been implicated in [[autoimmune disease]]s and are possibly involved in [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=Padiath/&gt;

===DNA repair===

A-type [[lamin]]s promote genetic stability by maintaining the levels of proteins that have key roles in DNA double-strand break repair during the processes of [[non-homologous end joining]] and [[homologous recombination]].&lt;ref name="pmid21701264"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redwood AB, Perkins SM, Vanderwaal RP, Feng Z, Biehl KJ, Gonzalez-Suarez I, Morgado-Palacin L, Shi W, Sage J, Roti-Roti JL, Stewart CL, Zhang J, Gonzalo S |title=A dual role for A-type lamins in DNA double-strand break repair |journal=Cell Cycle |volume=10 |issue=15 |pages=2549–60 |year=2011 |pmid=21701264 |pmc=3180193 |doi=10.4161/cc.10.15.16531 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutations in lamin A (LMNA) cause Hutchinson–Gilford [[progeria]] syndrome, a dramatic form of premature aging.&lt;ref name=Eriksson /&gt;  Mouse cells deficient for maturation of prelamin A show increased DNA damage and [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosome aberrations]] and are more sensitive to DNA damaging agents.&lt;ref name="pmid15980864"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu B, Wang J, Chan KM, Tjia WM, Deng W, Guan X, Huang JD, Li KM, Chau PY, Chen DJ, Pei D, Pendas AM, Cadiñanos J, López-Otín C, Tse HF, Hutchison C, Chen J, Cao Y, Cheah KS, Tryggvason K, Zhou Z |title=Genomic instability in laminopathy-based premature aging |journal=Nat. Med. |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=780–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15980864 |doi=10.1038/nm1266 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inability to adequately repair DNA damages when A-type lamins are defective is likely responsible for some of the aspects of premature aging.

==Treatment and drug development==
Currently, there is no cure for laminopathies and treatment is largely symptomatic and supportive. [[Physical therapy]] and/or corrective [[orthopedic surgery]] may be helpful for patients with muscular dystrophies. Laminopathies affecting [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] may cause [[heart failure]] requiring treatment with medications including [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[beta blocker]]s and [[Antimineralocorticoid|aldosterone antagonists]], while the [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] that frequently occur in these patients may require a [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] or [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|implantable defibrillator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Captur|first=Gabriella|last2=Arbustini|first2=Eloisa|last3=Bonne|first3=Gisèle|last4=Syrris|first4=Petros|last5=Mills|first5=Kevin|last6=Wahbi|first6=Karim|last7=Mohiddin|first7=Saidi A.|last8=McKenna|first8=William J.|last9=Pettit|first9=Stephen|date=2017-11-25|title=Lamin and the heart|journal=Heart|doi=10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312338|issn=1468-201X|pmid=29175975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for neuropathies may include medication for [[seizure]]s and [[spasticity]].

The recent progress in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of toxic progerin formation in laminopathies leading to premature aging has opened up the potential for the development of targeted treatment. The farnesylation of prelamin A and its pathological form progerin is carried out by the enzyme [[farnesyl transferase]]. [[Farnesyl transferase inhibitors]] (FTIs) can be used effectively to reduce symptoms in two mouse model systems for progeria and to revert the abnormal nuclear morphology in progeroid cell cultures. Two oral FTIs, [[lonafarnib]] and [[tipifarnib]], are already in use as anti-tumor medication in humans and may become avenues of treatment for children suffering from laminopathic progeria. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphate drugs used in the treatment of [[osteoporosis]] reduce [[Farnesyl pyrophosphate|farnesyldiphosphate]] production and thus prelamin A farnesylation. Testing of these drugs may prove them to be useful in treating progeria as well. The use of [[antisense]] [[oligonucleotide]]s to inhibit progerin synthesis in affected cells is another avenue of current research into the development of anti-progerin drugs.&lt;ref name=Rusinol&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rusinal AE, Sinensky MS | title = Farnesylated lamins, progeroid syndromes and farnesyl transferase inhibitors | journal = J.

== Graduate degree programs ==

=== Structure ===

Records are listed alphabetically by university in descending order. Within a given university, records are sorted by degree (doctorate, then master's). Inclusion criteria are described on the [[Talk:List of schools for quantitative psychology#Inclusion Criteria|talk page]].
* '''University section'''
** '''University''' – The university listed is the primary institution/organization which grants the degree. The link provided links to the Wikipedia page for the university.
** '''Department''' – The department listed is the primary department which grants the degree. The link provided links to the department's website.
* '''Program section'''
** '''Terminal degree''' – This is the final degree granted to the student within that degree track. Many doctoral programs in the US have joint MA/Ph.D programs. Those degrees are listed within the same record under the final degree granted (''e.g.'', Doctorate of Philosophy). The link provided directs to the description of the degree.
** '''Program''' – This is the name of the degree program. The link typically directs to the degree requirements. Many times the Terminal Degree page and the Program page are the same.
** '''Specialty''' – This subsection identifies various tracks within a degree program. Not all programs have this level of specialty. If applicable, the link directs to the primary page detailing the specialization requirements.
** '''Faculty''' – This section lists the tenured/tenure-track faculty currently listed on the program's website with a primary appointment. Emeritus professors are excluded from this list.
* '''Source''' – The source lists the academic organization which identified the program as a quantitative program. Multiple organizations can be listed. See the [[Talk:List of schools for quantitative psychology#Inclusion Criteria|talk page]] for more details.

[[File:Littering in Stockholm.jpg|right|thumb|Litter in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]]]

'''Litter''' consists of [[Waste|waste products]] that have been disposed of improperly, without consent, at an inappropriate location. Litter can also be used as a verb. To litter means to drop and leave objects, often man-made, such as aluminum cans, cardboard boxes or [[plastic bottle]]s on the ground and leave them there indefinitely or for others to dispose of as opposed to disposing of them properly.

Large and hazardous items of rubbish such as tires, electrical appliances, electronics, batteries and large industrial containers are sometimes dumped in isolated locations, such as national forests and other public lands.

It is a [[human impact on the environment]] and remains a serious [[environmental issue]] in many countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before degrading and be transported large distances into the world's oceans. Litter can affect the [[quality of life]].

[[Cigarette butt]]s are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded annually.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, T.E. &amp; Zhao, F. (1999). Consumption and production waste: another externality of tobacco use. Tobacco Control, 8, 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates on the required time for cigarette butts to break down vary. They range from five years to 400 years for complete degradation.&lt;ref name="Littering Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/issues/littering/littering-information.cfm |title=Littering Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006152103/http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/issues/littering/littering-information.cfm |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Umweltthemen Zigaretten |url= http://naturschutzbund.at/umweltthemen/articles/zigaretten.html |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2018 02 Templin DSCF1313.jpg|thumb|Littering in nature]]
In addition to intentional littering, almost half of litter on U.S. roadways is now accidental or unintentional litter, usually debris that falls off  improperly secured trash, recycling collection vehicles and pickup trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greve |first=Frank |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/244/story/25267.html |title=Mcclathydc.com |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population levels, traffic density and proximity to waste disposal sites are factors known to correlate with higher litter rates.&lt;ref name="erplanning.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erplanning.com/uploads/National_Geographic_Article.pdf |title=Erplanning.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njclean.org/New-Jersey-Litter-Report.pdf |title=NJClean.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3175688 |title=Debris Wreaks Havoc on the Road - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh |first=Patricia |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E2D81431F932A25756C0A9619C8B63 |title=Highway Debris, Long an Eyesore, Grows as Hazard - NYTimes.com |location=California |publisher=New York Times |date=2007-05-11 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NE 2010 survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://njclean.org/DOCUMENTS/2010-Northeast-Litter-Survey-Final-Report.pdf|title=Northeast 2010 Litter Survey, Retrieved 2012.05.16|author=|date=|website=njclean.org|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illegally dumped hazardous waste may be a result of the costs of dropping materials at designated sites: some of these charge a fee for depositing hazardous material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |url=http://www.epa.gov/region5/waste/illegal_dumping/downloads/il-dmpng.pdf |title=Illegal Dumping Prevention Guidebook |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of access to nearby facilities that accept hazardous waste may deter use. Additionally, ignorance of the laws that regulate the proper disposal of hazardous waste may cause improper disposal.

According to a study by the Dutch organization VROM, 80% of people claim that "everybody leaves a piece of paper, tin or something, on the street behind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidecostarica.com/dailynews/2010/december/20/costarica10122006.htm |title=Volunteers Pick Up Litter in Sabana Park |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young people from 12 to 24 years cause more litter than the average (Dutch or Belgian) person; only 18% of people who regularly cause litter were 50 years of age or older. However, a 2010 survey of littering in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States, placed litterers aged 55 and over at less than 5%. The same observational study estimated that 78% of litterers are male.&lt;ref name="NE 2010 survey" /&gt; In 1999, research by [[Keep America Beautiful]] found that 75% of Americans admitted to littering the last five years, yet 99% of the same individuals admitted that they enjoyed a clean environment.

Negligent or lenient law enforcement contributes to littering behavior. Other causes are inconvenience, entitlement and economic conditions. A survey of dumping in Pennsylvania found that the largest number of illegal dumps were in townships without municipal trash hauling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ydr.com/ci_15429915|title=The York Daily Record|author=|date=|website=The York Daily Record|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111223349/http://www.ydr.com/ci_15429915|archive-date=11 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also cites unavailability of curbside trash and recycling service, shortage of enforcement, and habit as possible causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keeppabeautiful.org/Portals/0/PDFs/IDS/MASTER_yorkIDS.pdf|title='PA CleanWays - Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful: Illegal Dump Survey Final Report York County 2010|author=|date=|website=keeppabeautiful.org|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427005301/http://www.keeppabeautiful.org/Portals/0/PDFs/IDS/MASTER_yorkIDS.pdf|archive-date=27 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of litter invites more littering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Two-stage process model===
The two-stage process model of littering behavior describes the different ways in which people litter. The model was proposed by Chris Sibley and James Liu and differentiates between two types of littering: active and passive.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, C.G., &amp; Liu, J.H. (2003). Differentiating active and passive littering: A two-stage process model of littering behavior in public spaces. ''Environment and Behavior'', 35, 415–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has implications for understanding the different types of litter reduction interventions that will most effectively reduce littering in a given environment. The theory states that, all things being equal, passive littering will be more resistant to change because of two psychological processes: 1. [[diffusion of responsibility]] that increases as the latency between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory, and 2. forgetting, which is also more likely to occur at longer delays between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory.

==Life cycle==
Litter can remain visible for extended periods of time before it eventually [[Biodegradation|biodegrades]], with some items made of condensed glass, [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]] or plastic possibly remaining in the environment for over a million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.deq.state.or.us/wmc/solwaste/rethinkrecyc/K-3/RRK-308.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428050343/http://www.deq.state.or.us/wmc/solwaste/rethinkrecyc/K-3/RRK-308.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/education/lnt/background/packing.htm |last=Brody |first=Jeremy |title=Teaching Leave No Trace. (Editorial) |work=blm.gov |date=10 January 1998 |accessdate=14 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814105440/http://www.blm.gov/education/lnt/background/packing.htm |archivedate=14 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christina Macfarlane, for CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/11/04/littering.golf.balls/ |title=CNN.com |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 18 percent of litter, usually traveling through [[stormwater]] systems, ends up in local streams, rivers, and waterways. Uncollected litter can accrete and flow into [[streams]], local [[bays]] and [[estuaries]]. Litter in the ocean either washes up on beaches or collects in [[Ocean gyre]]s such as the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. About 80 percent of [[marine debris]] comes from land-based sources.&lt;ref&gt;Faris, J. and Hart, K., Seas of Debris: A Summary of the Third International Conference on Marine Debris, N.C. Sea Grant College Program and NOAA, 1994, title page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some litter that is collected can be [[recycling|recycled]], however degraded litter cannot be recycled and eventually degrades to [[sludge]], often toxic. The majority of litter that is collected goes to [[landfill]]s.

==Effects==
Litter can have a detrimental impact on humans and the environment in different ways.

===Effects on humans===
[[File:DISCARDED TIRES LITTER THE SHORELINE OF THE MIDDLE BRANCH OF BALTIMORE HARBOR NEAR WATERVIEW AVENUE - NARA - 547683.jpg|thumb|These tires were discarded on the Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor in this photo from 1973. Tire dumping is still a concern today and could benefit from [[tire recycling]].]]

Hazardous materials encapsulated within tires and other items of illegally dumped rubbish can [[Leaching (chemistry)|leach]] into water sources, [[contamination|contaminate]] the soil and [[pollution|pollute]] the air.

[[Tire]]s are the most often dumped hazardous waste&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;. In 2007 the United States generated 262 million scrap tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/swfa/tires/|title=Waste Tires - Waste 2 Resources Program - Washington State Department of Ecology|publisher= |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-eight states have laws that ban whole tires being deposited in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/materials/tires/basic.htm|title=Basic information/scrap tires retrieved 05/15/2012|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these discarded tires end up illegally dumped on public lands. Tires can become a breeding ground for insect vectors which can transmit disease to humans.&lt;ref name="tires"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/materials/tires/health.htm|title=Health and Environmental Concerns /Tires retrieved 05/15/2012|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mosquitoes]], which breed in stagnant water, can transmit [[West Nile virus]] and [[malaria]]. Rodents nest in accumulated tires and can transmit diseases such as [[Hantavirus]].&lt;ref name="tires"/&gt;

When tires are burned they can smolder for long periods of time, emitting hundreds of chemical compounds that pollute the air causing respiratory illnesses. Additionally the residue left behind can harm the soil and leach into groundwater.&lt;ref name="tires"/&gt;

[[File:Toothbrush regurgitated by albatross on Tern Island, Hawaii - 20060614.jpg|thumb|This [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] from a Hawaiian albatross (either a [[black-footed albatross]] or a [[Laysan albatross]]) has several ingested [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan, and derelict|flotsam]] items, including monofilament from fishing nets and a discarded [[toothbrush]]. Ingestion of plastic flotsam can be an increasing health risk to [[albatross]]es, [[Tern Island (Hawaii)|Tern Island]], [[French Frigate Shoals]].]]

[[Visual pollution]] is a major effect of litter.

Open containers such as paper cups, cardboard food packets, plastic drinks bottles and aluminum drinks cans may fill up with rainwater, providing breeding locations for [[mosquito]]es&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;. In addition, a spark or a lightning flash can start a fire if it strikes litter such as a paper bag or cardboard box&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;.

Litter can be hazardous to health. Debris falling from vehicles is an increasing cause of automobile accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3175688 |title=ABCnews.go.com |publisher=ABCnews.go.com |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discarded [[dangerous goods]], [[chemical]]s, tires, [[sharps waste]] and [[pathogen]]s resulting from litter can cause accidental harm to humans.

Litter also carries substantial cost to the economy. Cleaning up litter in the US costs hundreds of dollars per ton, about ten times more than the cost of trash disposal, with a cost totaling about $11 billion per year.&lt;ref name="erplanning.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/100/v-print/story/900146.html Newsobserver.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805190449/http://www.newsobserver.com/100/v-print/story/900146.html |date=August 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on wildlife===
Animals may get trapped or poisoned with litter in their habitats. Cigarette butts and filters are a threat to [[wildlife]] and have been found in the stomachs of [[fish]], [[birds]] and [[whales]], who have mistaken them for food.  Also animals can get trapped in the rubbish and be in serious discomfort. For example, the plastic used to hold beverage cans together can get wrapped around animals' necks and cause them to suffocate as they grow&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;. Other instances where animals could be harmed by litter include broken glass lacerating the paws of [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and other small mammals&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;.

Most litter in Victoria, Australia ends up in or near oceans, beaches or rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litter.vic.gov.au/-/media/SV-VLAA/Downloads/Litter_Statistics_Fact_Sheet_-_2014.pdf?la=en|title=Litter Statistics Fact Sheet|last=Victorian Litter Action Alliance (VLAA)|first=|date=|website=|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Other effects===
Organic litter in large amounts can cause [[water pollution]] and lead to [[algal bloom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/resident/environment/Documents/Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Littering.pdf Litter management - Townsville City Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328031044/http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/resident/environment/Documents/Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Littering.pdf |date=March 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cigarettes could also start fires if they are not put out and then discarded in the environment.

==Extent==
Litter is an [[environmental issue]] in many countries around the world. While countries in the [[developing world]] lack the resources to deal with the issue, consumer based economies in the [[western world]] are capable of generating larger quantities of litter per capita due to a higher consumption of [[disposable product]]s.

===Branded litter===
A number of credible studies have shown that [[fast food]] packaging is one of the most common forms of litter while [[McDonald's]] is the most common brand of litter, despite having messages to dispose of properly, such as the [[Ronald McDonald]] "tidy man" marking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesatellite.com.au/news/study-reveals-mcdonalds-to-be-pick-of-the-litter/1768498/|title=Study reveals McDonalds to be pick of the litter|first=|last=cowen|publisher=thesatellite.com.au |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kab.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/KAB-National-Branded-Litter-Study-11-12.pdf|title=McGregorTan Research, Keep Australia Beautiful National Branded Litter Study Annual Results 2011/12, Retrieved 16 January 2016.|author=|date=|website=kab.org.au|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
[[File:No littering.svg|thumb|"No littering" sign in the US]]
===Litter bins===
{{main|Waste container}}
[[File:DeutscheBahnRecycling20050814 CopyrightKaihsuTai Rotated.jpg|thumb|left|Recycling and [[rubbish bin]] in a [[Germany|German]] [[railway station]].]]

Public waste containers or street bins are provided by local authorities to be used as a convenient place for the disposal and collection of litter. Increasingly both general waste and recycling options are provided. Local councils pick the waste up and take it to reuse or recycling. However, there are issues with this approach. If the bins are not regularly emptied, then overfilling of bins occurs and can increase litter indirectly. Some local authorities will only take responsibility for rubbish that is placed in the bins, which means that litter remains a problem. People may blame a lack of well-placed bins for their littering. Hazardous materials may be incorrectly disposed of in the bins and they can encourage [[dumpster diving]].

===Picking up===
[[File:US Navy 090917-N-1783P-001 Naval Nuclear Power Training Command student volunteers dispose of used tires littering the waterways of Naval Weapons Station Charleston.jpg|Clean Up|thumb|Naval Nuclear Power Training Command student volunteers dispose of used tires littering the waterways of [[Naval Support Activity Charleston|Naval Weapons Station]] [[Charleston, South Carolina]].]]

Volunteers, sometimes alone or coordinated through organizations, pick up litter and dispose of it. Clean up events may be organized in which participants will sometimes comb an area in a line to ensure that no litter is missed. In North America, [[Adopt a Highway]] programs are popular, in which companies and organizations commit to cleaning stretches of road. In Kiwayu, a Kenyan island, some of the collected litter (flip-flops) is used to make art, which is then sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theffrc.com/|title=theffrc.com|author=|date=|website=www.theffrc.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swahili-imports.com/home/si3/page_5146/uniqueco__the_flip_flop_project.html |title=UniquEco: The Flip Flop Project &amp;#124; Artisans |publisher=Swahili-imports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picking up litter can be hazardous to health. Hazards can include spinal damage through repeated bending, and exposure to [[dangerous goods]], [[sharps waste]] and [[pathogen]]s. As a result, safety equipment such as gloves is sometimes worn and tools such as [[reach extender]]s are used.

===Litter traps===
[[File:Litter trap.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Parks Victoria]] litter trap on the river catches floating rubbish on the [[Yarra River]] at [[Birrarung Marr]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].]]
Litter traps can be used to capture litter as it exits stormwater drains into waterways. However, litter traps are only effective for large or floating items of litter and must be maintained. A recent watershed litter survey showed a difference in the composition of street litter and stormwater litter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.erplanning.com/uploads/2015_Anacostia_Watershed_Litter_Survey_-_Final_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108143240/http://www.erplanning.com/uploads/2015_Anacostia_Watershed_Litter_Survey_-_Final_Report.pdf |archive-date=2016-01-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring dumping sites===
Increasingly, there have been efforts to use technology to monitor areas prone to dumping. In Japan, a study used [[Geographic Information System]]s (GIS) to map areas of dumping based on site characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Container deposit legislation===
[[Container deposit legislation]] can be aimed at both reducing littering and also encouraging picking up through local recycling programs that offer incentives, particularly for [[aluminium recycling|aluminium cans]], [[glass recycling|glass bottles]] and [[plastic recycling|plastic bottles]]. In New York, an expanded bottle bill that included plastic water bottles increased recycling rates and generated 120 million dollars in revenue to the state General Fund from unclaimed deposits in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/news/articles/2010/NY-11-3-NYsBBBringsIn.htm|title=Bottle Bills in the News|publisher= |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, [[container deposit legislation]] has been introduced on cans and plastic bottles. Parts of Belgium are also considering adopting such legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140819_01222742|title=Wallonië wil statiegeld op blik invoeren|work=De Standaard}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can thus collect [[Container deposit legislation|refund value money]] from this type of waste. The result of this is that in Germany, hardly any cans or plastic bottles can still be found along the road. In the Netherlands, the amount of litter has dropped considerably since the new law was implemented, and 95% of the plastic bottles are now recycled. According to Chris Snick, the revenue that can be obtained from waste picking can be financially profitable in countries where container deposit legislation has been introduced: in 1 hour he managed to pick up 108 cans and 31 plastic bottles, earning him 13.90 euro (€0.10 per can/plastic bottle).&lt;ref&gt;Het Nieuwsblad, 23 august 2014; "13.90 euro voor wat gedeulte blikjes, geen slecht uurloon"&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, in countries where only the value of the aluminum for example would be refunded, 139 cans would yield only 1.72 euro (0.0124 euro per can; assuming there is 15 grams of aluminum in a can, and with scrap aluminum valued at 0.8267 euro/kg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recraigslist.com/2013/10/how-to-make-money-selling-scrap-metal/|title=How To Make Money Selling Scrap Metal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Fines===
[[File:No littering sign in Cape Cod.jpg|thumb|right|No littering sign at a highway in [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts.]]
Some countries and local authorities have introduced legislation to address the problem.

Actions resulting in fines can include on-the-spot fines for individuals administered by authorised officers in public or on public transport or littering from a vehicle, in which the vehicle owner is fined - reported by either responsible officer or third party, sometimes online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/waste/littering.html|title=Littering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/litter/if_you_have_been_reported.asp |title=If you've been reported - EPA Victoria |publisher=Epa.vic.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific legislation exists in the following countries:
* United States - punishable with a more than $500 fine, community service, or both, as set out by state statutes and city ordinances. All 50 states have anti-litter laws, with various fines, community service, and/or imprisonment as possible punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/env-res/states-with-littering-penalties.aspx|title=States with Littering Penalties|first=National Conference of State|last=Legislatures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* United Kingdom - Leaving litter is an offence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This was extended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 under section 18. It carries a maximum penalty of £2500 upon conviction. However, many local authorities issue fixed penalty notices under section 88 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Often incorrectly known as "on the spot fines", they do not have to be issued on the spot. Nor are they a fine.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} If an alleged offender does not want to pay a fixed penalty notice, he can have the case heard in the Magistrates Court.
* Australia - no national legislation, although state based environmental protection authorities have laws and fines to discourage littering.
* The Netherlands - Dutch police and local supervisors (known as ''buitengewoon opsporingsambtenaar'', or BOA) fine citizens for throwing away cans, bottles or wrappers on the street.

==Anti-litter campaigns==
[[File:International tidyman.svg|thumb|upright|The International Tidy Man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/1964to1979/filmpage_tidy.htm |title=Public Information Films : 1964 to 1979 : Film index : Keep Britain Tidy |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many groups exist with the aim of raising awareness and run campaigns including clean up events. [[World Cleanup Day]] is a worldwide campaign.

In the United States there are a number of organizations running anti-litter campaigns. [[Keep America Beautiful]] was founded in 1953, and promulgated the word ''litterbug'', coined by its partner the [[Ad Council]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=132 |title=Ad Council : Pollution: Keep America Beautiful - Iron Eyes Cody (1961-1983) |access-date=2009-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030084003/http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=132 |archive-date=2008-10-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 38 states have high profile, government-recognized slogan campaigns, including [[Don't Mess with Texas]]; Let's Pick It Up New York; Don't Trash California; Take Pride in Florida; Keep Iowa Beautiful.

In Australia, [[Clean Up Australia]] Day is supported by many major Australian companies, firms and volunteers alike. Anti-litter organizations include "[[Keep Australia Beautiful]]", founded in 1963. It created the popular "Do the Right Thing" campaign and its Tidy Towns competition became well known being a very competitive expression of civic pride.

[[Keep Britain Tidy]] is a British campaign run by the Keep Britain Tidy environmental charity, which is part funded by the UK government.

==History==

Throughout human history, people have disposed of unwanted materials onto streets, roadsides, in small local dumps or often in remote locations. Prior to reforms within cities in the mid-to-late 19th century, [[sanitation]] was not a government priority. The growing piles of waste led to the spread of disease.

Anti-littering legislation seems to have existed in [[ancient Greece]], as is evidenced by a road marker discovered on the island of [[Paros]], bearing the inscription ''"whoever drops their litter on the street owes 51 [[drachma]]e to whoever wishes to claim them"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=73. Στήλη λευκού Παριακού μαρμάρου ελλιπής κάτω. |url=http://www.greek-language.gr/digitalResources/ancient_greek/anthology/inscriptions/page_086.html |accessdate=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the growing amount of waste generated in the United States, the [[Solid Waste Disposal Act]] of 1965 was enacted. In 1976 the Federal government amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act, creating the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA), which requires a "cradle to grave"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/inforesources/pubs/orientat/rom2.pdf|title=RCRA Orientation Manual: Managing Nonhazardous Solid Waste Retrieved 2012-05-15.|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach to the proper handling of potentially hazardous materials. RCRA gives authority to the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to regulate and enforce proper hazardous waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resource Conservation and Recovery Act |url=http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/rcra.html |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many countries now have laws that require that [[household hazardous waste]] be deposited in a special location rather than sent to landfills with regular refuse. Household hazardous waste includes [[paints]] and [[solvents]], [[chemicals]], [[light bulbs]], [[fluorescent lights]], spray cans, and yard products such as [[fertilizers]], [[pesticides]], [[herbicides]] and [[insecticides]]. Additionally, [[medical waste]] generated at home is considered a hazardous waste and must be disposed of properly.

'''Malaria Control''' is a volunteer [[distributed computing]] project. The project simulate the transmission dynamics and health effects of malaria. It is part of the [[Africa@home]] project.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lovgren|first1=Stefan|title=Malaria Battlers Enlist Power of Your PC|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060808-malaria.html|accessdate=10 June 2017|publisher=National Geographic|date=8 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902224121/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060808-malaria.html|archivedate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The malariacontrol.net domain name was first registered on 19 May 2005 under Swiss Tropical Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malariacontrol.net domain information|url=https://www.whois.com/whois/malariacontrol.net|website=whois.com|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was under [[Africa@home]] where the latter was conceived and developed by European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Malariacontrol was the first project to use distributed computing to model diseases. The model simulates malaria infection in 50,000 to 100,000 people. Each work unit lasted for an hour in average personal computers and the results were returned to [[University of Geneva]] for evaluation by researchers.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helen|first1=Pearson|title=Wanted: computers for a humanitarian cause|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060717/full/news060717-15.html|accessdate=13 June 2017|publisher=Nature|date=20 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826162943/http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060717/full/news060717-15.html|archivedate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malariacontrol ran all the simulations by using [[stochastic simulation]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does MalariaControl.net work?|url=https://africa-at-home.web.cern.ch/africa-at-home/malariacontrolnet.html|website=Africa@home|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 4 November 2010, using the financial support from [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=A Smith|title=Open Malaria|url=https://github.com/SwissTPH/openmalaria/wiki|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=14 June 2017|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malariacontrol.net developed an [[Open-source model|open-source]] software named "Open Malaria" which can be used to simulate outcomes in various types of malaria transmission settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Malaria releases|url=https://github.com/SwissTPH/openmalaria/wiki/Changelog#schema-version-23|publisher=GitHub|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2016, malariacontrol.net announced that the project has been terminated due to financial constraints in upgrading their servers for further volunteer computing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maire|title=Status and plans as of June 2016|url=http://www.malariacontrol.net/forum_thread.php?id=1472|website=malariacontrol.net|accessdate=10 June 2017|date=21 June 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722220548/http://www.malariacontrol.net/forum_thread.php?id=1472|archivedate=22 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Malaria Control has studied the effectiveness of using [[RTS,S]] malaria vaccine in [[World Health Organization]]'s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in different malarial transmission settings and reported that such programme only has modest benefits over 14 years period. The study suggested that the RTS,S vaccine should be used in targeted mass vaccination in low malarial transmission settings in order to get the most benefits out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Status update|url=http://www.malariacontrol.net/forum_thread.php?id=1264|website=malariacontrol.net|accessdate=14 June 2017|date=23 March 2012|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327012309/http://www.malariacontrol.net/forum_thread.php?id=1264|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
As of 2010, malariacontrol.net had about 10,000 active users with 37,002 registered members. Similar to the general [[BOINC]] users, malariacontrol.net mainly had a volunteer base of males ranged from 20 to 50 years old, mostly staying in European countries and North America. Most of them learned about this project through BOINC website and their main motivation was the satisfaction of doing something good for the betterment of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krebs|first1=Viola|title=Motivations of cybervolunteers in applied distributed computing environment: Malariacontrol.net as an example.|journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|date=1 February 2010|volume=15|issue=2|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2783/2452#author|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original hospital was designed by the famous American architect [[Charles Bulfinch]].&lt;ref name="Ether Dome" /&gt; It is the third-oldest general hospital in the [[United States]]; only [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] (1751) and [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]]'s predecessor [[New York Hospital]] (1771) are older.&lt;ref name="Globe_20110226" /&gt; [[John Warren (surgeon)|John Warren]], Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at Harvard Medical School, spearheaded the move of the medical school to Boston.

[[John Bartlett (minister)|John Bartlett]], the Chaplain of the [[Almshouse]] in Boston. Because all those who had sufficient money were cared for at home, Massachusetts General Hospital, like most hospitals that were founded in the 19th century, was intended to care for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hms.harvard.edu/about/history.html Harvard Medical School: A History and Background&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-to-late 19th century, Harvard Medical School was located adjacent to Massachusetts General Hospital.

[[Walter J. Dodd]] established the radiology department at the hospital.  From just after the discovery of x-rays in 1895, until his early death in 1916 from metastatic cancer caused by multiple radiation cancers he oversaw the radiology department.  He also underwent over 50 surgical procedures at the hospital to treat his radiation injuries, from skin grafts to amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suit|first1=Herman D.|last2=Loeffler|first2=Jay S.|title=Evolution of Radiation Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xL44oNwJsXgC&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=R1QEttqi_T&amp;dq=walter%20j%20dodd%20radiology&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=walter%20j%20dodd%20radiology&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|language=en|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first American hospital social workers were based in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Beder, J. (2006). ''Hospital Social Work: The interface of medicine and caring... Routlege: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital's work with developing specialized computer software systems for medical use in the 1960s led to the development of the [[MUMPS]] programming language, which stands for "'''M'''assachusetts General Hospital '''U'''tility '''M'''ulti-'''P'''rogramming '''S'''ystem," an important programming language and data-base system heavily used in medical applications such as patient records and billing. A major patient database system called File Manager, which was developed by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (now the Department of Veterans' Affairs), was created using this language.

Patients, families, hospital staff, and members of the public can learn more about the accomplishments MGH is most proud of at the [[Paul S. Russell, MD Museum of Medical History and Innovation]], located at the front of the hospital's main campus on Cambridge Street. 
===Early use of anesthesia===
[[Image:Ether monument-Boston.JPG|thumb|125px|left|Monument in Boston commemorating Morton's demonstration of ether's anesthetic use.]]

On 16 October 1846, after administration of ether by Morton, MGH Chief of Surgery, John Collins Warren, painlessly removed a tumor from the neck of a local printer, [[Edward Gilbert Abbott]].&lt;ref name="Ether Dome" /&gt; Upon completion of the procedure, which was without screaming or restraint, the usually skeptical Warren reportedly quipped, "Gentlemen, this is no humbug." News of this "anesthesia" invention rapidly traveled within months around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fenster | first = J.

A reenactment of the Ether Dome event was painted in 2000 by artists Warren and Lucia Prosperi. They used the then-MGH staff to pose as their counterparts from 1846.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.massgeneral.org/history/museum_onlineExhibits_EtherMural.htm Museum at Mass General&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415110724/http://www2.massgeneral.org/history/museum_onlineExhibits_EtherMural.htm |date=2013-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ether Dome still exists&lt;ref name="Ether Dome" /&gt;  and is open to the public.

An anesthesia department was established at the MGH in 1936 under the leadership of Henry Knowles Beecher.

=== First successful replantation of a severed limb ===
On May, 1962, under the direction of [[Ronald A. Malt]], a team of surgeons successfully accomplished the first replantation of completely severed limb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ronald-malt-trq26n9gcbb|title=Ronald Malt|date=2002-11-11|work=The Times|access-date=2018-06-08]|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While attempting to hitch a ride on the back of a freight train, Everett Knowles hit an abutment when the train lurched, severing his arm completely at the shoulder. He and his arm were rushed to MGH, where a 30 year old Malt conducted the team of surgeons. Some doctors prepared Everett for surgery, while others worked on the separated arm.  First they rejoined the "chaotically mangled blood vessels, then the bone and finally the skin." In the time since the accident, the arm had grown a "deathly gray," but grew steadily pink as the surgery progressed and blood vessels were reattached. The nerves would be reconnected in a later surgery. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title=He Takes a Grip on Life|last=Howard|first=Jane|date=1962|work=Life Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2006/03/donald-alan-malt/|title=Donald Alan Malt|date=2006-03-02|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“All we did,” said the modest Dr. Malt, “was apply techniques we’ve known about for a long time and simply never had occasion to correlate before…The astonishing thing was not the newness of the operation but the teamwork—the way 12 doctors with expert skills, distinguished a collection of authorities as you could find anywhere, were willing to stand by and feed the incomparable extent of their knowledge to me, for no gain other than to know they had contributed.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Facilities and current operations==
The main MGH campus is located at 55 Fruit Street in Boston, Massachusetts. It has expanded into an area formerly known as the [[West End, Boston, Massachusetts|West End]], adjacent to the [[Charles River]] and [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]]. The hospital handles around 1.5 million outpatient visits each year at its main campus, as well as its seven satellite facilities in Boston at Back Bay, Charlestown, Chelsea, Everett, Revere, Waltham and Danvers. With more than 25,000 employees, the hospital is the largest non-governmental employer in Boston.&lt;ref name="BostonRedevelopmentAuthority"&gt;{{cite news

==Controversies==
A former MGH physician filed a lawsuit under seal in May 2015 alleging that at least five orthopedic surgeons endangered patient safety by keeping them under [[anesthesia]] longer than necessary while the surgeons performed simultaneous surgeries. Dr. Lisa Wollman refiled the lawsuit in June 2017, citing concerns that the hospital was driven by economic benefit and keeping patients unaware of the practice of concurrent surgeries. Wollman's attorney claimed that [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] were being defrauded because they require that the surgeons must be present for all "critical portions" of the surgery in order to be compensated.&lt;ref name="Saltzman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Saltzman |first=Jonathan |last2=Wallack |first2=Todd |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/07/mgh-surgeons-left-patients-waiting-under-anesthesia-while-they-did-second-surgeries-whistle-blower-charges/QshFeHhRn92WOSwDEIi1LO/story.html |title=Whistle-blower files suit over alleged double-booked surgeries |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2017-06-07 |accessdate=2017-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Maxime Kuczyński was born near [[Poznań]], then in the [[Province of Posen]] within the [[German Empire]], as the son of Emma (''[[Given name#Name at birth|née]]'' Schlesinger) and Louis Kuczyński, both of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/swiat/wybory-w-peru-kuczynski-prowadzi-ale-czesc-kart-trzeba-sprawdzic/dq6ekx|title=Wybory w Peru:  Kuczynski prowadzi, ale część kart trzeba sprawdzić|date=9 June 2016|website=Wiadomosci.onet.pl|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Berlin]] shortly after his birth. He studied [[medicine]] and [[natural science]] at the [[University of Rostock]].

During [[World War I]], he served in the German army and participated in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Balkans Campaign]]. In 1924, he received his professorship. After the Nazis came to power he fled to Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/peru-leading-presidential-contender-is-son-of-polish-jews-who-fled-nazis/|title=Peru presidential contender is son of Polish Jews who fled Nazis|website=Timesofisrael.com|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1924 and 1926 he conducted [[Anthropology|anthropological]] research in [[Central Asia]], and later, between 1938 and 1948, in [[Andes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence K.

A '''methadone clinic''' is a clinic which has been established for the dispensing of [[methadone]] (Dolophine). Methadone treatment is indicated in patients who are opioid dependent or have a history of opioid dependence.&lt;ref name="Clinical Guidelines" /&gt; Methadone is a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|schedule II]] (USA) [[opioid]] analgesic, that is also prescribed for pain management. It is a long-acting opioid that can delay the opioid withdrawal symptoms that patients experience from taking short-acting opioids, like [[heroin]], and allow time for detoxification.&lt;ref&gt;Ilene Anderson, Thomas E Kearney (January 200) “Use of Methadone.” Medicine Cabinet. Retrieved November 11, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; By law, patients must receive methadone under the supervision of a physician, and dispensed through an opioid treatment program certified by [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] and registered with the [[Drug Enforcement Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (09/28/2015) “Methadone”. Retrieved November 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation and policy==
In the United States, there are approximately 1500 methadone clinics that are federally certified opioid treatment programs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2018|title=Medications for Opioid Use Disorder – Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder (Part 3 of 5)|url=https://store.samhsa.gov/product/tip-63-medications-opioid-use-disorder-%E2%80%93-pharmacotherapy-opioid-use-disorder-part-3-5/sma18|journal=Treatment Improvement Protocol|volume=63|pages=|via=Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are generally two types of methadone clinics, public and private. The public clinics are generally cheaper to attend. However, there is usually a waiting list due to limited funding. The private clinics are more expensive to attend but usually have either a short or no waiting list. In many parts of the United States, methadone clinics are few and far between, which presents problems for addicts seeking methadone treatment who live far from a clinic. The greatest concentrations of clinics are in [[California]], [[Maryland]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[New Jersey]]. All methadone clinics must register as an accredited opioid treatment program with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration and renewed yearly or every three years based on accreditation time-frame awarded. Additionally, methadone clinics must register with the Drug Enforcement Agency before methadone can be dispensed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While not restricted to adults, this treatment method is generally not considered for people under the age of 18. 

Methadone clinics in the [[United States]] operate under strict regulations by state and federal laws. Before entering treatment, a patient must be given adequate information to provide [[informed consent]] about starting treatment. This information includes reasons for treatment and recommendation, the side effects and risks of treatment, and rules that must be followed to receive methadone treatment.&lt;ref name="Clinical Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Information |first1=National Center for Biotechnology |last2=Pike |first2=U. S. National Library of Medicine 8600 Rockville |last3=MD |first3=Bethesda |last4=Usa |first4=Bethesda |title=Methadone maintenance treatment |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310658/ |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=en |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a physician ensures that the patient voluntarily chooses to receive treatment through a consent form, treatment planning can begin. The patient must show current addiction to an opioid, using accepted medical criteria such as those listed in the [[DSM-5]] and have evidence that he or she became addicted at least 1 year before admission for treatment. &lt;ref&gt;“42 CFR 8.12 - Federal Opioid Treatment Standards.” Legal Information Institute, Legal Information Institute, Retrieved November 1, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. Prior to administration of treatment, a clinical evaluation is required asking about drug use history, co-occurring disorders, and impact of abuse on life,  along with providing information about the treatment goals and guidelines. A medical evaluation is also given in the form of a [[Clinical urine tests|urinalysis test]], a review of past and current health history, and a test for certain conditions which are known to be prevalent in addict populations, such as HIV, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. The medication is monitored by nursing staff and is prescribed by a [[physician]]. As of 2013, due to the strict changes in receiving prescription pain medication as well as decreases in prescription abuse, the requirements to be accepted into methadone clinics have changed in areas such as New York State.

==Use of methadone clinics==
Methadone clinics can provide methadone for on-site administration or to take home for self administration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Opioid Treatment Medications should be administered/dispensed by a practitioner who is licensed (by state, or federally) to administer/dispense opioid drugs. A [[pharmacist]], [[registered nurse]], or licensed [[nurse practitioner]] may also administer/dispense opioid treatment medications under the supervision of a licensed practitioner. More recent studies illustrated improved outcomes through a multidisciplinary approach, while similar successes are shown through delivery models led and managed by nurses or pharmacists under protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lagisetty|first=Pooja|last2=Klasa|first2=Katarzyna|last3=Bush|first3=Christopher|last4=Heisler|first4=Michele|last5=Chopra|first5=Vineet|last6=Bohnert|first6=Amy|date=2017-10-17|title=Primary care models for treating opioid use disorders: What actually works? A systematic review|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5645096/|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=12|issue=10|pages=e0186315|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0186315|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5645096|pmid=29040331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some methadone clinics can provide oversight of treatment, observed dosing, consultation services, urine drug test, [[naloxone]] distribution, mental health services, primary care services, and [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis C|HCV]] services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Although not required by regulation at this time in the United States, people are usually encouraged to attempt other types of treatment methods prior to entering methadone treatment programs. Since its use beginning in the 1960s, methadone is still the preferred choice of treatment at the clinics, and is often part of other protocols.The [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) provides the protocol of how to treat addiction with recommended options including medication assisted treatment, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and medical detox. Other than methadone, newer medications with fewer side effects including [[buprenorphine]] and [[naltrexone]] have been introduced which are non-addictive, relieve drug cravings, block opioid effects, and avoid physical dependence. CBT is an individualized treatment plan that allow therapists to explore patterns of maladaptive substance use to help generate alternative behavior skills. Medical detox ensures safety and comfort by providing long-term monitoring until the symptoms of withdrawals are over. &lt;ref&gt;"What to Know About Methadone Clinics." American Addiction Centers, Retrieved November 1, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of treatment for addiction is [[Psychotherapy|counseling]]. Methadone clinics are only for recovering addicts from opioids. Clinics require attendance at counseling groups as well as individual counseling contacts. It is generally accepted that the more intensive the counseling contacts the individual is willing to submit to, the higher the success rate of the program.
Also, an integral part of counseling is on preventing the exposure and transmission of HIV. Clinics should be able to provide or refer patients to various services: community resources, [[vocational rehabilitation]], education, employment, and prenatal-care.&lt;ref&gt;“42 CFR 8.12 - Federal Opioid Treatment Standards.” Legal Information Institute, Legal Information Institute, Retrieved November 1, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; There is no set guideline for duration of methadone treatment, however, longer treatments are associated with better outcomes. Patients receiving methadone treatment in a closed setting should be assisted when transferring to a community-based setting. Patients who voluntarily decide to stop methadone treatment should speak to their provider to discuss why they want to stop and other treatment options.&lt;ref name="Clinical Guidelines" /&gt;

==Effectiveness==
While methadone clinics are generally considered to be effective treatment options for patients addicted to opioids, especially when other interventions have failed, there is controversy surrounding the placement of methadone clinics.  There is a perception that the presence of the clinics attracts crime to surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=CrimeStudy /&gt; However, one study by the University of Maryland School of Medicine found that is not the case, crime rates do not increase when a methadone clinic is opened.&lt;ref name=CrimeStudy&gt;{{cite news |title=Methadone clinics don't attract crime, study finds |author=Andrea K Walker |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-04-30/health/bs-hs-methadone-clinic-crime-20120412_1_methadone-clinics-methadone-users-crime-data |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 30, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 GAO study notes that placement of clinics can impede recovery and exacerbate relapse: 

“Although these clinics are intended to help those in need of rehabilitation, patients who seek treatment must navigate their way to and from the clinics in an environment in which illegal sales of narcotics are daily occurrences. The efforts of patients who are seeking rehabilitation, and clinic professionals who serve them, are significantly undermined by this criminal activity that surrounds them." &lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, GAO-04-946T, Drug Rehabilitation Clinics: Illegal Drug Activities Near Some District of Columbia Clinics Undermine Clinic Services and Patient Rehabilitation 4 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 70-90% of patients who discontinue methadone maintenance will relapse.&lt;ref name=Maine&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinicians say giving addicts maintenance methadone serves them and society best |author=Christopher Williams |url=http://www.sunjournal.com/news/maine/2012/05/27/clinicians-say-giving-addicts-maintenance-methadon/1199164 |newspaper=Maine Sun Journal |date=May 27, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high relapse rate may be partially due to the severity of cases seen at methadone clinics, as well as the long-term effects of opioid use.  Some patients will be on methadone for the rest of their lives, which generates criticism regarding the effectiveness of the clinics.  Supporters argue that the clinics aim not just to eliminate narcotic addictions, but also to help people function in their lives.&lt;ref name=Maine /&gt;

Methadone clinics may decrease the use of emergency rooms by patients addicted to opioids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarz |first1=Ryan |last2=Zelenev |first2=Alexei |last3=Bruce |first3=Douglas |year=2012 |title=Retention on buprenorphine treatment reduces emergency department utilization, but not hospitalization, among treatment-seeking patients with opioid dependence |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment |volume= 43|issue= 4|pages= 451–7|doi= 10.1016/j.jsat.2012.03.008|pmid=22534003 |pmc=3419304}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 2009 Cochrane review, methadone maintenance treatments decreased the likelihood that heroin dependent patients would use heroin, but did not change crime or mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattick |first1=Courtney  |last2=Breen |first2=Jo |last3=Davoli |first3=Marina |year=2009 |title=Methadone maintenance therapy versus no opioid replacement therapy for opioid dependence |journal=The Cochrane Library |volume= |issue=3 |page= CD002209| doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002209.pub2 | pmid = 19588333|url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/11159/1/Methadone%20maintenance%20therapy%20versus%20no%20opioid%20replacement%20therapy%20for%20opioid%20dependence_GREEN%20VoR.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Health and Medical Education''' ('''MOHME''') has executive responsibility for health and medical education within the [[Iran]]ian government. The MOHME comprises five departments headed by deputy ministers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/docs/iteipc20057_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Review : The Islamic Republic of Iran|website=Unctad.org|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Higher education in Iran|Education]], 
#Logistics,
#[[Healthcare in Iran#Nutrition|Food]] and [[Healthcare in Iran#Pharmaceuticals|Drug]] and 
#[[Healthcare in Iran|Health]]. 

Iran's health system is highly centralized, and almost all decisions regarding general goals, policies and allocation of resources are made at the central level by MOHME. The Ministry has the legal authority to oversee, license and regulate the activities of the private health sector.&lt;ref name=WHO5&gt;[http://gis.emro.who.int/HealthSystemObservatory/PDF/Contracting/Iran.pdf The role of contractual arrangements in improving health sector performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706072720/http://gis.emro.who.int/HealthSystemObservatory/PDF/Contracting/Iran.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }} page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

An elaborate system of health network provides [[Primary Health Centre|Primary Health Care]] (PHC) to the vast majority of the Iranian public. MOHME owns and runs Iran's largest health care delivery network of health establishments and medical schools. MOHME is in charge of provision of healthcare services through its network, [[medical insurance]], [[medical education]], supervision and regulation of the [[healthcare system]] in the country, policymaking, production and distribution of pharmaceuticals, and research and development.

The Third Socio-economic Development Plan in 1999 authorized MOHME to adopt move towards  public–private partnership in health care delivery.&lt;ref name=WHO6&gt;[http://gis.emro.who.int/HealthSystemObservatory/PDF/Contracting/Iran.pdf The role of contractual arrangements in improving health sector performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706072720/http://gis.emro.who.int/HealthSystemObservatory/PDF/Contracting/Iran.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }} page 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2003 Statistical Centre of Iran census, Iran has 730 medical establishments (hospitals, clinics,...) with 110,797 [[bed]]s in all, of which 488 (77,300 beds) are run by the MOHME, 120 (11,301 beds) are privately owned, and the rest belong to other organisations, such as the [[Social Security Organization (Iran)|Social Security Organization of Iran (SSO)]].&lt;ref name='Iran'&gt;{{Citation| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=IRAN: Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals Forecast| title=Economist Intelligence Unit| editor-first=| editor-last=| publisher=| place=| pages=| date=August 18, 2008| year=| id= | contribution-url=| format=| accessdate=2009-07-12| editors= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Health Organization, private hospitals also do not prefer to contract with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, because of low tariffs, extra paperwork and delays in payment.&lt;ref name=WHO5 /&gt;

Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has adopted a full generic-based [[National Drug Policy]] (NDP), with local production of [[essential drugs]] and [[vaccines]] as one of the main goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2773/html/economy.htm Iran-Daily: Biggest Pharmaceutical Plant to Open Soon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206043310/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2773/html/economy.htm |date=2007-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MOHME has a mission to provide access to sufficient quantities of safe, effective and high quality medicines that are affordable for the entire population.

MOHME is the main stakeholder of pharmaceutical affairs in the country. However, the Social Security Investment Co. (SSIC), Iran's largest holding company, which owns and controls 22 pharmaceutical manufacturing companies with a 40% share of total pharmaceutical production in Iran, is affiliated to the Ministry of Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atiehbahar.com/Resource.aspx?n=1000012 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707183052/http://www.atiehbahar.com/Resource.aspx?n=1000012 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, 55 [[List of Iranian companies#Pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical companies]] in Iran produce more than 96 percent (quantitatively) of medicines on the market, worth $1.2 billion annually&lt;ref&gt;[http://iran-daily.com/1386/2880/html/national.htm Iran Daily - National - 07/01/07] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703181411/http://iran-daily.com/1386/2880/html/national.htm |date=2007-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a total market worth $1.87 billion (2008) and $3.65bn by 2013 (projected).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3249/html/economy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923041452/http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3249/html/economy.htm |archivedate=2009-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/apr/1027.html|title=Iran Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Report Q2|website=Payvand.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although over 85 percent of the population use an insurance system to reimburse their drug expenses, the government heavily subsidises pharmaceutical production/importation.

The MOHME Department of Medical Equipment supervises imports of medical equipment, its import and distribution is mostly handled by the [[private sector]].

The '''Modified Ashworth scale''' ('''MAS''') measures resistance during passive soft-tissue [[stretching]] and is used as a simple measure of [[spasticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ansari|first1=NN|last2=Naghdi|first2=S|last3=Arab|first3=TK|last4=Jalaie|first4=S|title=The interrater and intrarater reliability of the Modified Ashworth Scale in the assessment of muscle spasticity: limb and muscle group effect.|journal=NeuroRehabilitation|date=2008|volume=23|issue=3|pages=231–7|pmid=18560139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scoring (taken from Bohannon and Smith, 1987):
* 0: No increase in muscle tone
* 1: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension
* 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
* 2: More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
* 3: Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
* 4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension

The '''Montreal Oral School for the Deaf''' (MOSD) is a provincial school in [[Westmount, Quebec]], [[Canada]] with programs serving [[Hearing impairment|deaf and hard-of-hearing]] students. The school was founded in 1950.&lt;ref name=CTV&gt;{{cite web |url= http://montreal.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110423/mtl_deaf_110423/20110423/?hub=MontrealHome |title=CTV Montreal - School for the deaf marks 60 years|work=montreal.ctv.ca |date= 2011-04-23|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has a [[Early childhood education|preschool day program]], closed classrooms for [[elementary school]] children, and itinerant support for students of all ages mainstreamed into regular hearing classrooms.

The mission of the Montreal Oral School for the Deaf (MOSD) is to provide habilitation and education for children with hearing loss from infancy through to early adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montrealoralschool.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuska''' (Assyrian: &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'''nusku''', also &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;En-Šadibdib or &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;Umun-Šazedib) was the vizier of the chief Sumerian god [[Enlil]].&lt;ref name="Fox1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael V. Fox|title=Temple in society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHjV2_-8V2oC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=8 June 2011|year=1988|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-38-6|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also described as a scribe who records events, and a boatman who takes Enlil to his future wife, [[Ninlil]]. His shrine was recorded to be in the [[Ekur]].&lt;ref name="Fox1988"/&gt;

Later, In [[Babylon]]ia and [[Assyria]], he became the [[solar deity|light]] and [[Fire worship|fire]] god, indistinguishable from Girru (formerly [[Gibil]]).

== Later influence ==

In Babylonia and Assyria Nuska is the symbol of the heavenly as well as of the terrestrial fire. As the former he is the son of [[Anu]], the god of heaven, but he is likewise associated with [[Enlil]] of [[Nippur]] as the god of the earth and regarded as a first-born son. A centre of his cult in Assyria was in [[Harran]], where, because of the predominance of the moon-cult, he is viewed as the son of the moongod [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] and his wife [[Ningal]], though Nuska was with Enlil when Sin wasn't born yet, and Enlil hadn't married Ninlil—Sin's mother. Nuska is by the side of [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]], the god of water, the great purifier. It is he, therefore, who is called upon to cleanse the sick and suffering from disease, which, induced by the demons, was looked upon as a species of impurity affecting the body.

The fire-god is also viewed as the patron of the arts and the god of civilization in general, because of the natural association of all human progress with the discovery and use of fire. As among other nations, the fire-god was in the third instance looked upon as the protector of the family. He becomes the mediator between humanity and the gods, since it is through the fire on the altar that the offering is brought into the presence of the gods.

While temples and sanctuaries to Nusku-Girru are found in Babylonia and Assyria, he is worshipped more in symbolical form than the other gods.

For the very reason that his presence is common and universal he is not localized to the same extent as his fellow deities, and, while always enumerated in a list of the great gods, his place in the systematized pantheon is more or less vague. The conceptions connected with Nuska are of distinctly popular origin, as is shown by his prominence in incantations, which represent the popular element in the cult, and it is significant that in the astro-theological system of the Assyrian and Babylonian priests Nusku-Girru is not assigned to any particular place in the heavens.

Nuksu is revered in the name of [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] ("he whom Nusku endows with confidence,") a 12th-century BC king of [[Assyria]].

Nutrition psychology seeks to understand the relationship between nutritional behavior and mental health/well-being.  NP is a sub-field of [[psychology]] and more specifically of [[health psychology]]. It may be applied to numerous different fields including: [[psychology]], [[dietetics]], [[nutrition]], and [[marketing]]. NP is a fairly new field with a brief history that has already started to contribute information and knowledge to psychology.  There are two main areas of controversy within nutrition psychology. The first area of controversy is that the topic can be viewed in two different ways.  It can be viewed as nutrition affecting psychological functions, or psychological choices and behavior influencing nutrition and health. The second controversy being the defining of what is "healthy" or "normal" as related to nutrition.

==Overview==
{{Synthesis|section|date=April 2018}}
Nutrition is defined as, "the act or process of nourishing or being nourished; ''specifically'':  the sum of the processes by which an animal or plant takes in and utilizes food substances"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nutrition|title = Definition of NUTRITION|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Psychology is defined as, "the study of mind and behavior in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychology|title = Definition of PSYCHOLOGY|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this case, the particular field is nutrition. Therefore, nutrition psychology is the study of mind and behavior in relation to the process of taking in and utilizing food.

=== Objectives ===
Today, over one third of American adults are considered "[[Obesity|obese]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html|title = Adult Obesity Facts Data Adult Obesity DNPAO CDC|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nutrition psychology aims to explain what psychological reasons may be behind this and other health trends. Nutrition psychology looks at the internal psychological effects of why people do what they do, and how they are shaped and influenced by outside stimuli.

== Origins and development ==
Nutrition psychology is a field that is still in its early stages of development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} With [[obesity]] being a continually growing problem in the [[United States]] and abroad, nutrition psychology is gaining importance and popularity in society today. As it has grown, nutrition psychology has directly and indirectly influenced research on [[dieting]], [[Nutrition facts label|food labels]], the way food is marketed, [[food technology]], obesity, and the attitude of the public towards food, among other topics.

Some research discusses the idea of "Food faddism," which is loosely defined as, "the idea that too much weight is put upon the influence of food and diet on overall health and that claims, whether good or bad, are often exaggerated."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=William T.|date=1983-01-01|title=Food Faddism, Cultism, and Quackery|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nu.03.070183.000343|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|volume=3|issue=1|pages=35–52|doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.03.070183.000343|pmid=6315036}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This idea of food choices having extreme consequences is thought to be deeply ingrained into culture, possibly stemming from the story of [[Adam and Eve]] eating the [[forbidden fruit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Food labels ===
In 1990, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) required that [[Nutrition facts label|nutrition labels]] be put on food products in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiesel|first=Kristin|last2=McCluskey|first2=Jill J.|last3=Villas-Boas|first3=Sofia B.|date=2011-01-01|title=Nutritional Labeling and Consumer Choices|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.resource.012809.103957|journal=Annual Review of Resource Economics|volume=3|issue=1|pages=141–158|doi=10.1146/annurev.resource.012809.103957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thought behind doing so was to provide consumers with the necessary information to make educated decisions about the foods that they purchased. Since that time, nutrition psychologists have done research on how influential these labels are on how consumers choose what foods to buy. These studies have shown mixed results concerning the effects of nutritional labeling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the research, the average consumer does tend to read the labels and take the information into consideration, in part because companies have begun producing foods with more health-conscious ingredients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, many of these potential health benefits are overshadowed by the continuing increase in obesity and deaths related to obesity in the United States over the last few decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Marketing ===
As with any industry, [[marketing]] plays an important role in the buying and selling of food products. Marketing campaigns for food and beverages are increasingly prevalent today and are larger in scope than ever before, given the resources that large corporations are able to use in the forms of social media and [[viral marketing]]. Some researchers claim that the dramatic rise in obesity rates are at least in part, due to an increase in the marketing of food over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Frederick J.|date=2011-01-01|title=Using Marketing Muscle to Sell Fat: The Rise of Obesity in the Modern Economy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090810-182502|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=32|issue=1|pages=285–306|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090810-182502|pmid=21219166}}&lt;/ref&gt; New marketing strategies have taken many forms, including changing the packaging of the food or beverage itself, product placement in media, advertisements in schools, increased focus on "value meals" with larger portions, and endorsements by athletes or celebrities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of these methods increase exposure to younger consumers, who studies show, tend to be more impressionable than adults and whose eating patterns as children can continue long into their adult lives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There are calls for junk food television advertisements to be banned before 9.00 pm to prevent children seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/top-paediatrician-says-its-time-to-give-parents-extra-votes-for-their-children Top paediatrician says it's time to give parents extra votes for their children] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food technology ===
Recently, food has been a source of technological development. Nutrition psychologists have studied the public's perception of food technology such as genetic modification or additives that may extend the shelf life of food, among other topics. In general, the findings show that the average consumer is more likely to avoid food that is affected by technology and will prefer organic, all-natural choices.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lusk|first=Jayson L.|last2=Roosen|first2=Jutta|last3=Bieberstein|first3=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=Consumer Acceptance of New Food Technologies: Causes and Roots of Controversies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012735|journal=Annual Review of Resource Economics|volume=6|issue=1|pages=381–405|doi=10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012735}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technological effects are often perceived by consumers to pose health risks, even if those claims are not founded in facts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Fad diets ===
Nutrition psychology has many applications not only related to how and what people eat on a day-to-day basis, but also the ways in which and why they [[Dieting|diet]] and [[Physical exercise|exercise]]. [[Fad diet]]s are popular in today's society and they usually play heavily on potential customers' ideals about what they should weigh or look like. These diets usually include an extreme condition or restriction on a person's food intake that supposedly will result in [[Weight Loss/Dieting|weight loss]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/home|title=Food Facts home|website=www.bda.uk.com|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; People become attracted to these weight loss claims because of the potential ease with which the weight loss can happen. However, these claims are not always founded in scientific research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The 2004 documentary film, ''[[Super Size Me]]'', directed by and starring [[Morgan Spurlock]] focuses on the ways in which the [[fast food]] industry in America is influencing how people and especially young children, view nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Spurlock|first = Morgan|title = Super Size Me|date = 2004-06-11|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/?ref_=nv_sr_1|accessdate = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8476">'''Palmer notation''' (named after [[Ohio]] dentist Dr. Corydon Palmer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edward F. Harris |year=2005 |title=Tooth-Coding Systems in the Clinical Dental Setting |journal=Dental Anthropology |volume=18 |issue=2 |page=44 |issn=1096-9411 |url=http://anthropology.osu.edu/DAA/back%20issues/DAVol18%202.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106031551/http://anthropology.osu.edu/DAA/back%20issues/DAVol18%202.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[dental notation]] used by dentists to associate information to a specific tooth. Also known as the Military System. Although supposedly superseded by the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation]], it overwhelmingly continues to be the preferred method used by orthodontists, dental students and practitioners in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blinkhorn A, Choi C, Paget H | title = An investigon into the use of the FDI tooth notation system by dental schools in the UK. | journal = Eur J Dent Educ | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–41 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9588962 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0579.1998.tb00034.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally termed the '''Zsigmondy system''' after the Hungarian dentist [[Adolf Zsigmondy]] who developed the idea in 1861, using a '''Zsigmondy cross''' to record quadrants of tooth positions&lt;!--
  --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Huszár G | title = [The role of the life and works of Adolf Zsigmondy and Ottó Zsigmondy in the history of dentistry] | journal = Fogorv Sz | volume = 82 | issue = 12 | pages = 357–63 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2689240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- NB not same as Richard Adolf Zsigmondy who won Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1925 --&gt; Adult teeth were numbered 1 to 8, and the child primary dentition (also called deciduous, milk or baby teeth) were depicted with a quadrant grid using Roman numerals I, II, III, IV, V to number the teeth from the midline. Palmer changed this to A, B, C, D, E. This makes it less confusing and less prone to errors in interpretation.

The Palmer notation consists of a symbol (┘└ ┐┌) designating in which quadrant the tooth is found and a number indicating the position from the midline. Adult teeth are numbered 1 to 8, with deciduous (baby) teeth indicated by a letter A to E. Hence the left and right maxillary central incisor would have the same number, "1", but the right one would have the symbol, "┘", underneath it, while the left one would have, "└".

==Table of codes==
Orientation of the chart is traditionally "dentist's view", i.e. patient's right corresponds to notation chart left.  The designations "left" and "right" on the chart, however, nonetheless correspond to the patient's left and right, respectively.

With the move from written dental notes to electronic records, some difficulty in reproducing the symbols has been encountered.&lt;!--

On a standard keyboard 'slash' and 'backslash' may be used as a crude approximation to the symbols with numbers placed before or afterwards; hence '''3/''' is '''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;┘''' and '''/5''' is '''┌&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Daniel Johnson has put together a Palmer Tooth Notation TrueType font called FreePalmer. It can be downloaded:
{{cite web | title=FreePalmer TrueType Font | url=http://www.markpreston.co.uk/fonts/FreePalmer.ttf}} It is covered by the GPL 3 license. This font is descended from FreeSans, part of the {{cite web | title=Freefont project | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/}} A screenshot showing it working in OpenOffice can be seen here: {{cite web | title=FreePalmer in OpenOffice | url=http://www.markpreston.co.uk/fonts/palmer5.png}} A derivative which enables the grid patterns to be produced that correspond to
handwritten Palmer tooth notations is available for download as well {{cite web | title=FreePalmerMP7 TrueType Font | url=http://www.markpreston.co.uk/fonts/FreePalmerMP7.ttf}}

One advantage of Palmer notation is that it can produce a very graphical image, akin to a 'map' of the dentition; [[tooth transposition]]s or [[edentulous|edentulous space]]s can easily be depicted if desired. It would also be feasible to introduce additional alphabetic characters or other symbols, for example to denote [[Supernumerary body part|supernumerary]] teeth or [[dental bridge|bridge pontics]], to which a purely numerical method such as the FDI system does not lend itself easily.&lt;!--

A '''preventive action''' is a change implemented to address a weakness in a management system that is not yet responsible for causing nonconforming product or service.

Candidates for preventive action generally result from suggestions from customers or participants in the process but preventive action is a proactive process to identify opportunities for improvement rather than a simple reaction to identified problems or complaints.  Apart from the review of the operational procedures, the preventive action might involve analysis of data, including trend and risk analyses and proficiency-testing results.

The focus for preventive actions is to avoid creating nonconformances, but also commonly includes improvements in efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.matlensilver.com/blog/post/the-pa-part-of-capa.html |title=THE PA PART OF CAPA |first= |last= |work=MATLEN SILVER |year=2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preventive actions can address technical requirements related to the product or service supplied or to the internal management system.

Many organizations require that when opportunities to improve are identified or if preventive action is required, action plans are developed, implemented and monitored to reduce the likelihood of nonconformities and to take advantage of the opportunities for improvement.  Additionally, a thorough preventive action process will include the application of controls to ensure that the preventive actions are effective.

In some settings, corrective action is used as an encompassing term that includes [[remedial action]]s, [[corrective action]]s and preventive actions.

== Risk and decision making ==
Preventive actions rely upon on the consequences of change. Once changed, inevitably, risks should be taken into consideration. In this case preventive actions aim to minimize or, where possible, eliminate the risks.

[[Risk]]s arise when little is known and understood about a particular situation. The chances of risk are minimized whilst one has better knowledge of the opportunities and consequences that could follow a situation. In order to reduce risk, a full analysis of potential best and worst results is required. Before taking into consideration any plan, people should be aware of the consequences of both success and failure. Not only the internal aspects - capability, expertise and willingness of staff- but also the external aspects of an organisation - stakeholders, customers, clients - should be assessed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Pettinger|first1 = Richard|title = Introduction to management|date = 2006|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|location = Basingstoke [u.a.]|isbn = 9780230000384|edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic risk management works with defining an organisation's approach to risk in terms of condition, attitudes and expertise. It identifies the possible areas of risk and assures that the proper approach is used. Then operational risk management will insure that steps for minimizing or eliminating the risk are followed. A strategic approach of the risk management includes studying the environment and being aware of the issues that must be considered in any situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Risks can occur due to a range of unexpected possible and potential events outside of the organisation's control, such as: political instability, change in currency, changes of the weather which could lead to a change in customer behavior, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Therefore, in an organisation it is important to know and understand what events could take place, where and why. So, managers should prioritize some steps of preventive actions in order to anticipate these kind of issues, especially focusing more on:
* Patterns of behavior
* Accidents
* Single events and errors 
"Patterns of behavior" relates to the morale and motivation of people.The effects of human behavior (such as victimization, bullying, harassment and discrimination) could affect confidence, weakening the relationships meant to lead to performance.

Accidents could happen anytime and anywhere. Thus, an organisation has to assure that the accidents are kept to a minimal level. In this situation preventive actions should focus more on the nature and quality of the working environment, safety aspects and technology.

Single events and errors are very hard to be managed and impossible to be eliminated. The risk should be kept at a minimum through supervision systems, regular inspections and procedures.

In order to perform a change, an organisation has to do a forecast, deeply understanding where that event could lead and its consequences. Thus, the risk of a particular event and its probability of occurring should be clear. Using this information, one can understand and better make future decisions, proposal and initiatives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Examples in management ===
Preventive actions differ from one organisation to another.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qualitysystems.com/support/pages/preventive-action&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizmanualz.com/improve-management-systems/what-are-the-top-ten-preventive-actions.html&lt;/ref&gt; Their number is vast, among them counting:
* Assessing business trends
* Monitoring processes
* Notifications regarding any situation
* Perform risk analysis 
* Assessing new technology
* Regular training and checking
* Recovery planning 
* Safety and security policies 
* Audit analysis

== Technology safety and security ==
Nowadays, due to fast changes in engineering, there is a large emphasis in the enhancement of [[safety]] and [[security]] regarding technology. However, in order to avoid some issues, more powerful safety analysis techniques are constantly being developed. As safety and security issues can occur anytime, intentionally or not, more preventive strategies against loss or hacking are enhanced. These actions aim to focus on the possible causes of the problem, rather than solving an already critical situation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/cacm232.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computing ===
[[Computer security]] tries to defend computers by assuring that their networks are not accessed or disrupted. They approach different tactics in order to protect against attackers, creating barriers or lines of defense, through [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] or [[encryption]]. However, losses result also from actions not executed properly (such as human errors) or from system errors among components.

Losses could be prevented through preventive strategies and tactics. Security analysts could find possible attackers, highlighting their reasons, potential and purpose. Owning proper knowledge, security experts could assess their own system and identify the most suitable defense strategy. Tracing is one of the methods used by people in order to find any issue or deficiency in their system.

Focusing first on strategy rather than tactics&lt;ref&gt;http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2013/01/14/the-difference-between-strategy-and-tactics/&lt;/ref&gt; can be achieved by adopting a new system-theoretic causality model recently developed to provide a more powerful approach to engineering for safety.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Causality models used in accidents are either traditional, caused by human errors, or more complex, caused by wrong interaction between components and systems errors.

STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) is a model of accident causality used in investigating potential accidents that can occur. In this case, issues are seen as results of inadequate control of the safety components used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Toolkit:Systems_Thinking_for_Safety/Systems_Theoretic_Accident_Model_and_Processes_%28STAMP%29|title = SKYbrary|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays more powerful systems that analyse safety have been created. STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis) uses such techniques, being based on the STAMP model of causality.&lt;ref&gt;http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Systems-Theoretic-Process-Analysis-STPA-v9-v2-san.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Once the cause is identified, STPA examines the system, creating a proper scenario that could solve the issue.

=== Information systems ===
Regarding technology, not only the safety and security of computers and isolated devices can be threatened, but also of entire complex [[information system]]s. As not all decisions made in an organisation are based on known rules, the analytical manager will examine in details the situation and anticipates potential issues that can occur. However. many decisions could have a great impact on some aspect of the organisation and cannot be easily reversed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hickie|first1=Paul Bocij, Andrew Greasley, Simon|title=Business information systems : technology, development and management|date=2008|publisher=FT Prentice Hall|location=Harlow, England|isbn=9780273716624|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, [[Systems modeling|modelling]] and [[Systems simulation|simulating]] play the roles of preventive actions, being applied earlier for the design of the process, where real factual data is not available. It is an abstract representation, that includes all aspects of a process so its potential impact could be better analysed. Such a representation before implementing can be done through [[business process modeling]] (BPM).

On one hand, there are indeed the [[deterministic system]]s that rely on the input data and are capable of predicting accurate output. On the other hand, there is the probabilistic system&lt;ref&gt;http://ecomputernotes.com/mis/information-and-system-concepts/differentiate-between-deterministic-and-probabilistic-systems&lt;/ref&gt; as well, which does not forecast with completely accuracy. However, both deterministic and probabilistic systems need some earlier actions that could prevent issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Analysis and design count are among the most important activities done before starting-up a business. During analysing, one gets a better understanding over the potential of the business; a diagrammatic model ensuring the agreement between IT professionals and system users. System design aims to design the way in which the system will work, this being eventually followed by system building.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Preventive healthcare ===
[[Preventive healthcare]] or preventive medicine refers to the measures taken in order to prevent and treat diseases. As there is a wide range of diseases in the world, there is also a wide variety of factors that influence those health disorders, such as environment, genetic and lifestyle. Preventive healthcare relies on the anticipation of the diseases, before they take occur. Among these preventing methods,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/preventivehealth.html&lt;/ref&gt; there are:
* regular check-ups at the doctors, in order to prevent risk factors or to monitor different diseases
* getting scanned, such as scanning of chronic diseases (cancer, diabetes, heart diseases)
* vaccinations
* trying to have a healthy lifestyle, through healthy eating and regularly exercising
* avoiding some harmful habits, such as tobacco or alcohol 
* life insurance
However, these traditional healthcare strategies&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001921.htm&lt;/ref&gt; are not the only actions that could prevent health diseases. A very important step is recognizing and being aware of some certain health changes that can turn into real health threats. Examples of minor problems that people usually do not take seriously into consideration are numerous, such as losing involuntary weight, lasting coughs, body changes and others aches and pains. Once with noticing a disorder, people can take action by checking a specialist in order to avoid the situation getting worse.

=== Crime prevention ===
[[Crime prevention]] relies on the actions that defend and fight against criminals and crimes, such as murders, robberies, burglaries, black mail, high jacking or smuggling.

[[Criminology|Criminologists]] focus on preventing the risks that can cause crime rather than reacting to crime that have already occurred.

There is a great number of techniques used in reducing crime. These could be split up into ones at a large scale, such as strategies implemented by a society or community, and others at a smaller one, such as personal security.

Examples of collective strategies preventing criminality:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/2011/11/19/what_really_cleaned_up_new_york/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increasing capacity of the police in an area
* Investing in jails
* Monitoring areas
* Support exchange of information regarding violent activities and events
* Enforcing the security
* Introducing violence preventing behavior in education
However, in most of the cases people tend to rely on their own personal skills and capabilities that could help them in preventing and defending criminal attacks. For example:
* Self-defense training
* Securing goods
* Avoiding wilderness

==Types of diseases==
Because pornographic film making involves [[unsimulated sex]], usually without [[condom]]s ([[Bareback (sex)|barebacking]]), pornographic actors are particularly vulnerable to [[sexually transmitted disease]]s including [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]],  [[syphilis]], and [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez-Hart|first1=C|last2=Chitale|first2=RA|last3=Rigg|first3=R|last4=Goldstein|first4=BY|last5=Kerndt|first5=PR|last6=Tavrow|first6=P|title=Sexually transmitted infection testing of adult film performers: is disease being missed?|journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases|date=December 2012|volume=39|issue=12|pages=989–94|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3182716e6e|pmid=23191956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grudzen|first1=CR|last2=Meeker|first2=D|last3=Torres|first3=J|last4=Du|first4=Q|last5=Andersen|first5=RM|last6=Gelberg|first6=L|title=HIV and STI risk behaviors, knowledge, and testing among female adult film performers as compared to other California women|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=February 2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=517–22|doi=10.1007/s10461-011-0090-0|pmid=22101890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=BY|last2=Steinberg|first2=JK|last3=Aynalem|first3=G|last4=Kerndt|first4=PR|title=High Chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence and reinfection among performers in the adult film industry|journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases|date=July 2011|volume=38|issue=7|pages=644–8|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e318214e408|pmid=21844714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former pornographic actress [[Shelley Lubben]], a 1980s outbreak of HIV led to the death of 27 porn stars between 1985 and 1992, including [[Wade Nichols]] (who died in 1985),&lt;ref name=Lubben2013/&gt; [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] (1988), [[Marc Stevens (actor)|Marc Stevens]] (1989), and [[Al Parker]] (1992).&lt;ref name=Lubben2013&gt;{{cite web |last=Lubben |first=Shelley |date=September 3, 2013 |title=STD and HIV Outbreaks in the Porn Industry Since the 1980's |url=http://pornharmsresearch.com/2013/09/std-and-hiv-outbreaks-in-the-porn-industry-since-the-1980s/ |type=compilation |website=pornharmsresearch.com |publisher=Morality in Media |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1986, Holmes was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Six months previously, he had tested negative. During the summer of 1986, Holmes, knowing his HIV status, agreed to perform in two pornographic films to be filmed in Italy, without informing the producers of his HIV status. Performers in one film, ''The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empress'', were [[Ilona Staller|Ilona "Cicciolina" Staller]], who later became a member of the Italian parliament, [[Tracey Adams]], [[Christoph Clark]], and [[Amber Lynn]].&lt;ref name=Huge2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Various |year=2008 |editor-last=Patrick |editor-first=John |title=Huge |publisher=STARbooks |page=13 |isbn=978-1-934187-29-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers in the other film, ''The Devil In Mr. Holmes'', were Adams, Lynn, [[Karin Schubert]], and [[Marina Hedman]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Subsequently, it was revealed that Holmes had consciously chosen not to reveal his HIV status to his producers or co-stars before engaging in unprotected sex for the filming.&lt;ref name=Huge2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden010112&gt;{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |date=12 January 2001 |title= WADD: The Life and Times of John C.

The heterosexual segment of the porn industry voluntarily shut down for 30 days (a 60-day moratorium was originally announced but it was lifted early) while it tried to deal with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7652.php AIDS in pornography industry of California contained says adult industry body]&lt;/ref&gt; Darren James, Jessica Dee, and Lara Roxx were barred from further production of sexually explicit content. About 60 actors who had had contact with James or Roxx were barred from working until HIV tests were completed and they were declared HIV negative. A further estimated 130 actors who had had contact with James were tested and received an HIV-negative result. A total of five actors were diagnosed with the virus by the end of the moratorium: one male and four females, including one transgender woman&lt;ref name="afyi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lat1" /&gt; named Jennifer.&lt;ref name=AVNMay2004 /&gt;

In June 2009, AIM reported that a female adult entertainer had tested positive, though it was believed that transmission occurred in her private life. LA County Public Health claimed that there had been 16 "unreported" HIV cases in the adult film industry. The AIM Healthcare Foundation claimed those cases did not involve actors in production companies that followed their testing protocols and included members of the general public who used AIM Healthcare testing services or individuals attempting to work in the porn industry who never were able to obtain employment in adult films because of their failure to provide proof negative status for HIV or other STD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-porn-hiv12-2009jun12,0,3569962.story More porn HIV cases disclosed]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, the HIV positive performer was identified as Derrick Burts. Burts had worked in both heterosexual and gay pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/health/la-me-porn-hiv-20101208,0,5306958.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Molly | last=Hennessy-Fiske | date=December 8, 2010 | title=HIV-positive porn performer speaks out}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite contracting [[gonorrhea]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[syphilis]], Burts continued taking part in unprotected sex in films before quitting once he was diagnosed as being HIV positive. He was informed by the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation that he had contracted the disease, which according to Burts, he received on a set outside the AIM system, while having oral sex scene with another "[[HIV positive]] male actor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/derrick-burts-hiv-in-pornography-the-naked-truth-2167532.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Derrick Burts: HIV in pornography: the naked truth | date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the industry was temporarily shut down because of news of a performer was testing positive for the virus. [[Diane Duke]], executive director of the [[Free Speech Coalition]], confirmed the situation.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Production later resumed production when a performer was retested and it came back negative.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In December 2013, a male porn actor tested HIV positive, leading FSC to halt production for one week. This infection was also determined to have taken place off-set.&lt;ref name="PASS Blog"/&gt;

==Testing and clinics==
The revelations led to the creation of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] (AIM Healthcare or AIM) in 1998, which helped set up a monitoring system in the pornographic film industry in the United States, and pornographic film actors were required to be tested for HIV every 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basten|first=Fred |author2=Laurie Holmes |author3=John C. Holmes|title=Porn King: The John Holmes Story|year=1998|publisher=John Holmes Inc|isbn=978-1-880047-69-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIM system required all sexual contact to be logged, with positive test results leading to all sexual contacts for the last three to six months being contacted and re-tested. The use of condoms became standard in films featuring homosexual [[anal sex]].{{why?|date=January 2018}} Due to accurate and mandatory medical tests, HIV and [[AIDS]] cases became rare in the pornographic film industry.{{source needed|date=January 2018}}

However, testing is voluntary (though refusal to be tested can result in the actor not being cast in a sex role) and there is no testing or monitoring of the pornographic film industry in other countries. There have been indications that actors have voluntarily left the industry, at least the industry in the United States, rather than be tested by AIM and have their AIDS and HIV status disclosed.

AIM closed all its operations in May 2011, forcing the industry to look for other mechanisms for supporting and enforcing regular testing.&lt;ref name="romero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/05/porn_clinic_closed_aim_testing.php|title=Porn Clinic AIM Closes For Good: Valley-Based Industry Scrambles to Find New STD Testing System|last=Dennis Romero|date=May 3, 2011|work=[[LA Weekly]]|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap was filled by the [[Free Speech Coalition]], which set up the APHSS system, now known as [[Performer Availability Screening Services]] (PASS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSC Pass |url=http://www.fscpass.com|accessdate= |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

===Regulations to limit the spread of HIV===
Due to this limited outbreak, the California State government considered regulating the industry. Some proposed to mandate the wearing of [[condom]]s during sexually explicit scenes. Industry insiders say this would ruin sales of their wares since the unprotected content is one of the selling points of some of their films. They say the wearing of condoms ruins the sexual fantasies of many viewers. Insiders say that such regulation would force the industry underground, out of California or overseas where it would be more prone to health risks for performers. The non-profit [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] (AIM Healthcare) worked with the government, to develop policies that both the industry and the government would find acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1892037 | pmid=17579507 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040126 | volume=4 | issue=6 | title=The adult film industry: time to regulate? | year=2007 | journal=PLoS Med. | pages=e126 | last1 = Grudzen | first1 = CR | last2 = Kerndt | first2 = PR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 ballot measure in Los Angeles ===
In the 2012 election voters in Los Angeles were presented with [[Measure B]] ("Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act") with the following text:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/11/06/ca/la/meas/B/|title=Measure B: Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act - Los Angeles County, CA|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Shall an ordinance be adopted requiring producers of adult films to obtain a County public health permit, to require adult film performers to use condoms while engaged in sex acts, to provide proof of blood borne pathogen training course, to post permit and notices to performers, and making violations of the ordinance subject to civil fines and criminal charges?}}

Proponents of the measure claimed pornography performers were significantly more likely to acquire HIV than the general population and that they are generally not given health insurance by their employers and so the tax payer would foot the bill for HIV treatment. Opponents claimed it to be a waste of tax dollars because of existing stringent HIV testing protocols and because nobody has contracted HIV on set in the past eight years in the United States.{{When|date=September 2016}}

The measure passed with 57% voting for and 43% voting against.&lt;ref name=DailyMail8November2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Shergold|first=Adam|title=California votes to mandate condoms in porn industry|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2229232/Measure-B-California-votes-mandate-condoms-LA-porn-industry-amid-fears-industry-leave-state.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail (London)|date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Porn industry trade group vows to fight condom requirement|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/porn-industry-trade-group-plans-to-fight-condom-decision.html|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] tried several times to have California's Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health's Appeals Board force companies in the pornography industry to treat actors and actresses as employees subject to [[occupational safety and health]] regulation; in a 2014 case brought against [[Treasure Island Media]] an administrative judge found that the company did have to comply with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitz-Gerald|first1=Sean|title=Condoms Required for CA Porn Performers: Judge|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Judge-Issues-Landmark-Ruling-on-Unprotected-Porn-242117921.html|work=NBC Southern California|date=January 27, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheila Dorothy King''', '''[[Order of Distinction|CD]]''' (born 1932) was a Barbadian-born, Jamaican academic and physician. She was the second woman to be appointed as full professor at the [[University of the West Indies]]. She was the first woman appointed as a professor in the Faculty of Medicine in 1983, ten years after she was appointed as head of UWI's Microbiology Department. A specialist in infectious disease and [[Virus#Epidemiology|viral epidemiology]], she advised numerous national, regional and international departments and governmental agencies on such diseases as [[dengue]], [[influenza]], and [[typhoid]]. In 1998, she was honored as a Commander of the [[Order of Distinction]].

==Early life==
Sheila Dorothy King, known as Dorothy,{{sfn|Francis|2010|p=8}} was born in 1932&lt;!--November 28, 1932--&gt;, in Barbados to Henrietta Adina (née Stuart) and Alfred T. King.{{sfn|Sleeman|2001|p=299}}{{sfn|The Gleaner Company|2001}} She grew up in Barbados and completed her secondary education at [[Queen's College (Barbados)|Queen's College]] in [[Bridgetown]], before enrolling in medical school at the [[University College of the West Indies]] in [[Mona, Jamaica]].{{sfn|The Gleaner Company|2001}} In 1958, King graduated with a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]]{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1958|p=3}}{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1983|p=21}} and on the day of her graduation became engaged to fellow medical student, [[Hugh Hastings Wynter]]. The two were assigned to complete their internship at the University College Hospital in the obstetrics and gynecology department. On 28 December 1959, at the chapel on the UWI campus, King and Wynter married.{{sfn|Francis|2010|p=8}}

==Career==
Over the next four years King worked in various rotations including as Casualty Officer, House Officer in Medicine, House Officer of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Senior House Officer in Paediatrics at the University College Hospital and had two sons, Shaun and David.{{sfn|Francis|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1983|p=21}} In 1961, she was appointed as an assistant Lecturer in the Department of Microbiology at UWI.{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1983|p=21}} That same year, leaving her children in Jamaica with their grandparents,{{sfn|Francis|2010|p=8}} King relocated to England and enrolled in post-graduate studies at the [[University of London]]. She graduated with her [[Postgraduate Diploma]] in [[bacteriology]] in 1964 and went on to earn her [[MRCPath|Membership in the Royal College of Pathology]] at the University of London,{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1983|p=21}} before returning home to resume her post at UWI.{{sfn|Francis|2010|p=8}}

Besides her teaching, King conducted research on viral diseases. In 1968, she was involved in a vaccine study to [[inoculate]] Jamaican school children at risk for the [[rubella virus]] with a weakened strain of live virus.{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1968|p=28}} In 1970, King was granted tenure and three years later she was made Head of the Department of Microbiology. Simultaneously, in 1973, she began working as the supervisor for the Ministry of Health’s Typhoid Carrier Surveillance Programme. The following year she was appointed to the advisory board of the Trinidad Virus Laboratory and became an advisor to the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO)'s Committee on Dengue in the Americas.{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1983|p=21}} In 1977, a [[Dengue fever|dengue]] [[epidemic]] swept through Jamaica, soon spreading throughout the [[Caribbean]] and to the American mainland.{{sfn|Kourí|Más et al.|1983|p=126}} King and Dr. [[Esmie Rose]], who headed the Virology Department directed the investigation to identify the virus and develop a plan to control the virus. Their findings were presented at a conference held in [[Montego Bay]] between 8–11 May 1978.{{sfn|Pan American Health Organization|1979|pp=18, 41}}

King also made studies of the [[rotavirus]] and the role they played in the development of [[gastroenteritis]],{{sfn|''UWI Departmental Reports''|1978|p=208}} typhoid, [[meningitis]], and [[Hepatitis B]] and was a prolific publisher and presenter at international conferences on regional infectious disease.{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1983|p=21}}{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1990|p=3}} From 1981, had additional responsibilities as Director of the Jamaican Influenza Center for the [[WHO]] and on the Advisory Board for the Caribbean Epidemiological Center (CAREC).{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1983|p=21}}{{sfn|Sleeman|2001|p=299}} In 1983, after a decade heading the Department of Microbiology, and earning her [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree from the University of London, King was made a full professor. The appointment was only the second full professorship ever granted to a woman in UWI's history and was the first time a woman had been elevated to the position in the faculty of medicine.{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1983|p=21}}{{sfn|Faruqui|Hassan|Sandri|1991|p=621}}  To recognize her achievement, King was awarded the Medal of Appreciation by the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|Prime Minister]] that same year.{{sfn|Sleeman|2001|p=299}}{{sfn|The Gleaner Company|2001}} In 1998, she was honored by the government of Jamaica as a Commander in the [[Order of Distinction]]{{sfn|''The Gleaner''|1998|p=3}} and that same year conducted research into a virulent strain of the [[influenza virus]] which was prevalent on the island.{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=4}} King retired from UWI in 2001.{{sfn|''UWI Departmental Reports''|2002|p=182}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11147">'''Social quality''' is a way of understanding society which is also relevant for social and public policy. Social quality looks at elements that should constitute a good or decent society. It contributes to the body of work concerned with understanding social progress going beyond [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], taking into account the work of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and the [[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions]]. Whilst most approaches have concentrated on the [[happiness economics|economics]] or [[Subjective well-being|psychology of well-being]], social quality can help understanding the social conditions that enable human flourishing.&lt;ref name="social quality"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |date=2012 |title=Social Quality: A way to measure the quality of society |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=153–167 |doi=10.1007/s11205-011-9871-0 |pmid=22773884 |pmc=3384781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Social quality.png|400px|right|Social quality diagram]]

There are four elements shown in the diagram on the right. ''Economic security'' refers to the material conditions that enable people to have a long term perspective on their lives, and their confidence for the future. This can include social policies, such as pensions and social security, that ensure this. It also includes economic conditions that enable people to feel secure because they have enough income to cover their basic needs.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt; ''Social cohesion'' refers to the bonds that link societies together, deriving from the work of [[Émile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durkheim |first=Émile |date=1952 |title=Suicide. A Study in Sociology |location=London |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durkheim |first=Émile |date=1952 |title=The Division of Labour in Society|location=New York |publisher=Free Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]]'s work considers the moral and social relationships between members of society and social groups, including factors such as trust in others, trust in social institutions, a sense of identity, a collective consciousness, solidarity  and commitment to the common good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dragolov |first=Georgi |last2=Ignácz |first2=Zsófia |last3=Lorenz |first3=Jan |last4=Delhey |first4=Jan| last5=Boehnke |first5=Klaus |date=2013 |title=Social Cohesion Radar. Measuring Common Ground. An international Comparison of Social Cohesion|location=Gutersloh |publisher=Bertelsmann }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social inclusion'' refers to the way in which individuals and social groups are included into society, either through employment, networks and family or through access to social support of various kinds, this can come through support from other people or from social policies. Social policies that foster social inclusion, reduce poverty and tackle other forms of social exclusion can be important in this respect.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt; ''Social empowerment'' refers to the conditions that enable people to participate in their society, such as having good health, education and democratic opportunities for participation, such as voting and joining civil society. However, it can also mean the feelings of being empowered, being able to take control of one's circumstances. It derives from the work of [[Amartya Sen]], who suggests that people need to have the capability to be able to do the things that they wish to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha Craven |editor-last2=Sen |editor-first2=Amartya|title=The Quality of Life |location=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=1993 |chapter=Capability and Well-being }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the social quality approach is fundamentally relational. As such, it emphasises a complex field of conditional (i), constitutional (ii) and normative factors (iii). These are (i) Socio-Economic Security, Social Cohesion, Social Inclusion, Social Empowerment; (ii) Person/human security, Social Recognition, Social Responsiveness, Personal/human Capacity; and (iii) Social Justice (Equity), Solidarity, Equal Valuation, Human Dignity. On the one hand this rejects the Durkheimian view on society as an independent social fact sui generis; on the other hand it qualifies Sen's approach as social quality is not primarily focusing on the subjective side and individuals within society but on the constitution of society by way of people producing and reproducing their daily life and with this society.

==Origins and development==
The idea of social quality began as a [[European Union]] project among a group of social scientists, concerned to develop a better way forward for social policies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Wolfang |last2=van der Maesen |first2=Laurent |last3=Walker |first3=Alan |date=1997 |title=The Social Quality of Europe|location=The Hague |publisher=Kluwer Law International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Wolfang |last2=van der Maesen |first2=Laurent |last3=Walker |first3=Alan |last4=Thomes |first4=Fleur |date=2001 |title=Social Quality: A Vision for Europe|location=The Hague |publisher=Kluwer Law International }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |editor-last=van der Maesen |editor-first=Laurent |editor-last2=Walker |editor-first2=Alan |date=2012 |title=Social Quality. From Theory to Indicators|location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the concept underwent some fundamental development. Empirically it had been developed amongst others by Pamela Abbott, [[Claire Wallace]] and Roger Sapsford, who looked at how the model can be developed empirically in Europe, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], China and [[Rwanda]]. They have used a different variation, considering the impact on well being, measured through [[life satisfaction]] and human flourishing in order to understand how social quality might work in fostering the well being of people in society.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Pamela| last2=Wallace| first2=Claire |editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine |editor-last2=Gareth|editor-first2=Gaveth|title=Happiness across Cultures: Views of Happiness and Quality of Life in Non-Western Cultures  |location=London|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2012 |chapter=Happiness in Post-Conflict Rwanda| pages= 361–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Pamela| last2=Wallace| first2=Claire |editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine |editor-last2=Gareth|editor-first2=Gaveth|title=Happiness across Cultures: Views of Happiness and Quality of Life in Non-Western Cultures  |location=London|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2012 |chapter=Satisfaction and Societal Quality in Kazakhstan| pages= 107–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |date=2014 |title='Rising economic prosperity and social quality. The case of new member states of the European Union |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11205-012-9992-0|journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=419–439 |doi=10.1007/s11205-012-9992-0 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire|last3=Sapsford |first3=Roger |date=2010|title='Surviving the transformation: Social quality in Central Asia and the Caucasus |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10902-010-9187-9|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=199–223  |doi=10.1007/s10902-010-9187-9 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This empirical work had been to a large extent emerging from the work undertaken by colleagues in Asia, in particular by Ka Lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin |first=Ka |last2=Herrmann |first2=Peter |date=2015 |title=Social Quality Theory. A New Perspective on Social Development|location=New York/Oxford |publisher=Berghahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another development is by a marked shift towards questions around 'overall sustainability'. Laurent van der Maesen is the main proponent of this strand contends. In a working paper we read that "international and national (and urban) strategies and policies for development toward 'overall' sustainability not only have to have a strong emphasis on development toward sustainability of cities themselves (internal sustainability) but also – simultaneously – address the development toward sustainability of the cities' surroundings ('Hinterland')".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=International Association of Social Quality  |date=2012 |title=The need for a Comprehensive Conceptual and Methodological Framework for new politics and policies: A social quality perspective; A contribution to the Rio+ 20 Conference on the sustainability of human existence on Earth |journal=IASQ working papers |issue=11 |pages=12 f.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more traditional line is maintained by [[Peter Herrmann (social philosopher)|Peter Herrmann]] who had been since the end of the 1990s advisor of the then European Foundation, later International Association of Social Quality. He claims that 
"[w]e have to reconceptualize ... indicators. They are not measurement instruments sui generis. Rather they are instruments to develop an understanding of complex issues and trends. As such they need to be guided by a sound conceptual reflection of what they are looking for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herrmann |first=Peter |date=2012 |title=Economic Performance, Social Progress and Social Quality |journal=International Journal of Social Quality |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=41–55 |doi=10.3167/IJSQ.2012.020104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Herrmann is on the one hand reclaiming the methodological and theoretical importance of Social Quality thinking, at least qualifying the empirical orientation. On the other hand, though this does not contradict the orientation on sustainability, Herrmann emphasises the need to reorient debates on "the kind of economy in place" instead of maintaining dichotomies, separations and hierarchies between different areas of societal development. This had been elaborated in a book on defining social policy as matter of producing society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herrmann |first=Peter  |date=2014 |title=Social Policy – Production rather than Distribution. A Rights-Based Approach|location=Bremen |publisher=EHV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Vincent's HealthCare''', based in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] is a network of three acute-care hospitals, a long-term skilled nursing facility, 30+ primary care centers, nearly a dozen medical laboratories, transportation and prescription services, and a health outreach ministry. St.Vincent's is also an affiliate of [[Ascension Health]].&lt;ref name=HIST&gt;[https://www.jaxhealth.com/about-us/history/ "Our history"] St. Vincent's HealthCare website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxhealth.com/locations/ "Find a location"] St. Vincent's HealthCare website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
St. Vincent's Hospital was founded in 1916 by the Daughters of Charity and named after the 17th century [[Paris, France|Parisian]] [[St. Vincent de Paul]], who started the Daughters of Charity in 1633.

===Foundation===
The '''St. Vincent's HealthCare Foundation''' is the entity that financially supports the mission of Jacksonville's province of [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]]. The foundation and network, established in 1982, is dedicated to improving the present and future healthcare needs of the Jacksonville area, and has provided more than $1 million in support every year since its creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxhealth.com/foundation/ "Foundation"] St. Vincent's HealthCare website&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation stages fund-raising events throughout the year, including the ''Red Rose Ball'', begun in 1982 and Jacksonville's oldest charity ball. The 2008 event was attended by [[John Travolta]] and [[Kelly Preston]], who helped collect over $1 million in donations.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, Myrlia: [http://www.looktothestars.org/news/549-travolta-and-preston-raise-funds-for-premature-babies "Travolta and Preston Raise Funds for Premature Babies"] Look to the Stars, February 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ash was the celebrity chef at the 10th annual ''Delicious Destinations'' event in 2011. The three-day event attracts over a dozen executive chefs from notable restaurants and resorts around the country to prepare their favorite dishes for donors at the [[Ponte Vedra Inn and Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Trussel, Ilyssa: [http://jacksonville.com/opinion/blog/470157/ilyssa-trussel/2011-07-07/chef-john-ash-confirmed-celebrity-chef-st-vincent-s "Annual Gourmet Food and Wine Tasting Event"] Florida Times-Union, July 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Gary: [http://jacksonville.com/opinion/blog/st-vincents-healthcare-foundation "St. Vincent's Healthcare Foundation"] Florida Times-Union, September 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Vincent's HealthCare Foundation is also a charity recipient of proceeds from [[The Players Championship]], and conducts a two-day charity golf tournament early in the week known as ''The Tradition''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxhealth.com/foundation/the-tradition/ "THE TRADITION 2012"] St. Vincent's HealthCare website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baptist merger===
During the 1990s, for-profit [[health maintenance organization]]s such as [[Hospital Corporation of America|Columbia/HCA]] captured a large share from non-profit hospitals. With William C. "Bill" Mason as CEO, St. Vincent's merged with rival [[Baptist Health]] in 1995 to become the dominant healthcare provider in northeast Florida and control rising costs. In 1998, John J Maher became CEO and ''Baptist/St. Vincents Health System'' had a 40% market share and had cut operating costs by $100 million in three years.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant-Friedland, Bruce: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/040298/met_2a1Mason.html "Hospital changes leadership"] Florida Times-Union, April 2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; However, the arrangement didn't last and a demerger occurred, with both groups going separate ways in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Mark: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/071401/bus_6681433.html "Companies need to be masters of their domain"] Florida Times-Union, July 14, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
St. Vincent's HealthCare includes 1,081 beds and 4,700 employees. The network's facilities and programs provide a full spectrum of care.

===The original===
St. Vincent's Hospital was begun in 1916 when the Daughters of Charity turned the DeSoto Sanitorium into the third hospital in Jacksonville. The institution grew from 42 beds into the [[St. Vincent's Medical Center Riverside]], with 528 beds. As the largest facility in the group, they offer the most diverse health care services in the system.&lt;ref name=HIST /&gt;

===Expansion===
[[St. Vincent's Medical Center Southside]], a 313-bed [[acute care]] hospital, was purchased by St. Vincent's HealthCare in 2008 from [[Mayo Clinic Hospital]]. The present facility was opened in 1984, but St. Luke's Hospital was begun in 1873 and is the oldest private hospital in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton, Michael: [http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2012/01/05/st-lukes-hospital-changes-name.html "St. Luke's Hospital changes name"] Jacksonville Business Journal, January 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elder care===
'''St. Catherine Labouré Manor''' is a [[chronic care]] facility on the campus of St. Vincent's Medical Center. The complex contains 240 beds, including a special unit for patients suffering [[dementia]] from [[Alzheimer's disease]].

Unlike the typical [[nursing home]], the staff tries to maintain a "home-like" atmosphere for the patients, who are called "residents". Many services are available in-house for the resident's convenience.

The ''Semmes Garden'' on the [[St. Johns River]], provides walkways through the landscaped grounds leading to fountains, gazebos, and a rose garden.

===Primary care===
'''St. Vincent's Primary Care''' is a network of more than 30 facilities and 80 physicians throughout the [[Jacksonville metropolitan area]], including [[Clay County, Florida|Clay]], [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau]] and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns]] counties. Each is connected to the St. Vincent's Medical Centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxhealth.com/locations/svhc-primary-care/#St-Johns "St. Vincent's Primary Care"] St. Vincent's Healthcare website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory testing===
There are eleven locations of '''Consolidated Laboratory Services''' (Consolidated Labs) in the Jacksonville area, including St. Vincent's Medical Center Riverside and St. Vincent's Medical Center Southside.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Testicular pain''', also known as '''scrotal pain''',  occurs when part or all of either one or both [[testicles]] hurt. Pain in the [[scrotum]] is also often included. Testicular pain may be either short or long duration. 

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Causes range from non serious muscular skeletal problems to [[Emergency medicine|emergency condition]]s such as [[Fournier's gangrene]] and [[testicular torsion]]. The diagnostic approach involves making sure no serious conditions are present. Testing may include [[ultrasound]] and blood tests.

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Pain management is typically given with definitive management depending on the underlying cause.

==Definition==
Testicular pain is when part or all of either one or both [[testicles]] hurt, the pain varies from male to male although it lasts around five minutes to an hour. Pain of the [[scrotum]] is often included. It may be either acute, subacute or chronic depending on its duration.

===Chronic scrotal pain===
[[Chronic scrotal pain]] (pain for greater than 3 months) may occur due to a number of underlying conditions.&lt;ref name=PC2010/&gt; It occurs in 15-19% of men post [[vasectomy]], due to infections such as [[epididymitis]], [[prostatitis]], and [[orchitis]], as well as [[varicocele]], [[hydrocele]], [[spermatocele]], [[polyarteritis nodosa]], [[testicular torsion]], previous surgery and trauma.&lt;ref name=PC2010/&gt;  In 25% of cases the cause is never determined.&lt;ref name=PC2010/&gt; The pain can persist for a long and indefinite period of time following the [[vasectomy]], in which case it is termed [[post-vasectomy pain syndrome]] (PVPS).

==Differential diagnosis==
{{See also|List of the causes of genital pain}}
The differential diagnosis of testicular pain is broad and involves conditions from benign to life-threatening. The most common causes of pain in children presenting to the emergency room are [[testicular torsion]] (16%), torsion of a testicular appendage (46%), and [[epididymitis]] (35%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis AG, Bukowski TP, Jarvis PD, Wacksman J, Sheldon CA |title=Evaluation of acute scrotum in the emergency department |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=277–81; discussion 281–2 |date=February 1995 |pmid=7738751 |doi=10.1016/0022-3468(95)90574-X |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In adults, the most common cause is epididymitis.

===Testicular torsion===
[[Testicular torsion]] usually presents with an acute onset of diffuse testicular pain and tenderness  of less than 6 hrs of duration.  There is often an absent or decreased [[cremasteric reflex]], the testicle is elevated, and often is horizontal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karmazyn B, Steinberg R, Kornreich L |title=Clinical and sonographic criteria of acute scrotum in children: a retrospective study of 172 boys |journal=Pediatr Radiol |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=302–10 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15503003 |doi=10.1007/s00247-004-1347-9 |url= |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It occurs annually in about 1 in 4000 males before 25 years of age,&lt;ref name=PC2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wampler SM, Llanes M |title=Common scrotal and testicular problems |journal=Prim. Care |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=613–26, x |date=September 2010 |pmid=20705202 |doi=10.1016/j.pop.2010.04.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is most frequent among adolescents ( 65% of cases presenting between 12 – 18 years of age ),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Edelsberg JS, Surh YS |title=The acute scrotum |journal=Emerg. Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=521–46 |date=August 1988 |pmid=3292226 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is rare after 35 years of age.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt;  Because it can lead to [[necrosis]] within a few hours, it is considered a surgical emergency.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt;  Another version of this condition is a chronic illness called intermittent testicular torsion (ITT) which is characterized by recurrent rapid acute onset of pain in one testis which will temporarily assume a horizontal or elevated position in the scrotum similar to that of a full torsion followed by eventual spontaneous detortion and rapid solution of pain.  Nausea or vomiting may also occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Epididymitis and orchitis===
[[Epididymitis]] occurs when there is [[inflammation]] of the [[epididymis]] (a curved structure at the back of the [[testicle]]).&lt;ref name=AMP09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trojian TH, Lishnak TS, Heiman D |title=Epididymitis and orchitis: an overview |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=583–7 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19378875 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This condition usually presents with gradual onset of varying degrees of pain, and the [[scrotum]] may be red, warm and swollen.  It is often accompanied by symptoms of a [[urinary tract infection]], fever, and in over half of cases it presents in combination with [[orchitis]].&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt;  In those between the ages of 14 to 35 it is usually caused by either [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]].  In people either older or younger ''[[E. coli]]'' is the most common bacterial infection.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt;  Treatment involves the use of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt;

===Fournier's  gangrene===
[[Fournier's gangrene]] ( an aggressive and rapidly spreading infection of the [[perineum]] ) usually presents with fever and intense pain.  It is a rare condition but fatal if not identified and aggressively treated with a combination of [[debridement|surgical debridement]] and broad spectrum antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burch DM, Barreiro TJ, Vanek VW |title=Fournier's gangrene: be alert for this medical emergency |journal=JAAPA |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=44–7 |date=November 2007 |pmid=18035764 |doi=10.1097/01720610-200711000-00020 |url=http://media.haymarketmedia.com/Documents/2/fournier1107_1568.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007042739/http://media.haymarketmedia.com/Documents/2/fournier1107_1568.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

[[File:Segmental testicular infarction 112914968.jpg|thumb|Segmental testis infarction in a patient presenting with right testis pain.]]

Many other less common conditions can lead to testicular pain.  These include [[inguinal hernia]]s, injury, [[hydrocele]]s, and [[varicocele]]s among others.  [[Testicular cancer]] is usually painless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003160.htm |title=Testicle pain: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |work=National Institute of Health|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential cause is [[blue balls|epididymal hypertension]] (also known as "blue balls").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chalett JM, Nerenberg LT |title="Blue balls": A diagnostic consideration in testiculoscrotal pain in young adults: A case report and discussion |journal=Pediatrics |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=843 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11015532 |doi= 10.1542/peds.106.4.843|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostic approach==

===Physical findings===
The [[cremaster reflex]] (elevation of the testicle in response to stroking the upper inner thigh) is typically present in epididymitis but absent in testicular torsion as the testis is already elevated.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt;  [[Prehn's sign]] ( the relief of pain with elevation ) though a classic physical exam finding has not been found to be reliable in distinguishing torsion from other causes of testicular pain such as [[epididymitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lavallee ME, Cash J |title=Testicular torsion: evaluation and management |journal=Curr Sports Med Rep |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=102–4 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15763047 |doi= 10.1097/01.CSMR.0000306081.13064.a2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory tests===
Useful tests that may help in the determination of the cause include a [[urinalysis]] (usually normal in testicular torsion). [[Pyuria]] and [[bacteriuria]] (white blood cells and bacteria in the urine) in patients with acute scrotum suggests an infectious cause such as epididymitis or orchitis and specific testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be done.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt; All people with chronic pain should be tested for [[gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]].&lt;ref name=PC2010/&gt;

===Imaging===
[[medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] is useful if the cause is not certain based on the above measures.&lt;ref name=Galejs&gt;{{cite journal |author=Galejs LE |title=Diagnosis and treatment of the acute scrotum |journal=American Family Physician |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=817–24 |date=February 1999 |pmid=10068706 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990215ap/817.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the diagnosis of torsion is certain, imaging should not delay definitive management such as physical maneuvers and surgery.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt;

'''Veterinary public health''' (VPH) is a component of [[public health]] that focuses on the application of [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary science]] to protect and improve the physical, mental and social well-being of humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_907.pdf "Future Trends in Veterinary Public Health"], World Health Organ Tech Rep Ser. 2002;907:i-vii, 1-85, back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; In several countries activities related to VPH are organized by the [[Chief Veterinary Officer|chief veterinary officer]].

Conventionally veterinary public health as a topic covers the following areas:

==Food production and safety==

It is desirable to consider food production as a chain, with animals reared on the [[farm]] (pre-harvest) then going for primary processing (harvest), secondary processing and distribution followed by final preparation (all post-harvest). This "farm to fork" concept can be easily described by considering a [[beef]] animal on a farm going to slaughter at the [[abattoir]], then the [[hamburger]] production plant, then being distributed to a [[supermarket]]. The hamburger is then sold, taken home, stored, cooked and eaten.

Veterinary public health concerns all aspects of food production chain from controlling [[epidemic]] diseases that may impact on agriculture, to ensuring [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] is conducted safely and humanely, to informing the public on safe ways to store and cook hamburgers.

==Zoonosis control==
A [[zoonosis]] may be defined as any [[disease]] and/or [[infection]] which is naturally transmissible between animals and man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/zoonoses/en/ WHO-Zoonoses]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are a major public concern. Headlines on issues like [[avian influenza]], [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] (mad cow disease) and [[salmonella]] of eggs have dominated the UK newspaper headlines for the last thirty years.

The picture in developed and developing countries may be quite different as far as zoonoses are concerned. In developed countries the [[consumer]] has very little contact with the live animal, limiting transmission from live animals to the general public. In addition [[food safety]] is extremely regulated. Despite this [[Foodborne illness|food borne disease]] is still a big problem in developed countries. In the [[European Union|EU]] in 2006, a total of 175,561 confirmed cases of [[campylobacteriosis]] were reported from 21 member states and reported cases will only represent the tip of the iceberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efsa.eu.int/EFSA/DocumentSet/Zoon_report_2006_summary_en.pdf?ssbinary=true "Main conclusions on the Community Summary Report on Zoonoses 2006"], The EFSA Journal (2007) 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Veterinary public health concerns the surveillance and control of zoonoses at many different levels be it via disease control programmes at farm level or [[wild animal]]s or in the abattoir.

==Environmental contamination==
[[Environmental pollution|Environmental pollutants]] that arise through the keeping and use of animals may include [[pollution]] of the air, land or water. It can arise through [[animal waste]] products as well as [[chemical]]s that may be used during production (e.g. [[insecticide]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, etc.).

In addition, practising vets will also produce potential environmental [[contaminant]]s in the form of used needles, syringes, animal tissue and other [[clinical waste]].

All of these materials have to be dealt with in a safe and controlled way. See the section [http://w01.rvcwiki.wf.ulcc.ac.uk/index.php?title=Introduction_to_VPH Environmental Contamination] on [http://www.wikivet.net WikiVet].

==Role of animals in society==
This aspect of veterinary public health deals with a number of [[Ethics|ethical]] issues. [[Animal welfare|Welfare of animals]] is an ever present issue regardless of the setting, whether it concerns pet animals, production animals or wild animals.

Where the line that defines acceptable and unacceptable welfare conditions lies is different for different individuals from different countries and [[culture]]s, however, it is common for minimum welfare standards to be defined in [[legislation]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://w01.rvcwiki.wf.ulcc.ac.uk/index.php?title=Introduction_to_VPH Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other issues may concern the use of animals in [[science]], not just for [[Animal experimentation|experimentation]], but the use of [[transgenic]] animals (an animals who has had its [[genome]] deliberately altered by [[genetic engineering]] techniques as opposed to [[selective breeding]]) and [[xenotransplantation]] (the transplantation of organs or tissues from one species to another) or the emergence of [[Drug resistance|resistance]] to [[antimicrobial]] drugs due to their use in animals &lt;ref&gt;[http://w01.rvcwiki.wf.ulcc.ac.uk/index.php?title=Introduction_to_VPH Antimicrobial Resistance]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67344">[[Greater Mexico City]] (''Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México''), a [[metropolitan area]] with more than 19 million inhabitants including [[Mexico city|Mexico's capital]] (''Distrito Federal'', or DF) with about 9 million inhabitants, faces tremendous water challenges. These include [[groundwater]] [[overexploitation]], [[Groundwater-related subsidence|land subsidence]], the risk of major [[flooding]], the impacts of increasing [[urbanization]], poor water quality, inefficient water use, a low share of [[wastewater treatment]], health concerns about the reuse of wastewater in agriculture, and limited cost recovery. Overcoming these challenges is complicated by fragmented responsibilities for '''water management in Greater Mexico City''':
* The Federal government is in charge of regulating the use of water resources, contributing to the financing of investments and supplying bulk water from other basins through the National Water Commission [[:es:Comisión Nacional del Agua (México)|Conagua]];
* The [[Mexico State|State of Mexico]] provides bulk water, treats wastewater and assists municipalities in providing water and sanitation services in its part of Greater Mexico City;
* 59 municipal governments in the part of Greater Mexico City located in the State of Mexico and one municipality in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo State]] are in charge of water distribution and sanitation for their constituents;
* the government of Federal District provides water supply and sanitation services to its constituents through its water department; and
* two irrigation districts in Hidalgo state are in charge of irrigation with wastewater from Greater Mexico City.

Given the size and political importance of Greater Mexico City, a major flood or a major water supply interruption would be a national political crisis potentially threatening the stability of the federal government. The security of water supply and the functioning of the storm water drainage of the metropolitan area thus are major concerns for the local, state, district and federal governments. In response to the challenges outlined above, the Federal Government, the State of Mexico and the Federal District initiated a US$2.8 billion Water Sustainability Program in 2007.

In parallel, the government of the Federal District launched a Green Plan which includes water conservation as an important element. Investments envisaged under both plans include an increase in wastewater treatment, the import of groundwater from irrigated areas North of the city where the groundwater table increased due to irrigation with wastewater, the construction of a major new storm water drainage tunnel, increased water imports from an expansion of the energy-intensive Cutzamala system that pumps water up over more than 1000 meters, and the reduction of [[non-revenue water]] from 36% to 25%.

[[File:Zona Metropolitana de México.svg|thumb|350px|[[Greater Mexico City]] (gray), [[Mexico State]] (green) and [[Mexico City]] (Distrito Federal). The [[Valley of Mexico]] encompasses the ''Distrito Federal'' (DF) and the part of Mexico State north of DF.]]

== Geography and climate ==
[[File:PopoAv0005.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Popocatépetl]], the largest peak in the mountains surrounding Mexico city.]]

The climate of the [[Valley of Mexico]] ranges from a [[semi-arid]] belt in the north to a tropical one in the south. The valley receives about {{convert|700|mm|in|sp=us}} of annual rainfall, which is concentrated from June through to September/October with little or no precipitation during the remainder of the year. There are hardly any permanent rivers today. Groundwater is the main water resource in the valley.&lt;ref name="NRC4"/&gt;

The valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. It was artificially opened through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century, entirely draining what used to be [[Lake Texcoco]]. The rural southern portion of the Federal District and of the Valley of Mexico, in particular the [[Sierra Chichinautzin]] is the most important natural recharge zone for the Mexico City Aquifer due to relatively high levels of precipitation and the high permeability of its basalt rock.&lt;ref name="NRC4"&gt;[http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/Mexico/water/book.html Mexico City's Water Supply:Improving the Outlook for Sustainability], National Research Council, Academia Nacional de la Investigación Científica, A.C., Academia Nacional de Ingeniería, A.C., NATIONAL ACADEMY PRESS, Washington, D.C. 1995, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sector responsibilities ==

'''Water resources management'''. The National Water Commission ([[:es:Comisión Nacional del Agua (México)|Conagua]]) is responsible for water resources management in Mexico, including granting of water abstraction and wastewater discharge permits. 
{{See also|Water supply and sanitation in Mexico}}
'''Water supply and sanitation'''. The National Water Commission also supplies bulk water to the Federal District and to parts of Mexico state through the Cutzamala and Lerma systems. 
[[File:Cutzamala_system.png|thumb|The Cutzamala System is one of the biggest drinking water supply systems in the world, because of the quantity of water that it supplies (approximately 450 million cubic meters every year), and because of the difference in elevation (1 100 m) that it has to overcome.

The figure shows the location of the system and the difference in elevation that has to be overcome from the lowest point to the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico (MAVM).]]
In Mexico State, the State Water Commission buys bulk water from Conagua, transmits it through its own bulk water infrastructure and sells it on to 57 municipalities with 4.1 million inhabitants. The State Water Commission also monitors water quality, provides technical assistance to municipalities in water disinfection and sewer cleaning, operates wastewater pumping stations and five wastewater treatment plants, empties septic tanks and provides water in tankers in emergency situations. It also provides training and assists municipalities in the establishment of municipal utilities (''organismos operadores'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edomex.gob.mx/portal/page/portal/caem/infraestructurahidraulica/infraaguapotable|title=Bienvenido a Portal Ciudadano - Portal Ciudadano|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 59 municipalities of Mexico State and one municipality of the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] that are part of Greater Mexico City, each municipality is in charge of water supply and sanitation.

The municipal water utility of Mexico City, ''Sistema de Aguas de la Ciudad de México'' (SACM), is responsible for water supply and sanitation in the Federal District. Its head is appointed by the government of the District.

== Infrastructure ==
[[File:Mexico.DF.Chapultepec.02.jpg|thumb|300px|A view of Mexico City with Paseo de la Reforma and Torre Mayor.]]
The water infrastructure in Greater Mexico City consists of infrastructure for bulk water supply and water distribution (water supply), wastewater collection, storm water collection and wastewater treatment (sanitation), and for irrigation using mainly wastewater.

=== Water supply ===

The Federal District and State of Mexico combined had 1,089 registered wells at depths of 70 to 200&amp;nbsp;meters in 1994. This does not include wells operated by the National Water Commission, which are deeper. There are also a large number of non-registered wells, many of which are located in the State of Mexico. Wells are generally located in four different well fields. These are labeled as South (or [[Xochimilco]]), Metropolitan, East (or [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]] region) and North well fields.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

Besides these well fields, the bulk water supply infrastructure of Greater Mexico city consists of two systems: Lerma and Cutzamala. The Lerma system, built in the 1940s, transfers 4.8&amp;nbsp;[[Cubic metre per second|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s]] of water (6% of total water supply to Greater Mexico City) from well fields in the upper basin of the Lerma River in the West to Mexico City. The Cutzamala System built in stages from the late 1970s to the late 1990s to transfer 14.9&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s (19% of total supply) of water from the [[Río Cutzamala|Cutzamala]] River in the [[Balsas River|Balsas basin]] in the Southwest to [[Greater Mexico City]] for use as drinking water, lifting it over more than 1000 meters.&lt;ref name="ambio.allenpress.com"&gt;[http://ambio.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1639%2F0044-7447(2003)032%5B0124%3AWMFAMM%5D2.0.CO%3B2&amp;ct=1 Cecilia Tortajada and Enrique Castelán:Water Management for a Megacity: Mexico City Metropolitan Area], Ambio, Volume 32, Issue 2 (March 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

It utilizes 7 reservoirs, a 127-[[km]] long aqueduct with 21&amp;nbsp;km of tunnels, 7.5&amp;nbsp;km open canal, and a water treatment plant. Its cost was US$1.3 billion.&lt;ref name="ambio.allenpress.com"/&gt; While providing Mexico City with over 20% of its water, the Cutzamala system currently operates at only 47% of its total capacity.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;BBC:[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2009/04/090409_0159_falta_agua_mexico_jrg.shtml Millones sin agua en la Ciudad de México], 13 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Both systems are operated by the National Water Commission.

The water distribution system in the Federal District included nearly 11,000&amp;nbsp;km of distribution lines and 243 storage tanks with a capacity of 1.5 million cubic meters in 1994. Water from all the separate sources is added to the common distribution system. The Federal District also operates a water transmission line (the ''Acueducto Periférico'') that transports water from the Cutzamala System - entering the distribution system from the west - to the southern and eastern part of the district. The State of Mexico system has nearly 800&amp;nbsp;km of distribution lines and 32 storage tanks with a capacity of 440,000 cubic meters. As of 2000, there were 2.5 million water connections with 67% of these being domestic and this only accounts for legal connections. It is estimated that there could be another 900,000 illegal connections.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite journal

The State of Mexico operates the 49-km water transmission line (the ''Macrocircuito'') to transport water entering from the west side of the service area (including the imported water from the Cutzamala-Lerma System) to the east side. This transmission line is being upgraded to increase the volume of water taken from the Cutzamala-Lerma system to 7.3&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and to provide service to the eastern service area.  The ''Macrocircuito'' is operated by the State Water Commission.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

It is expected that the dependency of Mexico City on external sources of water will increase. Additionally, the absence of economic compensation mechanisms for those communities from which water is extracted has created conflicts among users and sometimes limits water transferred to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agua.org.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12116:exploring-the-risks-of-ineffective-water-supply-and-sewage-disposal-a-case-study-of-mexico-city&amp;catid=1220:cuenca-del-valle-de-mexico&amp;Itemid=110|title=Exploring the risks of ineffective water supply and sewage disposal: A case study of Mexico City|author=Jaime SA|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is Mexico City's high use of bottled water. Those that do not have access to water from pipes, pay private vendors from 6 to 25% of their daily salaries. General distrust of tap water quality has led to much of the population purchasing drinking water; Mexico was ranked the third largest consumer of bottled water in 2009.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

=== Combined sewer system ===

Greater Mexico City is served by a singled [[combined sewer]] system, collecting municipal wastewater, industrial wastewater and storm water. It includes {{convert|7400|mi|-2|sp=us|adj=on}} of pipes,&lt;ref name="ellingwood" /&gt; 68 pumping stations, numerous dams, lagoons, and regulatory tanks for flow control, 111&amp;nbsp;km of open canals, 42&amp;nbsp;km of rivers (rio) used primarily for drainage, and 118&amp;nbsp;km of underground collectors (interceptor and emisor) and tunnels.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt; The three interceptors are:

* The Western Interceptor (''Interceptor del Poniente''), draining into the Nochistongo Channel, which ultimately joins the Emisor Central;
* The Central Interceptor (''Interceptor Central''), draining into the ''Emisor Central'' (''Drenaje Profundo'') and then into the Salto River in Hidalgo state near the Requena dam, from where it flows to the [[Mezquital Valley]]; and
* The Eastern Interceptor (''Interceptor del Oriente''), draining into the Grand Canal, then into the old and new tunnels of [[Tequixquiac]] and ultimately to the Salado River.&lt;ref name="Marrakech"&gt;[http://www.cities-localgovernments.org/uclg/upload/newTempDoc/Presentation_GobiernoEstadoMexicol_Marrakech.ppt&amp;ei=GuaWSc_2MuPetgeSy5ibCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGbYUNtKF6QC3_YZPa66aqmmDkBw La Administración del Agua en las Zonas Metropolitanas del Estado de México] Gobierno del Estado de México, Secretaría del Agua y Obra Pública, Marrakech, October 29, 2006, Slide 16-17
&lt;/ref&gt;

The total dry weather flow for Greater Mexico City, which consists mainly of untreated municipal wastewater, was estimated at 44&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in 1993. During the rainy season, the region experiences many storms of high intensity and short duration. A single storm can produce up to 70 millimeters (about 3&amp;nbsp;inches) of rainfall, representing 10 percent of the total annual precipitation. Because of this rainfall pattern, the general drainage system was designed to carry 200&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s over a 45-hour period
&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

Until 1910 the Grand Canal functioned purely by gravity, with an inclination of 19&amp;nbsp;cm per km. Over the next five decades its inclination declined to 10&amp;nbsp;cm per km due to [[land subsidence]] of 7 meters. Several large pumps were installed in an attempt to maintain its capacity.&lt;ref name="Marrakech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Montoya"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=25 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After heavy floods in 1950 and 1951 it became clear that the Grand Canal could not protect the city any more from flooding and a deep drainage system (''Drenaje profundo'') was proposed for the first time. Studies on the system began in 1959; its construction began in 1967 and it was completed in 1975. It consists of a deep tunnel, the ''Emisor Central'' with a length of 68&amp;nbsp;km and a depth of up to 250&amp;nbsp;m. It today constitutes by far the most important element of the Mexico City drainage system. It was designed for a flow of 170&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s.

Due to further land settlement the inclination in the Grand Canal became zero by 1990 and negative by 2000. Despite the installation of further pumps, the capacity of the Grand Canal thus declined from 80&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in 1975 to 15&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in 2008. This in turn affected the ''Emisor Central'', which had been designed to be closed during the dry season for maintenance. Because of the settlement of the grand canal the ''Emisor Central'' was continuously filled with water, making it impossible to inspect it for problems or to maintain it, making maintenance impossible between 1995 and 2008. The tunnel has been damaged by overwork and corrosion of its {{convert|20|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} diameter walls &lt;ref name="ellingwood"&gt;{{cite news

Overall, the combined discharge capacity of the system has declined from 280&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in 1975 to 165&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in 2008. The Nochistongo Channel is the only element of the system whose capacity remains undiminished at 30&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s.

=== Wastewater treatment ===

Only about 15% of the wastewater collected in [[Greater Mexico City]] was treated in 2008, mostly in wastewater treatment plants in Mexico state.&lt;ref name="Marrakech" /&gt;  Currently, the metropolitan area generates 40&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s of wastewater; however capacity is only built to handle 10&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; The treated wastewater is for local reuse projects such as ground water recharge and agricultural and urban-landscape irrigation. There were 13 wastewater treatment plants in the Federal District and 14 in the State of Mexico service area in 1994, treating a total flow of 2.62 and 1.69&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s respectively.&lt;ref name="NRC4"/&gt; The untreated portion of the wastewater is discharged to the drainage system, from where it is discharged to the North where it is being reused in irrigated agriculture.

=== Reuse in irrigated agriculture ===
{{See also|Irrigation in Mexico}}

[[File:Lucerne flowers.jpg|thumb|300px|The fodder crop [[Alfalfa]] is the main crop irrigated with wastewater from Mexico City.]]
Large-scale irrigation infrastructure was built in the state of Hidalgo to distribute storm water and wastewater from Mexico City for the irrigation of [[Alfalfa]] as the main crop, as well as barley, wheat and corn. Thanks to the nutrients in the sewage, alfalfa yields are more than 100 tons per hectare, compared to the national average of 68-74 tons. Alfalfa is planted year-round, providing 9-10 harvests per planting, and is sold to livestock operations in other states.&lt;ref&gt;

They used to be operated by Conagua, but were transferred to water user associations during the 1990s.

The cultivated area is 83,000 [[hectare]], about half the size of the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Wastewater has been used there since 1912. The wastewater, whether raw, partially treated or mixed with rainfall, is highly valued by the farmers because of its ability to improve soil quality and because of its nutrient load that allows increased productivity. However, the wastewater is contaminated with pathogenic organisms and toxic chemicals that constitute a health risk for both farmers and consumers of agricultural products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://193.43.36.27/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0xNTAzOS4xMDk2NDMmNj1lbiYzMz1kb2N1bWVudHMmMzc9aW5mbw~~ Romero-Alvarez, H.:The Mezquital Valley, Mexico], in:UNESCO, WHO, UNEP: Helmer, P.; Hespanhol, I. (Editors):Water Pollution Control: A Guide to the Use of Water Quality Management Principles, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reuse for other purposes ===

Water reuse activities in Greater Mexico City officially began in 1984 under the National Program for Efficient Use of Water. This national program included the establishment of new wastewater discharge regulations by the Federal District, and in 1990, provisions were established for an industrial pretreatment program - an important prerequisite for any reclamation and reuse activity. Little information is available on the extent and success of industrial pretreatment programs.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

Within the Federal District service area, in 1995 the 2.62&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s of treated reused wastewater is distributed as follows:

* 83 percent for urban landscape irrigation and recreational impoundments,
* 10 percent for industrial uses,
* 5 percent for agricultural irrigation, and
* 2 percent for commercial uses such as car washing.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

'''Recreational impoundments.''' A major wastewater reclamation and reuse scheme exists at [[Lake Texcoco]] in conjunction with programs for flood control and dust abatement. Between flooding, the shallow, saline lake bed would dry and produce severe dust storms. In response to this problem, the Texcoco Plan was established in 1971. The solution was to create smaller, more permanent ponds within the large, intermittent lake bed, and to rehabilitate the problem areas for further urban and agricultural expansion through windbreaks, revegetation, agricultural irrigation, and drainage improvements.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

The artificial and more permanent lakes were created using lessons learned from the subsidence problem. High rates of pumping consolidated the clays and lowered the old lake bed by about 4 meters in places. The reuse component of the Texcoco plans include the construction of a [[Stabilization pond|facultative lagoon wastewater treatment system]], and reclamation of the collected storm water for agricultural irrigation. Thus, the potable water currently used for this purpose will be replaced.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

'''Industrial reuse.''' Industries recycle and reuse wastewater generated by themselves or by municipalities. For example, 26 private companies in the [[Metro Vallejo|Vallejo]] area initiated a reuse program in 1989 by establishing a for-profit firm, Aguas Industriales de Vallejo. The firm rehabilitated an old municipal wastewater treatment plant and distributes reclaimed water to its shareholder companies at three-quarters of the cost of government supplied potable water.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

'''Pilot project for potable reuse.''' The Federal District constructed two pilot treatment plants in 1983 to study the potential for the advanced wastewater treatment of secondary effluent for potable reuse, and to examine the potential for treating contaminated ground water. Based upon results of the experimental treatment plants, a new treatment facility was constructed, with a capacity of 0.3&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s, and designed for both ground water treatment and direct potable reuse. The established goal of the reuse project was to blend the reclaimed wastewater with treated ground water and add it directly into the distribution system Currently, the reclaimed wastewater is being used for non-potable purposes.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

=== Artificial ground water recharge ===

Artificial ground water recharge is being practiced in Greater Mexico City using both flood water and treated wastewater.

'''Floodwater.''' Artificial floodwater recharge has been practiced in the region since 1943, as a method to alleviate flooding rather than as a method to recharge groundwater. Early projects involved runoff retention and surface spreading, channel modification, and infiltration wells. Many of these projects were done in the highly permeable basalt of the upland areas and achieved very high rates of infiltration during periods of heavy rains.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

Artificial recharge of floodwater using injection wells was first developed in the Federal District around 1953. Half of the wells were subsequently closed due to operational problems. In 1970, a series of approximately 56 wells was developed for the purposes of disposing of stormwater. These wells were capable of handling up to 35&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s of water collectively. Although the wells were not designed for recharge purposes, the storm water possibly reached the aquifer.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

'''Treated wastewater.''' The Texcoco Project mentioned above has carried out studies on indirect potable reuse of reclaimed wastewater through artificial recharge of the aquifer using secondary and advanced treatment of municipal wastewater. The final effluent may be used in either infiltration ponds or injection wells. In a separate program carried out by the Federal District, a pilot plant injected advanced treated water directly into the aquifer at a rate of up to 0.05&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s. Monitoring wells were used to gauge changes in water quality and pressure levels.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt;

== Water challenges ==

These include groundwater [[overexploitation]], [[Groundwater-related subsidence|land subsidence]], the risk of major [[flooding]], the impacts of increasing urbanization, poor water quality and intermittent supply, inefficient water use, a low share of [[wastewater treatment]], health concerns about the reuse of wastewater for irrigation, and limited cost recovery for water. Infrastructure coverage in terms of access to a piped water connection or to sanitation, which is used to monitor the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s for water supply and sanitation, is almost universal in Greater Mexico City and as such does not constitute a challenge.

=== Groundwater overexploitation ===
The [[Greater Mexico City]]'s exponential population growth has depleted its groundwater resources. Currently, 4 of the 14 aquifers in the Valley of Mexico basin are overexploited. The per capita rechargeable water available for the Valley of México in 2010 is calculated at 163&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas in 2030, it is predicted that rechargeable water per capita will be 148&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; Recharge of the [[aquifer]] is about 31.6&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s compared to abstraction of 59.5&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s, resulting in an overdraft of about 28&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s.&lt;ref&gt;CNA, quoted in Herrera 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 systematic monitoring of the water levels in the aquifer began. Since that time, the average annual declines in ground water levels range from 0.1 to 1.5 meters per year in different zones. At the current rate of depletion, it has been calculated that the estimated volume of storage corresponds to between 200 and 350 times the annual abstraction. However, a simplistic water balance approach does not account for other realities. For example, the aquifer is vulnerable to geologically-induced water quality problems with increasing aquifer depth and consolidation and fracturing of clay layers. Furthermore, the actual volume available in the main aquifer would likely be less than estimated because of probable decreasing porosity with increasing depth. Also, there are practical, economic limits to the depth of pumping.&lt;ref name="NRC3"&gt;[http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/Mexico/water/book.html Mexico City's Water Supply:Improving the Outlook for Sustainability], National Research Council, Academia Nacional de la Investigación Científica, A.C., Academia Nacional de Ingeniería, A.C., NATIONAL ACADEMY PRESS, Washington, D.C. 1995, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Land subsidence has been caused by groundwater overexploitation during the last hundred years, and has been up to 9 meters, resulting in damages to buildings, streets, sidewalks, sewers, storm water drains and other infrastructure. The collapse in the central region of the city reached 10m at the end of the 20th century, while in the sub-basin Chalco-Xochimilco, it reached 7m.&lt;ref name="ECLAC"/&gt; Current subsidence rates lie between five and 40&amp;nbsp;cm/year.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

Most of the floods in the Valley can be explained due to the difference in altitude and the inability of the sewerage system to pump the water out during the rainy season.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Great Canal has lost its [[Drainage gradient|gradient]] due to land subsidence in some parts of the city, losing its discharge capacity from 90 m³/second to 12 m³/second in the last 30 years, and the secondary sewerage network is insufficient to carry high volumes of [[stormwater]] and [[wastewater]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This situation has resulted in chronic flooding, on occasions, even of [[wastewater]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Poor neighborhoods located in hillsides are particularly affected&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban Risk Assessments: An approach for understanding disaster &amp; climate risk in cities|last=Dickson|first=Eric, et. al.|publisher=World Bank|year=2012|isbn=|location=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/659161468182066104/Urban-risk-assessments-understanding-disaster-and-climate-risk-in-cities|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by waterborne, diseases, suspension of electricity service and need for piped water supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A total of 668 floods have been recorded throughout the 1980-2000 period, for which a total of 2,771,284 people have needed immediate assistance (including evacuation and displacement).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During this period, some of the municipalities that have had the most floods have been [[Ecatepec de Morelos|Ecatepec]] (8.68%), [[Iztapalapa]] (7.93%) and [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Chalco]] (6.44%), although [[Tultitlán de Mariano Escobedo|Tultitlan]] and [[Chimalhuacán|Chimalhuacan]] have been the most affected in terms of Urban growth reduces the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the soil in [[groundwater recharge]] areas and increases the risk of flooding. people (36.09% and 32.7%, respectively).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In low-lying neighborhoods such as [[Iztapalapa]], residents are so accustomed to seeing a fetid sea of sewage rise in the streets that they have built miniature dikes in front of their homes.&lt;ref name="ellingwood" /&gt; Flooding is caused both by the sinking together and increased soil impermeability due to urbanization. If the ''Emisor Central'' should fail during the rainy season, modelling shows that a major flood would occur that would inundate the historic center, the [[Mexico City International Airport]] and the eastern boroughs of Mexico City.&lt;ref name="Herrera" /&gt;
=== Increasing urbanization ===
[[File:MX-DF-Crecimiento_de_la_ciudad_de_México.png|thumb|Urban growth of Mexico City (1910-1990)]]It is estimated that the metropolitan area grows annually by 200 to 300 hectares on recharge areas. With every square meter that is built up, on average 170 liters of annual recharge are lost. Thus, for every hectare built up, the water for 500 families are lost and the pressure on groundwater increases further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planeta.com/ecotravel/mexico/ecologia/97/1197df1.html|title=Ecologica - Ciudad de Mexico|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is estimated that the amount of rain water that enters the basin (215 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/second) and the amount that evaporates (160 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/second) has remained the same since precolonial times.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Nevertheless, the recharge rate has reduced considerably due to deforestation and urban growth. Both elements reduce the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the soil in [[groundwater recharge]] areas and increases the risk of flooding. 

To prevent urbanization, a total of 182 Federally [[Mexican Protected Natural Areas|Protected Natural Areas (NPA)]] have been declared throughout the country and cover 90,893,522 [[Hectare|hectares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sig.conanp.gob.mx/website/pagsig/datos_anp.htm|title=Decreed Natural Protected Areas|last=|first=|date=|website=CONANP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, state protected areas exists: [[Mexico City]] has a total of 23 [[Mexican Protected Natural Areas|NPAs]], covering a total of 26,047 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sedema.cdmx.gob.mx/programas/programa/suelo-de-conservacion|title=Land Conervation|last=|first=|date=|website=SEDEMA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State of Mexico]] has a total of 88 [[Mexican Protected Natural Areas|NPAs]], covering a total of 983,984 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conacyt.gob.mx/cibiogem/images/cibiogem/sistema_nacional/documentos/ANPL/Mex/SUPERFICIE_PARQUES_JUNIO_2014.pdf|title=Natural Protected Areas in State of Mexico|last=|first=|date=June 1, 2014|website=Conacyt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite of this, the [[Greater Mexico City|Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA)]] has grown physically and demographically since 1930's.

Additionally, the growth of the city has created a very large and complex hydraulic system fed from 3 different water bodies (the aquifer of Mexico Valley (70%), Lerma-Balsas river basin (9%) and [[Cutzamala River|Cutzemala]] river basin (21%)), where 40% of the water in the network is lost due leakages and illegal connections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The daily mean water provision is 315 liters/inhabitant/day in [[Mexico City]] and 135-195 liters/inhabitant/day in [[State of Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban Water: Challenges in the Americas: a Perspective from the Academies of Sciences - Urban Water in Mexico|last=Torregrosa|first=Maria Luisa, in Lopardo, Raul Antonio (Cord.)|publisher=IANAS|year=2015|isbn=6078379127|location=http://coniunctus.amc.edu.mx/libros/URBANWATERWEBPAGINAS.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is estimated that in wealthy areas, people use up to 600 liters per capita, while in poor ones, the use is only around 20 liters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Water quality and intermittent supply===
'''Water quality'''. Poor water quality is a concern both at the source and at the point of use. Groundwater below Mexico City was initially believed to be protected from contamination by a thick impervious layer. However, this layer has fractured due to land subsidence. Furthermore, the natural upward flow of water in the [[artesian aquifer]] has now been reversed due to [[Overdrafting|groundwater depletion]]. The Groundwater under Mexico City thus is believed to be increasingly vulnerable to contaminants from waste dumps and industrial sites leaching to the aquifer. Furthermore, the deep drainage system penetrates below the clay [[aquitard]] in some places into the main aquifer. During periods of heavy rain, waste water seeps out from the deep tunnels into the surrounding subsoil contaminating the aquifer.&lt;ref name="NRC5"&gt;[http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/Mexico/water/book.html Mexico City's Water Supply:Improving the Outlook for Sustainability], National Research Council, Academia Nacional de la Investigación Científica, A.C., Academia Nacional de Ingeniería, A.C., NATIONAL ACADEMY PRESS, Washington, D.C. 1995, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Untreated wastewater is also disposed of in surrounding rivers that run to the sea, but this runoff water polluted with untreated waste water is also used for irrigation as farmers have found that the high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients effectively fertilize their crops and increase crop yields. Though there is a national norm regulating pollution limits in untreated waste water, CONAGUA reported that the Valley of Mexico basin had 50% heavily contaminated, 25% contaminated, 20.8% acceptable, and only 4.2% excellent water quality based on Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels sampled at selected sites.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

Leaks in the distribution system are a major cause of concern for drinking water quality. When the soil is permeated by sewage from leaking sewers or from other sources, then leaky pipelines will be infiltrated with contaminated water when pressure is low. According to the Federal District's water quality laboratory, neighborhoods that experience more frequent interruptions in service have poorer quality water compared to neighborhoods with a constant supply. The percent of household tap samples in compliance with the residual chlorine standard (0.2 milligrams/liter) ranged from 87 to 100 percent in tests undertaken in 1993 and was notably low among southeastern counties ([[Iztapalapa]], [[Tláhuac]], and [[Xochimilco]]).&lt;ref name="NRC5" /&gt;

Household water storage tanks, or ''tinácos'', are common on almost all household rooftops and are used to store water when water pressure in the system is inadequate. In many instances, the tanks are open and not cleaned regularly, permitting the residual chlorine to dissipate and encouraging the growth of microorganisms. The standard levels of chlorine (0.2 milligrams/liters) maintained in the distribution system as it reaches the customer's tap are not sufficient to inactivate microorganisms that may have entered the pipelines.&lt;ref name="NRC5" /&gt;

'''Intermittent supply'''. Water supply in many parts of Greater Mexico City is intermittent and pressure is often insufficient.  Users thus have to complement their water supply with water bought from tanker trucks, or ''pipas''. Occasionally water supply is cut for several days, as occurred in January 2009 when the water supply from the Cutzamala system had to be reduced cutting water to 5.5 million people for three days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/science/environment/la-fg-mexico-water30-2009jan30,0,7164283.story Mexico City braces for water rationing], Los Angeles Times, January 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

This incident was followed by a second supply cut in March 2009, and most recently a third cut in April 2009. This third cut was done in response to alarmingly low levels in the city's water reserves, and reparations being undertaken on the Cutzamala system. It lasted 36 hours, and left over five million city residents without water services. In response, the Mexico City government has had to implement an emergency supply response program, providing water in tanker trucks and bottles to residents of the affected communities.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

=== Limited wastewater treatment and concerns about reuse for irrigation ===
As mentioned above, only 15% of the wastewater in Greater Mexico City currently receives treatment. Storm water, untreated municipal wastewater and partially treated industrial wastewater mix with each other and are reused for irrigation on a large scale.

There are concerns about the health and environmental impacts of the reuse of untreated wastewater from Mexico City for irrigation. Crops to be grown using wastewater are restricted to crops not eaten raw, but these restrictions are difficult to enforce and farmers also grow vegetables using wastewater. According to a study by the [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI), these risks need to be carefully considered, but the importance of this practice for the livelihoods of countless smallholders must also be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/health/wastew/|title=Key Facts - Water &amp; Health - Issues :: IWMI|work=International Water Management Institute (IWMI)|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on soils irrigated with untreated wastewater for 50 years show an accumulation of heavy metals in the soil, but also that they accumulated in plants to a lower extent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X04000795 A. Mireles, C. Solís, E. Andrade, M. Lagunas-Solar, C. Piña and R. G. Flocchini:Heavy metal accumulation in plants and soil irrigated with wastewater from Mexico city], in:Proceedings of the Sixteenth International Conference on Ion Beam Analysis. Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B:Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms, Volumes 219-220, June 2004, Pages 187-190&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found bacterial contamination of canal water used for bathing and of groundwater used for drinking water supply in the irrigated areas where wastewater was being reused, resulting in a high incidence of diarrhea and skin irriations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1566683 T J Downs, E Cifuentes-García, and I M Suffet:Risk screening for exposure to [[groundwater pollution]] in a wastewater irrigation district of the Mexico City region], Environmental Health Perspectives 1999 July; 107(7): 553–561.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inefficient urban water use ===
The Federal District had a level of [[non-revenue water]] of 40%, close to the Mexican average, meaning that only 60% of the water pumped into the system is actually being billed for. A large share of non-revenue water is due not to leakage, but to illegal connections. Furthermore, SACM, the water department of the District, has by far the lowest collection efficiency among the 25 major municipalities, with only 40% of all bills being paid. Thus only 24% (60% is being billed, 40% of the bills being paid) of the water pumped into the system is being paid for. The level of non-revenue water in Mexico State is lower, so that the average level in the metropolitan area is 36%.

Per capita water use figures are difficult to compare over time, because sources typically do not indicate if water losses are included in the figures or not. The National Statistical Institute gives water use in the Federal District at 223 liter/day in 1999 (probably after losses), including 164 liter of residential use and 59 liter for industrial and commercial uses. This is only about one third of average [[Water supply and sanitation in the United States|water use in the United States]], which is 603 liter/capita/day. However, it is still one third higher than [[Water supply and sanitation in France|water use in France]], which is only 165 liter/capita/day.&lt;ref name="UIA"&gt;[http://www.uia.mx/web/files/la_problematica_del_agua%20.pdf La problematica del agua en el mundo], p. 8-9, quoting data from the Mexican Statistical Institute INEGI&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source gives average per capita water use in 1994 as 364 and 230 liters per day for the Federal District and Mexico State respectively (probably before losses). Authorities attribute the larger per capita use in the Federal District to the fact that the Federal District is more developed and includes more commercial and industrial activity than the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name="NRC4" /&gt; However, lower tariffs and lower metering in the Federal District may also influence the higher water use.

=== Limited cost recovery ===
There is a major gap between the cost of supplying water, a quarter of which is imported through expensive [[interbasin transfer]]s from the [[Lerma River|Lerma]] and [[Balsas River|Balsas]] basins, and what is recovered from users. Reasons for low cost recovery include illegal water connections, low tariffs and poor bill collection, in particular in the [[Mexico City|Federal District]].

Cost recovery in Mexico State is much higher than in the Federal District. For example, the city of [[Toluca]] in Mexico State charges residential users 8.7 pesos (US$0.70)/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for a consumption of 30&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Conagua"&gt;Comisión Nacional del Agua, [http://www.conagua.gob.mx/CONAGUA07/Publicaciones/Publicaciones/SGAPDS-40-12.pdf Situación del Subsector Agua Potable, Alcantarillado y Saneamiento], Edición 2012, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; This still falls short of the cost of bulk water from the Cutzamala system at nearly 10 pesos (US$0.78)/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, without taking into account the cost of distributing water and of sanitation. Furthermore, it is estimated than 1/3 of the water connections in the region are informal and therefore this consumption is not billed. Water price is differentiated according to their demand, increasing with higher consumption. Additionally water price was substantially reduced for low consumption users since 1996.&lt;ref name="ECLAC"/&gt;

In 2011 the Federal District charged residential users 15.6 pesos (US$1.25)/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for the same consumption without any surcharge for sanitation, the fourth-highest among the same municipalities.&lt;ref name="Conagua" /&gt; The remainder is effectively subsidized by the municipal and federal governments. In August 2007 a conflict had erupted between Conagua and the Federal District when Conagua increased the tariff for water supplied through the Cutzamala system and the District refused to accept the increase.

=== Social impact of water crisis ===

The human rights commission of the District (CDHDF) warned in summer 2009 that water shortage could cause a "spiral of violence" and that low-income families are paying more for water of lower quality and only receive it at certain hours of the day. This situation causes "social unrest". In early August 2009, the head of Conagua, José Luis Luege, had announced an "imminent and indefinite increase in water rationing in the Valley of Mexico and federal district." &lt;ref&gt;IRC:[http://www.irc.nl/page/49876 Mexico City: water scarcity could cause “spiral of violence”, human rights commission warns], accessed on 23 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Because water from Cutzamala and Lerma systems, supplying together one quarter of the metropolitan area's water, enters the city from the Northwest where wealthier neighborhoods predominate, water supply tends to be more continuous than in the Southeast of the city where most of the poor live.

Mexico has shown limited results in its implementation of socially differentiated price systems and cross-subsidies. There is an important limitation caused by the fact that the poor population does not have formal access to drinking water and is thereby forced to buy drinking water from informal water vendors. The informal market is not affected by the subsidies and furthermore tends to be even more expensive than the formal market price.&lt;ref name="ECLAC"&gt;{{cite web

== Response to challenges ==
In response to these challenges, two major programs are underway. The National Water Commission has launched a massive US$2.8 billion Water Sustainability Program in 2007 for bulk water supply, drainage and wastewater treatment for the period 2007-2012. In parallel, the government of the Federal District has launched a 15-year Green Plan that also includes drainage and wastewater treatment. In addition it emphasizes water conservation and water reuse through aquifer recharge. Both plans aim at reducing [[non-revenue water]].

=== Water Sustainability Program ===
In November 2009, President [[Felipe Calderón]] launched a US$2.8 billion Water Sustainability Program for the Valley of Mexico  through 2012. The program amplifies the earlier Program for the Sanitation of the Valley of Mexico. Its objectives are to avoid major floods such as the [[2007 Tabasco flood]], to treat all the wastewater collected, and to reduce groundwater overexploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=332113 Abandera Calderón Programa de Sustentabilidad Hídrica] La crónica de hoy, November 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water supply and exchange'''. 14&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s more water would be mobilized from various sources. The largest of these imports  (5&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) will consist of groundwater from the Tula Valley North of Greater Mexico, where the groundwater table has increased from many years of irrigation with untreated wastewater, at a cost of US$255 million. The second-largest source of additional water will be mobilized through an exchange of treated wastewater for clean water at present used for irrigation in the Vaso del Christo area (4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s), at a cost of 140 million. As part of the "rehabilitation" of existing sources, the Cutzamala system is expected to be expanded by 3&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s, at a cost of US$275 million. Finally, 2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s would be made available from the Guadelupe dam in Mexico state at a cost of US$40 million.

'''Storm water drainage and wastewater treatment'''. The program foresees the construction of the ''Emisor Oriente'' in parallel to the ''Emisor Central''.  In February 2009, Conagua oversaw the purchase of the first of three underground drills from German firm Herrenknecht. The new drill will be used to begin excavations for the tunnel in April 2009. The tunnel will be 62&amp;nbsp;km long, 7 meters in diameter, and have a capacity of draining 150 
&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s wastewater.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;  All works on the tunnel system are expected to be completed in September 2012, at an expected cost of MXP 13 billion (approx. USD 1 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conagua.gob.mx/CONAGUA07/NotaP/BOLETIN%20019-09.pdf Comunicado de Prensa de Conagua:En abril llegará el primero de tres escudos excavadores para iniciar la perforación del Túnel Emisor Oriente], February 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the discharge of the Emisor Oriental 23&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s would be treated in a planned wastewater treatment plant in [[El Salto, Hidalgo|El Salto]] in Hidalgo State to deliver water to the Tula Irrigation District.&lt;ref name="Herrera"&gt;Cesar Herrera:Integrated Urban Water Resources Management - Mexico City Case Study, World Bank, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of the investment  (US$1.28 bn) will be for the construction of 6 wastewater treatment plants, the largest of which by far would be the Atotonilco (El Salto) plant.&lt;ref name="Herrera" /&gt; The US$900m contract to finance, build and operate the plant, allegedly the largest wastewater treatment plant in the world, was awarded in 2010 to a consortium led by the Spanish company Acciona.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence:[http://www.globalwaterawards.com/ Global Water Awards 2011, Water Deal of the Year:Atotonilco WWTP financing], Retrieved on May 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The plant has a nominal treatment capacity of 23&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/second, with an additional capacity for periods of high rainfall of 12&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Projects, 20 November 2012|url=http://www.conagua.gob.mx/english07/publications/StrategicProjects.pdf|publisher=Conagua, Department of Studies and Projects  for drinking water and sewerage networks|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of the program objective to both supply a growing population with water and to reduce pressure on the aquifer rests on the assumption that leakage will be reduced from 36% in 2005 to 25% in 2030.

'''Financing'''. The program is being financed from the following sources:

* '''Private sector''':The wastewater treatment plants are partly financed by the private sector through equity and debt under [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) projects
* '''Federal government''': The federal government directly finances some of the works, executed by Conagua
* The '''Trust Fund No. 1928''', created by the Federal District, the State of Mexico and the Federal Government, will finance part of the works. The Trust Fund is replenished by the payments made by the Federal District and the State of Mexico for bulk water supplied to them by Conagua. It is administered financially by the public infrastructure Bank [[Banobras]], with Conagua acting as technical coordinator. The Trust Fund was modified in November 2008 to allow the financing of a broader range of projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espanol.news.yahoo.com/s/081127/35/gkhhid.html Conagua: Modificaciones a Fideicomiso 1928 facilitarán financiamiento de proyectos] Business News Americas, November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''Metropolitan Fund''', or National Infrastructure Fund, established at the national level for infrastructure investments, also finances some works
* Loans from the state-owned investment bank Banobras.

=== Green Plan ===
[[File:Xochimilco.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Canals in [[Xochimilco]].]]
Complementing the SARP, the Federal District launched in 2007 a 15-year Green Plan (''Plan Verde'') that aims at the sustainable development of the District along seven major axes, one of which is water. In 2008 it had a budget of US$6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/08/31/index.php?section=capital&amp;article=035n1cap Lanzan Plan Verde; en el primer año requerirá de $6 mil millones La Jornada] August 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning water, it foresees reaching an equilibrium in the aquifer, reducing residential water use, reducing network losses, increasing the reuse and the treatment of wastewater, and the creation of parks around the lakes [[Tláhuac]] and [[Xochimilco]].&lt;ref name="sma.df.gob.mx"&gt;[http://www.sma.df.gob.mx/sma/planverde/index.php?op=agua Plan Verde de la Ciudad de Mexico:Agua]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plan Verde de la Ciudad de Mexico"&gt;[http://planverde.org/diarioverde.php?idarticulo=7 Plan Verde de la Ciudad de Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, it foresees increased aquifer recharge through changes in land use and recharge wells; the [[Water metering|metering]] of all users by 2010 and making all users pay for water; identify and regularize illegal connections; the construction of tertiary wastewater treatment plants for the injection of treated wastewater into the [[aquifer]]. The Plan is expected to relieve pressure on the aquifer by 6.8&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s, including 3.3&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s by reducing leakage, 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s through water conservation and 2.5&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s by recharging groundwater with treated wastewater.&lt;ref name="sma.df.gob.mx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plan Verde de la Ciudad de Mexico"/&gt;

These measures together, if successful, would reduce groundwater abstraction in Greater Mexico by 10% and the overdraft by 25%. They would still fall short from establishing an equilibrium between abstraction and recharge.

=== Enhanced private sector participation in the Federal District from 2010 onwards ===

In mid-2009 the finance chief of the Federal District, Mario Delgado, and the director general of the District's water company SACM announced that from mid-2010 onwards the District intends to enhance the participation of the private sector in water supply through concessions, under which the concessionnaires would buy bulk water and distribute it, thus providing an incentive to reduce [[non-revenue water]]. A total of four concession covering 11 of the District's 16 ''delegaciones'' would be bid out. The concessions would replace the existing four service contracts for metering and billing.

=== Rainwater harvesting ===
In 2003, the Water Law was enacted in Mexico City. It mandates that new building constructions accommodate practices of rainwater harvesting and promotes this practice in previous buildings.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aldf.gob.mx/archivo-d0c1ac48ef930701568a2cbd52e7d29e.pdf|title=Water Law of Mexico City|last=Asamblea Legsilativa del Distrito Federal|first=|date=|website=ALDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also states that in certain zones (Zone 1 and 2, according to the Construction Regulation of Mexico City), it is also obligatory that buildings have a [[Rainwater harvesting|stormwater harvest]] and recharge system, especially if near green areas, to promote [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Finally, it also states that recreational or free areas must be covered with permeable materials.

== Past responses to challenges ==

Past responses to the water challenges facing Greater Mexico City included an ambitious water conservation campaign initiated in 1989, as well as an increase in metering and a reduction in leakage through private sector participation begun in the early 1990s.

===Water conservation program in the 1990s===

In 1989, in parallel with the introduction of stricter national water efficiency standards for household appliances, Mexico City launched an ambitious program to replace conventional toilets (using 16 liters) with 6-liter models, replacing 350,000 toilets by 1991. The program also included a large-scale public information campaign and an increase in water tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sandra Postel]]:Last Oasis, 1992, p. 150-151&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of the program is difficult to assess, since available figures on water consumption are difficult to compare over the years, because it is not clear whether they include water losses or not and whether they refer only to residential consumption or total consumption.

===Private sector participation in the Federal District since 1993===

[[Manuel Camacho Solís]], the [[Head of Government of the Federal District]] from 1988 to 1997 who was appointed by President [[Carlos Salinas]] (PRI), led the process of private sector participation in water supply in Mexico City in the early 1990s. At that time water revenues were extremely low, there was no functioning customer database, virtually no metering, and low bill collection efficiency. At least  22% of customers did not receive bills at all, partly because water connections were carried out by one department and billing by another which did not receive any information about water connections from the former.&lt;ref name="Haggarty"&gt;Haggarty, Luke; Brook, Penelope; Zuluaga, Ana Maria: [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2001/11/22/000094946_01090705105228/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf Thirst for reform ? private sector participation in providing Mexico City's water supply], Volume 1, 2001, 	World Bank Policy Research working paper No. WPS 2654&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1992 bids were launched, in March 1993 the results were announced and in November 10-year service contracts were signed with four firms, each for one block of the capital:
* Block 1 with four boroughs in the North was awarded to SAPSA (Servicios de Agua Potable S.A.), constituted by the large Mexican construction firm Ingenieros Civiles Asociados (ICA), with the Bank [[Banamex]] and the French firm Générales Des Eaux ([[Vivendi]]),
* Block 2 with three boroughs in the center was awarded to IASA, (Industrias del Agua S.A.), which included businessmen from Monterrey and the British firm [[Severn Trent]]
* Block 3 with the impoverished Southeast was attributed to TECSA (Tecnología y Servicios de Agua S.A.), which included [[Bancomer]], Bufete Industrial, and the French firm Lyonnaise Des Eaux-Dumex ([[SUEZ]]-Ondeo Services) as well as the British firm [[Anglian Water]].
* Block 4 with five wealthy delegations in the Southwest was awarded to AMSA (Agua de México S.A.), which included the GUTSA group and the British firm North West Water International.

The process of private sector participation foresaw three phases: 
*First phase (1994–1995): Updating of the user registry.
*Second phase (1995–1998): Meter reading, billing, and some aspects of collection.
*Third phase (1998–2003): Leak detection and repair, extension and rehabilitation of the secondary distribution network.

The city remained in charge of the water production, treatment and main distribution infrastructure, as well as some aspects of collection and the sanitation infrastructure. It also set water tarirfs. The first two phases were successful. Under the contracts the number of metered connections increased from virtually none in 1994 to up to 1,264,500 in 2002, reaching more than 90% of all users.&lt;ref name="Tortajada" /&gt; The third phase, however, was less successful.&lt;ref name="Tortajada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2006/papers/Tortajada%20C.pdf|title=Reports|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imacmexico.org/ev_es.php?ID=26291_201&amp;ID2=DO_TOPIC Eugenia Gutiérrez y Arturo Ramírez:Agua privada en la Ciudad de México], Revista Rebeldía # 28, Febrero 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Martínez Omaña, La gestión privada de un servicio público:el caso del agua en el Distrito Federal, 1988-1995, Mexico City 2002, {{ISBN|968-856-996-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1994 and 1998 the amount billed increased by almost 30% in real terms. But the amount collected stagnated, since private operators were not in charge of bill collection. Collection efficiency actually declined from 84% to 69%&lt;ref name="Haggarty"/&gt;  The service itself remained unchanged in terms of intermittency of supply and water quality, since these aspects were not part of the contracts. Tariffs and cost recovery also remained unchanged, with revenues covering less than 75% of operating costs.&lt;ref name="Haggarty" /&gt; The third phase of turning over increased responsibility to the private sector was abandoned after the PRD won elections in 1997 and renegotiated the contracts.&lt;ref name="Haggarty" /&gt;

The PRD mayor [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] (2000–2005) renewed the contracts in 2004 for another five years,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives-suez.com/en/presse/press/releases-archives/archives/?communique_id=746 SUEZ Environnement has its water services contracts renewed for 5 years by Mexico City], October 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Alejandro Encinas Rodríguez]] initially announced that the District would terminate the contracts even before they expired, but his successor [[Marcelo Ebrard]] actually extended them for another year until mid-2010.

=== Valley of Mexico Sanitation Project ===

In 1996 the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) approved a US$365 million loan for the Valley of Mexico Sanitation Project,  in parallel with a loan of US$410 million by the [[Foreign aid institutions of Japan|Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund]] of Japan. The IDB project, which closed in 2005, foresaw the construction of 4 wastewater treatment plants with a total capacity of 74.5&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s as well as the rehabilitation of drainage systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/projects/project.cfm?id=ME0179&amp;lang=en IDB:ME0179 : Sanitation for the Valley of Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water restrictions''' have been enacted in many cities and regions in [[Australia]], which is the Earth's driest inhabited continent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml|title=Living with Drought 20/3/2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to chronic water shortages resulting from the widespread [[Drought in Australia|drought]]. Depending upon the location, these can include restrictions on watering [[lawn]]s, using [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler systems]], washing [[vehicle]]s, hosing [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], refilling [[swimming pool]]s, etc. Overpopulation, [[Climate change in Australia|evidence of drying climates]], coupled with corresponding reductions in the supply of drinking water has led various state governments to consider alternative water sources to supplement existing sources, and to implement "water inspectors" who can issue penalties to those who waste water. 
As of July 2007, some areas and towns have no [[Outdoor water-use restriction|water restrictions]], including the [[Northern Territory]], Regional [[Tasmania]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and [[Dubbo]]. There are also a few parts of Australia where the water storage levels are at or close to 100%, such as [[Taree, New South Wales|Taree]]. Many states describe the different levels of water restrictions in terms of "stages": starting at Stage 1, for the least restrictive, going up as far as Stage 8. The highest level reached in the current drought has been stage 7 for [[Kingaroy, Queensland|Kingaroy]]. There are different definitions given to each "stage" in different States.

== Water restrictions by state or territory ==

=== Australian Capital Territory ===

There are presently four stages of temporary water restrictions which can be imposed by [[ACTEW Corporation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actew.com.au/publications/TemporaryWaterRestrictionsScheme.pdf|title=SCHEME OF TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF WATER FROM ACTEW CORPORATION WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canberra]] was subject to Stage 1 restrictions from 1 November 2005, which were increased to Stage 2 after a year on 1 November 2006. The continuing drought led to a further increase to Stage 3 from 16 December 2006; the restrictions were maintained at Stage 3 throughout 2007 and 2008. From 1 November 2010 Canberra moved to Permanent Water Saving Rules due to heavy rain bringing water storages close to capacity.

=== New South Wales ===

The different classification levels of water restrictions in New South Wales vary widely, and are set by the different authorities responsible for water throughout the state.

==== Sydney ====

The following Levels have been used by [[Sydney Water]] to describe the different stages of water restrictions it has imposed:&lt;ref name="SydneyWater"&gt;[http://www.sydneywater.com.au/SavingWater/WaterRestrictions/WhenWereWaterRestrictionsIntroduced.cfm When were water restrictions introduced&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneywater.com.au/SavingWater/WaterRestrictions/|title=Water Restrictions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|New South Wales water supply problems continue}}

Falling dam levels prompted Sydney Water to impose Level 1 water restrictions on the Sydney area from 1 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | author = Stephanie Peatling

 | accessdate = 2008-03-12
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
When these restrictions failed to stem the reduction in the city's water supplies as a result of continuing drought, and with dam levels dropping below 50 per cent, Level 2 water restrictions were introduced from 1 June 2004. Further reductions in dam levels to below 40 per cent of capacity led to an increase to Level 3 water restrictions from 1 June 2005. Level 3 water restrictions were in place as of February 2008. Since June 2009, though, Sydney Water replaced water restrictions with Water Wise Rules. The Rules are:
* All hoses must now have a trigger nozzle.
* Hand held hoses, sprinklers and watering systems may be used only before 10 am and after 4 pm on any day - to avoid the heat of the day
* No hosing of hard surfaces such as paths and driveways. Washing vehicles is allowed.
* Fire hoses may be used for fire fighting activities only.

To deal with its water shortage, New South Wales has followed the same path as Western Australia, announcing a new desalination plant for [[Sydney]] to cost $1.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/scorchedearth/nsw-goes-against-flow-on-water-law/2007/01/02/1167500125064.html NSW goes against flow on water law], Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

Sydney Water has imposed fines of $200 for violations of the rules for individuals, $500 for businesses, and $2,200 for water theft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneywater.com.au/Water4Life/WaterWise/ Sydney Water - Water Wise Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; Rules are enforced by Sydney Water staff through random checks.

==== Regional NSW ====

As different towns in regional New South Wales take their drinking water from different sources, different levels of water restrictions apply. The levels or stages which apply in certain towns are as follows:
*[[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] – no restrictions
*[[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] – no restrictions
*[[Cobar, New South Wales|Cobar]] – stage 5
*[[Dubbo]] – no restrictions
*[[Gosford, New South Wales|Gosford]] – stage 4 from 1 October 2006
*[[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] had Stage 5 water restrictions imposed from 1 October 2004, and went on to win a National Water Conservation Award for Excellence due to the water which had been conserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/2006/s1800197.htm Goulburn wins water-saving award], ABC News 29 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; From 5 July 2007, Goulburn relaxed its water restrictions to Level 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goulburn.local-e.nsw.gov.au/roads/1439/5103.html|title=Goulburn - Level 3 Water Restrictions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Territory ===

{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
Currently, no water restrictions apply in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].

=== Queensland ===

Some of the details of the different stages of water restrictions which apply in Queensland for the residential sector are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qwc.qld.gov.au/Water+restrictions|title=Qld Water Commission : Restrictions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some regions of Queensland have had traditionally high rainfalls, some regions of Queensland have been subject to the toughest water restrictions in place in Australia. The highest level of water restrictions reached the drought was stage 7 for [[Kingaroy, Queensland|Kingaroy]]. [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]], [[Brisbane]] and South East Queensland reached Level 6 restrictions.

On 13 May 2005, 13 local councils in southeast Queensland, including those in Brisbane, agreed to impose Stage 1 water restrictions, due to drying dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | author = Staff writer

 | publisher = [[News Limited]]
 | page = 1
 | date = 13 May 2005
 | accessdate = 2008-03-17
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
These restrictions were increased to Stage 2 from 3 October 2005, which at the time were described as the "toughest water restrictions in southeast Queensland's history", except the Gold Coast which had been on Stage 5 restrictions since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Stage 3 water restrictions were imposed on the region from 13 June 2006 amid projections that water storage levels would drop to 5% within 26 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Water restrictions continued to increase, to Stage 4 from 1 November 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qwc.qld.gov.au/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=41 Level 4 restrictions start 1 November], Queensland Water Commission&lt;/ref&gt; stage 5 from 10 April 2007, and up to Stage 6 from 23 November 2007.

The [[Queensland Water Commission]] has relaxed water restrictions, with the introduction of High Level Water restrictions as of 31 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qwc.qld.gov.au/myfiles/uploads/high%20level%20restrictions/high%20level%20restrictions.pdf|title=High level restrictions|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other towns and regions of Queensland are subject to different levels of water restrictions, as set out below:
*[[Cairns]] – Level 1 restrictions from October 2002 till about January 2004.
*[[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] – stage 6 from 23 November 2007, stage 5 from 10 April 2007, stage 4 from 1 November 2006. The Hinze Dam, which is the Gold Coast's main water supply reached 100% in January 2008 and the coast now has no water restrictions.
*[[Kingaroy]] – Stage 7 from 1 October 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingaroy.qld.gov.au/pdfs/200709waternewsletter.pdf|title=Water Restriction Document from Kingaroy Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Toowoomba]] – stage 6 from 23 November 2007, stage 5 from 26 September 2006. In 2006, the town council proposed the use of [[Sewage treatment|recycled wastewater]] to supplement town water from dams, however the scheme was rejected by the town's population and the town has since resorted to drilling [[Artesian aquifer|artesian]] and sub-artesian bores as an alternative source of drinking water.
*[[Townsville]] – stage 2 from 15 November 2006, stage 1 from 12 February 2007

=== South Australia ===

The different levels of residential water restrictions which have been applied to different regions of South Australia by [[SA Water]] are as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! !! Permanent Water Conservation Measures !! Eyre Peninsula !! Level 2 !! Level 3
|-
!Reticulation sprinklers:
|5pm–10am (6pm–10am in [[Daylight saving in Australia|DST]])
|6pm–8am (8pm–8am in [[Daylight saving in Australia|DST]])
|8pm–8am, 3 days/week. Sporting grounds and public facilities 2 days/week.
|Prohibited
|-
!Hand-held hose watering and drippers:
|colspan=3|Any time
|1 day/week with trigger nozzle, 6–9am or 5–8pm
|-
!Bucket/watering cans:
|colspan=4|Any time
|-
!Swimming pools and Spas:
|No restrictions
|colspan=3|No filling or emptying without permit. New pools or spas must have a cover.
|-
!Fountains and ponds:

|colspan=2|Bucket, commercial car wash or hose with trigger nozzle only
|colspan=2|Bucket or commercial car wash only
|-
!Hard surfaces:
|colspan=4|No washing or hosing down hard surfaces
|}

Different water restrictions levels apply to different parts of the state, depending upon the source of drinking water used in that region. SA Water have produced a [http://www.sawater.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/A1700B03-0CC3-401C-B338-C94F8C297DD4/0/WaterRestrictions_lvl3.pdf map] showing the current areas of water restrictions.

==== Areas using Murray River water ====

[[Adelaide]] and much of south-eastern South Australia takes its drinking water from the [[Murray River]]. Permanent water conservation measures were put into place in this region in 2003,&lt;ref name="Advertiser"&gt;{{cite news
 | first = Greg
 | last = Kelton

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and as a result of the most severe drought to hit the region since the 1940s,&lt;ref name="Advertiser" /&gt; Level 2 water restrictions were imposed from 22 October 2006 on those areas (including metropolitan Adelaide) which use water from the Murray River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate = 2008-03-17
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Even lower inflows to the Murray River over the course of 2006 led to the even tougher Level 3 water restrictions being imposed on the region from 1 January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | first = Clare

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
which remain in place.

==== Other areas ====

The [[Eyre Peninsula]] draws most of its drinking water from underground basins,&lt;ref name="Eyre"&gt;{{cite news
 | author = Greg Kelton &amp; Nathan Cross
 | title = Constraints on gardens, parks and washing cars Peninsula hit with water restrictions.

 | accessdate = 2008-03-17
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
which progressively became depleted through drought and high consumption, prompting the State Government to introduce water restrictions on the entire region from 6 December 2002, apart from [[Whyalla]].&lt;ref name="Eyre" /&gt; The water restrictions for the peninsula remain in force as of 2008.

Conversely, the areas in the south east of the State, south of the town of [[Keith, South Australia|Keith]], are subject to the permanent water conservation measures.

Other areas in the state are not subject to water restrictions. These areas include [[Murray Mallee]], areas north of [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]], [[Kangaroo Island]], [[Cockburn, South Australia|Cockburn]], [[Hawker, South Australia|Hawker]], [[Melrose, South Australia|Melrose]], Ororoo, [[Parachilna, South Australia|Parachilna]], [[Quorn, South Australia|Quorn]], Warooka, Wilmington, [[Terowie, South Australia|Terowie]], Yunta, Olary and Manna Hill.

The different levels of residential water restrictions which have been applied to different regions of South Australia by SA Water are as follows:

Permanent Water Conservation Measures Eyre Peninsula Level 2 Level 3 
Reticulation sprinklers: 5pm–10am (6pm–10am in DST) 6pm–8am (8pm–8am in DST) 8pm–8am, 3 days/week Prohibited 
Hand-held hose watering and drippers: Any time 1 day/week with trigger nozzle, 6–9am or 5–

=== Tasmania ===

Usually, there are no water restrictions for domestic consumption.

Periodically, however, restrictions will be placed on how water can be used in domestic, commercial or rural areas.  Examples&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernwatertas.com.au/ArticleDocuments/120/Water Restrictions Policy.pdf.aspx Stages of Water Restrictions]&lt;/ref&gt; of such restrictions are:
*watering with a hose is permitted but not using a fixed sprinkler system,
*being able to use sprinkler systems only during certain hours,
*the initial wetting and final rinsing of a car may be done with the hose but washing must be done using a bucket,
*washing a car is permitted using a bucket of water but not using the hose,
*watering of sports grounds allowed only during certain hours,
*watering stock is acceptable but not irrigating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter,nsf/WebPages/JMUY-4YB2FZ?open Restrictions] Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment&lt;/ref&gt;

One purpose of such restrictions is to keep the dam levels up and ensure adequate water pressure for the fire department's needs in the event of fires.

=== Victoria ===

The different stages of water restrictions which apply in different areas of Victoria are based upon the Victorian Uniform Drought Water Restriction Guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vicwater.org.au/uploads/Water%20Restrictions/Final%20Version%20Uniform%20Drought%20Water%20Restriction%20Guidelines.pdf|title=Victorian Uniform Drought Water Restriction Guidelines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
however they have been modified by the inclusion of a "Stage 3a", to reduce the likelihood of needing to impose Stage 4 restrictions in metropolitan Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwater.vic.gov.au/ourwater/water_restrictions/stage_3a|title=Our Water, Our Future - Stage 3a Water Restrictions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water restrictions have been employed in various Western Australian towns when poor rainfall has led to water shortages. For instance, in the summer of 1977-1978, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] was subject to a total sprinkler ban.&lt;ref name="WASprinklerBan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | quote = But Minister Assisting the Treasurer Nick Griffiths said a total ban - not seen since 1977 - would be put in place only if people were not able to save water.
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Newman, Western Australia|Newman]] and [[Nullagine, Western Australia|Nullagine]] experienced water restrictions from 1991 and 1992 onwards as the result of drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, the resort towns of [[Yallingup, Western Australia|Yallingup]] and [[Dunsborough, Western Australia|Dunsborough]] experienced water restrictions in 1997 during a heatwave,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Kalgoorlie|Kalgoorlie-Boulder]] had temporary water restrictions imposed during 1998 due to shortages in its reservoirs (which contain water pumped through the [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme]]).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

 | accessdate = 2008-03-12
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A Stage 1 ban on using reticulation sprinklers between 9.00am and 6.00pm was imposed on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] residents in 1996,&lt;ref name="WASprinklerBan"&gt;{{cite news
 | first = Carmelo

 | quote = The sprinkler ban was introduced in 1996, the first restriction on Perth's water since the summer of 1977-78.
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and remains in place to this day. This was the first water restriction imposed on the state's most populous city since the total sprinkler ban in 1978.&lt;ref name="WASprinklerBan" /&gt; From September 2001, users of the Integrated Water Supply Scheme (covering Perth, its surrounds and towns on the [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme|Goldfields pipeline]]) were subject to Stage 4 restrictions, only permitted to use reticulation sprinklers two days per week, according to a roster.

The town of [[Northampton, Western Australia|Northampton]] in the Mid-West encountered a water shortage in 2006 where its underground aquifer could not meet demand. Stage 5 watering restrictions were imposed,&lt;ref name="SWToughBans"&gt;{{cite news
 | first = Suellen

 | quote = One-day-a-week sprinkler restrictions have already been imposed in Northampton, in the Mid-West
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Water Corporation]] resorted to carting tankers of water to the town to maintain the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | first = Suellen
 | last = Jerrard
 | title = Country in crisis as water tanks run dry
 | publisher = [[The West Australian]]

 | accessdate = 2008-03-12
 | quote = The Water Corporation has started carting water to Northampton, one of the areas hardest hit by the drought, because its ground water aquifer could not meet demand.
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage 4 water restrictions were imposed in the South-West towns of [[Bridgetown, Western Australia|Bridgetown]], [[Balingup, Western Australia|Balingup]], [[Boyup Brook, Western Australia|Boyup Brook]], [[Hester, Western Australia|Hester]], [[Kirup, Western Australia|Kirup]], [[Greenbushes, Western Australia|Greenbushes]] and [[Mullalyup, Western Australia|Mullalyup]] from 13 October 2006.&lt;ref name="SWToughBans" /&gt;

On 1 October 2007, water restrictions were expanded to cover the entire state, including those towns serviced by utilities other than the [[Water Corporation]]. Under the new system, all areas of the state in the region south of Kalbarri and Kalgoorlie (including Perth and most of the state's population) which use scheme water are subject to Stage 4 restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_reg/waub2007297/s6.html reg 6], Water Agencies (Water Use) By-Laws 2007 (WA)&lt;/ref&gt;
Areas north of the dividing line are subject to Stage 2 restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_reg/waub2007297/s5.html reg 5], Water Agencies (Water Use) By-Laws 2007 (WA)&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, whereas the water restrictions had previously only restricted the use of mains water to water gardens and lawns by sprinkler, under the new water restrictions unlicensed [[Borehole|bore]] operators in Perth and its surrounds are restricted to watering their gardens three times per week.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.waterwisewaysforwa.com.au/go/secondary-navigation/faqs Waterwise Ways for WA - FAQs]
&lt;/ref&gt;
This was to slow the depletion of underground aquifers from which Perth sources much of its drinking water.

Around November 2013 the water restrictions were removed from the Water Agencies (Water Use) Bylaws 2010 and added to the Water Services Regulations 2013 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/gazette/gazette.nsf/searchgazette/7D00684E37ECBC8748257C22000DB0CE/$file/gg203.pdf], Western Australian Government Gazette 14 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_11731_homepage.html], Water Agencies (Water Use) Bylaws 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_13117_homepage.html], Water Services Regulations 2013 - See part 5 and schedules 1, 2 and 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts are being made to secure alternative water sources to ease water shortages in the Integrated Water Supply Scheme. Integral to the Government's strategy is the construction of desalination plants to service Perth. One has already been constructed in [[Kwinana Desalination Plant|Kwinana]], which supplies 17% of the city's water consumption and is the largest desalination plant in both the [[Southern hemisphere|Southern]] and [[Eastern hemisphere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watercorporation.com.au/S/sources_of_perths_water.cfm?uid=7488-4865-5888-4035|title=Integrated Water Supply System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Binningup Desalination Plant|second desalination plant]] near Binningup was completed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watercorporation.com.au/D/desalination_plant2.cfm|title=Southern Seawater Desalination Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trial has also been announced to [[sewage treatment|treat wastewater]] and pump it into underground aquifers to undergo natural filtration as it returns to the dwindling groundwater supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/perth-tests-treated-sewage-for-drinking/2007/01/01/1167500065933.html Perth tests treated sewage for drinking] The Age, 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Water restrictions have been criticised for hampering the economy and the lifestyles of people.&lt;ref&gt;(28 May 2007). [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/restrictions-off-in-five-years-says-usage-report/2007/05/27/1180205077457.html Restrictions off in five years, says usage report]. David Rood. The Age.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Water Commission]] chief has argued that Australia needs a source of water that is independent of the rainfall. [[Water desalination]] is touted as the solution for potentially unlimited water use.&lt;ref&gt;(18 May 2007). [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/unlimited-water-could-be-on-tap/2007/05/17/1178995330217.html 'Unlimited' water could be on tap]. Ben Doherty. The Age.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Australian Environment Minister, [[Malcolm Turnbull]] says that it does not make sense to have permanent water restrictions just as there are no electricity restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/news/article.aspx?ID=495 |accessdate=27 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820071310/http://malcolmturnbull.com.au/news/Article.aspx?ID=495 |archivedate=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9745">The '''Zimbabwe Rowing team at the 2016 Summer Paralympics''' was the first rowing team to represent [[Zimbabwe at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|their country]] at a [[Paralympic Games]]. The team entered the [[Rowing at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|para mixed coxed four]] finishing last in their event. The team consisted of rowers Margret Bangajena, Michelle Garnett, Takudzwa Gwariro and Previous Wiri and their [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] Jessica Davis. Managed by Davis' mother, Rachel Davies, the team captured the imagination of the press due to the unlikely story of the crew's formation and the hardships they faced on reaching the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] in Rio de Janeiro.

==Formation==
Rachel Davies, a Canadian sports administrator from [[Cambridge, Ontario]], was assigned to [[Zimbabwe]] in 1996 by her employers, [[Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Aviron]] (FISA), where her role was to improve the sport of rowing in Africa. The following year she married a Zimbabwean, had a family and settled down in the country.&lt;ref name="Waterloo Record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/sports-story/6791179-rowing-coach-is-rio-bound-against-all-odds/|work=Waterloo Region Record|accessdate=30 October 2016|title=Rowing coach is Rio-bound, against all odds|date=1 August 2016|first=Greg|last=Mercer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Davis successfully coached and registered two Zimbabwean rowers for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, [[Micheen Thornycroft]] and [[James Fraser-Mackenzie]]. When Thornycrofy decided to part company from Davis to train permanently with the South African team, it left Davis with free time to spare, which resulted in a new FISA request.&lt;ref name="Doucet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgetimes.ca/sports-story/6826844-cambridge-woman-turns-fairy-tales-and-stories-into-zimbabwe-paralympic-reality-maybe/|work=Cambridge Times|accessdate=30 October 2016|title=Cambridge woman turns 'fairy tales and stories' into Zimbabwe Paralympic reality ... maybe|date=28 August 2016|first=Bill|last=Doucet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to widen the appeal of rowing the [[International Paralympic Committee]] assigned four berths for African teams in the rowing program at the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] in Rio. [[Kenya at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|Kenya]] and [[South Africa at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|South Africa]] had already taken three of the positions, and FISA now asked Davis to put forward a Zimbabwe team for the last slot.&lt;ref name="Doucet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/rowing-five-things-we-learned-rio-2016|title=Rowing: Five things we learned from Rio 2016|website=www.paralympic.org|access-date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis had no experience in adaptive rowing, and Zimbabwe had no program either.&lt;ref name="Waterloo Record"/&gt; With only two months before the Paralympic qualifying camp in Italy, Davis sent out a call on social media for people with disabilities who would be interested in rowing at the Paralympics. Eighteen people responded to her call, meeting at [[St. George's College, Harare]] where Davis taught.&lt;ref name="Waterloo Record"/&gt; None had any rowing experience and most could not swim. The candidates had little understanding of competitive rowing, and one sixty year-old applicant arrived in her Sunday best, wearing a shower cap to protect her hair.&lt;ref name="Waterloo Record"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doucet"/&gt; Overwhelmed by the response, as Davis was expecting only a handful of responders, she decided to assemble a team rather than enter single scull events.&lt;ref name="Doucet"/&gt; Initially Davis was concerned about understanding how adaptive rowers were classified, but fortunately two physiotherapists turned up at the first meet hoping to help out the athletes for "Olympic trials", who were able to assess the volunteers.&lt;ref name="Doucet"/&gt; 

The initial meet gave Davis three members of her mixed cox team, but she needed a second male member.&lt;ref name="worldrowing 13 June"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldrowing.com/news/how-one-african-para-rowing-team-found-their-way-the-paralympics|title=How one African para-rowing team found their way to the Paralympics|website=worldrowing.com|access-date=30 October 2016|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noticing that Takudzwa Gwariro, a fellow PE teacher at the school, walked with a limp, she inquired if he would like to join the team.&lt;ref name="worldrowing 13 June"/&gt; He accepted, giving the team just three weeks to train together before the trials in Italy.&lt;ref name="worldrowing 13 June"/&gt; The team's preparations for Italy were far from perfect, training on a dam which was home to crocodiles with having to use antiquated boats.&lt;ref name="Waterloo Record"/&gt; Further problems came after a public transit boycott meant the rowers couldn't travel to the dam.&lt;ref name="Waterloo Record"/&gt;

==Competition==
The team that travelled to Italy consisted of Takudzwa Gwariro, Margret Bangajena, Previous Wiri, Chipo Zhento and Davis' daughter Jessica as their able-bodied cox.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt; Their chances were almost dashed at the first hurdle after Zhento suffered a seizure. The team was asked to pull-out, but a Cameroon doctor, who knew the shame that would be brought onto Zheno's family if she caused the team to fail, cleared Zhento to compete.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt; Although the team finished second to last, ahead of Japan, they qualified for Rio after being offered a bipartite invitation.&lt;ref name="Doucet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldrowing 13 June"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/rowing-bipartite-invitations-rio-2016-announced|title=Rowing bipartite invitations for Rio 2016 announced|work=paralympic.org|date=9 July 2016|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the team returned home Zhento suffered another seizure, and Davis was forced to find a replacement.&lt;ref name="Doucet"/&gt;  With only a week before a World Cup race in Poland, an event the team had to compete in to show international competition experience, Michelle Garnett, was drafted in.&lt;ref name="Doucet"/&gt;

At the Rio Games, Zimbabwe finished sixth from a field of six in the heats, with a time of 4:08.63. In the Final B, they again finished in last place, but Davis stated that she was satisfied with the teams performance considering the limited time they team had to train together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.co.zw/team-zimbabwe-struggles-at-rio/|title=Team Zimbabwe struggles at Rio  |work=chronicle.co.zw| date=12 September 2016|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team==
===Margret Bangajena=== 
Margret Bangajena (born 14 May 1977) answered the initial call for rowers, and rows in the bow seat. Bangajena had some experience in parasport having raced in wheelchair marathon events.&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.co.zw/2016/09/07/zims-para-rowing-team-defies-odds/|title=Zim’s para-rowing team defies odds|work=newsday.co.zw|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
