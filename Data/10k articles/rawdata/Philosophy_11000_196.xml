'''Advertising in biology''' means the use of [[display (zoology)|displays]] by [[organism]]s such as [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to [[signalling theory|signal]] their presence for some [[evolution]]ary reason.

Such signalling may be honest, used to attract other organisms, as when [[flower]]s use bright colours, patterns, and scent to attract [[pollinator]]s such as [[bee]]s; or, again honestly, to warn off other organisms, as when distasteful animals use [[aposematism|warning coloration]] to prevent attacks from potential predators. Such honest advertising benefits both the sender and the receiver.

Other animals may advertise dishonestly; in [[Batesian mimicry]], edible animals more or less accurately mimic distasteful animals to reduce their own risk of being attacked by predators.

==In plants==

{{further information|flower|entomophily}}

[[Insect-pollinated]] [[flower]]s use bright colours, patterns, rewards of [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], and scent to attract [[pollinator]]s such as [[bee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iolanda, Filella |author2=Primante, Clara |author3=Llusià, Joan |author4=Martín González, Ana M. |author5=Seco, Roger |author6=Farré-Armengol,Gerard |author7=Rodrigo, Anselm |author8=Bosch, Jordi |author9=Peñuelas, Josep |title=Floral advertisement scent in a changing plant-pollinators market |journal=Scientific Reports |year=2013 |volume=3 |page=3434 |doi=10.1038/srep03434|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep03434 |pmid=24305624 |pmc=3852139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also use drugs such as [[caffeine]] to encourage bees to return more often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plants spike nectar with caffeine and give bees a buzz|journal=New Scientist|date=15 October 2015|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28349-plants-spike-nectar-with-caffeine-and-give-bees-a-buzz/|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is influenced by [[sexual selection]]: in [[dioecious]] plants like [[Salix caprea|sallow]], the male flowers are brighter yellow (the colour of their pollen) and have more scent than female flowers. Honey bees are more attracted by the brighter male flowers, but not by their scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dötterl, Stefan |author2=Glück, Ulrike |author3=Jürgens, Andreas |author4=Woodring, Joseph |author5=Aas, Gregor |title=Floral Reward, Advertisement and Attractiveness to Honey Bees in Dioecious ''Salix caprea''|journal=PLOS ONE| year=2014 |volume=9 |issue=3 |page=e93421 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093421 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093421 |pmid=24676333 |pmc=3968154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many flowers that are adapted for pollination by birds produce copious quantities of nectar and advertise this with their red coloration. Insects see red less well than other colours, and the plant needs to devote its energy to attracting birds that can act as pollinators rather than insects that cannot. In fact, the Canary Island [[Endemism|endemic]] ''[[Echium wildpretii]]'' has two subspecies, a red-flowering one on Teneriffe which is mainly pollinated by birds, and a pink-flowered one on Las Palmas which is pollinated by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rodríguez-Gironés, Miguel A. |author2=Santamaría, Luis |year=2004 |title=Why are so many bird flowers red? |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e306 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020350 |pmid=15486585 |pmc=521733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|sexual selection|signalling theory|aposematism}}

Advertising takes a variety of forms in animals.&lt;ref name=Cott&gt;[[Cott, H. B.|Cott, Hugh B]] (1940). ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]''. Methuen. page 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slater1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Peter J. B. |title=Essentials of Animal Behaviour |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEOePcIFW0IC&amp;pg=PA178 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62996-6 |pages=178–181 |chapter=8.5 Advertising displays}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breeding adults often [[display (zoology)|display]] to attract a mate. Breeding males of [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] birds, such as [[peacock]]s, [[Bird-of-paradise|birds of paradise]] and [[bower bird]]s, have elaborate [[plumage]], [[birdsong|song]], and [[ethology|behaviour]]. These evolved through [[sexual selection]] by females.&lt;ref name=Slater1999/&gt; The males use these features alone or in combination to advertise their presence, and, especially but not only in species with [[lek mating]], to [[sexual competition|compete]] with rival males. In a lek, the presence of multiple males advertises and potentially benefits all the males present, so they are both collaborating and competing.&lt;ref name="Brudzynski2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brudzynski, Stefan M. |title=Handbook of Mammalian Vocalization: An Integrative Neuroscience Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TU9wYetjgsC&amp;pg=PA446 |date=8 December 2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-092337-6 |page=446 |quote=An advantage of lek mating is that males pool their advertising and courtship signals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeding males may also advertise [[honest signal|honestly]] to warn rival males of their strength, a classic example being the [[red deer]], where the roaring of a rutting stag reliably signals its size. The honest advertisement benefits both sender and receiver, as neither need become involved in a costly fight to assess their relative strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clutton-Brock |first1=T. H. |last2=Albon |first2=S. D. |title=The Roaring of Red Deer and the Evolution of Honest Advertisement |journal=Behaviour |date=1979 |volume=69 |issue=3/4 |pages=145–170|jstor=4533969 |doi=10.1163/156853979x00449}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the breeding season, frogs congregate at suitable breeding sites and call to advertise their presence, particularly at night. Females can distinguish between the fitness of males based on the characteristics of their voices.&lt;ref name=Dorcas&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dorcas, Michael E.|author2=Gibbons, Whit|title=Frogs: The Animal Answer Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cST6P7aJToYC&amp;pg=PA35 |year=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-9935-5 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Animal behaviour: Truth in advertising|journal=[[The Economist]]|date=18 June 1998|url=http://www.economist.com/node/137078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desert toads emerge from their underground burrows in response to heavy rain. Males emerge first and when one finds a suitable ephemeral pool, its call attracts others and they all congregate there. Males may call in unison in noisy choruses, and breeding is explosive, a mass of males competing for the smaller number of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |page=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colour can be used in advertising. Some butterflies have [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]s on their wings. These make no effort at concealment, but may startle a potential predator into trying elsewhere. The [[western skink]] has a distinctive blue tail. If the skink cannot escape from a predator by concealment or flight, it can afford to lose its tail in order to escape with its life. Similarly, some species of [[grasshopper]] are well-camouflaged when at rest but flash vivid colouration when flying. The grasshopper thus avoids being eaten while the potential predator hunts in vain for the brightly coloured insect it saw.&lt;ref name=Ipsen&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stebbins, Robert Cyril |author2=Ipsen, D.C.|author3=Gillfillan, Gretchen|title=Animal Coloration: Activities on the Evolution of Concealment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0JpRuexSY0C&amp;pg=PA2 |year=2008 |publisher=NSTA Press |isbn=978-1-933531-29-8 |pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acrocephalus schoenobaenus 1 (Marek Szczepanek)-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sedge warbler]] males advertise their fitness by the variety of their [[birdsong|song]] repertoire.]]

Male crickets chirp to attract females, and in some species, their calls can be heard from great distances. However, a certain parasitic fly has taken advantage of this, the female is attracted to a calling male cricket on which it then deposits its developing larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cade, W.H. | year = 1975 | title = Acoustically orienting parasitoids: Fly phonotaxis to cricket song | journal = Science | volume = 190| pages = 1312–1313 | doi=10.1126/science.190.4221.1312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate [[birdsong|song]] is especially well-developed among [[bird]]s, and again sexual selection has driven its evolution. Songbirds such as warblers have an extensive repertoire of songs, sometimes with thousands of phrases. The [[sedge warbler]] assembles an effectively infinite number of songs by assembling phrases in combination. Laboratory experiments by Clive Catchpole demonstrate that female sedge warblers select males with more varied songs, while field observation indicates that such males attract mates before other males.&lt;ref name=Slater1999/&gt;

Breeding females may advertise [[oestrus]] (being "on heat" or "in season", i.e. that they are fertile, [[ovulation|ovulating]] and receptive to breeding) with [[pheromone]]s (scent), courtship behaviour, and visual signals.&lt;ref name="IrwinStoner2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Irwin |first1=Mark D. |last2=Stoner |first2=John B. |last3=Cobaugh |first3=Aaron M. |title=Zookeeping: An Introduction to the Science and Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7TbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2013 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-92532-5 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human females have long been thought to conceal their ovulation, but women's behaviour changes around the time of ovulation with increased sexual motivation, and they are more attracted to men at that time; conversely, men are more attracted to the scent of women around the time of ovulation than in the non-ovulating (luteal) phase of the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarin|first1=Juan J.|last2=Gomez-Piquer|first2=Vanessa|title=Do women have a hidden heat period?|journal=Human Reproduction|date=2002|volume=17|issue=9|pages=2243–2248|doi=10.1093/humrep/17.9.2243|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/9/2243.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distasteful animals use [[aposematism|warning coloration]] (aposematism) to prevent attacks from potential predators.&lt;ref name=Cott/&gt;

Many animals wish to advertise to those of their own species while being camouflaged to avoid [[predation]]. Many deep sea fish do this by way of [[bioluminescence]]. Patterns of [[photophore]]s on their undersides emit light that from below hide their silhouettes and resemble the scintillating lights produced by the ever-moving surface layers of water. At the same time, each species has a distinctive pattern of photophores that enables another member of its species to identify it as a con-specific.&lt;ref name=Bone&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bone, Quentin |author2=Moore, Richard |title=Biology of Fishes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLoqT_xWaqoC&amp;pg=PA328 |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science|isbn=978-0-203-88522-2 |pages=328, 334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4853">'''Aesara of Lucania''' ({{lang-el|Αἰσάρα}} ''Aisara''; 4th or 3rd century BC) was a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] philosopher who wrote ''On Human Nature'', of which a fragment is preserved by [[Stobaeus]].

==Life==
Aesara is known only from a one-page fragment of her philosophical work titled ''On Human Nature'' preserved by [[Stobaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus, i. 49. 27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucania]], where she came from, was an ancient district of southern [[Italy]] and part of [[Magna Graecia]] where many Pythagorean communities existed. It has been conjectured that her name is a variation on the name Aresa, who, according to one minor tradition, was a daughter of [[Pythagoras]] and [[Theano (philosopher)|Theano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plant|2004|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; A male writer from Lucania called Aresas is also mentioned by [[Iamblichus]] in his ''Life of Pythagoras''.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Life of Pythagoras'', 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
''On Human Nature'' is written in the [[Doric Greek|Doric]] prose characteristic of the 3rd century BC or earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waithe|1987|p=72}}; {{Harvnb|Plant|2004|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that doesn't preclude the possibility that it was written later in an archaic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waithe|1987|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the fragment is a [[Neopythagorean]] forgery dating from the [[Roman era]], although this at least implies that there was an earlier Pythagorean called Aesara of Lucania worth imitating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waithe|1987|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the fragment is [[pseudonym]]ous and comes from a textbook produced by one of the dissenting successor schools to [[Archytas of Tarentum]] in Italy in the 4th or 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waithe|1987|pp=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of any strong evidence supporting either hypothesis, there is no reason to suppose that the fragment was not written by a woman philosopher called Aesara in the 4th or 3rd centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waithe|1987|pp=72–73}}; {{Harvnb|Plant|2004|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesara argues that it is by studying our own [[human nature]] (and specifically the human soul) that we can understand the philosophical basis for [[natural law]] and [[morality]]:&lt;ref name="waithe19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waithe|1987|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Human nature seems to me to provide a standard of law and justice both for the home and for the city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aesara divides the soul into three parts: the mind which performs judgement and thought, the spirit which contains courage and strength, and desire which provides love and friendliness:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Being threefold, it is organized in accordance with triple functions: that which effects judgment and thoughtfulness is [the mind], that which effects strength and ability is [high spirit], and that which effects love and kindliness is desire.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These things, being divine, are the rational, mathematical, and functional principles at work in the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waithe|1987|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|Plant|2004|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aesara's theory of natural law concerns three applications of morality, concerning the individual, the family, and social institutions.&lt;ref name="waithe19"/&gt;

The Pythagoreans were notable as a sect for including women in their ranks. This did not necessarily equate to modern ideas of equality; they believed that women were responsible for creating harmony and justice in the home, in the same way that men had the same responsibility towards the state.&lt;ref name="waithe25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waithe|1987|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seen in this context, Aesara's theory of natural law is fundamental to justice and harmony in society as a whole.&lt;ref name="waithe25"/&gt;

==Biography==
MacIntyre was born on 12 January 1929 in [[Glasgow]], to Eneas and Greta (Chalmers) MacIntyre. He was educated at [[Queen Mary, University of London]], and has a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] and from the [[University of Oxford]]. He began his teaching career in 1951 at Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Hauerwas|first=Stanley |title= The Virtues of Alasdair MacIntyre |url= http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/10/004-the-virtues-of-alasdair-macintyre | journal = First Things|accessdate= 16 June 2014|date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the [[University of Leeds]], the [[University of Essex]] and the [[University of Oxford]] in the United Kingdom, before moving to the US in around 1969.  MacIntyre has been something of an intellectual nomad, having taught at many universities in the US. He has held the following positions:
*Professor of History of Ideas, [[Brandeis University]] (1969 or 1970),
* Dean of the College of Arts and Professor of Philosophy, [[Boston University]] (1972),
*[[Henry Luce]] Professor, [[Wellesley College]] (1980),
*W. Alton Jones Professor, [[Vanderbilt University]] (1982),
*Professor of Philosophy, [[University of Notre Dame]] (1985),
*Professor of Philosophy, [[Vanderbilt University]] (1985),
*Visiting scholar, Whitney Humanities Center, [[Yale University]] (1988),
*McMahon-Hank Professor of Philosophy, [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] (1989), and
*Arts &amp; Sciences Professor of Philosophy, [[Duke University]] (1995–1997).
He has also been a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]], and is a former president of the [[American Philosophical Association]].  In 2010, he was awarded the Aquinas Medal by the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]].

From 2000 he was the Rev. John A. O'Brien Senior Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy (emeritus since 2010) at the [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Indiana]], US. He is also professor emerit and emeritus at [[Duke University]]. In April 2005 he was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]], and in July 2010 became senior research fellow at [[London Metropolitan University]]'s Centre for Contemporary Aristotelian Studies in Ethics and Politics. Since his retirement from active teaching in 2010, he remains the senior distinguished research fellow of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture,&lt;ref&gt;http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/people/fellows/research/&lt;/ref&gt; where he retains an office. He continues to make public presentations, including an annual keynote as part of the Center for Ethics and Culture's Fall Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fall Conference | publisher = Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture | url = http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/programs/fall-conference/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been married three times. From 1953 to 1963 he was married to Ann Peri, with whom he had two daughters. From 1963 to 1977 he was married to former teacher and now poet Susan Willans, with whom he had a son and daughter. Since 1977 he has been married to philosopher Lynn Joy, who is also on the philosophy faculty at Notre Dame.

==Philosophical approach==
MacIntyre's approach to moral philosophy has a number of complex strains that inform it. Although his project is largely characterised by an attempt to revive an Aristotelian conception of moral philosophy as sustained by the virtues, he nevertheless describes his own account of this attempt as a "peculiarly modern understanding" of the task.&lt;ref&gt;''After Virtue'', (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 3rd edn, 2007) xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

This "peculiarly modern understanding" largely concerns MacIntyre's approach to moral disputes. Unlike some [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]s who try to generate moral consensus on the basis of an ideal of [[rationality]], MacIntyre presents a historical narration of the development of ethics to illuminate the modern problem of "incommensurable" moral notions—i.e., notions whose value can not be reduced to a common measure. Following [[Hegel]] and [[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]] he offers a "philosophical history" (which he distinguishes from both analytical and phenomenological approaches to philosophy) in which he concedes from the beginning that "there are no neutral standards available by appeal to which any rational agent whatsoever could determine" the conclusions of moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''After Virtue'', 3, xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, one of MacIntyre's major points in his most famous work, ''[[After Virtue]]'', is that the failed attempt by various [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers to furnish a final universal account of moral rationality led to the rejection of moral rationality altogether by subsequent thinkers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Charles Stevenson]]. On MacIntyre's account, it is especially Nietzsche's utter repudiation of the possibility of moral rationality that is the outcome of the Enlightenment's mistaken quest for a final and definitive argument that will settle moral disputes into perpetuity by power of a calculative reason alone and without use of [[teleology]].&lt;ref&gt;''After Virtue'', 257&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, MacIntyre is concerned with reclaiming various forms of moral rationality and argumentation that claim neither ultimate finality nor incorrigible certainty (the mistaken project of the Enlightenment), but nevertheless do not simply bottom out into [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] or [[Emotivism|emotivist]] denials of any moral rationality whatsoever (according to him, the mistaken conclusion of Nietzsche, Sartre, and Stevenson). He does this by returning to the tradition of [[Aristotelian ethics]] with its teleological account of the good and moral persons, which reached a fuller articulation in the medieval writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and which in modern times was first rejected by the Enlightenment. This [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]-[[Thomism|Thomistic]] tradition, he proposes, presents "the best theory so far," both of how things are and how we ought to act.

More generally, according to MacIntyre, it is the case that moral disputes always take place within and between rival traditions of thought that make recourse to a store of ideas, presuppositions, types of arguments and shared understandings and approaches that have been inherited from the past. Thus even though there is no definitive way for one tradition in moral philosophy to vanquish and exclude the possibility of another, nevertheless opposing views can call one another into question by various means including issues of internal coherence, imaginative reconstruction of dilemmas, [[Epistemology|epistemic]] crisis, and fruitfulness.&lt;ref&gt;''After Virtue'', xii–xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major writings==

===''After Virtue'' (1981)===
{{main article|After Virtue}}
Probably his most widely read work, ''After Virtue'' was written when MacIntyre was already in his fifties.  Up until that time, MacIntyre had been a relatively influential [[Analytic philosophy |analytic philosopher]] of a [[Marxism |Marxist]] bent whose inquiries into moral philosophy had been conducted in a "piecemeal way, focusing first on this problem and then on that, in a mode characteristic of much analytic philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;''The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) viii&lt;/ref&gt; However, after reading the works of [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Imre Lakatos]] on [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]], MacIntyre was inspired to change the entire direction of his thought, tearing up the manuscript he had been working on and deciding to view the problems of modern moral and [[political philosophy]] "not from the standpoint of liberal [[modernity]], but instead from the standpoint of… Aristotelian moral and political practice."&lt;ref name= "Tasks_viii"&gt;''The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1'', viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, the task of ''After Virtue'' is to account both for the dysfunctional quality of moral discourse within modern society and rehabilitate what MacIntyre takes to be a forgotten alternative in the teleological rationality of Aristotelian [[virtue ethics]]. MacIntyre's thought is revolutionary as it articulates a politics of self-defence for local communities that aspire to protect their practices and sustain their way of life from corrosive effects of the capitalist [[Market economy |economy]].&lt;ref name= "BlackledgeKnight2011"&gt;{{cite book| first1 =Paul | last1 = Blackledge| first2 =Kelvin | last2 = Knight|title=Virtue and Politics: Alasdair MacIntyre's Revolutionary Aristotelianism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mfpLYgEACAAJ |accessdate= 21 December 2012 |date= 15 June 2011 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |isbn= 978-0-268-02225-9 |page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' (1988)===
{{main article|Whose Justice? Which Rationality?}}

MacIntyre's second major work of his mature period takes up the problem of giving an account of philosophical rationality within the context of his notion of "traditions," which had still remained under-theorized in ''After Virtue''. Specifically, MacIntyre argues that rival and largely incompatible conceptions of justice are the outcome of rival and largely incompatible forms of practical rationality. These competing forms of practical rationality and their attendant ideas of justice are in turn the result of "socially embodied traditions of rational inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;"Précis of Whose Justice? Which Rationality?" in ''MacIntyre Reader'', ed. Kelvin Knight (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1998) 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Although MacIntyre's treatment of traditions is quite complex he does give a relatively concise definition: "A tradition is an argument extended through time in which certain fundamental agreements are defined and redefined" in terms of both internal and external debates.&lt;ref&gt;''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988) 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' is therefore engaged in the task of not only giving the reader examples of what MacIntyre considers actual rival traditions and the different ways they can split apart, integrate, or defeat one another (e.g. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]], [[Thomism|Thomist]], [[David Hume|Humean]]) but also with substantiating how practical rationality and a conception of justice help constitute those traditions. Specifically, according to him, the differing accounts of justice that are presented by Aristotle and Hume are due to the underlying differences in their [[conceptual scheme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = MacIntyre | first1 = A. | title = Précis of Whose Justice?

Which Rationality?'', 361–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacIntyre's account also defends three further theses: first, that all rational human inquiry is conducted whether knowingly or not from within a tradition; second, that the incommensurable conceptual schemes of rival traditions do not entail either [[relativism]] or [[perspectivism]]; third, that although the arguments of the book are themselves attempts at universally valid insights they are nevertheless given from within a particular tradition (that of Thomist Aristotelianism) and that this need not imply any philosophical inconsistency.

===''Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry'' (1990)===

''Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry'' was first presented by MacIntyre as part of the Gifford lecture series at the University of Edinburgh in 1988 and is considered by many the third part in a trilogy of philosophical argumentation that commenced with ''After Virtue''. As its title implies, MacIntyre's aim in this book is to examine three major rival traditions of moral inquiry on the intellectual scene today (encyclopaedic, genealogical and traditional) which each in turn was given defence from a canonical piece published in the late nineteenth century (the Ninth Edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality|Genealogy of Morals]]'' and [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'', respectively). MacIntyre's book ultimately conducts a complex series of both interior and exterior critiques of the encyclopaedic and genealogical positions in an attempt to vindicate philosophical [[Thomism]] as the most persuasive form of moral inquiry currently on offer. His critique in chapter IX of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s genealogical mode as implicitly committed to an emancipatory and continuous notion of self which they cannot account for on their own terms has been of particular influence.

===''Dependent Rational Animals'' (1999)===

While ''After Virtue'' attempted to give an account of the virtues exclusively by recourse to social practices and the understanding of individual selves in light of "quests" and "traditions," ''Dependent Rational Animals'' was a self-conscious effort by MacIntyre to ground virtues in an account of biology. MacIntyre writes the following of this shift in the preface to the book: "Although there is indeed good reason to repudiate important elements in Aristotle's biology, I now judge that I was in error in supposing an ethics independent of biology to be possible."&lt;ref&gt;''Dependent Rational Animals'' (Chicago: Carus Publishing, 1999) x&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, ''Dependent Rational Animals'' tries to make a [[Holism|holistic]] case on the basis of our best current knowledge (as opposed to an ahistorical, foundational claim) that "human vulnerability and disability" are the "central features of human life" and that Thomistic "virtues of dependency" are needed for individual human beings to flourish in their passage from stages of infancy to adulthood and old age.&lt;ref name="Tasks_viii" /&gt; As MacIntyre puts it: &lt;blockquote&gt;
It is most often to others that we owe our survival, let alone our flourishing ... It will be a central thesis of this book that the virtues that we need, if we are to develop from our animal condition into that of independent rational agents, and the virtues that we need, if we are to confront and respond to vulnerability and disability both in ourselves and in others, belong to one and the same set of virtues, the distinctive virtues of dependent rational animals&lt;ref&gt;''Dependent Rational Animals'', 1, 5&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Engaging with scientific texts on human biology as well as works of [[philosophical anthropology]], MacIntyre identifies the human species as existing on a continuous scale of both intelligence and dependency with other animals such as dolphins. One of his main goals is to undermine what he sees as the fiction of the disembodied, independent reasoner who determines ethical and moral questions autonomously and what he calls the "illusion of self-sufficiency" that runs through much of Western ethics culminating in [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Übermensch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dependent Rational Animals'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; In its place he tries to show that our embodied dependencies are a definitive characteristic of our species and reveal the need for certain kinds of virtuous dispositions if we are ever to flourish into independent reasoners capable of weighing the intellectual intricacies of moral philosophy in the first place.

==Virtue ethics==
MacIntyre is a key figure in the recent surge of interest in [[virtue ethics]], which identifies the central question of [[morality]] as having to do with the habits and knowledge concerning how to live a good life. His approach seeks to demonstrate that good [[judgment]] emanates from good [[Moral character|character]]. Being a good person is not about seeking to follow formal rules. In elaborating this approach, MacIntyre understands himself to be reworking the Aristotelian idea of an ethical [[teleology]].

MacIntyre emphasises the importance of moral goods defined in respect to a community engaged in a 'practice'—which he calls 'internal goods' or 'goods of excellence'—rather than focusing on practice-independent [[obligation]] of a moral agent ([[deontological ethics]]) or the [[Consequentialism|consequences]] of a particular act ([[utilitarianism]]). Before its recent resurgence, virtue ethics in European/American academia had been primarily associated with pre-modern philosophers (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas). MacIntyre has argued that [[Aquinas]]' synthesis of Augustinianism with Aristotelianism is more insightful than modern moral theories by focusing upon the telos ('end', or completion) of a social practice and of a human life, within the context of which the morality of acts may be evaluated.  His seminal work in the area of virtue ethics can be found in his 1981 book, ''[[After Virtue]]''.

MacIntyre intends the idea of [[virtue]] to supplement, rather than replace, moral rules. Indeed, he describes certain moral rules as 'exceptionless' or unconditional. MacIntyre considers his work to be outside "virtue ethics" due to his affirmation of virtues as embedded in specific, historically grounded, social practices.&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, [http://www.ucd.ie/news/2009/03FEB09/110309_macintyre.html “On having survived the academic moral philosophy of the twentieth century”], lecture of March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Politically, MacIntyre's ethics informs a defence of the Aristotelian 'goods of excellence' internal to practices against the modern pursuit of 'external goods', such as money, power, and status, that are characteristic of rule-based, [[Utilitarianism |utilitarian]], [[Max Weber |Weberian]] modern institutions. He has been described as a 'revolutionary [[Aristotelianism |Aristotelian]]' because of his attempt to combine historical insights from his [[Marxism |Marxist]] past with those of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] and [[Aristotle]] after his conversion to [[Catholic Church |Catholicism]]. For him, [[Classical liberalism |liberalism]] and [[Postmodernity |postmodern]] [[consumerism]] not only justify capitalism but sustain and inform it over the long term. At the same time, he says, "Marxists have always fallen back into relatively straightforward versions of [[Kantianism]] or utilitarianism"{{cn |date= October 2016}} and criticises Marxism as just another form of radical [[individualism]], saying about Marxists, "as they move towards power they always tend to become Weberians." Informed by this critique, [[Aristotelianism]] loses its sense of [[Elitism |elitist]] complacency; moral excellence ceases to be part of a particular, historical practice in [[ancient Greece]] and becomes a universal quality of those who understand that good judgment emanates from good character. It has been argued that MacIntyre's thought is unable to provide a coherent and effective model for a justifiable and politically stable political order, due to its neglect of [[political theology]].&lt;ref name= "Kozinski2010"&gt;{{cite book | first =Thaddeus J | last = Kozinski |title= The Political Problem of Religious Pluralism: And Why Philosophers Can't Solve It |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7xlnJsF6DScC&amp;pg=PR13 |accessdate= 18 April 2013 |year= 2010 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn= 978-0-7391-4168-7 |page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s/1960s, MacIntyre was a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (leaving in 1956), briefly of the [[Socialist Labour League]], and later of the [[International Socialists (UK) |Socialist Review Group/International Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Sects &amp; New left disillusionment | newspaper = The weekly worker | url = http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/813/sects-and-new-left-disillusionment/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
MacIntyre converted to [[Catholic Church |Roman Catholicism]] in the early 1980s, and now does his work against the background of what he calls an "[[Augustine of Hippo |Augustinian]] [[Thomism |Thomist]] approach to moral philosophy."&lt;ref name= "Solomon"&gt;{{cite web | last = Solomon | first = David |url= http://home.comcast.net/~icuweb/c04309.htm |title= Lecture 9: After Virtue |accessdate= 2007-07-02 |deadurl=yes | work = Twentieth-century ethics | publisher = International Catholic University |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100111063108/http://home.comcast.net/~icuweb/c04309.htm |archivedate= 11 January 2010 |df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Prospect (magazine) |Prospect]]'', MacIntyre explains that his conversion to Catholicism occurred in his fifties as a "result of being convinced of [[Thomism]] while attempting to disabuse his students of its authenticity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Alastair MacIntyre | date = October 2010 | newspaper = Prospect | url = http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/10/alasdair-macintyre-on-money/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in his book ''Whose Justice, Which Rationality?'' there is a section towards the end that is perhaps autobiographical when he explains how one is chosen by a tradition and may reflect his own conversion to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;''Whose Justice, Which Rationality?'' 1988, pp. 393–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel recent developments in the methods of philosophical research, which carry resonances with MacIntyre's take on [[Thomism]] are witnessed with a modern approach to Avicennism (the historical legacies that were built upon the philosophy of [[Avicenna]] or Ibn Sina) as embodied in the works of [[Nader El-Bizri]] in connection with Islam, even though the orientation is phenomenological instead of being analytic, and the focus is on [[ontology]] rather than moral philosophy.

Fuller accounts of MacIntyre's view of the relationship between philosophy and religion in general and Thomism and Catholicism in particular can be found in his essays "Philosophy recalled to its tasks" and "Truth as a good" (both found in the collection ''The Tasks of Philosophy'') as well as in the survey of the Catholic philosophical tradition he gives in ''God, Philosophy and Universities''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006); ''God, Philosophy and Universities'' (Plymouth, UK: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Moiseyevich Piatigorsky''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Моисе́евич Пятиго́рский}}; 30 January 1929, [[Moscow]]{{spaced ndash}}25 October 2009, [[London]]) was a Soviet dissident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chernyaev, Anatoly|title=Continuity and succession in contemporary Russian philosophy|journal=Studies in East European Thought|date=December 2014|volume=66|issue=3|pages=263–276|doi=10.1007/s11212-014-9213-2|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11212-014-9213-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]]n [[Philosophy|philosopher]], scholar of [[South Asia]]n philosophy and culture, historian, philologist, [[Semiotics|semiotician]], writer. Well-versed in the study of language, he knew [[Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Pali]], [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]], German, Russian, French, Italian and English. In an obituary appearing in the English-language newspaper [[The Guardian]], he was cited as "a man who was widely considered to be one of the more significant thinkers of the age and Russia's greatest philosopher."&lt;ref name = Parfitt&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Piatigorsky obituary |last1=Parfitt|first1=Tudor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/05/alexander-piatigorsky-obituary|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2010-01-05|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Russian television stations he was mourned as "the greatest Russian philosopher."&lt;ref name="soasalumni.org"&gt;[http://www.soasalumni.org/Page.aspx?pid=380] School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) Alumni Online Community News.  What's New. "Remembering `the Greatest Russian Philosopher'", December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Piatigorsky was born in Moscow. His father, Moshe, an engineer and lecturer at the Stalin metallurgical college was sent to a weapons production facility in the Urals (city of [[Nizhny Tagil]]) at the outbreak of World War II, where he took up a post as chief engineer in weapons production. Alexander worked in the plant during the war. Being a poor student of mathematics, chemistry and physics, Alexander was expelled from school twice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/time/543196-echo/|title=Интервью / Майя Пешкова|last=Майя|first=Пешкова|website=Эхо Москвы|language=ru|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at this time he learned Latin and some other languages out of sheer curiosity. He was a voracious reader, and read just about everything he could get his hands on.

==Studying and work in USSR==
At Moscow State University he studied philosophy, graduating in 1951. He moved to [[Stalingrad]] where he taught high-school history before returning to Moscow to join the Institute of Oriental Studies as "a specialist in Tamil languages and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] studies."&lt;ref name="Line 2009"&gt;Times on Line, "Alexander Piatigorsky: Russian Emigre, Writer and Philosopher," From the Times, 21 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He compiled the first Russian-Tamil dictionary in 1960. In 1963, influenced by [[Yuri Lotman]] who was working in [[Tartu University]], he was involved with Lotman, [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]] and others, in the establishment of [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School]]. The School developed the theoretical foundations and nomenclature for a new approach in  [[semiotics]] for the study of society, consciousness and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Piatigorsky, Alexander. "A Word About the Philosophy of Vladimir Nabokov", ''Kontinent 4: Contemporary Russian Writers'', ed George Bailey, Avon, New York, New York. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Piatigorsky's friend, poet [[Joseph Brodsky]], was handed down a five-year sentence of internal exile.  The following year, in support of the writers [[Yuli Daniel]] and [[Andrey Sinyavsky]], Piatigorsky with other Russian intellectuals:

{{Quote| "...signed a letter deploring the violation of the writers' human rights, and later took part in the first human rights demonstration in Pushkin Square.  "&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt;}}

His  investigations and theoretical observations of the role played by thinking and philosophy in ancient South Asian culture and society were viewed with suspicion by some as a subtly indirect way of attacking the Soviet system. Knowing themselves to be likely targets of KGB surveillance, he and his fellow Indologists would gather in a room of the [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies]] where they would enter into "fiery debates... in Sanskrit."&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt;  He was expelled from the Oriental Institute in 1968.

Piatigorsky continued to lecture at the University of Moscow. He pursued his Indological investigations, increasingly dealing with Buddhist thought, and continued with more general work on the metatheory of consciousness, psychology, semiotics and philosophy in general, while collaborating with various Russian philosophers and thinkers outside of Indology.  Chief among them was his close friend, philosopher [[Merab Mamardashvili]].  Influenced by German Idealism, Mamardashvili was a Deputy Editor of the leading journal, Voprosy Filosofii ("Problems of Philosophy"), and was also a principal representative of the so-called "Moscow School of Methodology."  Participants in the Moscow School seminars included: [[Alexander Zinoviev]], [[Evald Ilyenkov]], [[Georgy Shchedrovitsky]], [[Boris Grushin]], Lefebvre, and others. The School is believed by some to be the source of the most important developments in philosophy in the post-War period, rivaling anything done in the Western analytical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Zilberman, David. B.''The Moscow School of Methodology'', unfinished unpublished monograph, Boston, 1977, 676 pp. David Zilberman Archive, The Mugar Memorial Library, Boston University, Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt;  The School remains virtually unknown in the West because its members were forced to operate behind the "Iron Curtain" in a context of severely reduced operational visibility and Soviet-style repression. One of his friends was also an indologist and culture theoretician David Zilberman,   who in 1968-1972 was a postgraduate student working under prof. Yuri Levada. Together they used to discuss problems of consciousness development. After they both migrated they kept friendship and continued research co-operation till Zilberman's death in July 1977. Piatigorsky's book" ''Myshlenie i nablyudenie''" (Thinking and Observation), published  in Riga in 2002, was dedicated to David Zilberman and included an explicit confession of Zilberman's influence on the author's thought.

In 1972, Piatigorsky's Buddhist teacher [[Dandaron]] was arrested by Soviet authorities. A number of Dandaron's students were imprisoned.  Dandaron was sent to a Soviet labor camp where he perished in 1974.&lt;ref name = Piatigorsky&gt;Piatigorsky, Alexander. "The Departure of Dandaron," ''Kontinent 3: Contemporary Russian Writers'' ed. George Bailey, New York, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the same period, Mamardashvili and Piatigorsky co-authored: "Symbol and Consciousness: Metaphysical Discussion of Consciousness, Symbolism and Language"  Jerusalem (1982), in Russian.  This  abstract and complex text, combining Western and Eastern terms, is considered by some to be the most significant philosophical work written in the Russian language.&lt;ref name = Parfitt/&gt; The text:

{{Quote| "...explores the theory of consciousness, and is a kind of philosophical conversation between [Mamardashvili and Piatigorsky], from the respective perspectives of Edmund Husserl's Phenomenology and the Buddhist School of Vijnanavada.&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt;}}

Written in the two years before Piatigorsky left the Soviet Union for Britain in 1974, the manuscript was spirited out of the country by the British-Czech social philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]].  It is worth noticing that the text was written in a deteriorating situation of renewed political repression of the Russian intelligentsia by the Soviet state.  The 'tightening of restrictions' followed a brief period of relaxation of Soviet controls on intellectual activity which had taken place from the mid-1960s until the early 1970s.&lt;ref name = Zilberman&gt;Zilberman, David B. "The Post-Sociological Society", ''Studies in Soviet Thought'' 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaving Soviet Union and career at SOAS, University of London==
Departing the Soviet Union in 1974 for Israel, Piatigorsky made his way to Oxford University where he had been invited to give some lectures. But early times in London were severe for his family (at the moment of departure he has some children and pregnant wife). He arrived to London in the summer and had no normal job, he earned only 6.5 pounds a day. He accepted some invitations to lecture, but decided to stay in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/time/543196-echo/|title=Интервью / Майя Пешкова|last=Майя|first=Пешкова|website=Эхо Москвы|language=ru|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Oxford he quickly became acquainted with [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[Leszek Kołakowski]].  He joined the staff of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[The University of London]], as lecturer in 1975 with the commendation of Berlin who at one point is reported to have said: "Piatigorsky is quite simply a genius!"&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soasalumni.org"/&gt; It is remarkable that Piatigorski didn't consider himself a dissident, he left Soviet Union just because he was bored, he felt that something was missing there.

While at SOAS, Piatigorsky wrote numerous journal articles and Introductions and chapters to books in various academic fields.  He wrote several larger scholarly works including: ''The Buddhist Philosophy of Thought'' (1984), ''Mythological Deliberations'' (1993), and ''Who's Afraid of Freemasons?'' (1997). The work on [[Freemasonry]] was a bestselling book on the sociology and philosophy of religious belief.  In 1991, he was made Professor of the Ancient History of South Asia, a position from which he retired in 2001 as Emeritus Professor. 
 
During the final two decades of his life, Piatigorsky wrote a number of philosophical novels in Russian, one of which earned him the Andrei Bely prize in 2000.  His first, ''The Philosophy of a Small Street'', was published in Moscow in 1994.  The book was well-received, further establishing his reputation in Russian intellectual circles, while placing him in the forefront of public consciousness. ''Remember the Strange Person'' (1999) and ''An Ancient Man in the City'' (2001) followed.  As a novelist he joins the select company of those few philosophers who successfully managed to cross over into the world of literature, including [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Umberto Eco]], and [[Alexander Zinoviev]]. He also crossed over successfully into the world of cinema.  He was made the subject of 'Philosopher Escaped' (2005) a documentary film directed by [[Uldis Tirons]] about the life of a philosopher, and he played "the part of an Indian merchant in his friend Otar Iosseliani's film  Hunting Butterflies."&lt;ref name="Line 2009"/&gt;  
   
Piatigorsky disliked traditional academic jargon and for most of his life he upheld the principle that scholars should publish as little as possible on the grounds that publishing interrupts thinking. His lecture style was lively and distinctive: he was able to speak with considerable effect about the most abstruse and difficult concepts.  Pacing back and forth, smoking, when it was still permitted, he sometimes stopped to observe his cigarette as it burned, pausing before making the next point. He was never known to consult notes.  He was married four times and had five children; Galia, Max, Ilya, Veronica and Anna. He died suddenly on 25 October 2009.

== Behavioral ethics in different fields ==

=== Behavioral ethics and education ===
In ethics teaching and research, ethics is arguably the "next big thing" because its �investigation agenda has generated many knowledge on why and how people choose and act when being confronted with ethical subject, which was unknown previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Teaching-Behavioral-Ethics-by-Robert-A.-Prentice.pdf|title = Teaching behavioral ethics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Robert|first = Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics and Rational Actor Model ===
Philosophical views about morality has been supported traditionally by theoretical reasoning and introspection, with at best passing reference to actual human behavior. Models of human morality advanced by behavioral ethics based on the fact that morality is a new and still developing quality of the evolutionary dynamic that leads to our species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/BehavioralEthics.pdf|title = Behavioral Ethics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Herbert|first = Gintis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics Meets Behavioral Law and Economics ===
Clarifying the difference between behavioral law and economics(BEL) and behavioral ethics(BE) is of importance. Compared to BLE, BE has reduced its ability of influencing broad legal academic circles. In addition, unlike BLE, BE was advanced as piece of the management literature, which is less related to legal scholarship than BLE is, and thus less likely to have impact on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Behavioral Ethics Meets Behavioral Law and Economics|ssrn = 2226711|date = 2013-10-03|location = Rochester, NY|first = Yuval|last = Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics and Justice ===
Behavioral ethics researchers have found the relationship between employees' justice perceptions and also, ethical and unethical behavior. In the 1990s, organizational justice became one of the most studied organizational themes. The term organizational justice is created by Greenberg(1987) to involve employee's perception of organizational events, policies, and practices as being fair or not fair. Classic work on distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice has been built. This research has focused on theoretical advance and empirical testing about the formation of justice judgements as well as the result of these justice evaluation. Justice and injustice perception have been related to an extensive variety of employee attitudes and behaviors consisted of trust, satisfaction, turnover and plenty of opposite formal negative behaviors such as theft and unethical behaviors which are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nipc.ir/uploads/m099_12051.pdf|title = Behavioral Ethics in Organizations: A Review|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
There are experiments that can be linked to behavioral ethics. The [[Trolley problem]] and the [[Prisoner's dilemma]] both place individuals in decision-making situations that carry ethical questions. In each, an individual is asked to make a decision that affects another person. In the [[prisoner's dilemma]], the principles of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)]] and [[Cooperation]] come into play, but not all who participate behave in the same manner. In the [[Trolley problem]] an individual has to choose which group of people to save. Both of these experiments shed light on how people behave when confronted with ethical dilemmas.

== The impact of behavioral ethics ==
If firms are able to utilize the principles of behavioral psychology to alter consumer's behavior and thus increase sales and governments can change people's behavior and hence promote policy target using those same principles, then individuals and their employers can apply related principles of behavioral ethics to promote ethical behavior in the company and in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Behavioral Ethics: Can It Help Lawyers (and Others) Be Their Best Selves?|ssrn = 2424249|date = 2014-04-12|location = Rochester, NY|first = Robert A.|last = Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of Unethical behavior in Business ==
According to an article in the Chron.com, examples of unethical behavior in business an environment can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-unethical-behavior-workplace-10092.html|title=Examples of Unethical Behavior in the Workplace|last=|first=|date=January 31, 2018|work=Chron.com|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Deliberate Deception
# Violation of Conscience
# Failure to Honor Commitments
# Unlawful Conduct
# Disregard of Company Policy

These behaviors are mostly based on different rights that we all have in society and therefore have in work environments as well. Usually each company have its own set of policy but there are some common ones as well. 

== Examples of Ethical Behavior in Business Meetings ==
At most business conference, employees are required to report on the progress of their missions. It can lead to an ethical dilemma because they may report their performance better than it is due to external pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Examples of Ethical Behavior in Business Meetings|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-ethical-behavior-business-meetings-21680.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unethical behavior ==
Unethical behavior is an action that falls outside of what is thought morally appropriate for a person, a job or a company. Individuals can act unethically, as can businesses, professionals and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Examples of Unethical Behavior|url = http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-unethical-behavior.html|website = YourDictionary|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical behavior in business ===
Ethics can be defined as going beyond what is legal and doing right things, even no one is paying attention to. So unethical behavior in business is about actions that don't obey the acceptable criterion of business operations, failing to do right things in each condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unethical Behavior in Business: Definition &amp; Examples - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|url = http://study.com/academy/lesson/unethical-behavior-in-business-definition-examples.html|website = Study.com|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="560">'''Catagenesis''' is a somewhat archaic term from [[evolutionary biology]] referring to evolutionary directions that were considered "[[wiktionary:retrogressive|retrogressive]]."  It was a term used in contrast to [[anagenesis]], which in present usage denotes the evolution of a single population into a new form without branching lines of descent.

'''''Caveat emptor''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|k|æ|v|i|æ|t|_|ˈ|ɛ|m|p|t|ɔr}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|k|æ|v|i|ɑː|t}}) is [[Latin]] for "Let the buyer beware"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Caveat%20emptor |title=Caveat emptor - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2008-03-30 |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(from ''caveat'', "may he beware", a [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] form of ''cavēre'', "to beware" + ''ēmptor'', "buyer").  Generally, ''caveat emptor'' is the [[contract law]] [[legal principle|principle]] that controls the sale of [[real property]] after the date of [[Closing (real estate)|closing]], but may also apply to sales of other goods.  The phrase ''caveat emptor'' and its use as a disclaimer of warranties arise from the fact that buyers typically have less information about the good or service they are purchasing, while the seller has more information.  The quality of this situation is known as '[[information asymmetry]]'. Defects in the good or service may be hidden from the buyer, and only known to the seller.

A common way that information asymmetry between seller and buyer has been addressed is through a legally binding [[warranty]], such as a [[Warranty#Satisfaction guarantee|guarantee of satisfaction]].  But without such a safeguard in place the ancient rule applies, and the buyer should beware.

== Explanation ==
Under the [[principle]] of ''caveat emptor'', the [[buyer]] could not recover damages from the [[Sales|seller]] for defects on the [[property]] that rendered the property unfit for ordinary purposes. The only exception was if the seller actively concealed latent defects or otherwise made material misrepresentations amounting to [[fraud]].

Before [[statutory law]], the buyer had no express [[warranty]] ensuring the quality of goods. In the UK, [[common law]] requires that goods must be "fit for the particular purpose" and of "merchantable quality", per Section 15 of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979|Sale of Goods Act]] but this [[implied warranty]] can be difficult to enforce and may not apply to all products.  Hence, buyers are still advised to be cautious.

=== United States ===
[[File:319 Contracting Sq emblem.png|thumb|Motto of the [[319th Air Base Wing#Subordinate organizations|319th Contracting Squadron (319 CONS)]]]]
====Real estate====
The modern trend in the U.S. is that the [[Implied warranty|implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose]] applies in the real-estate context to only the sale of new residential [[House|housing]] by a builder-seller and that the ''caveat emptor'' rule applies to all other real-estate sale situations (e.g. homeowner to buyer).&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Stambovsky v. Ackley]],'' 572 N.Y.S.2d 672 (N.Y. App. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions{{which|date=June 2016}} have provisions similar to this.

====Chattel property====
{{Main|Personal property}}
Under Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], adopted by all U.S. states, the sale of new goods is governed by the "perfect-tender" rule unless the parties to the sale expressly agree in advance to terms equivalent to ''caveat emptor'' (such as describing the goods as sold "as is" and/or "with all faults") or other limitations such as the below-discussed limitations on remedies.  The perfect-tender rule states that if a buyer who inspects new goods with reasonable promptness discovers them to be "nonconforming" (failing to meet the description provided or any other standards reasonably expectable by a buyer in his/her situation) and does not use the goods or take other actions constituting acceptance of them, the buyer may promptly return or refuse to accept ("reject") them and demand that the defect be remedied ("cured").  When goods fitting the same description and expectations are available for sale (''e.g.'', when the vendor has other instances of the same mass-produced merchandise in stock inventory), either the vendor or the buyer may insist on an "even exchange" for other, "conforming" instances of the product.  When conforming goods are not available in stock but are available for the dealer to purchase (usually on the open or "spot" market), the buyer may require that the seller obtain the goods elsewhere, even at a higher price, with the seller having to incur a loss equivalent to the price difference.  If the vendor still does not or cannot provide the goods and the dispute proceeds to litigation (as opposed to renegotiation or settlement), then as in all cases of vendor breaches of contract, the buyer may recover only the damages that s/he would have suffered had s/he taken all feasible steps to minimize ("mitigate") his/her damages suffered.

As a default rule, the perfect-tender rule may be "contracted around" in ways that specify or limit a buyer's remedies (and that accordingly reduce the market price that rational buyers are [[Willingness to pay|willing to pay]] for the goods).  In many cases, the [[vendor]] will not provide a refund but will provide [[Credit (finance)|store credit]]. In the cases of [[Computer software|software]], [[Film|movies]], and other [[copyright]]ed material, many vendors will offer only a direct exchange for another copy of the same title, with the effect that the initial transfer or license of intellectual-property rights is preserved. Most [[Retailing|stores]] require [[proof of purchase]] and impose time limits on exchanges or refunds. Some larger [[chain stores]], such as [[F.Y.E.]], [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], or [[Walmart]], will, however, do exchanges or refunds at any time, with or without proof of purchase, although they usually require a form of picture identification and place per-transaction and/or per-person quantity or dollar limitations on such returns.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, consumer law has moved away from the ''caveat emptor'' model, with laws passed that have enhanced [[consumer rights]] and allow greater leeway to return goods that do not meet legal standards of acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/cgi-bin/bglitem.cgi?file=BADV073-1011.txt |title=Trader's Guide to Civil Law |publisher=Trading Standards |accessdate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211185017/http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/cgi-bin/bglitem.cgi?file=badv073-1011.txt |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer purchases are regulated by the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]], whilst business-to-business purchases are regulated by the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]].

In the UK, consumers have the right to a full refund for faulty goods. However, traditionally, many retailers allow customers to return goods within a specified period (typically two weeks to two months) for a full refund or an exchange, even if there is no fault with the product. Exceptions may apply for goods sold as damaged or to clear.

Goods bought through "distance selling," for example online or by phone, also have a statutory "cooling off" period of fourteen calendar days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/changed-your-mind/changing-your-mind-about-something-youve-bought/|title=Changing your mind about something you've bought|website=citizensadvice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which the purchase contract can be cancelled and treated as if not done.

Although no longer applied in consumer law, the principle of ''caveat emptor'' is generally held to apply to transactions between businesses unless it can be shown that the seller had a clear information advantage over the buyer that could not have been removed by carrying out reasonable [[due diligence]].

==Variations==

=== ''Caveat venditor'' === &lt;!-- Incoming redirect from [[Caveat venditor]] --&gt;
''Caveat venditor'' is [[Latin]] for "let the seller beware." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/caveat-venditor/|title=Caveat Venditor Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the landmark case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' (1916), [[New York Court of Appeals|New York Court Appeals]] Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] established that [[Privity of contract#Third-party rights|privity of duty]] is no longer required in regard to  a lawsuit for [[product liability]] against the seller. This case is widely regarded as the origin of ''caveat venditor'' as it pertains to modern [[tort]] law in US. &lt;ref name="ReiboldtMallers2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reiboldt|first1=Wendy|last2=Mallers|first2=Melanie Horn|title=Consumer Survival: An Encyclopedia of Consumer Rights, Safety, and Protection &amp;#91;2 Volumes&amp;#93;: An Encyclopedia of Consumer Rights, Safety, and Protection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zY6dAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=26 November 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-937-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restat 2d of Torts, § 395:  "In 1916 the leading modern case of MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050, L.R.A. 1916F, 696, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 440, 13 N.C.C.A. 1029 (1916), discarded the general rule of non-liability, by holding that "inherently dangerous" articles included any article which would be dangerous to human safety if negligently made. After the passage of more than forty years, this decision is now all but universally accepted by the American courts."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Caveat lector'' ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
''Caveat lector'' is Latin for "let the reader beware".
One variant of this phrase is "caveat auditor", where the caveat is addressed to any receiver of a given (kind of) message (not necessarily a written one).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35582">{{Community}}
A '''community of practice''' ('''CoP''') is a group of people who share a craft or a profession. The concept was first proposed by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist [[Etienne Wenger]] in their 1991 book ''Situated Learning'' {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book ''Communities of Practice'' {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}.

A CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.

CoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a "virtual community of practice" (VCoP) {{Harv|Dubé|Bourhis|Jacob|2005}} when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards and newsgroups, or a "mobile community of practice" (MCoP) {{Harv|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}} when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.

Communities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [[American pragmatism]], especially [[C. S. Peirce]]'s concept of the "[[community of inquiry]]" {{harv|Shields|2003}}, but also [[John Dewey]]'s principle of learning through occupation {{harv|Wallace|2007}}.

== Overview ==

===Origin and development===
Since the publication of "Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation" {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}, communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See {{Harvtxt|Hildreth|Kimble|2004|}} for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. {{Harvtxt|Cox|2005}} offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.

====Early years====
To understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the [[Institute for Research on Learning]], Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named [[situated learning]].

The structure of the community was created over time through a process of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991|p= 29}}.

Lave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term "community of practice" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.

====Later years====
In his later work, {{Harvtxt|Wenger|1998}} abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a [[Duality (CoPs)|duality]] instead.  He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to [[knowledge management]].

He describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: '[[mutual engagement]]', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' {{Harv|Wenger|1998|pp= 72–73}}.

* Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement.  These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity.
* Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise.  The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community.
* Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.

====Present work====
For [[Etienne Wenger]], [[learning]] is central to human [[identity (social science)|identity]]. A primary focus of Wenger’s more recent work is on learning as social participation – the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}. In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities.

The structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice.

; Domain
:A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions.

; Community
:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning.  A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas.

; Practice
:While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.

In many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure {{Harv|McDermott|Archibald|2010}}. These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity {{Harv|Wenger|2004}}. Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the [[tacit knowledge]], or the know-how that is not so easily articulated.

An important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. {{Harvtxt|Lesser|Storck|2001|p=836}} identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: 
* Decreasing the learning curve of new employees
* Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries
* Reducing rework and preventing "reinvention of the wheel"
* Spawning new ideas for products and services

== Examples ==

The communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.

Lave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucatán midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}} as well as insurance claims processors. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}. Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education {{Harv|Grossman|2001}}, sociolinguistics, material anthropology, [[medical education]], [[second language acquisition]] {{Harv|Kimble|Hildreth|Bourdon|2008}}, Parliamentary Budget Offices {{Harv|Chohan|2013}}, health care and business sectors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Linda C |last2=Grimshaw |first2=Jeremy M |last3=Nielsen |first3=Camilla |last4=Judd |first4=Maria |last5=Coyte |first5=Peter C |last6=Graham |first6=Ian D |title=Use of communities of practice in business and health care sectors: A systematic review |journal=Implementation Science |date=17 May 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and child mental health practice ([[Adolescent Mentalization-Based Integrative Treatment|AMBIT]]).

A famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field {{Harv|Brown|Duguid|2000}}. The Xerox reps began exchanging tips and tricks over informal meetings over breakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million.

===Compared to functional or project teams===
Collaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see {{Harvtxt|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}}.

A [[project team]] differs from a community of practice in several significant ways {{harv|McDermott|1999}}. 
* A [[project team]] is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results.
* A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task.
* A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project.
* A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished.

By contrast,
* A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community.
* Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise.
* A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it.

===Versus communities of interest===
In addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from [[community of interest]] (CoI).

'''Community of interest'''
* A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.
* Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.
* The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.
* Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise – one only needs to be interested in the subject.

'''Community of practice'''
* A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.
* CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.
* The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.
* Membership is dependent on expertise – one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.
* Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoP's structure, non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.

== Benefits ==

===Social capital===
[[Social capital]] is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring [[social capital]] – especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.

=== Knowledge management ===
{{Harvtxt|Wasko|Faraj|2000}} describe three kinds of knowledge: "knowledge as object", "knowledge embedded within individuals", and "knowledge embedded in a community".&lt;ref&gt;Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). ""It is what one does": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155–173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7&lt;/ref&gt; Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit "expertise", or [[tacit knowledge]]. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}, also {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.

Because [[knowledge management]] is seen "primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining" {{Harv|Thomas|Kellogg|Erickson|2001}}, the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, [[best practices]].

Thus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.

== Factors ==

===Individuals===
Members of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job {{Harv|Seely Brown|Duguid|1991}}.

Studies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database)  {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}. Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP.  Members of the community have [[tacit knowledge]], which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside.  For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve.  In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless  {{Harv|Dalkir|2005}}. {{Harvtxt|Duguid|2005}} clarifies the difference between [[tacit knowledge]], or knowing ''how'', and [[explicit knowledge]], or knowing ''what''. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing ''what'' and knowing ''how'' {{Harv|Duguid|2005}}.

As members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}.

====Social presence====
Communicating with others in a community of practice involves creating ''social presence''. {{harvtxt|Tu|2002}} defines social presence as "the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship" (p.&amp;nbsp;38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) {{Harv|Tu|2002}}. Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints {{Harv|Wasko|Faraj|2000}}.

====Motivation====
Motivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}. Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction).

====Collaboration====
Collaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network {{Harv|Sveiby|Simon|2002}}. Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.

== Cultivating successful CoPs ==
{{see also|Motivations for online participation}}

What makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice:

# Design the community to evolve naturally – Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus.
# Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives – While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals.
# Welcome and allow different levels of participation – Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community.
# Develop both public and private community spaces – While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs.
# Focus on the value of the community – CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group.
# Combine familiarity and excitement – CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic.
# Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community – CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}.

'''Daniele Archibugi''' is an Italian economic and political theorist. He works on the economics and policy of [[innovation]] and [[technological change]], on the political theory of [[international relations]] and on political and technological [[globalisation]].

== Biography ==
Archibugi graduated with an [[Economics]] degree at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] "La Sapienza" with [[Federico Caffè]], and obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] degree at [[Science Policy Research Unit|SPRU]] of the [[University of Sussex]] under the mentorship of [[Christopher Freeman]] and [[Keith Pavitt]]. He has worked and taught at the Universities of [[University of Sussex|Sussex]], [[Parthenope University of Naples|Naples]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Sapienza University of Rome]], [[LUISS]] University of Rome, Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto and SWEFE University, Chengdu. He was Leverhulme [[Visiting Professor]] at the [[London School of Economics]], and [[Lauro de Bosis]] Visiting Professor at [[Harvard University]]. In June 2006, Archibugi was appointed [[Honorary Professor]] at the University of Sussex. He currently works at the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|Italian National Research Council]] in Rome and at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].

== Cosmopolitan democracy ==

Together with [[David Held]], Archibugi has been a key figure in the development of [[cosmopolitanism]] and of [[cosmopolitan democracy]] in particular, namely the attempt to apply some of the norms and values of democracy to global politics.&lt;ref&gt;See Tom Cassauwers, [http://www.e-ir.info/2015/09/14/interview-daniele-archibugi/ Interview with Daniele Archibugi], E-INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, SEP 14 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He has advocated substantial reforms in international organizations, including the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;See Allen White, [http://greattransition.org/publication/on-the-cosmopolitan-path On the Cosmopolitan Path, An Interview with Daniele Archibugi], [[Great Transition Initiative]], April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has criticized the G7, G8 and G20 summits as undemocratic and urged for more transparent gathering for global politics.&lt;ref&gt;D. Archibugi, ''The G20 is a luxury we can't afford'', [[The Guardian]], Saturday 28 March 2008 [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/25/g20-unitednations]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also taken position against a [[Concert of democracies|League of Democracies]] arguing that the same demands will be better served by a democratic reform of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;D. Archibugi, ''A League of Democracies or a Democratic United Nations'', [[Harvard International Review]], October 2008 [http://hir.harvard.edu/index.php?page=article&amp;id=1758]&lt;/ref&gt; Archibugi is among the promoters of a directly elected [[World Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly [http://en.unpacampaign.org/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt; and a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allpro&amp;mapgroup=pro|title=Overview|last=|first=|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization of innovation ==

Archibugi developed a taxonomy of the [[globalization]] of technology with [[Jonathan Michie]], where they distinguish among three main devices of transmission of know-how: international exploitation of innovations, global generation of innovation and global collaborations in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi and Jonathan Michie, ''The Globalization of Technology: A New Taxonomy'', "[[Cambridge Journal of Economics]]", vol. 19, no. 1, 1995, pp. 121-140,
[http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/Globalisation_of_techn_and_science/Globalis_techn_taxonomy.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chairman of an Expert Group of the [[European Research Area]] on international collaboration in science and technology, he has pointed out that the demographic decline in Europe, combined with the lack of vocation of youngesters for hard sciences, will generate a dramatic shortage of qualified workers in less than a generation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi (Chair) ''Opening to the World.

[http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/opening.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This will jeopardize the standard of livings of Europeans in key areas such as medical research, information technologies and knowledge intensive industries. Archibugi has urged for substantial revisions to European immigration policy in order to accommodate at least two million qualified students in science, engineering from developing countries in a decade.

'''Dany-Robert Dufour''' (born in 1947) is a French philosopher, professor of  educational sciences at the university Paris-VIII. He teaches regularly abroad, particularly in Latin America.
His main focus is symbolic processes (specially ''désymbolisation'') with relevance to [[language philosophy]], [[political philosophy]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. He is a frequent participant in cooperative artistic activities  with music, literature or theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paideia.paris8.free.fr/spip.php?article39 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060905/http://paideia.paris8.free.fr/spip.php?article39 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mankind - its weakness and greatness ==

In his books a large portion is dedicated to [[neoteny]] and the human physical inability of becoming "full-grown". This has forced humans to invent culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://paideia.paris8.free.fr/spip.php?article310&lt;/ref&gt;
This condition may be weakness as well as greatness of man.
:...we are not finalized to a defined place in the hierarchy of species, because we are born incomplete. Different from animals we do not possess an instinct to make us occupy a particular place ... We are not fixated in a natural state, we participate in another world, that of language, culture, where significations are extremely mobile, subject to fluctuations and manipulations. That is our basic frailness. But this frailness is also the beauty of man. That is what takes him out of the animal kingdom and lets him search his own way. It is basically that way the Renaissance started with [[Pico della Mirandola]]'s ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'': you are not finalized to be here rather than anywhere else, thus you may accomplish your own selves. That is a beautiful mission, because that is the part of liberty which God (if he exists) leaves us. Partly you are formatted, partly it is up to you to create yourselves, for better or worse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article555#nh2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of "The Grand Subject" ==
Culture is created by "intersubjectivity", where an "I" is talking to a "you" about an "it".  The "it" in this conversation between two persons present is a symbolization of something absent. A symbol has thus substituted the leader of the flock seen in other animals growing out of their [[neoteny|neotenia]]n state. This abstract "leader" he calls "The Grand Subject" and has been referred to different symbolic powers throughout the ages: spirits, machinery of gods (like the Olympic gods), the monotheistic almighty God, the Proletariate, the Race and, lately, the neoliberal Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RAI&amp;ID_NUMPUBLIE=RAI_002&amp;ID_ARTICLE=RAI_002_0009 « Portrait du grand Sujet » in ''Raisons politiques'' (Presses de Sc. Po.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deconstruction of (neo)liberal civilisation ==

===Postmodernist change of minds===
In the book ''L'art de réduire les têtes'' ("The Art of Shrinking Heads"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3340688-the-art-of-shrinking-heads&lt;/ref&gt;) Dufour considers the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] change which [[Lyotard]] refers to as "the end of the Grand Narrative".
 
This new aspect suits [[liberalism]] in an excellent way, being more flexible than the old way of thinking to the everchanging circulation of merchandise, he claims.

===A new religion===
In the book ''Le Divin Marché, la révolution culturelle libérale'' ("The Divine Market, the Liberal Cultural Revolution")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallimard.com/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Folio/Folio-essais/Le-Divin-Marche&lt;/ref&gt; Dufour tries to point out that we have come under the grip of a new victorious religion: the Divine Market, functioning on a simple but terribly efficient principle which [[Bernard Mandeville]] described in ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1704: it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress. This "miracle" is produced by "[[divine providence]]", what [[Adam Smith]] was to call "[[The Invisible Hand]]".

Dufour also wants to point out that the liberal project tends to contradict the concept of "school" in Antiquity: Greek σχολή (scholē), Latin [[otium]] = free time, i.e. the time not employed to work or duties. This concept permitted the individual, before entering business life (Latin "neg-otium" = time not free), to create a mastering of mind not to be subject to uncontrolled passions, neither his own nor those of others.

We are thus left to distinguish between two contrary concepts of education: the classical one with self-control and the liberal one  where passions and urges on the loose are permitted. The more this latter educational project triumphs, the more the desymbolized world of drives and urges will protrude, according to Dufour. This world, however, creates a new problem: when no longer control of passions and urges is effected on a symbolic level, it must more and more be effected on a pure corporal level, inwards with pills and outwards with surveillance techniques – something happening not without implications for the function of democracy in liberal societies.

More generally this book describes and analyses – one year before the big [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] – the potentially destructive effects of (neo)liberalism, not only on the market economy, but also and particularly on other fields of human expression such as [[politics]], use of symbols, [[semiotics]], [[psychology]]... And not to disregard what contains everything: how to handle one's own living.

===A world of "self love"===
In ''La cité perverse – libéralisme et pornographie'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-la-cit%C3%A9-perverse-lib%C3%A9ralisme-et-pornographie-de-dany-robert-dufour.html&lt;/ref&gt; 2009 (''Perverted Society - Liberalism and Pornography'') Dufour attempts to display that the economical and financial crisis starting in October 2009 has provided us with at least one advantage: it has revealed the perverted mechanisms regulating the function of today's society.

We live in a world that has made [[selfishness|egoism]] ([[Adam Smith]]'s "self love") its foremost principle. This principle henceforth commands all forms of conduct, whether in the uppermost classes, among juvenile dilinquents or the middle-classes. Destructive for the notions of "being together" or "being your-self" it urges us to live in a perverted society: [[pornography]], selfishness, contestation of every law whatsoever, acceptance of [[social darwinism]]. It makes [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]] a tool and results in our world becoming [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]]-ish. It extolls henceforth the alliance between [[Adam Smith]] and [[Marquis de Sade]]. 
 
Against the old moral order, which summoned everyone to master his passions and urges, Dufour proposes that a new order has substituted the old one and that it is now, on the contrary,  fashionable to display one's passions and urges regardless of any consequences. He analyses today's world as a result of the revolution of western [[metaphysics]] during the century between [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s puritan philosophy and de Sade's porno fixated one (philosophie puritaine – philosophie "putaine").

de Sade had so well demonstrated how a world subject to the principle of absolute egoism would appear that he was to be imprisoned for 27 years and his books to be concealed in the archives of libraries for two centuries. Dufour investigates de Sade's return, first masked, then overtly, during the 20th century and the world which will become the result of this. He also tries to indicate some ways to escape this (a)moral trap.

::These three books might be qualified as a trilogy of criticism of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[anthropology]].

== Reconstruction of a humanistic civilisation ==

===Renaissance 2.0===
''L'individu qui vient … après le libéralisme''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-l-individu-qui-vient-apres-le-liberalisme-de-dany-robert-dufour.html]&lt;/ref&gt; ("The Individual that Appears … after liberalism"), published in 2011, is a new step in Dufour's work. He considers that he has sufficiently [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] the liberal anthropology in his previous works and is now to enter a constructive line of work in his research for new possible [[axiom]]s for a real civilizational policy.

He first states that western civilization, after a century of two forceful turbulences, [[nazism]] and [[stalinism]], now is drawn into today's [[neoliberalism]]. This produces a crisis in a hitherto unseen extension, the nature of which is political, economical, ecological, moral, subjective, esthetical, intellectual …

Dufour, however, sees nothing fatal in this third historical dead end during a century. As a philosopher he considers possibilities to resist this latest [[totalitarianism]] which step by step changes and destroys various expressions of human culture.

Dufour sees no other solution than resuming things where they have been discontinued by this new religion which he in his previous works has called ''le divin Marché'' (The Divine Market). 
Like all religions a promise makes it function: salvation by continual growth of riches – a precipitous fleeing ahead leading to global devastation according to Dufour. To avoid such fate he proposes a return to the heart of civilization in order to find the necessary principles for a re-creation. In his opinion our civilization is in possession of the necessary resources for its [[renaissance]].

For this reason he proposes to map the foundations for that western narrative which has wrecked facing "The Divine Market".
He proposes to go back to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] and  his public  ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'' which has been called the "Manifesto of the Renaissance".

What it is all about is the perspective of a new [[Renaissance]], new dynamics like those during the [[Quattrocento]] when knowledge was attained  how to retrieve the fundaments of Greek civilization and, supported by this, how to overcome the grip of obscure  tenets  dominating general thinking. What Dufour proposes then is to retrieve the civilizational process where it was interrupted in order to obtain the individual who dares to think and act by her/himself while giving the same right to [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]]. An individual cured from that egoism that is at present exalted to general law (Adam Smith's ''self love''). An individual well prepared to meet with any type of flock mentality whether in the form of fanatical mass movements or the present tyranny (without a tyrant) of mass consumption.

===Today's civilization - a madness===
In ''Le délire occidental'' (Occidental Madness),&lt;ref&gt;http://livre.fnac.com/a7551982/Dany-Robert-Dufour-Le-delire-occidental, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Dufour starts from what [[Descartes]] argued in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'': humans make themselves masters and owners of nature. This marks a turn in human progress that has led to the gradual development of thinking in terms of machinery and productivity and the present boost of technology as supreme value.

If this occidental madness today causes problems, it is because it has become worldwide: the neoliberal globalization without limitation exploiting everything, including people and environment. A madness which, like all forms of madness, is doomed to crash against reality. On the one hand because its pretentious omnipotence and illimited arrogance inevitably blocks it: our earth is already forcefully reacting to the ongoing vandalization. On the other hand, because this madness in an obvious way changes the three basic spheres of human life, which are ''work, leisure'' and ''love'', by voiding them of all substance.
*''Work'' is no longer creative, but [[Social alienation|alienating]] and mind-numbing as a result of  a more and more distorted organization of work ([[taylorism]], [[fordism]], [[toyotism]]/[[lean management]]).
*''Leisure'', which once was working on and realisation of oneself ([[otium]]), is now invaded by [[consumerism]].
*As to ''love'', it is profoundly reconfigurated in two ways: partly by transforming sensual [[eroticism]] into pornography, partly by unconditionally promising realisation of all forms of fancy. 
 
This is thoroughly scrutinized in the book. 
Yet, all is not lost: a new reason, free from this madness, is conjured up and the contours of it are sketched up.

====Three madnesses …====
In his book "''La situation désespéré du présent me remplit d'espoir'' (The Present Situation Fills Me with Hope), 2016, Dany-Robert Dufour tries to illustrate how the ''Occidental madness'', founded on the "will to always have more" (what the Greeks called [[pleonexia]], greed), has resulted in nothing but provoking its contrary strife for purity. Which could be transformed into a new madness of "fundamentalist" expression, like for instance [[jihadism]], where the strife for a purity guaranteed by the original union with God, can alter into absolute igominy of spectacular deranged massacres of "infidels". This second madness leads in turn to a third madness, that of "madness of identity" which can cause civil wars in the search for "alien elements" to exterminate.

That is why the present day philosophical question, according to Dany-Robert Dufour, is about how to get out of these impasses.

'''David Jonathan Gross''' ({{IPAc-en|g|r|oʊ|s}}; born February 19, 1941) is an [[United States|American]] [[particle physics|theoretical physicist]] and [[string theory|string theorist]]. Along with [[Frank Wilczek]] and [[David Politzer]], he was awarded the 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their discovery of [[asymptotic freedom]]. David Gross is the Chancellor’s Chair Professor of Theoretical Physics at the [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics]] of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California, Santa Barbara, and was formerly the KITP director and holder of their]] [[Frederick Gluck|Frederick W. Gluck]] Chair in Theoretical Physics . He is also a faculty member in the [[UC Santa Barbara Physics Department]] and is currently affiliated with the [http://www.quantum.chapman.edu Institute for Quantum Studies] at Chapman University in California. He is a foreign member of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Foreign Members---Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences|url = http://english.casad.cas.cn/mem/fm/|website = english.casad.cas.cn|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Gross was born to a Jewish family in [[Washington, D.C.]], in February 1941. His parents were Nora (Faine) and [[Bertram Myron Gross]] (1912–1997). Gross received his [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], in 1962.  He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1966, under the supervision of [[Geoffrey Chew]].&lt;ref name=np&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2004/gross-autobio.html|title=Autobiography|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=23 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He was a [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Junior Fellow]] at [[Harvard University]], and a [[Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics]] at [[Princeton University]] until 1997, when he began serving as Princeton's Thomas Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics Emeritus.  He has received many honors, including a [[MacArthur Foundation]] Fellowship in 1987, the [[Dirac Medal]] in 1988 and the [[Harvey Prize]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=np /&gt;

He has been a central figure in particle physics and string theory. In 1973, Professor Gross, working with his first graduate student, [[Frank Wilczek]], at [[Princeton University]], discovered [[asymptotic freedom]]—the primary feature of non-Abelian gauge theories—led Gross and Wilczek to the formulation of [[quantum chromodynamics]], the theory of the strong nuclear force. Asymptotic freedom is a phenomenon where the nuclear force weakens at short distances, which explains why experiments at very high energy can be understood as if nuclear particles are made of non-interacting quarks. The flip side of asymptotic freedom is that the force between quarks grows stronger as one tries to separate them. Therefore, the closer [[quarks]] are to each other, the less the [[strong interaction]] (or [[color charge]]) is between them; when quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost as free particles. This is the reason why the nucleus of an atom can never be broken into its quark constituents.

QCD completed the Standard Model, which details the three basic forces of particle physics—the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and the strong force. Gross was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, with Politzer and Wilczek, for this discovery. He has also made seminal contributions to the theory of Superstrings, a burgeoning enterprise that brings gravity into the quantum framework. With collaborators he originated the "Heterotic String Theory," the prime candidate for a unified theory of all the forces of nature. He continues to do research in this field at the KITP, a world center of physics.

Gross, with [[Jeffrey A. Harvey]], [[Emil Martinec]], and [[Ryan Rohm]] also formulated the theory of the [[heterotic string]]. The four were whimsically nicknamed the "Princeton String Quartet."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/science/07stri.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;fta=y String Theory, at 20, Explains It All (or Not)]. NY Times (2004-12-07)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Gross was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers | title=Notable Signers | publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] | work=Humanism and Its Aspirations | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krauss, Lawrence Maxwell 2006"&gt;Krauss, Lawrence Maxwell.

In 2015, Gross signed the ''[[Mainau Declaration|Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change]]'' on the final day of the 65th [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]]. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, [[François Hollande]], as part of the successful [[Paris Climate Change Conference|COP21 climate summit]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainaudeclaration.org/|title=Mainau Declaration|website=www.mainaudeclaration.org|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Democratic Party of Guinea-African Democratic Rally''' (''Parti Démocratique de Guinée-Rassemblement Démocratique Africain'') is a [[political party]] in [[Guinea]]. The party was founded as a branch of the [[African Democratic Rally]] (RDA) in June 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas O'Toole, ''Historical Dictionary of Guinea'', 1978, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October 1958 the party severed its links with the RDA, other members of which supported a closer union with [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The party's leader, [[Sékou Touré]], became the country's first president.  Two years later, he declared the PDG to be the sole legal party in the country.  As president of the PDG, Touré was the only candidate for president of the republic, and as such was elected unopposed to four seven-year terms.  Every five years, a single list of PDG candidates was returned to the National Assembly.  After the fall of the Touré regime in 1984, the PDG was dissolved.

In 1992 PDG-RDA was revived under the leadership of [[El Hadj Ismael Mohamed Gassim Gushein]]. In the [[Guinean parliamentary election, 2002|parliamentary election]] held on 30 June 2002, the party won 3.4% of the popular vote and 3 out of 114 seats.&lt;ref name='African Elections Database'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanelections.tripod.com/gn.html |title=Elections in Guinea |accessdate=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''descriptive phenomenological method in psychology'''&lt;ref name="Giorgi2"&gt;Giorgi, Amedeo. (2009). ''The Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology.'' Duquesne University Press: Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wertz, F. J. (2005). Phenomenological research methods for counseling psychology. Journal of Counseling Psychology, 52(2), 167-177.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by the American psychologist [[Amedeo Giorgi]] in the early 1970s. Giorgi based his method on principles laid out by philosophers like [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] as well as what he had learned from his prior professional experience in psychophysics.&lt;ref&gt;http://phenomenologyblog.com/?p=485&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgi was an early pioneer of the [[humanistic psychology]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apadivisions.org/division-32/about/history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the use of [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] in psychology, and qualitative research in psychology, and to this day continues to advocate for the importance of a [[human science]] approach to psychological subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgi, A. (2000). Psychology as a Human Science Revisited. Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 40(3), 56–73. doi:10.1177/0022167800403005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giorgi1"&gt;Giorgi, Amedeo. (1970). ''Psychology as a Human Science.'' New York : Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;  Giorgi has directed over 100 dissertations that have used the Descriptive Phenomenological Method on a wide variety of psychological problems, and he has published over 100 articles on the phenomenological approach to psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipjp.org/index.php/editorialboard/29-amedeo-giorgi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203141411/http://www.ipjp.org/index.php/editorialboard/29-amedeo-giorgi |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical perspective ==
Giorgi promotes [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as a theoretical movement that avoids certain reductionist tendencies sustained by many contemporary approaches to psychological research.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgi, A. (1986). Theoretical justification for the use of descriptions in psychological research. In P. Ashworth, A. Giorgi, &amp; A. de Koning (Eds.), Qualitative research in psychology (pp. 3–22). Pittsburgh, PA: Duquesne University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the phenomenological psychological perspective espoused by Giorgi, researchers are encouraged to "bracket" their own assumptions pertaining to the phenomenon in question by refraining from positing a static sense of objective reality for oneself and the participants whose experiences are being studied. This allows the researchers to attend to the descriptions of the participants without forcing the meaning of the descriptive units into pre-defined categories.

An important aspect of the descriptive phenomenological method in psychology is the way by which it distinguishes itself from those approaches that are strictly interpretive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/Epoche557/applebaum-hermeneutics-in-descriptive-phenomenology?from=ss_embed&lt;/ref&gt; In this, Giorgi closely follows Husserl who proposes that "being given and being interpreted are descriptions of the same situation from two different levels of discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, J. N. (1985). The Possibility of Transcendental Philosophy. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, in the Descriptive Phenomenological Method there are both descriptive and interpretive moments, but the researcher remains careful to attend to each type of act in unique ways. Through a sort of empathic immersion with the subjects and their descriptions, the researchers get a sense of the ways that the experiences given by the participants were actually lived, which is in turn described. During this process, however, theoretical or speculative interpretation should be avoided so as to flesh out the full lived meaning inherent to the descriptions themselves (Giorgi, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;127). Interpretation may then occur to various extents during other phases of the research process, but only as it relates to implications of the results rather than the lived meaning of the participants' experiences.

== Phenomenological intuition ==
The Descriptive Phenomenological Method involves neither deduction nor induction in order to find meaning, but instead asks the researcher to intuit what is essential to the phenomenon being studied.&lt;ref name="phenomenologyblog.com"&gt;http://phenomenologyblog.com/?p=583&lt;/ref&gt; Intuition, in this sense (going along with the philosophy of phenomenology), simply means that an object (or state of affairs, structural whole, proposition etc.) becomes presented to consciousness in a certain mode of givenness. In the context of this research method, therefore, intuition is used in order to get a sense of the lived meaning of each description so as to relate them to what is known about the phenomenon of interest in general&lt;ref name="phenomenologyblog.com"/&gt; These types of generalities are not statistical probabilities nor universally posited, but are dependent upon the lived meaning of the descriptions and the meaning of the phenomenon being studied.

== Data analysis ==
The phenomenological psychological attitude is to be assumed while analyzing the data in order to ensure that "the results reflect a careful description of precisely the features of the experienced phenomenon as they present themselves to the consciousness of the researcher" (Giorgi, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;130–131). In the phenomenological psychological attitude, the psychological acts of the participants are affirmed to be real while the objects at which those acts are directed are reduced to what appears as psychologically relevant to the particular experience being attended to. In this sense, the researcher attends to the phenomenon in its "own appropriate mode of self-givenness, thus [meeting] the demand for scientific objectivity concerning the subjective: the method of phenomenological reduction" (Scanlon, 1977, xiv)&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, J. (1977). Translator’s Introduction. In E. Husserl Phenomenological Psychology(ix–xv) The Hague. Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; With this method, this is done so as to reach a level of understanding that is appropriate for psychologists, while also helping the researcher to reach a sort of empathically sensed intuition of the experiences, in the sense used by [[Eugene Gendlin]] &lt;ref&gt;Gendlin, E.T.(1978).Focusing.(firstedition).NewYork:EverestHouse.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each description given by the participants is first read through in its entirety in order to get a better sense of the whole situation in which the experiences occurred.&lt;ref&gt;http://phenomenologyblog.com/?p=811&lt;/ref&gt; Then each description is attended to individually as the researcher goes through and marks off different units of meaning within the data in order to make the descriptions more manageable. After a single description is broken down into separate units, each unit can then be transformed from the language through which it was given into "psychologically sensitive" meaning units, which is done with the help of imaginative variation. This process is meant to flesh out the horizons of the lived meaning more fully in order to expand the possibilities inherent to the phenomenon being studied. Finally, after all the descriptions have undergone these steps, general psychological structures, in the sense described above, are sought. For Giorgi (2009), "essential psychological structure" refers to: "[A depiction] of the lived experience of a phenomenon, which may include aspects of the description of which the experiencer was unaware. The psychological structure is not a definition. It is meant to depict how certain phenomena that get named are lived, which includes experiential and conscious moments seen from a psychological perspective. A psychological perspective means that the lived meanings are based on an individual but get expressed eidetically, which means that they are general."

The final structure is meant to serve as an ideal representation of the phenomenon being studied, based upon actual instantiations of it within concrete lived experiences. It may be the case that such structures turn up many times again, or their relevance may be limited to the cases studied in a particular study. Either way, they have the potential to reveal a lived understanding of a certain phenomenon without first requiring a certain theoretical framework in order to comprehend it.

{{Buddhism}} 
'''Dharmadhatu''' ([[Sanskrit]]) is the 'dimension', 'realm' or 'sphere' (dhātu) of the [[Dharma]] or [[Two Truths doctrine|Absolute Reality]].

==Definition==
In [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], dharmadhātu ({{lang-bo|chos kyi dbyings}}; {{zh|c=法界}}) means "realm of phenomena", "realm of Truth", and of the [[noumenon]]. It is referred to by several synonymous terms from Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, such as [[Tathata]] (Reality "as-it-is"), [[Shunyata|emptiness]], [[pratitya-samutpada|dependent co-arising]] and [[eternal Buddha]]. It is the "deepest nature, or essence".{{sfn|Chang|1992|p=253}}

Dharmadhātu is the purified mind in its natural state, free of obscurations. It is the essence-quality or nature of mind, the fundamental ground of consciousness of the [[trikaya]], which is accessed via the [[mindstream]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

When the [[buddha-nature]] has been realised, dharmadhātu is also referred to as the [[Dharmakāya]], the ''Body of Dharma Truth''.

It is associated with [[Vairocana]].

==Historical origin==
Kang-nam Oh traces the origin of dharmadhatu to the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. It has been further developed by the [[Huayan school|Hua-yen school]]:

==Understanding in Buddhist tradition==

===Indian Buddhism===

====Śrīmālādevī Sūtra====
The [[Śrīmālādevī Sūtra]] (3rd century CE{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=2}}), also named ''The Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala'', centers on the teaching of the [[tathagatagarbha]] as "ultimate soteriological principle".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=10}} It states that the tathagata-garbha is the "embryo" of the Dharmadhatu and the [[Dharmakaya]]:{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=106}}
{{quote|Lord, the Tathagatagarbha is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. The Tathagatagarbha is not the domain of beings who fall into the belief in a real personality, who adhere to wayward views, whose thoughts are distracted by [[Sunyata|voidness]]. Lord, this Tathagatagarbha is the embryo of the Illustrious Dharmadhatu, the embryo of the [[Dharmakaya]], the embryo of the supramundane ''dharma'', the embryo of the intrinsically pure ''dharma''.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=106}}}}

In the Śrīmālādevī Sūtra, there are two possible states for the Tathagatagarbha:
{{quote|[E]ither covered by [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]], when it is called only "embryo of the Tathagata"; or free from defilements, when the "embryo of the Tathagata" is no more the "embryo" (potentiality) but the [[Tathāgata]] (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;the [[Dharmakaya]])(actuality).{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}}}}

The sutra itself states it this way:
{{quote|This Dharmakaya of the Tathagata when not free from the store of defilement is referred to as the Tathagatagarbha.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=98}}}}

====''Dharmadhātustava''====
The ''Dharmadhātustava'' ("In praise of the Dharmadhatu"), attributed to [[Nāgārjuna]]{{sfn|Nagarjuna|1998}} though questioned, is a treatise on the dharmadhatu. According to the ''Dharmadhātustava'', the dharmadhatu is the ground which makes liberation possible:
{{quote|The dharmadhatu is the ground&lt;br /&gt;
For [[buddhahood]], [[nirvana]], purity, and permanence.{{sfn|Nagarjuna|1998}}{{refn|group=note|In cooperation with the Indian Khenpo, Krishna Pandita, it was translated (from Sanskrit to Tibetan) by Lotsawa Tsultrim Gyalwa. Based on teachings given by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, it has been translated from Tibetan into English by Jim Scott, April 1997, and edited by Ari Goldfield, September 1998.&lt;br&gt;Karl Brunholzl published another translation, with extensive commentaries, ''In Praise of Dharmadhatu'' (2008).}}}}

According to the ''Dharmadhātustava'', the dharmadhatu is seen when the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|afflictions]] are purified:
{{quote|As butter, though inherent in the milk,&lt;br /&gt;
Is mixed with it and hence does not appear,&lt;br /&gt;
Just so the dharmadhatu is not seen&lt;br /&gt;
As long as it is mixed together with afflictions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And just as the inherent butter essence&lt;br /&gt;
When the milk is purified is no more disguised,&lt;br /&gt;
When afflictions have been completely purified,&lt;br /&gt;
The dharmadhatu will be without any stain at all.{{sfn|Nagarjuna|1998}}}}

===Chinese Buddhism===

====Mahaparinirvana Sutra====
In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], the Buddha states of himself that he is the "boundless Dharmadhatu" - the Totality itself.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

====Five Wisdoms====
The Dharmadhatu is comprehended by one of the [[Five Wisdoms]]:
# Dharmadhātu wisdom, 
# Mirror-like wisdom, 
# Equality wisdom, 
# Discriminating wisdom, 
# All-accomplishing wisdom.

====Dzogchen====
In the [[Dzogchen]] text ''Gold refined from ore''{{sfn|Namkhai Norbu and Kennard Lipman (translators)|2001}} the term Dharmadhatu is translated as 'total field of events and meanings' or "field of all events and meanings".{{sfn|Namkhai Norbu and Kennard Lipman (translators)|2001}}

'''Donald M. Berwick''' (born September 9, 1946) is a former Administrator of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS). Prior to his work in the administration, he was President and Chief Executive Officer of the [[Patient safety organization#Institute for Healthcare Improvement|Institute for Healthcare Improvement]]&lt;ref&gt;Galewitz P. [http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2009/July/22/Hospital.aspx "Local hospitals and doctors join forces to improve health care, restrain costs"], ''[[Kaiser Health News]]'', July 22, 2009; accessed July 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a not-for-profit organization. 

On July 7, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Berwick to serve as the Administrator of CMS through a [[recess appointment]]. On December 2, 2011, he resigned because of heavy Republican opposition to his appointment and his potential inability to win a confirmation vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/medicare-administrator-donald-berwick-resigns-in-the-face-of-republican-opposition/2011/11/23/gIQA5S7mpN_story.html "Medicare administrator Donald Berwick resigns in the face of Republican opposition"], Sarah Kliff, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 18, 2013, Berwick declared his candidacy for [[governor of Massachusetts]], but lost the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination to [[Massachusetts Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Martha Coakley]].&lt;ref name="bostonglobe.com"&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/2014/09/09/governor/E05iS1vFgw0XmhBgHSpYoL/story.html "For governor, it’s Coakley vs. Baker"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', September 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Berwick has studied the management of health care systems, with emphasis on using scientific methods and [[evidence-based medicine]] and [[comparative effectiveness research]] to improve the tradeoff among quality, safety, and costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2799075|pmid=22478764|volume=6|title=Rethinking comparative effectiveness research|year=2009|journal=Biotechnol Healthc|pages=35–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Interview with Donald Berwick".

==Biography==
Berwick grew up in [[Moodus, Connecticut]]. His father, Philip, worked as the town's family doctor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/1995-11-08/news/9511080654_1_donald-m-berwick-family-physician-doctor "Obituary: Dr. Philip Berwick"] Derrick Stokes, ''Hartford Courant'', November 8, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Rosalind Fine, was the primary caretaker of Berwick and his two younger brothers until she died from ovarian cancer in 1961.&lt;ref name="The Revolutionary"&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2004/01/04/revolutionary/yCLyCKJ9QPUAIg3y270AEP/story.html "The Revolutionary"] Neil Swidey, ''The Boston Globe'', January 4, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Fine's efforts to promote the construction of a new elementary school in Moodus, the school's library was named after her when it was built.&lt;ref&gt; Jonathan Klate, [http://www.gazettenet.com/home/12625507-95/jonathan-klate-don-berwick-in-governors-race-for-right-reasons-public-service "Don Berwick in governor's race for right reasons: public service"], ''Daily Hampshire Gazette'', July 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berwick said that he was motivated by his Jewish upbringing. “The ethical foundations of Judaism speak to me about being proper stewards of society and the world,” said Berwick. “It affects my views and reminds us all we are in this together and really have to help each other,” he said. “I’m worried about the failure to realize progressive issues I care about: healthcare as a human right, poverty and justice. These issues are under siege in America.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-massachusetts-the-next-jewish-state-1.5318361

Berwick graduated from Nathan Hale-Ray High School and went on to obtain his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Harvard College]], where he graduated ''summa cum laude''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://advancedleadership.harvard.edu/faculty/berwick/ "Donald M. Berwick"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221215927/http://advancedleadership.harvard.edu/faculty/berwick|date=February 21, 2014}} Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative&lt;/ref&gt; While at Harvard, Berwick met his future wife, Ann, in his freshman biology class, where they were lab partners.&lt;ref name="The Revolutionary"/&gt; The couple have four children: Ben, Dan, Jessica, and Becca. Berwick earned both an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] ''cum laude'' from [[Harvard Medical School]] and an [[Master of Public Policy|M.P.P.]] from [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/02/berwick_stresses_health_care_i.html#incart_river "Don Berwick stresses health care in race for Massachusetts governor"], Associated Press, February 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his medical residency in pediatrics at [[Children's Hospital Boston]].

Berwick began his career as a pediatrician at [[Harvard Community Health Plan]]; in 1983 he became the plan's first Vice President of Quality-of-Care Measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Barnaby J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/business/21pyle.html "Thomas Pyle, 67, innovator in 1980s health care plans"]. ''The New York Times''. July 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In that position, Berwick investigated quality control measures in other industries such as aeronautics and manufacturing, in order to consider their application in health care settings.&lt;ref name="The Revolutionary"/&gt; From 1987 to 1991, Berwick was co-founder and Co-Principal Investigator for the National Demonstration Project on Quality Improvement in Health Care, designed to explore opportunities for quality improvement in health care. Based on this work, Berwick left Harvard Community Health Plan in 1989 and co-founded the IHI (Institute for Healthcare Improvement).

Berwick is Clinical Professor of Pediatrics and Health Care Policy in the Department of Pediatrics at the [[Harvard Medical School]] and Professor of Health Policy and Management at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5589633 "Report: hospital medication errors commonplace"]. ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', [[National Public Radio]]. July 28, 2006. Accessed July 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a pediatrician, Adjunct Staff in the Department of Medicine at [[Children's Hospital Boston]], and a Consultant in Pediatrics at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].

Berwick has published over 129 articles in professional journals on health care policy, decision analysis, technology assessment, and health care quality management. He is the co-author of several books, including ''Cholesterol, Children, and Heart Disease: an Analysis of Alternatives'' (1980), ''Curing Health Care'' (1990), and ''New Rules: Regulation, Markets and the Quality of American Health Care'' (1996). In February 2013, he participated as a speaker on [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/voices/ Voices in Leadership], an original [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] webcast series, in a discussion titled, "[https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/voices/events/berwick/ Leadership in the Next Steps on Health Reform]," moderated by Dr. John McDonough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/voices/events/berwick/|title=Leadership in the Next Steps on Health Reform|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004121457/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/voices/events/berwick/|archive-date=2015-10-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination and controversy==
On April 19, 2010, Berwick was nominated to be Administrator of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], which oversees the two federal programs.&lt;ref&gt;White House. [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-nominates-dr-donald-berwick-administrator-centers-medicare-and-medi "President Obama Nominates Dr. Donald Berwick for Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423113324/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-nominates-dr-donald-berwick-administrator-centers-medicare-and-medi |date=April 23, 2010 }}. April 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berwick said, "20 percent to 30 percent of health spending is 'waste' that yields no benefit to patients, and that some of the needless spending is a result of onerous, archaic regulations enforced by his agency."&lt;ref name="Pear" /&gt; Berwick's critics have cited his statements about the need for health care to redistribute resources from the rich to the poor and his favorable statements about the [[National Health Service (England)|British health service]]. They quote Berwick as saying, "The decision is not whether or not we will ration care—the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/medimedia/bh_200906/index.php?startid=35#/40/OnePage "Rethinking Comparative Effectiveness Research"]. Interview with Donald Berwick. ''Biotechnology Healthcare'' June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rethinking Comparative Effectiveness Research|date=June 2009|journal=Biotechnology Healthcare|volume=6|issue=2|pages=35–38|pmc=2799075|postscript=. Interview of Donald Berwick.|pmid=22478764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berwick said Republicans had "distorted" his meaning when he said, "My point is that someone, like your health insurance company, is going to limit what you can get. That's the way it's set up. The government, unlike many private health insurance plans, is working in the daylight. That's a strength."&lt;ref name="Pear"&gt;Robert Pear,[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/health/policy/parting-shot-at-waste-by-key-obama-health-official.html "Health Official Takes Parting Shot at 'Waste{{'"}}]  ''The New York Times'', December 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For political reasons, the Obama administration didn't want Berwick to defend his past statements on the [[National Health Service (England)|British health service]], spending caps and high-technology care.&lt;ref name="Pear"/&gt;

Berwick said, "Any health care funding plan that is just, equitable, civilized and humane must, must redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and the less fortunate. Excellent health care is by definition redistributional."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Domenech]],[http://www.redstate.com/ben_domenech/2010/05/12/obama-nominee-donald-berwick%E2%80%99s-radical-agenda/ "Obama Nominee Donald Berwick's Radical Agenda"], ''[[RedState]]'', {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Tanner, senior fellow of the [[Cato Institute]], said that this would lead to "death panels."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tanner, [http://dailycaller.com/2010/05/27/death-panels-were-an-overblown-claim-until-now {{"'}}Death panels' were an overblown claim – until now"], May 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial wrote that his policy ideas could cut health care costs.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/28/AR2010062804675.html "Donald Berwick, a nominee well-suited to trim the fat on health care"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', June 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives criticized Berwick, based on comments he made about health care being, by definition, redistribution of wealth, rationing care with "our eyes open" and complete lives system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/07/obamas_cynical_recess_appointm.html "Obama's cynical recess appointment of Donald Berwick"], [[Ruth Marcus (journalist)|Ruth Marcus]], ''The Washington Post'', July 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Berwick advocated cutting health costs by adopting some of the approaches of Great Britain's [[National Health Services]] (NHS) and its [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE). NICE evaluates the costs and effectiveness of medical therapy that is covered by the NHS as guidance for local authorities to decide what to cover. [[Mark McClellan]], who served in the Bush administration, also advocated adopting some of NICE's methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/health/03nice.html "The Evidence Gap: British Balance Benefit vs. Cost of Latest Drugs"], Gardiner Harris, ''The New York Times'', December 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative critics claim, "NICE decides which healthcare people will get and which they won't."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Anderson|first=Jeffrey H.|title=Not NICE|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=2010-04-29|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/not-nice| accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Klein in ''[[The American Spectator]]'' dubbed him "Obama's Rationing Man".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Philip.

Senator [[John Kerry]] defended Berwick against "phony assertions" and accused [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] of trying "to crank up the attack machine and make his nomination a distorted referendum on reform".&lt;ref&gt;Milligan S. [http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/05/14/kerry_comes_to_defense_of_nominee_to_run_medicare_medicaid_programs "Kerry comes to defense of nominee to run Medicare, Medicaid programs"], ''The Boston Globe''.

[[American Enterprise Institute]] August 2, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berwick was installed by [[recess appointment]] on July 7, 2010, before confirmation hearings were scheduled by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-controlled Senate committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pear|first=Robert|title=Obama to Bypass Senate to Name Health Official|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 6, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/health/policy/07recess.html |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berwick could thus serve until the summer of 2011 without a Senate approval. The White House had talked up the possibility of a re-nomination through the fall of 2010; on January 26, 2011, the President re-nominated Berwick. On March 4, 2011, 42 U.S. Senators wrote the White House and asked for the nomination to be withdrawn. The signers of the letter were all Republicans.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Work in the UK==
Donald Berwick was the lead author of [http://www.ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Berwick_Report the ''Berwick Report''], a seminal report into patient safety in England, following the [[Stafford Hospital scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/226703/Berwick_Report.pdf Berwick D, Bibby J, Bisognano M, Callaghan I, Dalton D, Dixon-Woods M, et al. A promise to learn – a commitment to act. Improving the Safety of Patients in England: National Advisory Group on the Safety of Patients in England, 2013(August)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Berwick was knighted in 2005 for his work creating new care models in five trusts in the UK’s National Health Service -- acute care hospitals, multi-specialty groups, accident emergency rooms, mental health, and nursing homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.thelancet.com/blog/2018-03-13-single-payer-healthcare-debate-takes-stage-managed-care-0 Single payer healthcare debate takes the stage in managed care], John Otrompke, ''[[The Lancet]]'', 13 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 Massachusetts gubernatorial election==
[[File:DonBerwick RappaportCenter 2014.jpg|thumb|Don Berwick speaking at the [[Rappaport Center for Law and Public Service]], [[Suffolk Law School]] on January 15, 2014]]
{{main|Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2014}}
On June 17, 2013, Berwick announced his run for the Massachusetts Governor's office. Berwick framed himself as progressive on major issues and said it was crucial that Massachusetts continue to focus on health care reform and the well-being of children, topics he has focused on during his career. Berwick, who holds three degrees from Harvard, repeatedly emphasized his experience in helping health organizations deliver better care to consumers, an asset he said he would bring to being the state’s chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joshua Miller|date=June 18, 2013|title=Health leader Donald Berwick starts bid for governor|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/06/17/donald-berwick-former-obama-administration-official-kicks-off-bid-for-governor/BC7WaXd1eojBIgNSlMDX9L/story.html |newspaper=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Berwick's specific goals for the governorship included focusing on [[job creation]] and [[economic development]], instituting [[single-payer healthcare]] in Massachusetts, and ending [[child poverty]] in the state by the year 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's end child poverty|date=March 24, 2014|publisher=Blue Mass Group|url=http://bluemassgroup.com/2014/03/don-berwick-we-can-end-child-poverty/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conviction of former probation commissioner John O'Brien on corruption charges, Berwick added that rooting out corruption would be another priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Joshua|title=Don Berwick pitches liberal agenda to business audience|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/07/28/don-berwick-pitches-liberal-agenda-business-audience/ZXeXrFJT2WeOcHShgac6GL/story.html|newspaper=The Boston Globe|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Berwick was seen as the heir to the Massachusetts trend of electing political outsiders to high offices, like Governor [[Deval Patrick]] and Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]], pundits raised concerns in the Summer of 2014 that Berwick had failed to gain the traction he needed to succeed in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scharfenberg|first1=David|title=Role of political outsider reconsidered|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/01/berwick-struggles-get-traction-role-outsider-reconsidered/7uxxYD8nCLrPEMurdeWBkJ/story.html|newspaper=The Boston Globe|accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he outperformed nearly all projections and pollsters in the Democratic primary with 21% of the vote, which prompted the recognition of him being a "surprise" in the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Godlberg|first1=Cary|title=Surprise in Mass.

Berwick conceded the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination to [[Massachusetts]] [[Attorney General]] [[Martha Coakley]] on September 9, 2014,&lt;ref name="bostonglobe.com"/&gt; who lost to Republican [[Charlie Baker]] at the general election.

'''Emna Belhadj Yahia''' or '''Emna Belhaj Yahia''' ([[Arabic]]: آمنة بلحاج يحي) was born on September 30, 1945 in Tunis. She is a Tunisian teacher, philosopher and writer in French.

== Biography ==
Born on September 30, 1945 in [[Tunis]], from a family of theologians by her mother as well as from a family of wealthy traders by her father.

'''GRANK''', or '''Global Rank''' is a ranking of the rarity of a [[species]], and is a useful tool in determining conservation needs.
Global Ranks are derived from a [[consensus]] of various conservation data centres, natural heritage programmes, scientific experts and [[The Nature Conservancy]].

They are based on the total number of known, extant populations worldwide, and to what degree they are threatened by destruction.  Criteria also include securely protected populations, size of populations, and the ability of the species to persist.

* '''G1 — Extremely rare'''  Usually 5 or fewer occurrences in the overall range or very few remaining individuals; or because of some factor(s) making it especially vulnerable to extinction.
* '''G2 — Very rare'''  Usually between 5 and 20 occurrences in the overall range or with many individuals in fewer occurrences; or because of some factor(s) making it vulnerable to extinction.
* '''G3 — Rare to uncommon'''  Usually between 20 and 100 occurrences; may have fewer occurrences, but with a large number of individuals in some populations; may be susceptible to large-scale disturbances.
* '''G4 — Common'''  Usually more than 100 occurrences; usually not susceptible to immediate threats.
* '''G5 — Very common'''  Demonstrably secure under present conditions.
* '''GH — Historic'''  No records in the past 20 years.
* '''GU — Status uncertain'''  Often because of low search effort or cryptic nature of the species; more data needed.
* '''GX — Globally extinct'''  No recent records despite specific searches.
* '''?'''  Denotes inexact numeric rank (i.e. G4?).
* '''G '''  A "G" (or "T") followed by a blank space means that the conservation data centre has not yet obtained the Global Rank from The Nature Conservancy.
* '''G? — Unranked'''  Or, if following a ranking, rank tentatively assigned (e.g. G3?).
* '''Q'''  Denotes that the taxonomic status of the species, subspecies, or variety is questionable.
* '''T'''  Denotes that the rank applies to a subspecies or variety.

[[Image:Bio-papus-image-1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Papus]]
'''Gérard Anaclet Vincent Encausse''' (July 13, 1865 – 25 October 1916), whose [[esotericism|esoteric]] pseudonym was '''Papus''', was the Spanish-born [[French people|French]] [[physician]], [[hypnotist]], and popularizer of [[occultism]], who founded the modern [[martinism|Martinist Order]].

== Early life ==
{{Martinism}}
Gerard Encausse was born at [[A Coruña]] in Spain on July 13, 1865, of a Spanish mother and a French father, Louis Encausse, a [[chemist]]. His family moved to [[Paris]] when he was four years old, and he received his education there.

As a young man, Encausse spent a great deal of time at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] studying the [[Kabbalah]], occult [[tarot]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[alchemy]], and the writings of [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]]. He joined the French [[Theosophical Society]] shortly after it was founded by [[Madame Blavatsky]] in 1884–1885, but he resigned soon after joining because he disliked the Society's emphasis on Eastern [[occultism]].

==Career==

===Overview===
In 1888, he co-founded his own group, the [[Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix]]. That same year, he and his friend Lucien Chamuel founded the Librarie du Merveilleux and its monthly revue ''L'Initiation'', which remained in publication until 1914.

Encausse was also a member of the [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Light]] and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] temple in Paris, as well as [[Memphis-Misraim]] and probably other esoteric or [[Freemasonry|paramasonic]] organizations, as well as being an author of several occult books. Outside of his paramasonic and Martinist activities he was also a spiritual student of the French spiritualist healer, [[Nizier Anthelme Philippe|Anthelme Nizier Philippe]], "Maître Philippe de Lyon".

Despite his heavy involvement in occultism and occultist groups, Encausse managed to find time to pursue more conventional academic studies at the [[University of Paris]]. He received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1894 upon submitting a dissertation on Philosophical Anatomy. He opened a clinic in the rue Rodin which was quite successful.

Encausse visited Russia three times, in 1901, 1905, and 1906, serving [[Tsar Nicholas II]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]] both as physician and occult consultant. In October 1905, he allegedly conjured up the spirit of Alexander III, the Tsar Nicholas's father, who prophesied that the Tsar would meet his downfall at the hands of revolutionaries. Encausse's followers allege that he informed the Tsar that he would be able to magically avert Alexander's prophesy so long as Encausse was alive; Nicholas kept his hold on the throne of Russia until 141 days after Papus's death.

Although Encausse seems to have served the Tsar and Tsarina in what was essentially the capacity of a mediumistic spiritual advisor, he was later curiously concerned about their heavy reliance on occultism to assist them in deciding questions of government. During their later correspondence, he warned them a number of times against the influence of [[Rasputin]].

===Involvement and influences===
;Levi, Tarot, and the Kabbalah

Encausse's early readings in tarot and the lore of the Kabbalah in translation was inspired by the occult writings of Eliphas Lévi, whose translation of the "Nuctemeron of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]" printed as a supplement to ''Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie'' (1855), provided Encausse with his ''[[nom de plume]].'' "Papus" is the name of a Genius of the First Hour in the Nuctemeron, and is translated in the text as "physician."

;1891 l'Ordre des Supérieurs Inconnus

In 1891, Encausse claimed to have come into the possession of the original papers of Martinez Paschalis, or de Pasqually (c. 1700-1774), and therewith founded an Order of [[Martinism|Martinists]] called l'Ordre des Supérieurs Inconnus. He claimed to have been given authority in the Rite of Saint-Martin by his friend Henri Vicomte de Laage, who claimed that his maternal grandfather had been initiated into the order by Saint-Martin himself, and who had attempted to revive the order in 1887. The Martinist Order was to become a primary focus for Encausse, and continues today as one of his most enduring legacies.

;1893-1895 Bishop of l'Église Gnostique de France

In 1893, Encausse was consecrated a bishop of l'[[Église Gnostique de France]] by [[Jules Doinel]], who had founded this Church as an attempt to revive the [[Cathar]] religion in 1890. In 1895, Doinel abdicated as Primate of the French Gnostic Church, leaving control of the Church to a synod of three of his former bishops, one of whom was Encausse.

;1895 - 1888 The Golden Dawn; Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix

In March 1895, Encausse joined the [[Ahathoor Temple]] of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] in Paris.

Although Encausse claimed as his "spiritual master" the mysterious magician and healer known as "le Maitre Philippe" (Philippe Nizier), his first actual teacher in the intellectual aspects of occultism was the marquis [[Joseph Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre]] (1842 - 1910). Saint-Yves had inherited the papers of one of the great founders of French occultism, [[Antoine Fabre d'Olivet]] (1762 - 1825), and it was probably Saint-Yves who introduced Papus to the marquis [[Stanislas de Guaita]] (1861 - 1897).

In 1888, Encausse, Saint-Yves and de Guaita joined with Joséphin Péladan and [[Oswald Wirth]] to found the [[Rosicrucian]] ''Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix''.

;1901 Questionable Anti-Semitic writings

In October 1901 Encausse collaborated with Jean Carrère in producing a series of articles in the ''[[Echo de Paris]]'' under the pseudonym ''Niet'' ("no" in Russian). In the articles [[Sergei Witte]] and [[Pyotr Rachkovsky]] were attacked, and it was suggested that there was a sinister financial syndicate trying to disrupt the Franco-Russian alliance. Encausse and Carrère predicted that this syndicate was a [[Zionist Occupation Government|Jewish conspiracy]], and the [[anti-Semitic]] nature of these articles, compounded by Encausse's known connection to the Tsar of Russia, may have contributed to the allegation that Papus was the author who forged [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

;1908 - 1913 Encausse, Reuss and paramasonry

Encausse never became a regular [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. Despite this, he organized what was announced as an "International Masonic Conference" in Paris on June 24, 1908, and at this conference he first met [[Theodor Reuss]], and the two men apparently exchanged patents:

Reuss elevated Encausse as X° of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] as well as giving him license to establish a "Supreme Grand Council General of the Unified Rites of Ancient and Primitive Masonry for the Grand Orient of France and its Dependencies at Paris."  For his part, Encausse assisted Reuss in the formation of the O.T.O. [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica|Gnostic Catholic Church]] as a child of l'Église Gnostique de France, thus forming the E.G.C. within the tradition of French neo-gnosticism.

When [[John Yarker]] died in 1913, Encausse was elected as his successor to the office of Grand Hierophant (international head) of the Antient and Primitive Rites of Memphis and Mizraim.

==Death==
When [[World War I]] broke out, Encausse joined the French army medical corps. While working in a military hospital, he contracted tuberculosis and died in [[Paris]] on October 25, 1916, at the age of 51.

'''Habitability''' is the conformance of a [[House|residence]] or [[wikt:abode|abode]] to the implied [[warranty]] of habitability. A residence that complies is said to be '''habitable'''. It is an [[implied warranty]] or contract, meaning it does not have to be an [[express contract]], [[Covenant (law)|covenant]], or [[provision (contracting)|provision]] of a [[contract]].  There was no implied warranty of habitability for tenants at [[common law]] and the [[legal doctrine]] has since developed in many jurisdictions through housing laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landlord-Tenant Law|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/landlord-tenant_law|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duties of the Landlord|url=https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/duties-of-the-landlord|website=LawShelf|publisher=National Paralegal College|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Habitability is synonymous with '''tenantability'''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be habitable, such housing usually:
* must provide shelter, with working locks
* must be heated in the winter months (typically between October 1 and May 31 in the [[Northeastern United States]])&lt;ref&gt;In New York, see N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law § 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* must not be infested with [[vermin]], roaches, termites, or [[mold]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3898/is_200406/ai_n9435714 Mold in condominium: Negligent maintenance: Breach of warranty of habitability: Settlement: Verdict | Law Reporter | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Violation of the warranty of habitability results in [[constructive eviction]], whereby the [[landlord]] or [[wikt:Special:Search/lessor|lessor]] has, in effect, evicted the [[leasehold estate|tenant]] or [[lessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josephson|first1=Richard C.|title=The Implied Warranty of Habitability in Landlord-Tenant Relations|journal=William &amp; Mary Law Review|date=1971|volume=12|issue=3|page=580|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2742&amp;context=wmlr|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenant may remedy the problem,&lt;ref&gt;See N.Y.

'''Hans-Werner Bothe''' (born 23 September 1952 in [[Langelsheim]], near [[Goslar]]) is a German philosopher and neurosurgeon. Bothe is founder of the recent field of research on [[Neurobionics]].

==Life==
Bothe studied [[Philosophy]] and [[Medicine]] from 1973 until 1981 in [[Tübingen]] und [[Mainz]], graduated 1978 in [[Philosophy]] with [[Magister Artium]], later working for three years at the [[Max-Planck-Institute]] for Neurological Research in [[Cologne]]. He received his PhD in 1983 (thesis: ''Artificial Brain Abscess in Cats and Therapy with Antibiotics and Steroids'').

He specialized in [[Neurosurgery]] and completed his residency training at [[Johannes Gutenberg]]-University in [[Mainz]]. After achieving [[habilitation]] in 1991 he taught at [[Hanover]] [[Medical School]] and worked together with Madjid Samii at Nordstadt Hospital in [[Hanover]]. In 1993 he obtained a tenured [[professor]] for Neurosurgery at Westfälische Wilhelms-University in [[Münster]].

Bothe initiated and organized the ''1st International Workshop on Neurobionics'' in 1992 and founded thereby the recent field of research on Neurobionics, which aims at substitution of impaired functions of brain and spinal cord by neurosurgical implantation of microelectronic systems. For that purpose he brought together an international consortium of scientists covering for mathematics, neuroinformatics, biological basic research, microsystems, and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;''Neurobionics - an interdisciplinary approach to substitute impaired functions of the human nervous system, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1993''  {{ISBN|0-444-89958-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Neurobionics picture.jpg|thumb|100px|left]]In 1991 he launched the International Neurobionics Foundation together with Daniel Goeudevert, Madjid Samii, and other representatives of science, industry, and policy. From 1991 until 1995 he managed the foundation as executive director of the board. He developed microelectronic implants to treat blind patients suffering from damaged [[retina]]&lt;ref&gt;''Joined effort SOLARIS: visual prosthesis by selective stimulation of the optic nerve in patients with retinal diseases (1998):'' http://www.ifess.org/ifess98/Abstracts/list169.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (with B.

Bartha, et al.), microelectronic therapy to manage [[urinary incontinence]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sacral neuromodulation for urinary retention (2001):''  http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/reprint/63/3/505&lt;/ref&gt; (with B. von Heyden), and [[paraplegia]]&lt;ref&gt;''Adaptive closed-loop implant for selective repair of bladder, sexual, and bowels function in paraplegic patients (1998)''. In: Brunelli (eds), Proceedings of International symposium on experimental spinal cord repair and regeneration, Studio Progress, Brescia (with J. Holsheimer et al.)&lt;/ref&gt; (with J. Holsheimer).

[[File:Birth Places of Chinese Philosophers.png|350px|thumb|Birth places of notable Chinese philosophers from Hundred Schools of Thought in Zhou Dynasty.]]
The '''Hundred Schools of Thought''' ({{zh|t=諸子百家|p=zhūzǐ bǎijiā}}) were philosophies and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 BC, during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]] of ancient [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112694/Chinese-philosophy#ref171469 "Chinese philosophy"], Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 4/6/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

An era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=91219343 Graham, A.C., ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China'' (Open Court 1993).] {{ISBN|0-8126-9087-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, but it was also known as the Golden Age of [[Chinese philosophy]] because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely. This phenomenon has been called the '''Contention of a Hundred Schools of Thought''' (百家爭鳴/百家争鸣; ''bǎijiā zhēngmíng''; ''pai-chia cheng-ming''; "hundred schools contend"). The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s and [[social consciousness]] up to the present day in East Asian countries and the East Asian diaspora around the world. The [[intellectual]] society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war, and diplomacy.

This period ended with the rise of the imperial [[Qin Dynasty]] and the subsequent [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of dissent]].

==Schools listed in the ''Shiji''==
A traditional source for this period is the ''Shiji'', or ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]]. The autobiographical section of the ''Shiji'', the "Taishigong Zixu" (太史公自序), refers to the schools of thought described below.

===Confucianism===
{{main article|Confucianism}}

Confucianism (儒家; ''Rújiā''; ''Ju-chia''; "School of scholars") is the body of thought that arguably had the most enduring effects on Chinese life. Its written legacy lies in the [[Confucian Classics]], which later became the foundation of traditional society.  [[Confucius]] (551&amp;ndash;479 BC), or Kongzi ("Master Kong"), looked back to the early days of the [[Zhou Dynasty (1122 BC - 256 BC)|Zhou dynasty]] for an ideal socio-political order. He believed that the only effective system of government necessitated prescribed relationships for each individual: "Let the ruler be a ruler and the subject a subject".  Furthermore, he contended that a king must be virtuous in order to rule the state properly. To Confucius, the functions of government and social stratification were facts of life to be sustained by ethical values; thus his ideal human was the [[junzi]], which is translated as "gentleman" or "superior person".

[[Mencius]] (371&amp;ndash;289 BC), or Mengzi, formulated his teachings directly in response to Confucius.

The effect of the combined work of Confucius, the codifier and interpreter of a system of relationships based on ethical behavior, and Mencius, the synthesizer and developer of applied Confucianist thought, was to provide traditional Chinese society with a comprehensive framework by which to order virtually every aspect of life.

There were many accretions to the body of Confucian thought, both immediately and over the millennia, from within and without the Confucian school. Interpretations adapted to contemporary society allowed for flexibility within Confucianism, while the fundamental system of modeled behavior from ancient texts formed its philosophical core.

Diametrically opposed to Mencius, in regards to human nature (性), was the interpretation of [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] (c. 300&amp;ndash;237 BC), another Confucian follower. Xunzi preached that man is not innately good; he asserted that goodness is attainable only through training one's desires and conduct.

===Legalism===
{{main article|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
The School of Law or Legalism (法家; ''Fǎjiā''; ''Fa-chia''; "School of law") doctrine was formulated by [[Li Kui (legalist)|Li Kui]], [[Shang Yang]] (d. 338 BC), [[Han Feizi]] (d. 233 BC), and [[Li Si]] (d. 208 BC), who maintained that human nature was incorrigibly selfish; accordingly, the only way to preserve the social order was to impose discipline from above, and to see to a strict enforcement of laws. The Legalists exalted the state above all, seeking its prosperity and martial prowess over the welfare of the common people.

&lt;!-- This isn't clear: Although it was deemed out of fashion by the first dynasty,--&gt;Legalism greatly influenced the philosophical basis for the imperial form of government.  During the [[Han Dynasty]], the most practical elements of Confucianism and Legalism were taken to form a sort of synthesis, marking the creation of a new form of government that would remain largely intact until the late 19th century.

===Taoism===
{{main article|Taoism}}
Philosophical Taoism or Daoism (道家; ''Dàojiā''; ''Tao-chia''; "School of the Way") developed into the second most significant stream of Chinese thought. Its formulation is often attributed to the legendary sage [[Laozi]] ("Old Master"), who is said to predate Confucius, and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] (369&amp;ndash;286 BC). The focus of Taoism is on the individual within the natural realm rather than the individual within society; accordingly, the goal of life for each individual is seeking to adjust oneself and adapting to the rhythm of the natural (and the supernatural) world, to follow the Way ([[tao]]) of the universe, and to live in harmony. In many ways the opposite of rigid Confucian morality, Taoism was for many of its adherents a complement to their ordered daily lives. A scholar serving as an official would usually follow Confucian teachings, but at leisure or in retirement might seek harmony with nature as a Taoist recluse. Politically, Taoism advocates for rule through inaction, and avoiding excessive interference.

===Mohism===
{{main article|Mohism}}
Mohism or Moism (墨家; ''Mòjiā'';'' Mo-chia''; "School of Mo") was developed by followers of [[Mozi]] (also referred to as Mo Di; 470&amp;ndash;c.391 BC). Though the school did not survive through the [[Qin Dynasty]], Mohism was seen as a major rival of Confucianism in the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought. Its philosophy rested on the idea of impartial care (Chinese: 兼愛; pinyin: Jian Ai; literally: "inclusive love/care"): Mozi believed that "everyone is equal before heaven", and that people should seek to imitate heaven by engaging in the practice of collective love. This is often translated and popularized as "universal love", which is misleading as Mozi believed that the essential problem of human ethics was an excess of partiality in compassion, not a deficit in compassion as such. His aim was to re-evaluate behavior, not emotions or attitudes.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edited by Edward Craig. Routledge Publishing. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; His epistemology can be regarded as primitive materialist [[empiricism]]; he believed that human cognition ought to be based on one's perceptions &amp;ndash; one's sensory experiences, such as sight and hearing &amp;ndash; instead of imagination or internal logic, elements founded on the human capacity for abstraction.

Mozi advocated frugality, condemning the Confucian emphasis on ritual and music, which he denounced as extravagant. He regarded offensive warfare as wasteful and advocated pacifism or at the most, defensive fortification. The achievement of social goals, according to Mozi, necessitated the unity of thought and action.  His political philosophy bears a resemblance to divine-rule monarchy: the population ought always to obey its leaders, as its leaders ought always to follow the will of heaven. Mohism might be argued to have elements of [[meritocracy]]: Mozi contended that rulers should appoint officials by virtue of their ability instead of their family connections. Although popular faith in Mohism had declined by the end of the Qin Dynasty, its views are said to be strongly echoed in Legalist thought.

===School of Yin-yang===
{{main article|School of Yin Yang}}
The School of Naturalists or Yin-yang (陰陽家/阴阳家; ''Yīnyángjiā''; ''Yin-yang-chia''; "School of Yin-Yang") was a philosophy that synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]];  [[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder of this school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth). In its early days, this theory was most strongly associated with the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. In later periods, these [[Epistemology|epistemological]] theories came to hold significance in both philosophy and popular belief.  This school was absorbed into Taoism's alchemic and magical dimensions as well as into the Chinese medical framework. The earliest surviving recordings of this are in the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|Ma Wang Dui]] texts and ''[[Huang Di Nei Jing]]''.

===Logicians===
{{main article|School of Names}}
The School of Names or Logicians (名家; ''Míngjiā''; ''Ming-chia''; "School of names") grew out of Mohism, with a philosophy that focused on [[definition]] and [[logic]]. It is said to have parallels with that of the Ancient Greek [[sophists]] or [[dialectician]]s. The most notable Logician was [[Gongsun Longzi]].

==Schools listed in the ''Hanshu''==
In addition to the above six major philosophies within the Hundred Schools of Thought, the "[[Yiwenzhi]]" of the ''[[Book of Han]]'' adds four more into the Ten Schools (十家; ''Shijia'').

===School of Diplomacy===
{{main article|School of Diplomacy}}
The [[School of Diplomacy]] or School of Vertical and Horizontal [Alliances] (縱橫家/纵横家; ''Zonghengjia'') specialized in diplomatic politics; [[Zhang Yi (strategist)|Zhang Yi]] and [[Su Qin]] were representative thinkers. This school focused on practical matters instead of any moral principle, so it stressed political and diplomatic tactics, and debate and lobbying skill. Scholars from this school were good orators, debaters and tacticians.

===Agriculturalists===
{{main article|Agriculturalism}}
Agriculturalism (農家/农家; ''Nongjia'') was an early [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] social and political philosophy that advocated peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of [[agriculture]], and societies are based upon "people's natural propensity to farm."&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite book|last= Sellmann |first=James Daryl|year=2010 | page= 76|title=Timing and rulership in Master Lü's Spring and Autumn annals|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agriculturalists believed that the ideal government, modeled after the semi-mythical governance of [[Shennong]], is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields, not his leadership.&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last= Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011 | page= 38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the [[division of labour]], arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian [[self sufficiency]]. The Agriculturalists supported the [[price fixing|fixing of prices]], in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;

For example, Mencius once criticized its chief proponent [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]] for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects.  One of Xu's students is quoted as having criticized the duke of [[Teng (state)|Teng]] in a conversation with Mencius by saying:
"A worthy ruler feeds himself by ploughing side by side with the people, and rules while cooking his own meals. Now Teng on the contrary possesses granaries and treasuries, so the ruler is supporting himself by oppressing the people".

===Syncretism===
{{main article|Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)}}
'''Syncretism''', or the '''School of Miscellany''' (雜家/杂家; ''Zajia'') integrated teachings from different schools; for instance, [[Lü Buwei]] found scholars from different schools to write a book called ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' cooperatively. This school tried to integrate the merits of various schools and avoid their perceived flaws. The (c. 330 BC) ''[[Shizi (book)|Shizi]]'' is the earliest textual example of the Syncretic School.

===School of "Minor-talks"===
The '''School of "Minor-talks"''' (小說家/小说家; ''Xiaoshuojia'') was not a unique school of thought.
Indeed, all the thoughts which were discussed by and originated from non-famous people on the street were included in this school. At that time, there were some government officials responsible for collecting ideas from non-famous people on the street and report to their senior. These thoughts formed the origin of this school. This also explains its Chinese name, which literally means "school of minor-talks".

==Unlisted schools==
{{anchor|Yangism|Yang|Bingjia|School of the Military}}
These schools were not listed in the Hanshu but did have substantial influence.

===School of the Military===
Another group is the '''School of the Military''' (兵家; ''Bingjia'') that often studied and discussed about what westerners called [[Philosophy of war]]. Some of them studied warfare and  strategy, others focused on kinds and skills of weapons.; [[Sun Tzu]] and [[Sun Bin]] were influential leaders.Some of their famous works are Sun Tzu's [[The Art of War]] and [[Sun Bin's Art of War]]. Their theories influenced the later China and even the East Asia greatly. They work well in many ways in the modern day.

===Yangism===
'''[[Yangism]]''' was a form of [[ethical egoism]] founded by [[Yang Zhu]].  It was once widespread but fell to obscurity before the Han dynasty.  Due to its stress on [[individualism]], it influenced later generations of [[Taoism|Taoists]].

===School of the Medical Skills===
'''School of the Medical Skills'''(方技家;''Fangjijia'') is a school which studied [[Medicine]] and health. [[Bian Que]] and [[Qibo]] were well-known scholars. Two of the earliest and existing Chinese medical works are [[Huangdi Neijing]] and [[Shanghan Lun]].

==History and origins==
The "[[Yiwenzhi]]" of the ''[[Hanshu]]'' claims that the officials working for the government during the early Zhou Dynasty lost their position when the authority of the Zhou rulers began to break down in the Eastern Zhou period. In this way, the officials spread all over the country and started to teach their own field of knowledge as private teachers. In this way the schools of philosophy were born. In particular, the School of Scholars (i.e. the Confucian School) was born from the officials of the Ministry of Education; the Taoists from the historians; the Yin-yang School from the astronomers; the Legalist School from the Ministry of Justice; the School of Names from the Ministry of Rituals; the Mohist School from the Guardians of the Temple; the School of Diplomacy from the Ministry of Embassies; the School of Miscellany from the government counselors; the School of Agriculture from the Ministry of the Soil and Wheat; the School of Minor Talks from the minor officials. Although the details are unclear, the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]] during the Qin was the end of the period of open discussion.

It should be stressed that only the Ru, or Confucians and the Mohists were actual organized schools of teachers and disciples during this period.  All the other schools were invented later to describe groups of texts that expressed similar ideas.  There was never an organized group of people describing themselves as "Legalists," for example, and the term "Daoist" was only coined in the Eastern Han after having succeeded the Western Han's [[Huang-Lao]] movement.

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''Inevitable discovery''' is a doctrine in the [[United States]] criminal procedure that allows evidence of a [[defendant]]'s guilt that would otherwise be considered inadmissible under the [[exclusionary rule]] to be admitted into evidence in a [[trial]].

The doctrine was adopted first by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'' in 1984.  It holds that evidence obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights is admissible in court if it can be established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that normal [[police investigation]] would have inevitably led to the discovery of the evidence.  The rationale for the rule is that [[police misconduct]] is sufficiently deterred and the interests of society are better served by putting police in the same position that they would have been in without the rights violation, not a worse position.&lt;ref&gt;Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 443–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Burkett Hartle''' (August 20, 1939) is an American [[physicist]]. He has been a professor of physics at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] since 1966, and he is currently a member of the external faculty of the [[Santa Fe Institute]]. Hartle is known for his work in [[general relativity]], [[astrophysics]], and [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].

==Work==
In collaboration with [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and others, Hartle developed an alternative to the standard [[Copenhagen interpretation]], more general and appropriate to [[quantum cosmology]], based on [[consistent histories]].

With Dieter Brill in 1964, he discovered the Brill–Hartle [[Geon (physics)|geon]], an approximate solution realizing [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler]]'s suggestion of a hypothetical phenomenon in which a gravitational wave packet is confined to a compact region of spacetime by the gravitational attraction of its own field energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brill, D. R. |author2=Hartle, J. B. | title= Method of the Self-Consistent Field in General Relativity and its Application to the Gravitational Geon| journal=Phys. Rev. | year=1964 | volume=135 | pages=B271 | doi= 10.1103/PhysRev.135.B271|bibcode = 1964PhRv..135..271B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working at the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1983, he developed the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking wavefunction]] of the Universe in collaboration with [[Stephen Hawking]]. This specific solution to the [[Wheeler–deWitt equation]] is meant to explain the initial conditions of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology.

Hartle is the author of the textbook on general relativity entitled ''Gravity: an Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hartle, James B. | title=Gravity: an Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity | location=San Francisco | publisher=Addison–Wesley | year=2003 | isbn=0-8053-8662-9}},&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jay Newman''' (February 28, 1948 – June 17, 2007) was a [[philosopher]] and Professor at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]].

==Biography==
Newman was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, the son of Lou Newman and his wife, Kitty.  He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1968 before acquiring his [[master's degree]] from [[Brown University]] in 1969 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada, in 1971.

He began teaching at the [[University of Guelph]] in 1971, where he taught until his death.  His fields of study (and his 11 books) included [[philosophy of religion]], philosophy of [[culture]], and the [[ethics]] of [[mass communication]].  He became a Canadian citizen in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rsc-src.ca/civicrm/file?reset=1&amp;id=46&amp;eid=452| title=Jay Newman| publisher=Royal Society of Canada| accessdate=12 April 2012| type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995 he was named a [[Royal Society of Canada|Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rsc-src.ca/en/search-fellows?keywords_44=&amp;first_name=&amp;last_name=newman&amp;display_name=&amp;election_year_21=1995&amp;academy_25=All&amp;division_24=All&amp;discipline_23=All&amp;is_deceased=1&amp;sort_by=last_name&amp;sort_order=ASC| title=Dr. Jay Newman| publisher=Royal Society of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was past president of the Canadian Theological Society.  He received a Distinguished Alumnus Award of Honor from Brooklyn College in 1988 and was recipient of the 2001 University of Guelph's President's Distinguished Professor Award.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', July 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of Guelph has established the Jay Newman Award for Academic Integrity in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ugfa.ca/jaynewmanawardforacademicintegrity.htm| title=Jay Newman Award for Academic Integrity| publisher=University of Guelph Faculty Association| accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Canadian Theological Society inaugurated the Jay Newman Memorial Lecture in the Philosophy of Religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cts-stc.ca/2009/newman_lecture/ "Announcing the Annual Jay Newman Memorial Lecture in the Philosophy of Religion"] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman was a lifelong fan of the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and wrote several articles about [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the [[Savoy Operas]].&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Jay. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vnu22TEu7OIC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=%22Jay+Newman%22+%22Gilbert+and+Sullivan%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sfaEN7Xvfk&amp;sig=dnEHq1m6AwduW5ZP5AYlwn35kK8&amp;hl=en "The Gilbertianism of ''Patience''"] in ''Dalhousie Review'', vol. 65, no. 2 (Summer 1985), pp. 264-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Jay.

"Gilbert and the Utilitarians" in ''The Savoyard'', vol. XVI (September 1977), pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  A lecture about a Gilbert and Sullivan-related topic is given annually in his name, in New York City, by the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themorgan.org/public/program.asp?id=307 "Gilbert and Sullivan: Shining into a New Century with Reflected Light"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17812">'''Land law''' is the form of [[law]] that deals with the [[rights]] to [[usufruct|use]], [[alienation (property law)|alienate]], or [[right to exclude|exclude]] others from [[wikt:land|land]]. In many jurisdictions, these kinds  of [[property]] are referred to as [[real estate]] or [[real property]], as distinct from [[personal property]]. [[Land use]] agreements, including [[renting]], are an important intersection of property and [[contract law]]. [[Encumbrance]] on the land rights of one, such as an [[easement]], may constitute the land rights of another. [[Mineral rights]] and [[water rights]] are closely linked, and often interrelated concepts.

Land rights are such a basic form of law that they develop even where there is no state to enforce them; for example, the [[claim club]]s of the [[American West]] were institutions that arose organically to enforce the system of rules appurtenant to mining. [[Squatting]], the occupation of land without ownership, is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon.

==National sovereignty==
[[Sovereignty]], in [[common law]] jurisdictions, is often referred to as [[absolute title]], [[radical title]], or [[allodial title]].  Nearly all of these jurisdictions have a system of [[land registration]], to record [[fee simple]] interests, and a [[land claim]] process to resolve disputes.

==Land rights==

[[Indigenous land rights]] are recognized by [[international law]], as well as the national legal systems of common law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries. In common law jurisdictions, the land rights of [[indigenous peoples]] are referred to as [[aboriginal title]]. In [[customary law]] jurisdictions, [[customary land]] is the predominant form of land ownership.

[[Land reform]] refers to government policies that take and/or redistribute land, such as a [[land grant]].

Land rights refer to the inalienable ability of individuals to freely obtain, use, and possess land at their discretion, as long as their activities on the land do not impede on other individuals’ rights.&lt;ref name="Adi, D.N. 2009"&gt;Adi, D.N. (2009). Critical Mass Representation in Uganda. 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to be confused with access to land, which allows individuals the use of land in an economic sense (i.e. farming). Instead, land rights address the ownership of land which provides security and increases [[Capability approach|human capabilities]]. When a person only has access to land, they are in constant threat of expulsion depending on the choices of the land owner, which limits financial stability.&lt;ref name="Adi, D.N. 2009" /&gt;

Land rights are an integral part of Land Laws, as they socially enforce groups of individuals’ rights to own land in concurrence with the land laws of a nation. Land Law addresses the legal mandates set forth by a country in regards to land ownership, while land rights refer to the social acceptance of land ownership. [[Landesa]] takes the stance that although the law may advocate for equal access to land, land rights in certain countries and cultures may hinder a group’s right to actually own land.&lt;ref&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Landesa.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws are important, but they must be backed up by cultural tradition and social acceptance. Therefore, laws concerning land ownership and land rights of a country must be in agreement.

Globally, there has been an increased focus on land rights, as they are so pertinent to various aspects of development. According to Wickeri and Kalhan, land ownership can be a critical source of capital, financial security, food, water, shelter, and resources.&lt;ref name=Wickeri-Kalhan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wickeri |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Kalhan |first2=Anil |title=Land Rights Issues in International Human Rights Law |journal=Malaysian Journal on Human Rights |date=2010 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |ssrn=1921447}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Global Land Tool organisation has found that rural landlessness is a strong predictor of poverty and hunger,&lt;ref&gt;Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (2009), Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons, 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and negatively impacts [[Empowerment]] and the realisation of [[Human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Global Land Tool Network (2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2798&amp;catid=283&amp;typeid=24&amp;subMenuId=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111152637/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2798&amp;catid=283&amp;typeid=24&amp;subMenuId=0 |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to home in on this critical problem of inadequate land rights, The [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal 7D]] strives to improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Development Goal Monitor: Tracking the Mellennium Development Goals. (2010) http://www.mdgmonitor.org/goal7.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; This includes increased land rights for impoverished people, which will ultimately lead to a higher quality of life.&lt;ref name=Wickeri-Kalhan /&gt;

Although land rights are fundamental in achieving higher standards of living, certain groups of individuals are consistently left out of land ownership provisions. The law may provide access to land, however, cultural barriers and [[poverty trap]]s limit minority groups’ ability to own land.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010"&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Rural Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach equality, these groups must obtain adequate land rights that are both socially and legally recognised.

==Land rights and women==
Several scholars argue that women’s lack of sufficient land rights negatively affects their immediate families and the larger community, as well.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1988"&gt;Agarwal, B. (1988). “Who Sows? Who Reaps? Women and Land Rights in India” Journal of Peasant Studies. 531-581.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994"&gt;Agarwal, B. (1994). “A Field of One’s Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia”. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With land ownership, women can develop an income and allocate this income more fairly within the household.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005"&gt;Agarwal, B. (2005). “Marital Violence, Human Development, and Women’s Property Status in India” World Development. 823-850.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deere, C.D. 2006"&gt;Deere, C.D., &amp; Doss, C. R. (2006). “Gender and the Distribution of Wealth in Developing Countries. World Institute for Development Economics Research, 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Hanstad]] claims that providing sufficient land rights for women is beneficial because, once women can exercise those rights the following will be promoted:&lt;ref&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Rural Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women will be less likely to contract and spread [[HIV/AIDS]] as they do not have to resort to prostitution
* Women will be less likely to be victims of [[Domestic violence]]
* Their children will be more likely to get an education and stay in school longer
* Women will be better positioned to get access to [[Microcredit]]

In many parts of the world, women have access to land in order to farm and cultivate the land; however, there are traditions and cultural norms which bar women from inheriting or purchasing land.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deere, C.D. 2006" /&gt; This puts women in a place of dependence on their husbands, brothers, or fathers for their livelihood and shelter.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Should there be an illness, domestic violence, or death in the family, women would be left landless and unable to either grow crops for food, or rent land for profit. Land ownership for women is a crucial form of security and income, increasing [[Empowerment]] and decreasing [[Poverty]].

===India===
Kanakalatha Mukund makes the important point that although women in [[India]] have the legal right to own land, very few actually do as a result of the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] practices which dominate the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Mukund, K. (1999). “Women's Property Rights in South India: A Review”. Economic and Political Weekly.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until recently, Indian women have been left out of laws regarding the distribution of public land and were forced to rely on the small possibility of obtaining private land from their families.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; [[Inheritance]] laws which cater towards men are one of the key issues behind inequality in land rights. According to [[Bina Agarwal]], land ownership defines social status and political power in the household and in the village, shaping relationships and creating family dynamics.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Therefore, inheritance of land automatically puts men above women both in the household, and in the community. Without political pull in the village, and with limited bargaining powers within the household, women lack the voice to advocate for their own rights.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt;

Another issue with land rights in India is that they leave women completely dependent on the lives of their husbands. A study by Bina Agarwal found that in [[West Bengal]], prosperous families turn destitute when the male head of the household dies, as women are not permitted to take over their husband’s land.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Also, due to cultural tradition, the higher the status of the woman, the less likely she is to have any developed skills that would be useful in finding work.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; These women are forced to beg for food and shelter once their husbands die because they have not been allowed to gain work experience.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt;

Bina Agarwal argues that land ownership significantly decreases the chance of domestic violence against Indian women.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt; Owning property elevates women to a higher status within the household, allowing more equality and bargaining power. In addition, owning property separately from their husbands allowed women an opportunity of escape from [[Relational aggression|abusive relationships]].&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt; Agarwal concluded that the prospect of a safe shelter outside of the main household decreases the longevity of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt;

Land rights are critical for women in India due to the heavily patriarchal society in which they live. Cultural perspectives play a key role in the acceptance of equality within land ownership. Women owning land ultimately benefits the household and society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1988" /&gt;

The most recent advance towards equality in land rights in India was the [[Hindu Succession Act, 1956|Hindu Succession Act of 2005]]. This act aimed to remove the gender discrimination which was present in the [[Hindu Succession Act, 1956]]. In the new amendment, daughters and sons have equal rights to obtain land from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Succession Act 2005. September 5, 2005. http://www.hrln.org/admin/issue/subpdf/HSA_Amendment_2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This act was both a legally and socially important move for women’s rights to land ownership. Not only did it legally mandate equality in land succession, it also validated women’s roles as equals in society.

===Uganda===
[[Constitution of Uganda|Uganda’s 1995 Constitution]] enforces equality between men and women, including the acquisition and ownership of land.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Uganda. (1995). http://www.ugandaonlinelawlibrary.com/files/constitution/constitution_1995.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, research from Women’s Land Link Africa reveals that women remain excluded from land ownership due to customs and deeply ingrained cultural habits.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010"&gt;Women’s Land Link Africa. (2010). “The Impact of National Land Policy and Land Reform On Women in Uganda”. WLLA. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when women save up enough money to purchase land, the land is signed in their husband’s name, while women sign as the witness.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; [[Inheritance]] practices are a particular obstacle which reduces [[Empowerment|women empowerment]], as well. Land is passed down through male lineage which reinforces women’s exclusion from land ownership.&lt;ref name="cohre.org"&gt;Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions. (2010). “Uganda-Women’s Land Rights: The Gap Between Policy and Practice”. {{cite web |url=http://www.cohre.org/news/press-releases/uganda-women-s-land-rights-the-gap-between-policy-and-practice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124010924/http://www.cohre.org/news/press-releases/uganda-women-s-land-rights-the-gap-between-policy-and-practice |archivedate=2011-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another detriment to equality, pointed out by Women’s Land Link Africa, is that women lack sufficient knowledge about the rights they have under the law to own land.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; Rural, illiterate women do not even have access to the new constitution which guarantees them land rights.

Although the 1995 Constitution provides for equality between men and women, there are still gaps in the law which affect women’s rights to land. The law protects the rights to land of wives in marriage; however, it does not address the needs of widows or divorcees.&lt;ref name="cohre.org" /&gt; Consequentially, these women are left landless and without the protection land offers. Also, women have a difficult time taking cases to court due to corruption and expensive trials.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; The trials concerning land take so long to process that many women do not even attempt to seek legal assistance.

Women’s Land Link Africa provides suggestions to alleviate inequality in land ownership. Rural women can be educated about their rights through radio campaigns, community discussions, educational outreach programs, and public forums.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; The cultural nuances must be addressed in policies and community leaders can be educated about inclusion of minority groups.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; Also, the law itself can address the rights of widows and divorcees in addition to the rights of married women.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt;

'''Magdalena Środa''' (née Magdalena Ciupak, b. January 7, 1957 in [[Warsaw]]) is a Polish philosopher, professor of ethics at the [[University of Warsaw]], and a feminist author. She is also a [[columnist]] for the "[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]". She was government's Plenipotentiary for the Equal Status of Women and Men in the [[Second Cabinet of Marek Belka|cabinet of Marek Belka]] between August 16, 2004 and November 4, 2005.

In 1980s Magdalena Środa was active in [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarność]] movement. After 1989 she would not be involved in politics until 2004, when she was appointed by PM [[Marek Belka]] as the government's Plenipotentiary for the Equal Status of Women and Men. She has been advocating the separation of State and Church, [[LGBT rights]], and more liberal abortion law. She is also known for her consistently anti-war stance on foreign policy.

In December 2004 there was a controversy over Środa's statement during an international conference on [[honour killing]]s in [[Stockholm]]. When asked about the situation in Poland, she told [[Reuters]]: "Catholicism does not directly support or oppose violence against women. But there are indirect links through culture which is strongly based on religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Graczyk | first =Roman | publication-date =2004-12-27 | title =Amok polski | periodical =[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] | url =http://wyborcza.pl/1,75515,2466553.html | accessdate =2009-05-23 | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; These words were widely quoted in Polish media and sparked a public discussion about violence against women.

Another controversy blew up in March 2008 when Środa spoke publicly against the idea of protective measures for pregnant women in labour relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Środa | first =Magdalena | publication-date =2008-03-10 | title =Kobieta - gorsza płeć? | periodical =[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] | url =http://szukaj.wyborcza.pl/archiwum/1,0,5052376.html?kdl=20080310GW&amp;wyr=Magdalena%2B%25A6roda%2B%2B%2B | accessdate =2009-05-23 | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; When criticised by parts of feminist movement for neglecting issues of social and economic justice, she responded: "either we do fight for serious treatment on labour markets or for the role of a holy cow because of an inseminated egg".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first =Magdalena | last =Środa | title =Nie wszystkie feministki muszą być socjalistkami ekonomicznymi | url =http://www.feminoteka.pl/readarticle.php?article_id=420 | publisher =Feminoteka.pl | language =Polish | date =2008-03-11 | accessdate =2009-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Profesor Magdalena Sroda.jpg|thumb|left|Magdalena Środa at [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]]]]
Her academic research is focused on questions of individualism and its different critiques (from postmodern, feminist and communitarian positions) as well as on the ethics and politics of gender relations.

The term {{nihongo|'''makyō'''|魔境|makyō}} is a [[Zen]] term that means “ghost cave” or “devil’s cave.” It is a figurative reference to the kind of self-delusion that results from clinging to an experience and making a conceptual “nest” out of it for oneself. Makyō is essentially synonymous with illusion, but especially in reference to experiences that can occur within meditation practice.

In Philip Kapleau's ''The Three Pillars of Zen'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Kapleau|first = Philip|authorlink = Philip Kapleau|title = The Three Pillars of Zen| year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hakuun Yasutani]] explained the term as the combination of '''''ma''''' meaning devil and '''''kyo''''' meaning the objective world. This character for “devil” can also refer to [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], the Buddhist “tempter” figure; and the character ''kyo'' can mean simply region, condition or place. Makyō refers to the hallucinations and perceptual distortions that can arise during the course of meditation and can be mistaken by the practitioner as "seeing the true nature" or [[kenshō]]. [[Zen master]]s warn their meditating students to ignore sensory distortions. These can occur in the form of visions and perceptual distortions, but they can also be experiences of blank, trance-like absorption states. In the Zen school, it is understood that neither category of experience – however fascinating they may be – is a true and final enlightenment.

Contemplative literature contains numerous descriptions of the perceptual distortion produced by meditation. It is characterized in some schools as "going to the movies," a sign of spiritual intensity but a phenomenon that is considered distinctly inferior to the clear insight of settled practice. In some [[Hindu]] schools it is regarded as a product of the ''sukshma sharira'', or "experience body," in its unstable state, and in that respect is seen to be another form of [[maya (illusion)|maya]], which is the illusory nature of the world as apprehended by ordinary consciousness.[&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael Murphy|author2=Steven Donovan|title=The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation, Chapter 4:  Subjective Reports|url=http://noetic.org/research/medbiblio/ch4.htm|website=Institute of Noetic Sciences|accessdate=15 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615031020/http://noetic.org/research/medbiblio/ch4.htm|archivedate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

Tibetan contemplative literature uses the parallel term ''nyam'', which fall into three categories, usually listed as clarity, bliss, and non-conceptuality.  Many types of meditation phenomena can be classed under this rubric, and are generally tied to the reorganization of the body's subtle energies that can occur in meditation.  See [[Dudjom Lingpa]], (cited in Wallace, ''the Attention Revolution''), and [[Padmasambhava]] (in ''Treasures from the Juniper Ridge'') for more specific examples. [[Robert Baker Aitken]] classifies speaking in tongues as "elaborate makyō" (''Taking the Path of Zen'').

'''Menachem Fisch''' is an Israeli philosopher, and the Joseph and Ceil Mazer Professor Emeritus of History and Philosophy of Science, and Director of the Center for Religious and Interreligious Studies at [[Tel Aviv University]], and Senior Fellow of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]'s Forschungskolleg Humanwisseschaften.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/fisch|title=Prof. Menachem Fisch|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telaviv.academia.edu/MenachemFisch|title=Menachem Fisch - Tel Aviv University - Academia.edu|website=telaviv.academia.edu|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/author/menachem-fisch|title=Menachem Fisch, Author at Tablet Magazine|website=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the Humboldt Research Prize by the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung in October 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forschungskolleg-humanwissenschaften.de/index.php/en/archive/news/149?view=item|title=News|website=www.forschungskolleg-humanwissenschaften.de|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2017 an honorary doctorate in religious philosophy by the Goethe University, Frankfurt in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/pls/web/pub_auswahlergebnisse.main?p_lang=de|title=News|website=www.humboldt-foundation.de|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has published widely on the history of 19th century British science and mathematics, on confirmation theory and rationality, on the theology of the talmudic literature, and the philosophy of talmudic legal reasoning. His current work explores the limits of normative self-criticism, the Talmud's dispute of religiosity, the possibilities of articulating a pluralist political philosophy from within the assumptions of halakhic Judaism, and the historiography of scientific framework transitions.

A volume dedicated to his work, entitled ''Menachem Fisch: The Rationality of Religious Dispute'', was as Vol. 18 of the ''Library of Contemporary Jewish Philosophers'', (eds. H. Samuelson-Tiroshi and A. W. Hughes), (Brill, 2016).

'''Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɒ|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|s|ɒ|f}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lomonosov "Lomonosov"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-rus|Михаи́л (Михáйло) Васи́льевич Ломоно́сов|p=mʲɪxɐˈil vɐˈsʲilʲjɪvʲɪtɕ  {{nobr|ləmɐˈnosəf}}|a=Ru-Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov.ogg}}; {{OldStyleDate|November 19|1711|November 8}} – {{OldStyleDate|April 15|1765|April 4}}) was a Russian [[polymath]], scientist and writer, who made important contributions to literature, education, and science. Among his discoveries were the [[atmosphere of Venus]] and the law of [[conservation of mass]] in [[chemical reaction]]s. His spheres of science were [[natural science]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mineralogy]], history, art, [[philology]], [[optical devices]] and others. Lomonosov was also a poet and influenced the formation of the modern [[Russian language|Russian literary language]].

==Early life and family==
Lomonosov was born in the village of [[Kholmogorsky District|Mishaninskaya]] (later renamed [[Lomonosovo, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Lomonosovo]] in his honor) in [[Archangelgorod Governorate]], on an island not far from [[Kholmogory, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Kholmogory]], in the far north of Russia.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=11}} His father, Vasily Dorofeyevich Lomonosov, was a prosperous peasant fisherman turned ship owner, who amassed a small fortune transporting goods from [[Arkhangelsk]] to [[Pustozyorsk]], [[Solovetsky Islands|Solovki]], [[Kola (town)|Kola]], and [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]].{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=11}} Lomonosov's mother was Vasily's first wife, a [[deacon]]'s daughter, Elena Ivanovna Sivkova.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=12}}

He remained at Denisovka until he was ten, when his father decided that he was old enough to participate in his business ventures, and Lomonosov began accompanying Vasily on trading missions.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=12}}

Learning was young Lomonosov's passion, however, not business. The boy's thirst for knowledge was insatiable. Lomonosov had been taught to read as a boy by his neighbor Ivan Shubny, and he spent every spare moment with his books.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=12}} He continued his studies with the village deacon, S.N. Sabelnikov, but for many years the only books he had access to were religious texts. When he was fourteen, Lomonosov was given copies of [[Meletius Smotrytsky]]'s ''Modern Church Slavonic'' (a grammar book) and [[Leonty Magnitsky]]'s ''Arithmetic''.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=13}} On his religious views, Lomonosov was a Russian orthodox all his life, but had close encounters with [[Old Believers]] schism in early youth and later in life he became a deist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov: his life and work|date=1980|publisher=Mir|page=161|author=Galina Evgenʹevna Pavlova |author2=Aleksandr Sergeevich Fedorov|accessdate=|quote=The atheistic direction of Lomonosov's scientific and artistic creativity was not always consistent. His world outlook, just as that of many other representatives of the age of enlightenment, possessed elements of deism according to which God, having created the universe, assumed no control over its development which was governed by the laws of nature. Lomonosov's deism was no chance factor. As Karl Marx aptly put it, deism was the most convenient and easiest way for many materialists of the 17th-18th centuries to abandon religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pushkin's Lyric Intelligence|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191552939|page=130|author=Andrew Kahn|quote=No atheistic conclusions spring from 'The Orb of Day has Set' to reverse Lomonosov's deism, but the poem still intrudes a painful gap between man and nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1724, his father married for the third and final time. Lomonosov and his stepmother Irina had an acrimonious relationship. Unhappy at home and intent on obtaining a higher education, which Lomonosov could not receive in Mishaninskaya, he was determined to leave the village.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=15}}

==Education in Moscow and Kiev==
[[File:Lomonosov-house marburg1.jpg|thumb|upright|The Lomonosov house in Marburg]]
In 1730, at nineteen, Lomonosov went to [[Moscow]] on foot, because he was determined to "study sciences".{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=15}} Shortly after arrival, he admitted into the [[Slavic Greek Latin Academy]] by falsely claiming to be a son of a Kholmogory nobleman.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=16}} In 1734 that initial falsehood as well as another lie for him to be son of a priest nearly got him expelled from the academy but the investigation ended without severe consequences.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=20}}

Lomonosov lived on three kopecks a day, eating only black bread and [[kvass]], but he made rapid progress scholastically.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=17}} It is believed that in 1735, after three years in Moscow he was sent to [[Kiev]] to study for short period at the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. He quickly became dissatisfied with the education he was receiving there, and returned to Moscow to resume his studies there.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=17}} In five years Lomonosov completed a twelve-year study course and in 1736, among 12 best graduates, was awarded a [[scholarship]] at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|St. Petersburg Academy]].{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=23}} He plunged into his studies and was rewarded with a four-year grant to study abroad, in Germany, first at the [[University of Marburg]] and then in [[Freiberg]].{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=24}}

==Education abroad==
The University of Marburg was among Europe's most important universities in the mid-18th century due to the presence of the philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], a prominent figure of the German [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Lomonosov became one of Wolff's students while at Marburg from November 1736 to July 1739. Both philosophically and as a science administrator, this connection would be the most influential of Lomonosov's life. In 1739–1740 he studied mineralogy, [[metallurgy]], and mining at Bergrat {{ill|Johann Friedrich Henckel|de|lt=Johann Friedrich Henckel's}} laboratory in Freiberg, Saxony; there he intensified his studies of German literature.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}}
[[File:Lomonosov Poltava 1762 1764.jpg|thumb|left|The most grandiose of Lomonosov's mosaics depicts the [[Battle of Poltava]].]]
Lomonosov quickly mastered the German language, and in addition to philosophy, seriously studied [[chemistry]], discovered the works of 17th century Irish theologian and natural philosopher, [[Robert Boyle]], and even began writing poetry. He also developed an interest in German literature. He is said to have especially admired [[Johann Christian Günther|Günther]]. His ''Ode on the Taking of [[Khotin]] from the Turks'', composed in 1739, attracted a great deal of attention in Saint Petersburg.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}} Contrary to his adoration for Wolff, Lomonosov went into fierce disputes with Henckel over the training and education courses he and his two compatriot students were getting in Freiberg as well as over very limited financial support which Henckel was instructed to provide to the Russians after numerous debts they made in Marburg. As the result, Lomonosov left Freiberg without permission and wandered for quite a while over Germany and Holland unsuccessfully trying to get a permission from Russian envoys to return to the St.Petersburg Academy.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

During his residence in Marburg, Lomonosov boarded with Catharina Zilch, a brewer's widow.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlova, Galina E., and Fedorov, Aleksandr S. ''Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov: His Life and Work (English Translation).'' Mir: Moscow, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; He fell in love with Catharina’s daughter Elizabeth Christine Zilch. They were married in June 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlova, Galina E., and Fedorov, Aleksandr S. ''Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov: His Life and Work (English Translation).'' Mir: Moscow, 1980. {{ISBN|0-8285-2895-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8285-2895-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lomonosov found it extremely difficult to maintain his growing family on the scanty and irregular allowance granted him by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. As his circumstances became desperate, he resolved and got permission to return to Saint Petersburg.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}}

==Return to Russia==
Lomonosov returned to Russia in June 1741, after being abroad 4 years and 8 months.  A year later he was named an Adjunct of the Russian Academy of Science in the physics department.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}} In May 1743, Lomonosov was accused, arrested, and held under house arrest for eight months, after he supposedly insulted various people associated with the Academy. He was released and pardoned in January 1744 after apologising to all involved.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}}

Lomonosov was made a full member of the Academy, and named Professor of [[chemistry]], in 1745.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}} He established the Academy's first chemistry laboratory.&lt;ref name="Cornwell Page 514"&gt;Cornwell, Neil and Christian, Nicole. ''Reference Guide to Russian Literature,'' Page 514. Taylor &amp; Francis: London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Eager to improve Russia’s educational system, in 1755, Lomonosov joined his patron Count [[Ivan Shuvalov]] in founding [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]].&lt;ref name="Cornwell Page 514"/&gt;

In 1760, he was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1764, he was elected Foreign Member of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna]] &lt;ref&gt;R.Crease and V.Shiltsev, "Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765): Scientist in Politically Turbulent Times" in Il Nuovo Saggiatore, vol.33, issue 5-6 (2017), pp. 43–56 https://www.ilnuovosaggiatore.sif.it/issue/54 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130092120/https://www.ilnuovosaggiatore.sif.it/issue/54 |date=30 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1764, Lomonosov was appointed to the position of the State Councillor which was of Rank V in the Russian Empire's [[Table of Ranks]]. He died on 4 April (o.s.), 1765 in Saint Petersburg.  He is widely and deservingly regarded as the "Father of Russian Science",&lt;ref&gt;V.Shiltsev, "Mikhail Lomonosov and the dawn of Russian science", Physics Today (February , 2012), vol. 65, http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.1438&lt;/ref&gt; though many of his scientific accomplishments were relatively unknown outside Russia until long after his death and gained proper appreciation only in late 19th and, especially, in 20th centuries.

===Physicist===
[[File:Ekaterina II and Lomonosov.jpg|thumb|[[Catherine II of Russia]] visits Mikhail Lomonosov in 1764. 1884 painting by Ivan Feodorov.]]
In 1756, Lomonosov tried to replicate [[Robert Boyle]]'s experiment of 1673.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=120}} He concluded that the commonly accepted [[phlogiston theory]] was false. Anticipating the discoveries of [[Antoine Lavoisier]], he wrote in his diary: "Today I made an experiment in hermetic glass vessels in order to determine whether the mass of metals increases from the action of pure heat. The experiments– of which I append the record in 13 pages– demonstrated that the famous Robert Boyle was deluded, for without access of air from outside the mass of the burnt metal remains the same".

That is the [[Conservation of mass|Law of Mass Conservation]] in [[chemical reaction]], which was well-known today as "in a chemical reaction, the mass of reactants is equal to the mass of the products." Lomonosov, together with Lavoisier, is regarded as the one who discovered the law of mass conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 119–127 | last = Pomper | first = Philip | title = Lomonosov and the Discovery of the Law of the Conservation of Matter in Chemical Transformations | journal = Ambix | date = October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated that all matter is composed of corpuscles – molecules that are "collections" of elements – atoms. In his dissertation "Elements of Mathematical Chemistry" (1741, unfinished), the scientist gives the following definition: "An element is a part of a body that does not consist of any other smaller and different bodies ... corpuscle is a collection of elements forming one small mass."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp |first=Mikhail Vasil'evich |last=Lomonosov |title=Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory |translator-first=Henry M. |translator-last=Leicester |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1959 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study (1748), he uses term "atom" instead of  "element", and "particula" (particle) or "molecule" instead of "corpuscle".

He regarded heat as a form of motion, suggested the [[wave theory]] of light, contributed to the formulation of the [[kinetic theory of gases]], and stated the idea of [[Conservation of mass|conservation of matter]] in the following words: "All changes in nature are such that inasmuch is taken from one object insomuch is added to another. So, if the amount of matter decreases in one place, it increases elsewhere. This universal law of nature embraces laws of motion as well, for an object moving others by its own force in fact imparts to another object the force it loses" (first articulated in a letter to [[Leonhard Euler]] dated 5 July 1748, rephrased and published in Lomonosov's dissertation "Reflexion on the solidity and fluidity of bodies", 1760).

===Astronomer===
[[File:LomonossowEffekt.svg|thumb|Scheme of the Lomonosov-Effect during a transit of Venus]]

Lomonosov was the first to discover and appreciate atmosphere of Venus during his observation of the [[transit of Venus]] of 1761 in a small observatory near his house in Petersburg.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}}&lt;ref name="Shiltsev2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 1761 Discovery of Venus' Atmosphere: Lomonosov and Others |journal=[[Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage]] |first=Vladimir |last=Shiltsev |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=85–112 |date=March 2014 |bibcode=2014JAHH...17...85S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 a group of astronomers carried out experimental reconstruction of Lomonosov's discovery of Venusian atmosphere with antique refractors during the transit of Venus ( 5–6 June 2012).&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5286 A.Koukarine, et al., "Experimental Reconstruction of Lomonosov's Discovery of Venus's Atmosphere with Antique Refractors During the 2012 Transit of Venus" (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that Lomonosov's telescope was fully adequate to the task of detecting the arc of light around Venus off the Sun's disc during ingress or egress if proper experimental techniques as described by Lomonosov in his 1761 paper&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3489 V.Shiltsev, "Lomonosov's Discovery of Venus Atmosphere in 1761: English Translation of Original Publication with Commentaries" (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; are employed.&lt;ref&gt;V.Shiltsev, I.Nesterenko, and R.Rosenfeld,

[[File:Lomonosov 1761German Fig.jpg|thumb|left|Diagrams from Mikhail Lomonosov's "The Appearance of Venus on the Sun, Observed at the St. Petersburg Imperial Academy of Sciences on 26 May 1761"]]

In 1762, Lomonosov presented an improved design of a [[reflecting telescope]] to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] forum. His telescope had its [[primary mirror]] adjusted at an angle of four degrees to the telescope's axis. This made the image focus at the side of the telescope tube, where the observer could view the image with an [[eyepiece]] without blocking the image. However, this invention was not published until 1827, so this type of telescope has become associated with a similar design by [[William Herschel]], the [[Herschelian telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;"On an optic pipe improvement" — Lomonosov M.V.

===Chemist and geologist===
In 1759, with his collaborator, academician Joseph Adam Braun, Lomonosov was the first person to record the [[freezing]] of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and to carry out initial experiments with it.&lt;ref&gt;''Lomonosov M. V.'' Meditations on Solidity and Fluidity of Bodies(1760) / translation and commentary by Vladimir Shiltsev (2018); https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00909&lt;/ref&gt;  Believing that nature is subject to regular and continuous [[evolution]], he demonstrated the [[life|organic]] origin of [[soil]], [[peat]], coal, [[petroleum]] and [[amber]]. In 1745, he published a catalogue of over 3,000 minerals, and in 1760, he explained the formation of [[iceberg]]s.{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}}

In 1763, he published ''On The Strata of the Earth'' - his most significant geological work.&lt;ref&gt;''Lomonosov M. V.'' On the strata of the Earth: a translation of "O sloiakh zemnykh" / translated by S. M. Rowland, S. Korolev. Boulder: Geological Soc. of America, 2012. 41 p. (Special paper; 485)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographer===
Lomonosov's observation of iceberg formation led into his pioneering work in [[geography]]. Lomonosov got close to the theory of [[continental drift]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoohall.com.ua/leftframes/ecolog/greenplanet/jizn1.htm ''Life and Death of Alfred Wegener]''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111224004/http://www.zoohall.com.ua/leftframes/ecolog/greenplanet/jizn1.htm |date=11 January 2008 }} by Alexey Fedorchuk {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; theoretically predicted the existence of [[Antarctica]] (he argued that [[iceberg]]s of the South Ocean could be formed only on a dry land covered with ice),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eduard-belcher.org/belcher-stati5.html Eduard Belcher ''Prediction of Antarctica by Lomonosov'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and invented sea tools which made writing and calculating directions and distances easier. In 1764, he organized an expedition (led by Admiral [[Vasili Chichagov]]) to find the [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and Pacific oceans by sailing along the northern coast of [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=}}

===Mosaicist===
[[File:Lomonosov Grave.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of Lomonosov in Lazarev Cemetery, [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
Lomonosov was proud to restore the ancient art of [[mosaic]]s. In 1754, in his letter to [[Leonhard Euler]], he wrote that his three years of experiments on the effects of chemistry of minerals on their colour led to his deep involvement in the mosaic art. In 1763, he set up a glass factory that produced the first stained glass mosaics outside of Italy. There were forty mosaics attributed to Lomonosov, with only twenty-four surviving to the present day. Among the best is the portrait of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and the ''Battle of Poltava'', measuring {{convert|4.8|×|6.4|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elena Lavrenova |url=http://www.foxdesign.ru/aphorism/biography/lomonosov.html |title=Lomonosov biography |publisher=Foxdesign.ru |date= |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narfu.ru/lomonosov |title=М.

===Grammarian, poet, historian===
In 1755 Lomonosov wrote a [[grammar]] that reformed the [[Russian language|Russian literary language]] by combining [[Old Church Slavonic]] with the vernacular tongue. To further his literary theories, he wrote more than 20 solemn ceremonial [[ode]]s, notably the ''Evening Meditation on the God's Grandeur''. He applied an idiosyncratic theory to his later poems – tender subjects needed words containing the front vowel sounds E, I, Y and U, whereas things that may cause fear (like "anger", "envy", "pain" and "sorrow") needed words with back vowel sounds O, U and Y. That was a version of what is now called [[sound symbolism]].

In 1760 Lomonosov published a History of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/chronologicalabr00lomo A Chronological Abridgement of the Russian History], by Michail Lomonosov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/index.html hist.msu.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he attempted to write a grand epic about [[Peter the Great]], to be based on the ''[[Aeneid]]'' by [[Vergil]], but he died before he could finish it.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Preminger, Terry V.

His granddaughter Sophia Konstantinova (1769–1844) married Russian military hero and statesman General [[Nikolay Raevsky]]. His great-granddaughter was Princess [[Mariya Volkonskaya|Maria (Raevskaya) Volkonskaya]], the wife of the Decembrist Prince [[Sergei Volkonsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutherland |first=Christine |title=The Princess of Siberia: The Story of Maria Volkonsky and the Decembrist Exiles |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |date=1984 |isbn=0-374-23727-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Lomonosov, Russia]] (former [[Oranienbaum, Russia]] from 1710–1948), and a [[Lomonosov (lunar crater)|lunar crater]] bear his name, as does a [[Lomonosov (Martian crater)|crater on Mars]] and the asteroid [[1379&amp;nbsp;Lomonosowa]]. The [[Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg]] was renamed after him from 1925 to 2005. In 1948, the underwater [[Lomonosov Ridge]] in the Arctic Ocean was named in his honor.  [[Moscow State University]] was renamed '’M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University'’ in his honor in 1940.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The [[Lomonosov Gold Medal]] was established in 1959 and is awarded annually by the Russian Academy of Sciences to a Russian and a foreign scientist.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The street "Lomonosova iela" in the [[Maskavas Forštate]] district of [[Riga]] is named in honor of Lomonosov. During the Soviet era a main street in Tallinn, Estonia, was named in his honor as "Lomonossovi M.", but from 1991 it was renamed Gonsiori after Jakob Johann Gonsior, a 19th-century alderman and lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Simon|title=A Rambling Dictionary of Tallinn Street Names|url=http://www.tallinnstreets.com/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626010846/http://www.tallinnstreets.com/|archivedate=26 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Akademik Lomonosov]]'', the first of a series of [[Russian floating nuclear power station]]s, is named for him.

'''Music semiology''' ([[semiotics]]) is the study of signs as they pertain to [[music]] on a variety of levels. Following [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Kofi Agawu]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive—that is, musical signs within a text and without. "Topics," or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others. The notion of [[Musical gesture|gesture]] is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.

:There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both [[ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenetic]] levels, has developmental priority over verbal language. {{harv|Middleton|1990|p=172}} See {{harvnb|Nattiez|1976}}, {{harvnb|Nattiez|1987}}, {{harvnb|Nattiez|1989}}, {{harvnb|Stefani|1973}}, {{harvnb|Stefani|1976}}, {{harvnb|Baroni|1983}}, and ''Semiotica'' (66: 1&amp;ndash;3 (1987)).

Writers on music semiology include Kofi Agawu (on topical theory, [[Schenkerian analysis]]), [[Robert S. Hatten|Robert Hatten]] (on topic, gesture), [[Raymond Monelle]] (on topic, musical meaning), [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (on introversive taxonomic analysis and ethnomusicological applications), [[Anthony Newcomb]] (on narrativity), [[Thomas Turino]] (applying the semiotics of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]), and [[Eero Tarasti]] (generally considered the founder of musical semiotics).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--At least, proper references to the works of these authors should be added  to the Source list.--&gt;
[[Roland Barthes]], himself a semiotician and skilled [[amateur]] pianist, wrote about music in some of the essays collected in ''Image, Music, Text'' {{harv|Barthes|1977}} and ''The Responsibility of Forms'' {{harv|Barthes|1985}}, as well as in the essay "Eiffel Tower" {{harv|Barthes|1982|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--Cannot find any reference to music in this essay.--&gt;}}, though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Signs, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of [[Philip Tagg]] (''Ten Little Tunes'', ''Fernando the Flute'', ''Music’s Meanings''){{Full|date=August 2015}} provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially [[Popular music|popular]], television and [[Film score|film music]]. The work of [[Leonard Meyer]] in ''Style and Music'' {{harv|Meyer|1989}} theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on [[Romantic music|Romanticism]] as a case study. [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]] {{harv|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1983}} analyze how music is structured like a language with its own semiotics and syntax.

{{Ayyavazhi}}
'''Neetham''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:&lt;small&gt;நீதம்&lt;/small&gt;) are the primary virtues to be followed according to the [[Akilam]] the holy text of [[Ayyavazhi]]. They are found in [[Akilam one]], which is the first section of the [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]], and in the middle of the [[meta-narrative]] events of the [[:Category:Eight Yugas|eight yugas]]. This shows that the society, its people, and the ruling king once lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of God in all their works, deeds, and activities during early ages.

The [[Akilam]] points this out as an example, and describes how the people should live in the world. It also forms a part of [[Ayyavazhi]] ethics. The Neethams are split into three. They are,

# '''Manu Neetham''': How an individual should personify him/herself with good morality.
# '''Raja Neetham''': How an individual should be to the society or Nation, and in turn how the Nation should be to a common man.
# '''Deiva Neetham''': How an individual should be before God.

== Manu Neetham — Justice of Common Man==

The '''Manu Neetham''' describes how a person should act in society. It also describes the correct [[moral]] character of the people, and their way of life in harmony with nature (particularly women) in the early ages.

Followers believe that all the events and actions that happen in their lives are activated by [[God]]. Therefore, they prefer not to seek any individual supremacy for any of their activities or achievements. All faithful followers believe that everyone is equal, in spite of the presence of different castes.

In addition, they do not find anyone inferior or superior to others with respect to the jobs they do. They neither do any menial jobs nor make others do so. In turn, they live with a mutual understanding of others not unlike the innocence of children.

===Morality===

*[[virginity]] is treated with highest respect, especially in women.
**This not only means physical virginity, but a kind of mental "virginity" as well.
***This is described as keeping one's mind clear, and not allowing the mind to become "instable" or "impure". In other words, virginity also means preserving moral and virginal thinking.
**Because of this, [[Women]] do not speak often.
*Followers are to respect their [[father]] and [[mother]], and keep them at equal status with [[God]].
*Honesty is considered an important virtue.
*Women are taught to respect their [[husband]]s.
**[[Wives]] sleep only after making their husbands sleep.
***For example, women will wake up and bathe before dawn, [[prayer|pray]], then clean the house as part of her daily routine.

Thus the people of the [[society]] would live: always striving to be role models for others. This [[ethical]] code is considered by followers to have been given by [[Ayyavazhi]] scriptures to mankind.

== Raja Neetham — Justice of Governance==

This '''Raja Neetham''' or '''Arasa Neetham''' says, how an individual should be to the [[society]] or [[nation]], and in turn how the nation should be to a common [[man]]. This was derived from the meta-narrative events, one practiced in the society.

The king ruled the country with great care, by giving more importance to individual needs. He respect each and every individual with equal status. The king consider the comfort of the subjects of the nation as the comfort of himself. In all the 1008 Pathis (The place where [[God]] is) the [[puja (Hinduism)|pooja]]s were conducted rightly and in timely manner. The [[temples]], the watermeans such as [[pond]]s, [[Water well|well]]s were supervised and were repaired frequently. [[Anna Dharmam]], the charity on food is conducted frequently at choultries. The people of the nation always respect religious persons and [[pilgrims]], and help them by all possible means, and consider that serving them (religious persons) is like serving God.

The king collects one-sixth of the means of people as [[tax]]. If  any one says that they will not be able to give one-sixth of their means, the king don't use to compel them. If any one pays tax without any pending for about twelve years the King use to discount their tax for two years. The judgement from the king for the judicial cases of people will be accurate. He gives more importance for his people than for himself.

===Right Judgement===

This story tells about a king who follows the Raja Neetham rightly and so his accuracy in judgement.

Once a [[hunter]] choose a bird as his target and points his arrow towards it. The bird notes this and flies away and the hunter follows the bird. The bird flew and fell in front of the Chozha king and asked him to rescue from the hunter. Following this the hunter came in front of the king and demanded the bird. He also says, "whole of my today's time is wasted behind this bird. I and my family has to fulfill our hunger by this bird." On the other hand, the bird demanded the king to save it from the hunter.

The king feels that both of them are right from their own view point and sensed both the fulfillment of the hunger of hunter and saving the life of the bird is his duty as a king. So taking care the two subjects, the king cut an equal quantity of [[flesh]] to the bird from his limb and gave it to the hunter. So he saved the life of the bird and on the other hand saved the hunter's family from being hungry. As king, he treated both of his subjects equally and also fulfilled both of their needs.

&lt;small&gt;''Note: This story is not fully narrated as above in [[Akilam]] and only quoted.''&lt;/small&gt;

== Deiva Neetham — Justice of Divinity==

This '''Deiva Neetham''' tells about the thought of people about the Almighty and about their religious harmony during that (old) age, and tells the way by which one should be get divinized. The most important point is, this part says that when the other two Neethams are correctly followed the Deiva Neetham will be automatically fall in the right path. This concept was reveals from the [[mythical]] narration.

The reign of the king (above in Raja Neetham) was identified as a good rule by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]. [[Narayana]], [[Brahma]], [[Lekhsmi]] and all devas appreciated this rule. They went to [[Mount Kailash|kayilai]] to meet [[Shiva|Siva]] to tell about this.

They met Siva in Kayilai and told that the King chozha is ruling his country genuinely. They also told Siva about the judgement of the king in the matter of the '''Hunter and the Bird'''. Also they brought to his attention, other merits of the reign of the king. They also demanded that, since the king is so genuine, talented and accurate in following the principles, he should order the devas to do the duties to his nation correctly. Hearing this Siva ordered the [[Krishna|Mayon]] to order the devas to do all duties timidly. As per this Mayon ordered,

*  [[Bhoomaadevi]], goddess of [[earth]] to protect his nation.
*  [[Varuna]], the [[God of Rain]] to shed rain thrice a month in the country of that king.
*  The [[clouds]] to act as an umbrella and protect his nation.
*  [[Vayu]], the [[God of Wind]] to fan his nation with gentle breeze.
*  [[Sivayu]]s to be alert on the places where the poojas are held in his nation.
*  [[Nithira Devi]], the [[Goddess of sleepiness]] not to disturb unnecessarily the subjects of his nation.

As per the order of [[Shiva|Siva]] all activities were done by devas. Also they made all [[animal]]s to live in harmony with each other and with the people. They also made the crops of his nation to give good yield for the people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">{{tech|date=March 2016}}In [[formal logic]], '''nonfirstorderizability''' is the inability of an expression to be adequately captured in particular theories in [[first-order logic]].  Nonfirstorderizable sentences are sometimes presented as evidence that first-order logic is not adequate to capture the nuances of meaning in natural language.

The term was coined by [[George Boolos]] in his well-known paper "To Be is to Be a Value of a Variable (or to Be Some Values of Some Variables)."  Boolos argued that such sentences call for [[second-order logic|second-order]] symbolization, which can be interpreted as plural quantification over the same domain as first-order quantifiers use, without postulation of distinct "second-order objects" ([[properties]], sets, etc.).

== Examples ==
* A standard example is the ''[[Peter Geach|Geach]]–[[David Kaplan (philosopher)|Kaplan]] sentence'': "Some critics admire only one another."
: If ''Axy'' is understood to mean "''x'' admires ''y''," and the [[universe of discourse]] is the set of all critics, then a reasonable translation of the sentence into second order logic is:
: &lt;math display="block"&gt;\exists X ( \exists x,y (Xx \land Xy \land Axy) \land \exists x \neg Xx \land \forall x\, \forall y (Xx \land Axy \rightarrow Xy))&lt;/math&gt;
: That this formula has no first-order equivalent can be seen as follows.  Substitute the formula (''y'' = ''x'' + 1 v ''x'' = ''y'' + 1) for ''Axy''.  The result,
: &lt;math display="block"&gt;\exists X ( \exists x,y (Xx \land Xy \land (y = x + 1 \lor x = y + 1)) \land \exists x \neg Xx \land \forall x\, \forall y (Xx \land (y = x + 1 \lor x = y + 1) \rightarrow Xy))&lt;/math&gt;
: states that there is a nonempty set which is closed under the predecessor and successor operations and yet does not contain all numbers. Thus, it is true in all [[Non-standard model of arithmetic|nonstandard models of arithmetic]] but false in the standard model.  Since no first-order sentence has this property, the result follows.
* The concept of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] cannot be defined in first-order languages, merely indiscernibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SEP |url-id=identity|title=Identity|last=Noonan|first=Harold|last2=Curtis|first2=Ben|date=2014-04-25|section=2 "The Logic of Identity"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[compactness theorem]] implies that [[graph connectivity]] cannot be expressed in first-order logic.{{clarify|date=June 2018}}

In [[religion]] and [[esotericism]], the term "'''physical universe'''" or "'''material universe'''" is used to distinguish the [[nature|physical]] [[matter]] of the [[universe]] from a proposed [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[supernatural]] essence. 

In the [[Book of Veles]], and perhaps in traditional [[Slavic mythology]], the physical universe is referred to as [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Yav]]. [[Gnosticism]] holds that the physical universe was created by a [[Demiurge]]. In [[Dharmic religion]]s [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is believed to be the illusion of a physical universe.

[[Physicalism]], a type of [[monism]], holds that only physical things exist. This is also known as [[metaphysical naturalism]].

'''Pyrrho of Elis'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=11th |editor=Hugh Chisholm |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1911 |volume=22 |page=696}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|r|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc|Πύρρων ὁ Ἠλεῖος|Pyrrhо̄n ho Ēleios}}; {{circa|360|270&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}) was a Greek [[philosopher]] of [[Classical antiquity]] and is credited as being the first Greek [[skeptic]] philosopher.

==Life==
Pyrrho of Elis is estimated to have lived from around 365-360 BC until 275-270 BC.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43615424|title=Pyrrho, his antecedents, and his legacy|last=Home.|first=Bett, Richard Arnot|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198250654|location=Oxford|oclc=43615424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrho was from [[Elis]], on the [[Ionian Sea]]. [[Diogenes Laërtius]], quoting from [[Apollodorus of Athens]], says that Pyrrho was at first a painter, and that pictures by him were exhibited in the gymnasium at Elis. Later he was diverted to philosophy by the works of [[Democritus]], and according to Diogenes Laertius became acquainted with the [[Megarian school of philosophy|Megarian dialectic]] through [[Bryson of Achaea|Bryson]], pupil of [[Stilpo]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Pyrrho of Elis|volume=22|page=696|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While little is known for certain about [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrho’s philosophy]] and life, his primary influencers were most likely early philosophers whose work focused on the indeterminacy of the world, such as [[Plato]] and the [[Eleatics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is thought that he was taught by Anaxarchus of Abdera, and was also influenced by Eastern philosophy he encountered on a trip to India with Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/pyrrho|title=Pyrrho|last=Bett|first=Richard|last2=Zalta|first2=Edward|date=Winter 2014|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diogenes reports that Pyrrho, along with [[Anaxarchus]], travelled with [[Alexander the Great]] on his exploration of the East, 'so that he even went as far as the [[Gymnosophists]] in [[India]] and the [[Magi]]' in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. This exposure to [[Eastern philosophy]] seems to have inspired him to adopt a life of solitude; returning to Elis, he lived in poor circumstances, but was highly honored by the Elians and also by the Athenians, who conferred upon him the rights of citizenship.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Pyrrho wrote nothing. His doctrines were recorded in the writings of his pupil [[Timon of Phlius]]. Unfortunately these works are mostly lost. Today Pyrrho's ideas are known mainly through the book ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' written by [[Sextus Empiricus]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== Sources on Pyrrho ==
Pyrrho did not produce any written work detailing his philosophical principles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of the information on Pyrrho’s principles comes from his most notable follower, [[Timon of Phlius|Timon]], whose summary of Pyrrho's teachings are preserved in the Aristocles passage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, there are conflicting interpretations of the ideas presented in this passage, each of which leads to a different conclusion as to what Pyrrho meant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Most biographical information on Pyrrho, as well as some information concerning his demeanor and behavior, come from the works of mid-third century BC biographer [[Antigonus of Carystus]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Biographical anecdotes from Diogenes Laertius are also frequently cited; his work on Pyrrho's life drew primarily from Antigonus' accounts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Philosophy==
As Pyrrho left no written teachings, the exact details of his philosophy are uncertain. Most sources agree that the primary goal of Pyrrho’s philosophy was the achievement of a state of [[ataraxia]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or freedom from worry,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and that he observed that ataraxia could be brought about by eschewing beliefs about thoughts and perceptions. 

However, Pyrrho’s own philosophy may have differed significantly from the later Pyrrhonists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most interpretations of the information on Pyrrho’s philosophy suggest that he claimed that reality is inherently indeterminate, which, in the view of Pyrrhonism described by Sextus Empiricus, would be considered a negative dogmatic belief.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A summary of Pyrrho's philosophy was preserved by [[Eusebius]], quoting [[Aristocles of Messene|Aristocles]], quoting [[Timon of Phlius|Timon]], in what is known as the "Aristocles passage."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever wants to live well ([[eudaimonia]]) must consider these three questions: First, how are ''pragmata'' (ethical matters, affairs, topics) by nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?" Pyrrho's answer is that "As for ''pragmata''  they are all [[adiaphora]] (undifferentiated by a logical differentia), ''astathmēta'' (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and ''anepikrita'' (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). Therefore, neither our sense-perceptions nor our ''doxai'' (views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or lie; so we certainly should not rely on them. Rather, we should be ''adoxastoi'' (without views), ''aklineis'' (uninclined toward this side or that), and ''akradantoi'' (unwavering in our refusal to choose), saying about every single one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |pages=22–23 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf |ISBN=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main principle of Pyrrho's thought is expressed by the word ''[[acatalepsia]]'', which connotes the ability to withhold assent from doctrines regarding the truth of [[Noumenon|things in their own nature]]; against every statement its contradiction may be advanced with equal justification.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

=== Pyrrhonism ===

It is uncertain whether [[Pyrrhonism]] was a small but continuous movement in antiquity, or whether it died out and was revived. Regardless, several centuries after Pyrrho lived, [[Aenesidemus]] lead a revival of the philosophy. Pyrrhonism was one of the two major schools of skeptical thought that emerged during the Hellenistic period, the other being [[Academic skepticism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65192690|title=The History of Scepticism : from Savonarola to Bayle|last=Popkin|first=Richard Henry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780198026716|edition=Revised|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=65192690}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aenesidemus developed ten arguments to be used as justification for suspending all judgement on the true nature of things.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48857664|title=What is ancient philosophy?|last=Pierre.|first=Hadot,|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674013735|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=48857664}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further set of five arguments was developed by [[Agrippa the Skeptic]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These arguments, as well as several other sets of tropes used as justification for suspending judgement, are presented in the texts of [[Sextus Empiricus]], whose works contain the most detailed surviving account of Pyrrhonist practice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Pyrrhonists view their philosophy as a way of life, and view Pyrrho as a model for this way of life. Their main goal is to cure suffering and unhappiness through achieving suspension of judgment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One method Pyrrhonists use to suspend judgment is to gather arguments on both sides of the disputed issue, continuing to gather arguments such that the arguments have the property of isostheneia (equal strength). This leads the Pyrrhonist to the conclusion that there is an unresolvable disagreement on the topic, and so the appropriate reaction is to suspend judgement on the topic. The Pyrrhonist develops suspension of judgment as a habitual response to all matters of dispute, achieving a state of “[[epoché|epoche]]” – a general suspension of judgement about the real nature of things. Reaching epoche results in [[ataraxia]], or freedom of worry, which relieves the practitioner of the causes of unhappiness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pyrrhonism flourished among members of the [[Empiric school]] of medicine, where it was seen as the philosophic foundation to their approach to medicine, which was opposed to the approach of the [[Dogmatic school]] of medicine. Pyrrhonism fell into obscurity in the post-Hellenic period.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Pyrrhonism has three styles of practice, or types of practitioners. These are the [[ephectics|ephectic]] (a "suspension of judgment"), zetetic ("engaged in seeking"), and aporetic ("engaged in refutation").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Etymological Compendium, Or, Portfolio of Origins and Inventions |last=Pulleyn |first=William |publisher=T. Tegg |year=1830 |isbn= |location= |pages=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian influences on Pyrrho ==
Diogenes Laertius' biography of Pyrrho&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlpyrrho.htm|publisher=Peithô's Web|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  reports that Pyrrho traveled with [[Alexander the Great]]'s army to India and based his philosophy on what he learned there:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...he even went as far as the Gymnosophists, in India, and the Magi. Owing to which circumstance, he seems to have taken a noble line in philosophy, introducing the doctrine of incomprehensibility, and of the necessity of suspending one's judgment....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The sources and the extent of the Indian influences on Pyrrho's philosophy, however, are disputed by some. Some elements of [[scepticism]] were already present in Greek philosophy, particularly in the [[Democritus|Democritean]] tradition in which Pyrrho had studied prior to visiting India. [[Richard Bett]] heavily discounts any substantive Indian influences on Pyrrho, arguing that on the basis of testimony of [[Onesicritus]] regarding how difficult it was to converse with the gymnosophists, as it required three translators, none of whom understood any philosophy, that it is highly improbable that Pyrrho could have been substantively influenced by any of the Indian philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bett, Pyrrho, His Antecedents and His Legacy, 2000, p177-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Christopher I. Beckwith]]'s analysis of the Aristocles Passage, adiaphora, astathmēta, and anepikrita are strikingly similar to the Buddhist [[Three marks of existence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |page=28 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf |ISBN=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that Pyrrho's teaching is based on Buddhism. Beckwith disputes Bett's argument about the translators, as the other reports of using translators in India, involving [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Nearchus]], say they needed only one interpreter, and Onesicritus was [[Onesicritus#Writings|criticized]] by other writers in antiquity for exaggerating. Beckwith also contends that the 18 months Pyrrho spent in India was long enough to learn a foreign language, and that the key innovative tenets of Pyrrho's skepticism were only found in Indian philosophy at the time and not in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |page=221 |ISBN=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesized that the gymnosophists were [[Jainism|Jains]], or [[Ajñana|Ajnanins]] ,{{sfn|Barua|1921|p=299}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=129-130}}{{sfn|Flintoff|1980}} and that these are likely influences on Pyrrho.{{sfn|Barua|1921|p=299}}

== Influence ==
Pyrrhonism regained prominence in the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The publication of the works of Sextus Empiricus played a major role in Renaissance and Reformation thought. Philosophers of the time used his works to source their arguments on how to deal with the religious issues of their day. Major philosophers such as [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Marin Mersenne]], and [[Pierre Gassendi]] later drew on the model of Pyrrhonism outlined in Sextus Empiricus’ works for their own arguments. This resurgence of Pyrrhonism has been called the beginning of modern philosophy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Pyrrhonism also affected the development of [[historiography]]. Historical Pyrrhonism emerged during the early modern period and played a significant role in shaping modern historiography. Historical Pyrrhonism questioned the possibility of any absolute knowledge from the past and transformed later historian's selection of and standard for reliable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960048885|title=The specter of skepticism in the age of Enlightenment|last=1985-|first=Matytsin, Anton M.,|isbn=9781421420530|location=Baltimore|oclc=960048885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Raja]] Ram Mohan Roy''' (22 May 1774– 27 September 1833) was one of the founders of the [[Brahmo Samaj|Brahmo Sabha]], the precursor of the [[Brahmo Samaj]], a socio-religious reform movement in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He was given the title of Raja by [[Akbar II]], the Mughal emperor.  His influence was apparent in the fields of [[politics]], [[public administration]], education, and religion. He was known for his efforts to abolish the practices of [[Sati (practice)|sati]] and child marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soman |first1=Priya |title=Raja Ram Mohan and the Abolition of Sati System in Indai |journal=International Journal of Humanities, Art and Social Studies (IJHAS) |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=75–82 |url=https://airccse.com/ijhas/papers/1216ijhas08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raja Ram Mohan Roy is considered by many historians as the "Father of the Indian Renaissance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/raja-ram-mohan-roy-google-doodle-remembers-the-father-of-indian-renaissance-5186085/|title=Raja Ram Mohan Roy: Google doodle remembers the father of ‘Indian Renaissance’|website=Indian Express|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/special-features/raja-ram-mohan-roy-father-indian-renaissance-671173.html/|title=Raja Ram Mohan Roy: 'The father of Indian Renaissance'|website=Deccan Herald|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Roy was ranked number 10 in BBC's poll of the [[Greatest Bengali of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3623345.stm|title=Listeners name 'greatest Bengali'|date=2004-04-14|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2004/04/17/stories/2004041703001700.htm|title=The Hindu : International : Mujib, Tagore, Bose among `greatest Bengalis of all time'|website=www.thehindu.com|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/04/16/d4041601066.htm|title=BBC Listeners' Poll Bangabandhu judged greatest Bengali of all time'|website=archive.thedailystar.ne|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education (till 1796)==
Ram Mohan Roy was born in [[Radhanagore|Radhanagar]],  [[Hooghly District]], [[Bengal Presidency]]. His father Ramkanta was a [[Vaishnavite]], while his mother, Tarini Devi, was from a [[Shivaite]] family. Thus one parent prepared him for the occupation of a scholar, the ''Shastri'', the other secured for him all the worldly advantages needed to launch a career in the ''laukik'' or worldly sphere of public administration. Torn between these two parental ideals from early childhood, Ram Mohan vacillated the rest of his life, moving from one to the other and back.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;page 8, Raja Ram Mohan Roy — The Renaissance Man, H.D.Sharma, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram Mohan Roy was married thrice. His first wife died early. He had two sons, Radhaprasad in 1800, and Ramaprasad in 1812 with his second wife, who died in 1824. Roy's third wife outlived him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raja Ram Mohan Roy |url=https://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/raja-ram-mohan-roy.html |publisher=Cultural India |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram Mohan Roy's early education is disputed. One view is that "Ram Mohan started his formal education in the village ''[[pathshala]]'' where he learned [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and some [[Sanskrit]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. Later he is said to have studied [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] in a ''[[madrasa]]'' in [[Patna]] and after that he was sent to [[Benares]] (Kashi) to learn the intricacies of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindu]] scripture, including the [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]]. The dates of his time in both these places are uncertain. However, it is believed that he was sent to [[Patna]] when he was nine years old and two years later to [[Benares]]."&lt;ref name="Sharma" /&gt;

The Persian and Arabic studies influenced his thinking about One God more than studies of European deism, which he didn't know at least while writing his first scriptures as at that stage he didn't speak or understand English.

Ram Mohan Roy's impact on modern Indian history was his revival of the pure and ethical principles of the Vedanta school of philosophy as found in the Upnishads. He preached the unity of God, made early translations of Vedic scriptures into English, co-founded the Calcutta [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Society and founded the [[Brahma Samaj]]. The Brahma Samaj played a major role in reforming and modernising the Indian society. He successfully campaigned against [[Sati (practice)|sati]], the practice of burning widows. He sought to integrate Western culture with the best features of his own country's traditions. He established a number of schools to popularise a modern system (effectively replacing [[Sanskrit]] based education with [[English language|English]] based education) of education in [[India]]. He promoted a rational, ethical, non-authoritarian, this-worldly, and social-reform Hinduism. His writings also sparked interest among British and American Unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hodder |first1=Alan D. |title=Emerson, Rammohan Roy, and the Unitarians |journal=Studies in the American Renaissance |date=1988 |pages=133–148 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30227561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity and the early rule of the East India Company (1795–1828)==
During these overlapping periods, Ram Mohan Roy acted as a political agitator whilst employed by the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Singh |first1=Kulbir |title=Ram Mohan Roy: The Father of the Indian Renaissance |url=http://www.youngbites.com/newsdet.aspx?q=206336 |publisher=Young Bites |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, the British [[Baptist]] shoemaker [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] published his influential missionary tract, ''An Enquiry of the obligations of Christians to use means for the conversion of heathens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/enquiry/enquiry.html|title=An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens|website=www.wmcarey.edu|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] landed in India to settle. His objective was to translate, publish and distribute the Bible in Indian languages and propagate Christianity to the Indian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmcarey.edu|title=Home - William Carey University|website=www.wmcarey.edu|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realised the "mobile" (i.e. service classes) [[Brahmins]] and [[Pundits]] were most able to help him in this endeavour, and he began gathering them. He learnt the Buddhist and Jain religious works to better argue the case for Christianity in the cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reed |first1=Ian Brooks |title=Rammohan Roy and the Unitarians |url=http://fsu.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fsu:253129/datastream/PDF/view |publisher=Florida State University Libraries |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, Carey made contact with a Sanskrit scholar, the Tantric saihardana Vidyabagish,&lt;ref&gt;''Kaumudi Patrika'' 12 December 1912&lt;/ref&gt; who later introduced him to Ram Mohan Roy, who wished to learn English.

Between 1796 and 1797, the trio of Carey, Vidyavagish, and Roy created a religious work known as the "Maha Nirvana Tantra" (or "Book of the Great Liberation")&lt;ref&gt;"Essays in Classical and Modern Hindu Law" John Duncan Derrett&lt;/ref&gt; and positioned it as a religious text to "the One True God". Carey's involvement is not recorded in his very detailed records and he reports only learning to read [[Sanskrit]] in 1796 and only completed a grammar in 1797, the same year he translated part of The Bible from Joshua to Job, a massive task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-08|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/carey/04chapter.html|title=The Life of William Carey (1761-1834) by George Smith (1885) Ch4, p71}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next two decades this document was regularly augmented.&lt;ref name=himalaya&gt;{{cite web|last1=Syed|first1=M. H.|title=Raja Rammohan Roy|url=http://www.himpub.com/documents/Chapter107.pdf|publisher=Himalaya Publishing House|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its judicial sections were used in the law courts of the English Settlement in Bengal as Hindu Law for adjudicating upon property disputes of the zamindari. However, a few British magistrates and collectors began to suspect and its usage (as well as the reliance on [[pundit]]s as sources of Hindu Law) was quickly deprecated. Vidyavagish had a brief falling out with Carey and separated from the group, but maintained  ties to Ram Mohan Roy.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to "Fallacy of the New Dispensation" by Sivanath Sastri, 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797, Raja Ram Mohan reached Calcutta and became a "[[bania (caste)|bania]]" (moneylender), mainly to lend to the Englishmen of the Company living beyond their means. Ram Mohan also continued his vocation as [[pundit]] in the English courts and started to make a living for himself. He began learning Greek and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Patel |first1=Tanvi |title=Google Honours ‘Maker Of Modern India’: Remembering Raja Ram Mohan Roy |url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/142457/raja-ram-mohan-roy/ |publisher=The Better India |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799, Carey was joined by missionary [[Joshua Marshman]] and the printer William Ward at the Danish settlement of [[Serampore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joshua Marshman, D.D. |url=https://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/marshman/ |publisher=William Carey University |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1803 till 1815, Ram Mohan served the East India Company's "Writing Service", commencing as private clerk "Munshi" to Thomas Woodroffe, Registrar of the Appellate Court at Murshidabad&lt;ref&gt;S.D.Collett&lt;/ref&gt; (whose distant nephew, [[John Woodroffe]]&amp;nbsp;— also a Magistrate&amp;nbsp;— and later lived off the Maha Nirvana Tantra under the pseudonym [[Arthur Avalon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZRGodG_PJkC&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html|title=Mahanirvana Tantra Of The Great Liberation|first=Arthur|last=Avalon|date=1 June 2004|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|accessdate=2 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy resigned from Woodroffe's service and later secured employment with John Digby, a Company collector, and Ram Mohan spent many years at Rangpur and elsewhere with Digby, where he renewed his contacts with Hariharananda. [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] had by this time settled at Serampore and the old trio renewed their profitable association. [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] was also aligned now with the English Company, then head-quartered at Fort William, and his religious and political ambitions were increasingly intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=George|title=Life of William Carey|url=http://www.ccel.org/s/smith_geo/carey/carey.htm|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While being in Murshidabad in 1804 Raja Ram Mohan Roy wrote Tuhfat-ul-Muwahhidin (A Gift to Monotheists) in Persian with an introduction in Arabic. Bengali had not Yet become the language of intellectual discourse. The importance of Tuhfatul Muwahhidin lies only in its being the first known theological statement of one who achieved
later fame and notoriety as a vendantin. On its own, it is unremarkable, perhaps of interest only to a social historian because of its amateurish eclecticism. Tuhfat was, after all, available as early as 1884 in the
English translation of Maulavi Obaidullah EI Obaid, Published by the Adi Brahmo Samaj. Raja Ram Mohan Roy did not know the Upanishad at this stage'in his intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Quoted in Bruce Carlisle Robertson, Ram Mohan Roy, The father of Modem India (Oxford University Press, Delhi, 1995), p. 25. 2 Quoted in S. Crawford Cromwell Ram Mohan Roy, His era and Ethics (Arnold Heinemann Publishers, India, Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, 1984), p. 11.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815, he started [[Atmiya Sabha]], a philosophical discussion circle in [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta).

The East India Company was draining money from India at a rate of three million pounds a year in 1838. Ram Mohan Roy was one of the first to try to estimate how much money was being driven out of India and to where it was disappearing. He estimated that around one-half of all total revenue collected in India was sent out to England, leaving India, with a considerably larger population, to use the remaining money to maintain social well-being.&lt;ref&gt;, Roy, Rama Dev. ''Some Aspects of the Economic Drain from India during the British Rule''Social Scientist, Vol. 15, No. 3. March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ram Mohan Roy saw this and believed that the unrestricted settlement of Europeans in India governing under free trade would help ease the economic drain crisis.&lt;ref&gt;, Bhattacharya, Subbhas. ''Indigo Planters, Ram Mohan Roy and the 1833 Charter Act'' Social Scientist, Vol.4, No.3. October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next two decades, Ram Mohan launched his attack at the behest of the church against the bastions of Hinduism of Bengal, namely his own [[Kulin Brahmin]] priestly clan (then in control of the many temples of Bengal) and their priestly excesses.&lt;ref name=himalaya/&gt; The Kulin excesses targeted include sati (the co-cremation of widows), polygamy, child marriage and dowry.

From 1819, Rammohun's battery increasingly turned against William Carey, a Baptist Missionary settled in Serampore and the Serampore missionaries. With Dwarkanath's munificence, he launched a series of attacks against Baptist "Trinitarian" Christianity and was now considerably assisted in his theological debates by the Unitarian faction of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Das |first1=Pijush Kanti |title=Rammohun Roy and Brahmoism |url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/165007/8/08_chapter%205.pdf |publisher=University of Calcutta|work=Religious movement in mediaeval and modern India a critical study in Sikhism Brahmoism and the cult of Ramakrishna|pages=200–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828, he launched Brahmo Sabha with Devendranath Tagore. By 1828, he had become a well known figure in India. In 1830, he had gone to England as an envoy of the Mughal Emperor, Akbar Shah II, who invested him with the title of Raja to the court of King William IV.

==Middle "Brahmo" period (1820–1830)==
This was Ram Mohan's most controversial period. Commenting on his published works [[Sivanath Sastri]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Sivanath Sastri, History of the Brahmo Samaj, 1911, 1st ed. pg. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt;

"The period between 1820 and 1830 was also eventful from a literary point of view, as will be manifest from the following list of his publications during that period:

:* Second Appeal to the Christian Public, Brahmanical Magazine - Parts I, II and III, with Bengali translation and a new Bengali newspaper called [[Sambad Kaumudi]] in 1821;
:* A Persian paper called ''[[Mirat-ul-Akhbar]]'' contained a tract entitled Brief Remarks on Ancient Female Rights and a book in Bengali called Answers to Four Questions in 1822;
:* Third and final appeal to the Christian public, a memorial to the King of England on the subject of the liberty of the press, Ramdoss papers relating to Christian controversy, Brahmanical Magazine, No. IV, letter to Lord Arnherst on the subject of English education, a tract called "Humble Suggestions" and a book in Bengali called "Pathyapradan or Medicine for the Sick," all in 1823;
:* A letter to Rev. H. Ware on the " Prospects of Christianity in India" and an "Appeal for famine-smitten natives in Southern India" in 1824;
:* A tract on the different modes of worship, in 1825;
:* A Bengali tract on the qualifications of a God-loving householder, a tract in Bengali on a controversy with a Kayastha, and a Grammar of the Bengali language in English, in 1826;
:* A Sanskrit tract on "Divine worship by Gayatri" with an English translation of the same, the edition of a Sanskrit treatise against caste, and the previously noticed tract called "Answer of a Hindu to the question &amp;c.," in 1827;
:* A form of Divine worship and a collection of hymns composed by him and his friends, in 1828;
:* "Religious Instructions founded on Sacred Authorities" in English and Sanskrit, a Bengali tract called "Anusthan," and a petition against sati, in 1829;

He publicly declared that he would emigrate from the British Empire if Parliament failed to pass the Reform Bill.

In 1830, Ram Mohan Roy travelled to the United Kingdom as an ambassador of the [[Mughal Empire]] to ensure that Lord William Bentinck's [[Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829]] banning the practice of Sati was not overturned. In addition, Roy petitioned the King to increase the Mughal Emperor's allowance and perquisites. He was successful in persuading the British government to increase the stipend of the Mughal Emperor by £30,000. He also visited France. While in England, he embarked on a sort of cultural exchange, meeting with members of Parliament and publishing books on Indian economics and law. [[Sophia Dobson Collet]] was his biographer at the time.

He died at [[Stapleton, Bristol|Stapleton]], then a village to the north east of [[Bristol]] (now a suburb), on 27 September 1833 of [[meningitis]] and was buried in [[Arnos Vale Cemetery]] in southern Bristol.

==Religious reforms==
The religious reforms of Roy contained in some beliefs of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] expounded by [[Rajnarayan Basu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://brahmo.org/brahmo-samaj.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229062103/http://brahmo.org/brahmo-samaj.html |archive-date=29 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are:/-

*Brahmo Samaj believe that the most fundamental doctrines of [[Brahmoism]] are at the basis of every religion followed by a man.
*Brahmo Samaj believe in the existence of One Supreme God&amp;nbsp;— "a God, endowed with a distinct personality &amp; moral attributes equal to His nature, and intelligence befitting the Author and Preserver of the Universe," and worship Him alone.
*Brahmo Samaj believe that worship of Him needs no fixed place or time. "We can adore Him at any time and at any place, provided that time and that place are calculated to compose and direct the mind towards Him."

===Social reforms===
* Crusaded against Hindu customs as sati, polygamy, child marriage and the caste system.
* Demanded property inheritance rights for women.
* In 1828, he set up the ''Brahmo Sabha'' a movement of reformist Bengali Brahmins to fight against social evils.

Roy’s political background and Christian influence influenced his social and religious views regarding reforms of Hinduism. He writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The present system of Hindus is not well calculated to promote their political interests…. It is necessary that some change should take place in their religion, at least for the sake of their political advantage and social comfort."&lt;ref&gt;Gauri Shankar 'Bhatt, "Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, and the Church-Sect Typology" Review of Religions Research. 10. (1968): 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ram Mohan Roy’s experience working with the British government taught him that Hindu traditions were often not credible or respected by western standards and this no doubt affected his religious reforms. He wanted to legitimise Hindu traditions to his European acquaintances by proving that "superstitious practices which deform the Hindu religion have nothing to do with the pure spirit of its dictates!"&lt;ref&gt;Ram Mohan Roy, Translation of Several Principal Book, Passages, and Text of the Vedas and of Some Controversial works on Brahmunical Theology. (London: Parbury, Allen &amp; Company, 1823) 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The "superstitious practices", to which Ram Mohan Roy objected, included sati, caste rigidity, polygamy and child marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Brahendra N. Bandyopadyay, Rommohan Roy, (London: University Press, 1933) 351.&lt;/ref&gt; These practices were often the reasons British officials claimed moral superiority over the Indian nation. Ram Mohan Roy’s ideas of religion actively sought to create a fair and just society by implementing humanitarian practices similar to the Christian ideals professed by the British and thus seeking to legitimise Hinduism in the eyes of the Christian world.

===Educationist===
* Roy believed education to be an implement for social reform.
* In 1817, in collaboration with David Hare, he set up the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Hindu College]] at Calcutta.
* In 1822, Roy found the ''Anglo-Hindu school'', followed four years later (1826) by the ''Vedanta College''; where he insisted that his teachings of monotheistic doctrines be incorporated with "modern, western curriculum.".&lt;ref&gt;"Ram Mohan Roy." Main. britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511196/Ram-Mohan-Roy?view=print. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1830, he helped [[Alexander Duff (missionary)|Rev. Alexander Duff]] in establishing the General Assembly's Institution (now known as [[Scottish Church College]]), by providing him with the venue vacated by ''Brahma Sabha'' and getting the first batch of students.
* He supported induction of western learning into Indian education.
* He also set up the ''Vedanta College'', offering courses as a synthesis of Western and Indian learning.
* His most popular journal was the ''[[Sambad Kaumudi]]''. It covered topics like freedom of the press, induction of Indians into high ranks of service, and separation of the executive and judiciary.
* When the English Company muzzled the press, Ram Mohan composed two memorials and against this in 1829 and 1830 respectively.

==Mausoleum at Arnos Vale==
[[File: Epitaph of Raja Rammohun Roy in Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol, England.jpg|thumb|Epitaph for Ram Mohan Roy on his Mausoleum]]
[[File: Tomb of Raja Rammohun Roy in Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol, England.jpg|thumb|right|Mausoleum of Ram Mohan Roy in [[Arno's Vale Cemetery]], [[Bristol]], [[England]]]] 
Ram Mohan Roy was originally buried on 18 October 1833, in the grounds of Stapleton Grove where he had died of meningitis on 27 September 1833. Nine and a half years later he was reburied on 29 May 1843 in a grave at the new Arnos Vale Cemetery, in Brislington, East Bristol. A large plot on The Ceremonial Way there had been bought by William Carr and William Prinsep, and the body in its lac and a lead coffin was placed later in a deep brick-built vault, over seven feet underground. Two years after this, [[Dwarkanath Tagore]] helped pay for the chattri raised above this vault, although there is no record of his ever visiting Bristol. The chattri was designed by the artist William Prinsep, who had known Ram Mohan in [[Calcutta]].

Bristol Arnos Vale cemetery have been holding remembrance services of Raja Ram Mohan Roy every year on a Sunday close to his death anniversary date of 27 September.&lt;ref name="The Brahmo Samaj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrahmosamaj.net/articles/tombinauguration.html|title=The Brahmo Samaj|website=www.thebrahmosamaj.net|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian High Commission at London often come to Raja's annual commemoration. Bristol's Lord Mayor shall also be in attendance. The commemoration is a joint Brahmo-Unitarian service, in which, prayers and hymns are sung, flowers laid at the tomb, and the life of the Raja is celebrated via talks and visual presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnosvale.org.uk/friends-of-arnos-vale-history/662-raja-rammohun-roy|title=Celebration at Arnos Vale|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206222214/http://www.arnosvale.org.uk/friends-of-arnos-vale-history/662-raja-rammohun-roy|archivedate=6 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a recently discovered ivory bust of Ram Mohan was  displayed.&lt;ref name="The Brahmo Samaj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrahmosamaj.net/articles/ivorybust.html|title=The Brahmo Samaj|website=www.thebrahmosamaj.net|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, his original death mask at Edinburgh was filmed and its history was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMdqmloNKCA|title=Bristol Remembers Rammohun Roy|first=|last=Suman Ghosh|date=27 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Raja's commemoration was held on 24 September &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishsouthindians.co.uk/tributes-paid-to-the-great-indian-social-reformer-raja-ram-mohan-roy-in-bristol/|title= Tributes paid to the great Indian social reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy in Bristol|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018, it will be held on the 30th of September.

==Bristol honours Ram Mohan Roy==
In 1983, a full-scale Exhibition on Ram Mohan Roy was held in Bristol's Museum and Art Gallery. His enormous 1831 portrait by [[Henry Perronet Briggs]] still hangs there and was the subject of a talk by Sir Max Muller in 1873. At Bristol's centre, on College Green, is a full-size bronze statue of the Raja by the modern [[Kolkata]] sculptor Niranjan Pradhan. Another bust by Pradhan, gifted to Bristol by Jyoti Basu, sits inside the main foyer of Bristol's City Hall.

A pedestrian path at Stapleton has been named "Rajah Rammohun Walk". There is a 1933 Brahmo plaque on the outside west wall of Stapleton Grove, and his first burial place in the garden is marked by railings and a granite memorial stone. His tomb and chattri at Arnos Vale are listed at Grade II* by [[English Heritage]] and attract many admiring visitors today.

The term '''Shambhala Buddhism''' was introduced by [[Sakyong Mipham]] in the year 2000 to describe his presentation of the [[Shambhala Training|Shambhala teachings]] originally conceived by [[Chögyam Trungpa]] as secular practices for achieving enlightened society, in concert with the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shambhala.org/about_shambhala.php |title=About Shambhala |publisher=shambhala.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129000209/http://www.shambhala.org/about_shambhala.php |archivedate=November 29, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shambhala Buddhist [[sangha]] considers Sakyong Mipham to be its head and the second in a lineage of Sakyongs; with his father, [[Chögyam Trungpa]], being the first.

==Distinguishing characteristics==
Shambhala Buddhism partly derives from the teachings of Shambhala, as originally proclaimed by Chögyam Trungpa, which state that "there is a natural source of radiance and brilliance in the world, which is the innate wakefulness of human beings. This is the basis, in myth and inspiration, of the Kingdom of [[Shambhala]], an enlightened society of fearlessness, dignity and compassion." Furthermore, "Shambhala vision applies to people of any faith, not just people who believe in Buddhism. The Shambhala vision does not distinguish a Buddhist from a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, a Moslem, a Hindu. That's why we call it the Shambhala kingdom. A kingdom should have lots of spiritual disciplines in it."&lt;ref name="Trungpa, 2001"&gt;{{cite book | title=Great Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala | publisher=Shambhala Publications | last=Trungpa, |first=C. | year=2001 | page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shambhala Buddhist sangha expresses this vision largely within Tibetan Buddhist concepts, terms, and practices, continuing its ties to contemporary [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineage holders, among them the [[Karmapa]] ([[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]]),&lt;ref&gt;Due to a controversy within the [[Karma Kagyu]] school over the recognition process, the identity of the current 17th Karmapa is disputed. See [[Karmapa controversy]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penor Rinpoche]] (d. March 27, 2009), and other important [[lama]]s. Many prominent lamas come and offer teachings to the community on a regular basis. However, certain aspects of Shambhala Buddhism, known as ''Shambhalian'' practices, are unique to the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]].[[Image:Great eastern sun.png|frame|left|The Great Eastern Sun]]

===Shambhala and Shambhala Training===
{{Main|Shambhala Training}}
[[File:Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]]
In 1976,at a party&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466–470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;, Trungpa Rinpoche began giving teachings, some of which were gathered and presented as [[Shambhala Training]],&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2001, pp. 233–247&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by his vision (see [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]]) of the legendary Kingdom of Shambhala. Shambhalian practices focus on using mindfulness/awareness meditation as a means of connecting with one's basic sanity and using that insight as inspiration for one's encounter with the world. The Shambhala of Chögyam Trungpa is essentially a [[secular]] approach to meditation, with roots in Buddhism as well as in other traditions, but accessible to individuals of any, or no religion. The greater social vision of Shambhala is that it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish [[enlightened society]]. Trungpa's book ''[[Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior]]'' provides a concise collection of the Shambhala views.

Shambhala Training is administered worldwide by Shambhala International. Shambhala Training is presented in a series of weekend programs, the first five of which are called "The Heart of Warriorship", and the subsequent seven "The Sacred Path". The Warrior Assembly is the fruition of the Shambhala Training Sacred Path program. During Warrior Assembly, students study the Shambhala terma text, The Golden Sun of the Great East, and receive the ashé practices of stroke and lungta.

===Shambhala within Shambhala Buddhism===
After the year 2000, with the merging of the secular teachings of Shambhala and the Buddhist teachings of [[Vajradhatu]] into Shambhala Buddhism, completion of Shambhala [[Vajrayana]] Seminary (which itself requires taking Buddhist refuge and bodhisattva vows, as well as Buddhist vajrayana [[samaya]] vows) became a condition for receiving the highest Shambhala teachings, such as those of Werma and the Scorpion Seal Retreat. In turn, Warrior Assembly became a prerequisite for attending the Vajrayana Seminary.

The Shambhala Seminary is a two-part seminary designed to deepen students' practice and understanding of the Buddhist and Shambhala teachings and to enter them into the vajrayana practices of the Shambhala Buddhist [[mandala]]. Part 1, Sutrayana Seminary, is led by a Shambhala acharya and provides in-depth training and study of the Hinayana, Mahayana, and Shambhala teachings. Part 2, Vajrayana Seminary, is led by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche and authorizes students to begin their Shambhala ngöndro—the preliminary practices for receiving the Rigden Abhisheka.

The Rigden Abhisheka enters the student into the practice of the Werma Sadhana. It is open to graduates of Shambhala Vajrayana Seminary who have completed their Shambhala ngöndro and to students who have already received the Werma Sadhana and completed their Kagyü Ngöndro.

===Shambhala Terma===
Certain Shambhala practices derive from specific terma texts of Trungpa Rinpoche's such as ''Letter of the Black Ashe'', ''Letter of the Golden Key that Fulfills Desire'', ''Golden Sun of the Great East'', and the ''Scorpion Seal of the Golden Sun'', in long and short versions. Trungpa Rinpoche is believed by his students to have received these teachings directly from [[Gesar of Ling]], an emanation of [[Padmasambhava]], and the [[Kings of Shambhala|Rigden]] kings.&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Their terma status was confirmed by the Nyingma master [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]].

The Shambhala dharma practices derived entirely or in part from these texts include those of ''[[werma]]'', ''[[Shambhala Training#The Four Dignities.2C Drala and the Lhasang ritual|drala]]'', ''[[Wind Horse]]'' (Tib. ''lungta''), and meditations on four "dignities of Shambhala": tiger (Tib. ''tak''), lion (Tib. ''seng''), garuda (Tib. ''kyung'') and dragon (Tib. ''druk''). [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]], a great 19th century Nyingma lama and the predecessor of [[Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche]], wrote about many of these practices and concepts as well. Some, such as the "stroke of Ashé", have no known precedents.

===The Kalachakra, the Rigden Kings, and Gesar of Ling===
The [[Kalachakra]] tradition is central to Shambhala Buddhism. Trungpa Rinpoche requested that the Kagyu Kalachakra master [[Kalu Rinpoche]] perform the initiation for his Vajrayana students, which he did in 1986 in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. The Rigden Kings of Shambhala are central figures to the community, and a [[thangka]] of the Rigden king is the centerpiece of all public Shambhala Buddhist shrines. [[Gesar of Ling]], a mythical Tibetan king, is also an important figure to Shambhala Buddhists, to whom he represents enlightened wisdom manifesting in the world as a leader. Many of the teachings of the Shambhala lineage derive from the ''Epic of Gesar'' as propagated by [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] the Great.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Zen Influence===
Trungpa Rinpoche was deeply influenced by his friend [[Shunryu Suzuki]] Roshi, a Japanese [[Zen]] master who was one of the first accomplished teachers to present [[dharma]] to Westerners.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} As a result of this influence, certain attributes of form in Shambhala Buddhism are derived from Zen, rather than Tibetan Buddhism. The shrine rooms in Shambhala Buddhism, reflecting the Zen aesthetic of ''Kanso'' (簡素) or simplicity, tend to be sparsely furnished and decorated, whereas traditional Tibetan Buddhist shrine rooms are elaborate, ornate, and colorful. As in Zen but unlike Tibetan Buddhist practice, meditators engage in group practice of shamatha-vipashyana.

In addition, Shambhala Buddhists have adopted the practices of [[kyūdō]], [[ikebana]] (kado), [[tea ceremony]], [[oryoki]], [[calligraphy]], and other traditional Japanese arts as a means of extending the mind of calm-abiding and awareness to more active practices.

===Elements of Bön, Taoism, and Confucianism===
To a lesser extent, Trungpa Rinpoche incorporated other elements into Shambhala tradition that he thought would be beneficial to practitioners. From the [[Bön]] religion, the lhasang ceremony is performed; other elements of shamanism play a role. From [[Confucianism]] comes a framework of heaven, earth, and man for understanding the proper relationship between different elements of compositions of all kinds. From [[Taoism]] comes the use of [[feng shui]] and other incorporations.

===Dorje Kasung===
The Dorje Kasung is a group that was formed by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche to support the transmission of the Shambhala teachings by helping create an appropriate environment for them to be taught in. The Dorje Kasung accomplish this by providing a gentle and uplifted presence at teaching events, providing security services, providing driving and personal assistance to the teachers, and working with any issues of conflict or health that may arise in the community.

The training and model of the Dorje Kasung is based on military forms, such as hierarchy, uniforms, and drills. The purpose of utilizing the military format is not to propagate war, but to take advantage of the discipline and energy of military forms to embody and communicate compassion.The practice of Dorje Kasungship is founded on the mahayana Buddhist principle of compassionate action, and inspired by the vajrayana Buddhist emphasis on working directly with the energy of neurosis and transforming it into wisdom. Thus, through engaging directly with military forms, they aspire to fulfill the vision expressed in their motto, "Victory Over War".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kalapamedia.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=BSE251|title=True Command: The Teachings of the Dorje Kasung|website=Kalapa Publications|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dorje Kasung follow the orders of the Sakyong.  Once, this involved breaking into a guest's room, forcibly bringing her to a party and then stripping her naked, while onlookers ignored her pleas for help and for someone to call the police.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466–470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maitri and Mudra===
Maitri is a therapeutic program that works with different styles of neurosis using principles of the [[Five Buddha Families]]. [[Mudra]] practice, first explored by the Mudra Theater Group, is based on traditional Tibetan monastic dance training and the teachings on [[mahamudra]].

===Shambhala Art===
Shambhala Art can be seen as a process, a product, and an art-education program. As a process, it brings wakefulness and awareness to the creative and viewing processes through the integration of contemplation and meditation. As a product, it is art that wakes us up. Shambhala Art is also an international nonprofit art-education program based on the Dharma Art teachings of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the founder of Shambhala. Its purpose is to explore, from the viewpoint of a meditative discipline, the creative process and the product called art.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Shambhala Buddhism holds various meditation techniques of traditional Tibetan Buddhist lineages, including shamatha/vipashyana, zazen, [[madhayamaka]], [[mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]], tonglen, [[Lojong]], traditional yidam practices such as [[Vajrayogini]], [[Chakrasamvara]], [[Vajrakilaya]], Jambhala, [[Gesar]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], [[Manjushri]], and [[Vajrasattva]].

==History==
{{Prose|section|date=September 2009}}

{{Main|Vajradhatu}}

The term "Shambhala Buddhism", as used to describe the lineage and community led by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, came into use around 2000. 
* In 1970, the Shambhala community had its origins with the arrival of the 11th [[Trungpa tülkus|Trungpa]] [[tülku]], Trungpa Rinpoche, in North America. The first established center of his teachings was "Tail of the Tiger" in [[Barnet, Vermont]] (now [[Karmê Chöling]]).
* In 1971, a second branch of the community began to form when Rinpoche began teaching at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. The Rocky Mountain Dharma Center was established, now known as [[Shambhala Mountain Center]], near Fort Collins, Colorado. In the early 1970s the community grew rapidly and attracted the involvement of such notables as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Anne Waldman]], and many others
* In 1973, the Shambhala community was incorporated in Colorado as [[Vajradhatu]]. Vajradhatu hosted visits by the Sixteenth Karmapa (head of the Kagyu School) in 1974, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (head of the Nyingma School) in 1976, and the [[Fourteenth Dalai Lama]] in 1981.
* In 1974, Naropa Institute was founded, a contemplative studies and liberal arts college, now fully accredited as [[Naropa University]].&lt;ref name="chronicleproject.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=11th Trungpa Chronology |url=http://www.chronicleproject.com/chronology.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212638/http://chronicleproject.com/chronology.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1975, Shambhala Lodge was founded, a group of students dedicated to fostering enlightened society.
* In 1975, at an October party at Snowmass Colorado Seminary, Trungpa Rinpoche ordered his Vajra guard (i.e., the Dorje Kasung) to forcibly break into the room of his guest, Dana Naone, who he then ordered to be brought before the crowd and stripped naked, with onlookers ignoring her pleas for help and for someone to call the police.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466–470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1976, Trungpa Rinpoche began his cycle of [[Shambhala#The Shambhala of Chogyam Trungpa|Shambhala]] teachings and, with his students, manifesting forms of Shambhala society. Kalapa Court was established in Boulder, Colorado, as Trungpa Rinpoche's residence and a cultural center for the Vajradhatu community. [[Ösel Tendzin|Thomas F. Rich]] was empowered as Vajra Regent [[Ösel Tendzin]] and lineage holder in the Karma Kagyü and Nyingma lineages.
* In 1977, Shambhala Training was founded to promote a secular approach to meditation practice and an appreciation of basic human goodness.&lt;ref name="chronicleproject.com" /&gt; The Gyalwa Karmapa, the head of the Kagyü lineage, confirmed the Vajra Regent's appointment as a lineage holder. Ösel Tendzin was the first Western student to hold such a position in the Kagyü lineage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ösel Tendzin|Tendzin]] Shambhala Bio {{cite web |url=http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/vrot/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011015454/http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/vrot/ |archivedate=October 11, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1978, Trungpa Rinpoche conducted the first annual Kalapa Assembly, an intensive training program for advanced Shambhala teachings and practices.&lt;ref name="chronicleproject.com" /&gt;
* In 1979, Trungpa Rinpoche empowered his eldest son, [[Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo]], as his successor and heir to the Shambhala lineage.&lt;ref name="chronicleproject.com" /&gt;
* In 1986, Trungpa moved the international headquarters of [[Vajradhatu]] to [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], where he died the following year. A large number of his disciples emigrated from the United States to Nova Scotia along with him.
* In 1987, after Trungpa's death, Tendzin's role as spiritual head of [[Vajradhatu]] lasted until around 1989. Citing an [[AIDS]]-related infection, allegations arose that Tendzin had passed [[HIV]] to a male partner in the Colorado congregation, who in turn unknowingly infected his female partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Church's Turmoil |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1989 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/26/weekinreview/headliners-a-church-s-turmoil.html |accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tendzin, who was HIV-positive, knowingly had sex with students for three years without disclosing his infection.  He had a delusion that his enlightened status protected himself and others from AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buddhist Sect Alarmed by Reports that Leader Kept His AIDS a Secret |author=John Dart |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 3, 1989 |url=http://www.aegis.com/news/lt/1989/LT890302.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990819001619/http://www.aegis.com/news/lt/1989/LT890302.html |archivedate=August 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually came out that the Vajradhatu board of directors had known of the problem for more than two years and had done nothing about it.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, James William. ''The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition'' (2001) Oxford University Press. Page 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
* After the death of Ösel Tendzin in 1990, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo became spiritual head of what would become Shambhala International.
* In 1995, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo was recognized by [[Penor Rinpoche]] as the reincarnation of [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]] and enthroned as Sakyong. The Sakyong—literally "earth-protector"—is a chögyal—"dharma king"—who holds and propagates the teachings of Shambhala.&lt;ref&gt;Sakyong Shambhala Bio https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004539/http://www.mipham.com/biography.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2000, at the Kalapa Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/lodge/collaboration/index.htm Kalapa Assembly 2000 Collaborations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020060432/http://www.shambhala.org/lodge/collaboration/index.htm |date=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakyong Mipham made a proclamation&lt;ref&gt;Mipham Rinpoche, Sakyong. (2000) "Shambhala Buddhism". Published letter&lt;/ref&gt; that started the process of enclosing the previously secular teachings of Shambhala within the container of a new buddhist lineage, Shambhala Buddhism.
* In 2001, on a visit to Tibet, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche met the 12th [[Trungpa tülkus|Trungpa]] [[tülku]], [[Choseng Trungpa]] Rinpoche, an incarnation discovered by [[Tai Situ]] Rinpoche in 1991.
* In August 2007, The Sakyong married Khandro Tseyang Palmo with a ceremony conducted by Drupwang Penor Rinpoche during the Kalapa Festival in Halifax. Khandro Tseyang Palmo is currently the Sakyong Wangmo, a title held previously by Lady Diana Mukpo, now the Druk Sakyong Wangmo.
* In July 2018, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche stepped down from leadership after the release of a third-party investigative report extensively documenting numerous accounts of sexual misconduct involving his students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buddhistdoor.net/news/sakyong-mipham-rinpoche-steps-down-from-shambhala-leadership-amid-probe-into-conduct&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://andreamwinn.com/project_sunshine/Buddhist_Project_Sunshine_Phase_2_Final_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tarquinia Molza''' (1 November 1542 – 8 August 1617) was an Italian singer, poet, conductor, composer, and [[natural philosopher]].&lt;ref name=Drinker&gt;{{cite book|last=Drinker|first=Sophie|title=Music and women : the story of women in their relation to music|year=1999|publisher=The Feminist Press at the City Univ. of New York|location=New York|isbn=1558611169|page=222|edition=[Reprinted]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogilvie|first=Marilyn Bailey|chapter=Molza, Tarquinia |title=Women in science : antiquity through the nineteenth century : a biographical dictionary with annotated bibliography|date=1986|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262650380|page=139|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was considered a great ''[[virtuoso|virtuosa]]''. She was involved with the famous ''[[Concerto delle donne]]'', although whether she sang with them or coached them is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Grove'' article on Tarquinia Molza says that she did not sing with them, however the "Women in Music" article says she did sing with them.&lt;/ref&gt; She also played the [[viola bastarda]].

==Early life and education==
Molza was born in [[Modena]], the granddaughter&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Anthony |last=Newcomb |title=Molza, Tarquinia |encyclopedia=[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/18918 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riley |first=Joanne |chapter=Tarquinia Molza (1542 - 1617): A Case Study of Women, Music and Society in the Renaissance |editor-last=Zaimont|editor-first=Judith Lang|title=The musical woman : an international perspective, volume II, 1984-1985|date=1987|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0313235887|editor2-last=Overhauser |editor2-first=Catherine |editor3-first=Jane |editor3-last=Gottlieb |url=http://works.bepress.com/joanne_riley/3 |pages=470&amp;ndash;493}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the poet [[:it:Francesco Maria Molza|Francesco Maria Molza]], and the daughter of Camillus and Isabella Colombi.&lt;ref name=Jaffe /&gt; Her father agreed that she should have the same education as her brothers, and she learned Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and philosophy until she was sixteen.&lt;ref name=Jaffe /&gt; She studied with the scientist John Politiano and the poet Francis Patrizio, and learned astronomy from the mathematician Antony Guarini.&lt;ref name="Mossman 1870 135"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mossman|first=Samuel|title=Gems of Womanhood, Or, Sketches of Distinguished Women in Various Ages and Nations|year=1870|publisher=Gall &amp; Inglis|location=Edinburgh|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She married Paolo Porrino in 1560, who supported her returning to school, where she studied with [[Francesco Patrizi]].&lt;ref name=Jaffe /&gt; She was widowed by 1579.

==Musical career==
By 1583 she was living in [[Ferrara]] in the official capacity of lady-in-waiting to Duchess [[Margherita Gonzaga d'Este]], where she was a famous performer, conductor, and composer. Molza was dismissed from her position in 1589 and returned to Mantua when she was accused of having an affair with Flemish composer [[Giaches de Wert]]. Minor nobility (as ladies-in-waiting to the duchess were considered) were not to involve themselves with members of the servant class (as minor composers such as Wert were considered).&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fenlon&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Iain |last=Fenlon |title=Wert, Giaches de |encyclopedia=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/40707|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that her relationship with Wert was a friendship, and not sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Project Continua|title=Tarquinia Molza|url=http://www.projectcontinua.org/molza-tarquinia/|accessdate=1 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203004745/http://www.projectcontinua.org/molza-tarquinia/|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Molza wrote poetry in Latin and Tuscan dialect; she also wrote essays.&lt;ref name="Mossman 1870 135"/&gt;

==Literary and Artistic Representations==
Many artistic works were dedicated to her; [[Francesco Patrizi]] wrote about her singing in his treatise ''L'amorosa filosofia'', and she was perhaps the first singer to have a published biography dedicated to her (''Opuscoli inediti di Tarquinia Molza modenese'' by D. Vandelli).&lt;ref name=Jander&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Owen |last=Jander |author2= Elizabeth Forbes, Stanley Sadie, J.B. Steane, Ellen T.

Her name appears among those on the [[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]] of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Tarquinia Molza|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/tarquinia_molza.php|publisher=Brooklyn Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Molza was granted [[Roman citizenship]] in 1600, the only woman to have citizenship. The decree stated, "although the Senate has never accepted women in to the ranks of citizenship…[it is resolved that] Tarquinia Molza of Modena be numbered in the ranks of its most noble citizens with the title ''l'Unica'', never before bestowed on anyone, in recognition of her singular virtues and merits."&lt;ref name=Jaffe&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaffe|first=Irma B. and Gernando Colombardo|title=Shining Eyes, Cruel Fortune: The Lives and Loves of Italian Renaissance Women Poets|year=2002|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|isbn=0823221806|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Theory of Basic Human values''', developed by [[Shalom H. Schwartz]], is a theory in the field of intercultural research. The author considers the theory as an essential extension of previous approaches to comparative intercultural research theories,&lt;ref name="Schwartz-Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Shalom H.|title=An Overview of the Schwartz Theory of Basic Values|journal=Online Readings in Psychology and Culture|date=2012|volume=2 | issue = 1 |doi=10.9707/2307-0919.1116}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory]], and has been extensively applied in cross-cultural studies of individual values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=John|last2=Janek|first2=Pandey|last3=Poortinga|first3=Ype|title=Handbook of cross-cultural psychology|date=1997|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780205160747|page=77|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theory of Basic Human Values tries to measure [[Universal value|Universal Values]] that are recognised throughout all major cultures. Schwartz’s theory identifies ten such motivationally distinct values and further describes the dynamic relations amongst them. To better graphically portray these relationships, the theory arranges the ten values in a circular structure.

In the 2012 article, Schwartz and colleagues presented a refined set of 19 basic individual values that serve as "guiding principles in the life of a person or group".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Shalom H.|last2=Cieciuch|first2=Jan|last3=Vecchione|first3=Michele|last4=Davidov|first4=Eldad|last5=Fischer|first5=Ronald|last6=Beierlein|first6=Constanze|last7=Ramos|first7=Alice|last8=Verkasalo|first8=Markku|last9=Lönnqvist|first9=Jan-Erik|date=2012-10|title=Refining the theory of basic individual values|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=103|issue=4|pages=663–688|doi=10.1037/a0029393|issn=1939-1315|pmid=22823292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivational types of values ==
The Theory of Basic Human Values recognises ten universal values, which can be organised in four higher-order groups. Each of the ten universal values has a central goal that is the underlying motivator.&lt;ref name="Schwartz-Overview"/&gt;

=== Openness to change ===
'''Self-Direction''' 	Independent thought and action—choosing, creating, exploring.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Stimulation'''       Excitement, novelty and challenge in life.

=== Self-enhancement ===
'''Hedonism''' 	Pleasure or sensuous gratification for oneself.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Achievement''' 	Personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Power''' 	Social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources.

=== Conservation ===
'''Security''' 	Safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Conformity''' 	Restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses likely to upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Tradition''' 	Respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that one's culture or religion provides.

=== Self-transcendence ===
'''Benevolence''' 	Preserving and enhancing the welfare of those with whom one is in frequent personal contact (the ‘in-group’).&lt;br /&gt;
'''Universalism''' 	Understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature.

=== Other ===
'''Spirituality''' was considered as an additional eleventh value, however, it was found that it did not exist in all cultures.&lt;ref name="Schwartz-Universals"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Shalom H.|title=Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries.|journal=Advances in Experimental Psychology|date=1992|pages=1–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The structure of value relations ==
In addition to identifying the ten basic values, the theory also explains how these ten values are interconnected and influence each other, since the pursuit of any of the values results in either an accordance with one another (conformity and security) or a conflict with at least one other value (benevolence and power). Tradition and conformity share particularly similar motivational goals and consequently are consolidated in the same wedge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schwartz|first=Shalom H.|title=Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries|date=1992|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60281-6|work=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|pages=1–65|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60281-6|isbn=9780120152254|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Values can lightly or more strongly oppose each other, which has led to the organisation of the values in a circular structure along two bipolar dimensions. The first dimension is '''openness to change''' versus '''conservation''', which contrasts independence and obedience. The second bipolar dimension is '''self-enhancement''' versus '''self-transcendence''' and is concerned on the one side with the interests of one-self and on the other side of the welfare of others.
Although the theory distinguishes ten values, the borders between the motivators are artificial and one value flows into the next, which can be seen by the following shared motivational emphases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schwartz|first=Shalom H.|title=Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries|date=1992|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60281-6|work=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|pages=1–65|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60281-6|isbn=9780120152254|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#	'''Power''' and '''Achievement'''—social superiority and esteem;
#	'''Achievement''' and '''Hedonism'''—self-centred satisfaction;
#	'''Hedonism''' and '''Stimulation'''—a desire for affectively pleasant arousal;
#	'''Stimulation''' and '''Self-direction'''—intrinsic interest in novelty and mastery;
#	'''Self-direction''' and '''Universalism—'''reliance upon one's own judgement and comfort with the diversity of existence;
#	'''Universalism''' and '''Benevolence'''—enhancement of others and transcendence of selfish interests;
#	'''Benevolence''' and '''Tradition'''—devotion to one's in-group;
#	'''Benevolence''' and '''Conformity'''—normative behaviour that promotes close relationships;
#	'''Conformity''' and '''Tradition'''—subordination of self in favour of socially imposed expectations;
#	'''Tradition''' and '''Security'''—preserving existing social arrangements that give certainty to life;
#	'''Conformity''' and '''Security'''—protection of order and harmony in relations;
#	'''Security''' and '''Power'''—avoiding or overcoming threats by controlling relationships and resources.

Furthermore, people are still able to follow opposing values through acting differently in different settings or at different times. The structure of Schwartz's 10-value type model (see graph above) has been supported across over 80 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bilsky|first=Wolfgang|last2=Janik|first2=Michael|last3=Schwartz|first3=Shalom H.|date=2010-07-20|title=The Structural Organization of Human Values-Evidence from Three Rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS)|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022110362757|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=42|issue=5|pages=759–776|doi=10.1177/0022022110362757|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schwartz|first=Shalom H.|title=Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries|date=1992|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60281-6|work=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|pages=1–65|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60281-6|isbn=9780120152254|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Shalom H.|last2=Sagiv|first2=Lilach|date=1995-01|title=Identifying Culture-Specifics in the Content and Structure of Values|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022195261007|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=92–116|doi=10.1177/0022022195261007|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt; women and men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Struch|first=Naomi|last2=Schwartz|first2=Shalom H.|last3=van der Kloot|first3=Willem A.|date=2002-01|title=Meanings of Basic Values for Women and Men: A Cross-Cultural Analysis|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167202281002|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=16–28|doi=10.1177/0146167202281002|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt; various methods such as importance ratings of values (using the surveys listed below), direct similarity judgment tasks, pile sorting, and spatial arrangement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coelho|first=Gabriel Lins de Holanda|last2=Hanel|first2=Paul H.P.|last3=Johansen|first3=Mark K.|last4=Maio|first4=Gregory R.|date=2018-08-30|title=Mapping the Structure of Human Values through Conceptual Representations|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2170|journal=European Journal of Personality|language=en|doi=10.1002/per.2170|issn=0890-2070}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even for how the values of other people, such as family members, are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skimina|first=Ewa|last2=Cieciuch|first2=Jan|date=2015|title=Value structure and priorities:

== Measurement methods ==
Several models have been developed to measure the basic values to ensure that the values theory is valid independent of the methodology employed. The main differentiator between the '''Schwartz Value Survey''' and the '''Portrait Values Questionnaire''' is that the former is explicit, while the latter is implicit.

=== Schwartz Value Survey ===
The Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) reports values of participants explicitly, by asking them to conduct a self-assessment. The survey entails 57 questions with two lists of value items. The first list consist of 30 nouns, while the second list contains 26 or 27 items in an adjective form. Each item is followed by a brief description for clarification. Out of the 57 questions 45 are used to compute the 10 different value types, of which the number of items to measure a certain value varies according to the conceptual breath. The remaining 12 items are used to allow better standardisation in calculation of an individual’s value.
The importance of each of value item is measured on a nonsymmetrical scale in order to encourage the respondents to think about each of the questions.
	
* 	7 (supreme importance)
* 	6 (very important)
* 	5, 4 (unlabelled)
* 	3 (important)
* 	2, 1 (unlabelled)
* 	0 (not important)
* 	−1 (opposed to my values)
The survey has been conducted so far on more than 60,000 individuals in 64 nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Schwartz|first2=Shalom|title=Whence Differences in Value Priorities? : Individual, Cultural, or Artifactual Sources|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date=2011|volume=42|pages=1127–1145|doi=10.1177/0022022110381429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) has been developed as an alternative to the SVS. The PVQ has been created primarily for children from 11–14, however, also has shown to produce coherent results when given to adults. In comparison to the SVS the PVQ relies on indirect reporting. Hereby, the respondent is asked to compare himself/herself (gender-matched) with short verbal portraits of 40 different people. After each portrait the responded has to state how similar he or she is to the portrait person ranging from “very much like me” to “not like me at all”. This way of research allows to how the individual actually acts rather than research what values are important to an individual. Similar to the SVS the portraits for each value varies according to the conceptual breath.

== Limitations ==
One of the main limitations of this theory lies in the methodology of the research. The SVS is quite difficult to answer, because respondents have to first read the set of 30 value items and give one value the highest as well as the lowest ranking (0 or -1, depending on whether an item is opposed to their values). Hence, completing one questionnaire takes approximately 12 minutes resulting in a significant amount of only half-filled in forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindeman|first1=Marjaana|last2=Verkasalo|first2=Markku|title=Measuring Values With the Short Schwartz's Value Survey|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=2005|volume=85|pages=170–178|doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa8502_09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, many respondents have a tendency to give the majority of the values a high score, resulting in a skewed responses to the upper end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hood|first1=Jacqueline|title=The Relationship of Leadership Style and CEO Values to Ethical Practices in Organizations|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=2003|volume=43|pages=263–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another methodological limitations are the resulting ordinal, ipsatised scores that limit the type of useful analyses researchers can perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Julie A.|last2=Soutar|first2=Geoffrey N.|last3=Louviere|first3=Jordan J.|title=An Alternative Approach to Measuring Schwartz's Values: The Best-Worst Scaling Approach|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=2005|volume=90|pages=335–347|doi=10.1080/00223890802107925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical applications ==
Recent studies advocate that values can influence the audience’s reaction to advertising appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piirto|first1=Jane|title=I Live in My Own Bubble: The Values of Talented Adolescents|journal=The Journal of Secondary Gifted Education|date=2005|pages=106–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the case that a choice and a value are intervened, people tend to pick the choice that aligns more with their own values. Therefore, models such as the Theory of Basic Human Values could be seen as increasingly important for international marketing campaigns, as they can help to understand values and how values vary between cultures. This becomes especially true as it has been shown that values are one of the most powerful explanations of consumer behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beatty|first1=Sharon E.|title=Alternative Measurement Approaches to Consumer Values: The List of Values and the Rokeach Value Survey|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=2005|pages=181–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the different values and underlying defining goals can also help organisations to better motivate staff in an increasingly international workforce and create an according organizational structure.

Recently, Schwartz's work—and that of [[Geert Hofstede]]—has been applied to economics research. Specifically, the performance of the economies as it relates to entrepreneurship and business (firm) creation. This has significant implications to economic growth and might help explain why some countries are lagging behind others when labor, natural resources, and governing institutions are equal. This is a relatively new field of study in economics, however the recent empirical results suggest that culture plays a significant role in the success of entrepreneurial efforts across countries—even ones with largely similar governmental structures. Francisco Liñán and José Fernandez-Serrano found that these cultural attributes accounted for 60% of the difference in [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) variance per capita in countries within the European Union (EU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = National culture, entrepreneurship and economic development: different patterns across the European Union|last = Liñán|first = Francisco|date = 2014|journal = Small Business Economics, vol 42, Issue 4, pp 685-701|doi = 10.1007/s11187-013-9520-x|pmid = |access-date =|volume=42|pages=685–701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyndon LaRouche]] and the [[LaRouche movement]] have expressed controversial views on a wide variety of topics. The LaRouche movement is made up of activists who follow LaRouche's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Evening Independent|author=Donald Kaul|title=LaRouche might awaken Democratic party|page=12A|quote="by "he" I mean all LaRouche followers; internal dissent is not a big number with them"|date=April 10, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery of dead Briton and the right-wing cult|first=Jerome |last=Taylor|work=The Independent|location=London (UK)|date=February 27, 2010 |page=12 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mystery-of-dead-briton-and-the-rightwing-cult-1912336.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and politics==
According to Matko Meštrović, emeritus senior research fellow at the Institute of Economics of [[Zagreb]], Croatia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eizg.hr/default.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/emeriti-en-US/105.aspx|title=Naslovna|author=|date=|website=Ekonomski institut, Zagreb}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche's economic policies, developed from originally Marxist beginnings, call for a program modeled on the economic-recovery program of the [[Franklin Roosevelt]] administration, including [[fixed exchange rates]], [[capital controls]], [[exchange controls]], [[currency controls]], and [[protectionism|protectionist]] price and trade agreements among partner-nations.&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meštrović"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Davorka |editor1-last=Vidovic|editor2-first= Davor |editor2-last=Paukovic|first=Matko |last=Meštrović|chapter=What is Global Change?|title=Globalization and Neo-liberalism (Reflections on Croatian Society)|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfiV0UvHDF4C&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=July 10, 2011|publisher=CPI/PSRC|location=Zagreb, Croatia|isbn=978-953-7022-16-7|year=2007|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche also calls for a reorganization of debt world-wide, and a global plan for large-scale, continental infrastructure projects.&lt;ref name="Meštrović" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Beltran /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrats fear LaRouche takeover; Followers of fringe candidate seek seats on Alameda County Democratic Central Committee |first=Matt |last=Carter  |publisher=Oakland Tribune |location=Oakland, Calif |date=February 23, 2004 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejects [[free trade]], [[deregulation]], and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="Meštrović" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the machines: minor parties and independents in New South Wales, 1910–2006|series=NSW Sesquicentenary of Responsible Government Series|first=Rodney|last=Smith |publisher=Federation Press|year=2006|isbn= 9781862876231  |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist roots===
Lyndon LaRouche began his political career as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]&lt;ref name="TourishWohlforth2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tourish|first1=Dennis|last2=Wohlforth|first2=Tim|title=On the edge: political cults right and left|year=2000|publisher=M.E.

LaRouche no longer opposes private ownership of the means of production, and his analysis of political events is no longer phrased in terms of class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2010-03/31/c_1210286.htm |title=The Current World Financial System is Unsalvageable (现行的世界金融体系已经无可救药) |first= Ju |last=Hui (鞠辉) |newspaper=[[China Youth Daily]] |date=July 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tim Wohlforth]], during and after his break with Trotskyism, LaRouche's theory was influenced by what he called his "Theory of Hegemony" derived from [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s view of the role of intellectuals in being a [[vanguard party|vanguard]] helping workers develop their consciousness and realize their leading role in society. He was influenced by [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s concept of a [[hegemon]] as an intellectual and cultural elite which directs social thought. LaRouche's theory saw himself and his followers as becoming such a hegemonic force. He rejected Gramsci's notion of "organic intellectuals" being developed by the working class itself. Rather, the working class would be led by elite intellectuals such as himself.&lt;ref name="TW"&gt;{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Wohlforth | url=http://www.publiceye.org/larouche/Wohlforth.html | title=A '60's Socialist Takes a Hard Right | work=Political Research Associates | date=n.d. | accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche was influenced by his readings of [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s ''[[The Accumulation of Capital]]'' and [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' developing his own "theory of reindustrialization", saying that the West would attempt to industrialize the [[Third World]], particularly [[India]], and attempt to solve the economic crisis both by developing new markets in the Third World and using its cheap and surplus labor to increase profits and minimize costs (see [[neocolonialism]].) To oppose this, LaRouche argued for a "reindustrialization" of the United States with himself at the vanguard of the effort allowing him to personally resolve the [[crisis of capitalism]]. Though his arguments have since been stripped of their quasi-Marxist language and citations, his core theories have remained essentially the same since the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;

====''Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy''====
In ''Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy'', a book published in 1975 by [[D. C. Heath and Company]] under the pen name Lyn Marcus, LaRouche tried to show that numerous Marxists – ranging from the ''[[Monthly Review]]'' group to [[Ernest Mandel]], Vladimir Lenin, [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Fidel Castro]] and the "Soviet economists" – had failed to correctly understand and interpret Marx's writing. Marxists he admired – apart from Marx himself – were [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]].

According to a review by [[Martin Bronfenbrenner]] in ''[[The Journal of Political Economy]]'', about half of the book was devoted to dialectical philosophy, "with a strong epistemological stress", with the other half devoted to discussions of economic and general history, anthropology and sociology, and actual economics, including a surprisingly large helping of business administration – Bronfenbrenner noted that LaRouche seemed to have "more private-business experience than the great majority of academic economists", including a familiarity with the way speculative [[overcapitalization]], operating at the borders of [[white-collar crime]], creates "fictitious capitals" that later do not match their actual earning power. Like [[Thorstein Veblen]], LaRouche subscribed to an overcapitalization theory of [[economic depression]].&lt;ref name=HigherEd&gt;McLemee, Scott. [http://www.insidehighered.com/views/mclemee/mclemee132 The LaRouche Youth Movement], ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', July 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bronf /&gt;

According to Bronfenbrenner, LaRouche viewed conventional economics as a "withered arm of philosophy", which had taken a wrong turn towards [[reductionism]] under the influence of [[Empiricism#British empiricism|British empiricists]] such as [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]].&lt;ref name=Bronf /&gt; LaRouche's definition of reductionism was as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental fallacy of ordinary understanding is the delusion that the universe is reducible to simple substance, or—the more Hume-like view—that the content of human knowledge is limited to simple-substance-like, self-evident sense perceptions. This discredited outlook—whether it takes the naive mechanistic [form] or the equivalent mechanistic outlook of empiricism—is termed ''reductionism''. All varieties of reductionism are formally premised on the fallacious assumption of formal logic, that the universe can be represented as discrete points interconnected by formal relations.&lt;ref name=Bronf /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this it followed, Bronfenbrenner said, that LaRouche viewed bourgeois economists' concern with ''prices'' as reductionism, versus the Marxian concern with ''values''. The reductionist fallacy then lies in adjusting a value theory like [[labor theory]] to fit in with price theory; in LaRouche's view, economists should work in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=Bronf /&gt;

According to Bronfenbrenner, LaRouche viewed capitalist America as headed for a kind of fascism not much better than that of the Nazis; but he noted that LaRouche's own vision of socialism, and the trade-off between necessity and freedom in a centrally [[planned economy]], seemed apt to result in the justification of a different kind of dictatorship:&lt;ref name=Bronf /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Judging from his controversial manner, [LaRouche] impresses at least one reader as a Me-for-Dictator type to whom it would be dangerous to entrust the task of drawing any boundary between the domain of freedom and that of necessity or order.&lt;ref name=Bronf&gt;Bronfenbrenner, Martin. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1830175 "Economics in Dialectical Dialect"], ''[[The Journal of Political Economy]]'', Vol. 84, No. 1 (Feb., 1976), pp. 123–130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===LaRouche's campaign platforms===
The campaign platforms of LaRouche and his followers have included these elements:

===Later orientation===
According to ''[[China Youth Daily|China Youth Daily Online]]'', LaRouche was once a Marxist, but now supports capitalism. He supports public control of financial capital and low-interest loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2010-03/31/c_1210286.htm |title=The Current World Financial System is Unsalvageable (现行的世界金融体系已经无可救药) |first= Ju |last=Hui (鞠辉) |newspaper=[[China Youth Daily]] |date=July 24, 2009 }} Lyndon LaRouche [...] used to endorse Marxism, but later switched to supporting the American-style capitalist economy. [...]  He also states that if the public controlled the financial capital and revitalized industries with low-interest loans, American people can return to the spirit of innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche said banks should not be bailed out, but be placed in receivership by the state.  He said that a "[[Firewall (construction)|firewall]]" should prevent state aid from being diverted to speculative entities, which should be allowed to fail, and that such failures would clean up the financial markets.&lt;ref name=Caizzi&gt;{{cite news |last=Caizzi |first=Ivo |title=La Bretton Woods 2 di LaRouche e Tremonti |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/ottobre/20/Bretton_Woods_LaRouche_Tremonti_ce_0_081020029.shtml |work=Corriere della Sera |date=October 20, 2008 }} {{cite web |title=Google translation |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/ottobre/20/Bretton_Woods_LaRouche_Tremonti_ce_0_081020029.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche believes in the principles of the [[New Deal]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and favors state intervention in the economy. LaRouche also said that he supported the approach of U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]], who established a banking system geared to develop production.&lt;ref name=Caizzi/&gt;

Italian Economics Minister [[Giulio Tremonti]] said that he had encountered LaRouche at a debate held in 2007 in Rome, and that he appreciates LaRouche's writings. According to an article by Ivo Caizzi in ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', a group of Italian Senators led by [[Oskar Peterlini]] asked the Berlusconi government to tackle the financial crisis using legislation developed by LaRouche in 2007. The legislation proposed that public money should save only the commercial infrastructure required for the financing of productive enterprises.&lt;ref name=Caizzi/&gt;

The "Triple Curve", or "typical collapse function", is an economic model developed by LaRouche which tries to illustrate the growth of financial aggregates at the expense of the physical economy and how this leads to an inevitably collapsing [[bubble economy]]. According to the ''China Youth Daily Online'' interview, LaRouche's main point is that the [[real economy]] (production) is dropping while the nominal economy (money and financial instruments) is going up. As the nominal economy greatly overreaches the real economy, an unavoidable economic crisis ensues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zqb.cyol.com/content/2009-07/24/content_2771606.htm |title=The Current World Financial System is Unsalvageable (现行的世界金融体系已经无可救药) |first= Ju |last=Hui (鞠辉) |newspaper=China Youth Daily |date= July 24, 2009 }} His basic points about the unavoidability of the current US economic crisis are: the production of real goods is constantly dropping, but the credit supplies are steadily increasing, the real and nominal economies form two curves with one going up, and another one going down, which creates a great contrast. When the nominal economy greatly overreaches the real economy, the world will fall into an economic crisis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, the LaRouche movement has:
*Called for a [[debt moratorium|moratorium]] on [[Third World]] debt.&lt;ref name=Beltran&gt;{{cite news |last=Beltran |first=Jill |title=Group proposes steps vs. economic crisis |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2008/10/26/news/group.proposes.steps.vs.economic.crisis.html |newspaper=Sun-Star |location=Manila |date=October 26, 2008 |access-date=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028234535/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2008/10/26/news/group.proposes.steps.vs.economic.crisis.html |archive-date=October 28, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Qazwini |first=Iqbal |title=Major International Crises Need a Giant Project to Overcome Them |url=http://www.aawsat.com/leader.asp?section=3&amp;issueno=8822&amp;article=148496 |newspaper= [[Asharq al-Awsat]] |date= January 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Opposed [[deregulation]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; According to LaRouche's publications, "LaRouche has consistently called for reregulation of utilities, transportation, health care (under the "Hill-Burton" standard), the financial (especially the speculative markets) and other sectors..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Campaign 2004: Where they stand |url=http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2003/3050wh_th_stand_econ.html |publisher=larouchepub.com |date=December 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They support the renewal of [[Glass–Steagall Act]] regulations on banks.&lt;ref name="Santangelo"/&gt;
*In 2007, LaRouche proposed a "Homeowners and Bank Protection Act". This called for the establishment of a federal agency that would "place federal- and state-chartered banks under protection, freeze all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjust mortgage values to fair prices, restructure existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates, and write off speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities". The bill envisioned a foreclosure moratorium, allowing homeowners to make the equivalent of rental payments for an interim period, and an end to bank bail-outs, forcing banks to reorganize under bankruptcy laws. A LaRouche spokesman said that bank bail-outs "reward corrupt swindlers with taxpayer money". The proposal attracted support from Democrats at city council and state legislature level. Pennsylvania Democrat [[Paul Kanjorski]] opposed the bill, stating it would involve government seizure of "every American bank". Mike Colpitts of ''Housing Predictor'' stated that LaRouche's economic forecasts had been correct, and that he might have received more mainstream credibility had it not been for his controversial history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saukvalley.com/articles/2007/11/02/news/state/293146607163817.txt "Former candidate returns to Illinois"], saukvalley.com, November 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoplatonism==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|LaRouche references an old dispute between Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), here illustrated in a fresco by [[Raphael]]. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation. Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 1983 193"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
LaRouche's philosophy references an old dispute between Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle believed in knowledge through empirical observation and experience. Plato believed in [[The Forms]].
According to LaRouche, history has always been a battle between [[Platonism|Platonists]]—[[Rationalism|rationalists]], idealists and utopians who believe in absolute truth and the [[Theory of forms|primacy of ideas]]—and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]]—relativists who rely on [[empiricism|empirical]] data and sensory perception. Platonists in LaRouche's worldview include figures such as [[Beethoven]], [[Mozart]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. LaRouche states that many of the world's ills are due to the fact that Aristotelianism, as embraced by British philosophers like [[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and represented by "oligarchs", foremost among them wealthy British families, has dominated, leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], embraces [[moral relativism]], and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. LaRouche frames this struggle as an ancient one, and sees himself and his movement in the tradition of the [[philosopher-king]]s in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toumey|1996|p=85ff.}}

*For the list of friends and foes, see {{harvnb|Johnson|1983}}, pp. 22, 188, 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche and his followers use Neoplatonism as the basis for an economic model that posits "the absolute necessity of progress". Economies evolve in stages as humanity devises new technologies, stages that LaRouche compares to the hierarchical spheres in Kepler's model of the solar system based on the [[Platonic solids]]. The purpose of science, technology and business must be to assist this progress, enabling the Earth to support an ever-growing humanity. Human life is the supreme value in LaRouche's world view; environmentalism and [[population control]] are seen as retrogressive steps, promoting a return to the Dark Ages. Rather than curtailing progress, because of dwindling resources, LaRouche advocates using nuclear technology to make more energy available to humanity, freeing humanity to enjoy music and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=196, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kepler-solar-system-1.png|right|thumb|Kepler's Platonic solid model of the solar system from ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (1596)]]In LaRouche's view, the people opposing this vision are part of the Aristotelian conspiracy. They may not necessarily be in contact with one another: "From their standpoint, [the conspirators] are proceeding by instinct," LaRouche has said. "If you're asking how their policy is developed—if there is an inside group sitting down and making plans—no, it doesn't work that way ... History doesn't function quite that consciously."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led LaRouche to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, Black Muslims, Teamsters, [[anti-abortionist|pro-lifers]], and followers of the Ku Klux Klan—even though LaRouche counts the Klan itself among his foes.

[[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]], in ''Architects of Fear'' (1983), has described LaRouche's Neoplatonist conspiracy theory as a "distortion of a real philosophical distinction".&lt;ref name="Johnson 1983 193"/&gt; He has written that the resulting philosophy can be applied to any number of situations in a manner that becomes plausible once one accepts its basic premise. In his view, it forms the foundation of a conspiracy theory that rationalizes paranoid thinking, an opinion echoed by John George and [[Laird Wilcox]] in ''American Extremists: Militias, Supremacists, Klansmen, Communists &amp; Others'' (1996).&lt;ref name=Johnson2&gt;{{harvnb|Copulus|1984}}, p. 2.

==Conspiracies==
LaRouche wrote that conspiracy was natural in human beings. In 1998, he responded to critics of his conspiracism, such as [[Daniel Pipes]] and said that Pipes wrongly believed that all reports of conspiracy are axiomatically false.

LaRouche's critics, particularly Dennis King and [[Chip Berlet]], characterize his current orientation as being a [[conspiracist]] worldview. They say the Marxist concept of the [[ruling class]] was converted by LaRouche into a conspiracy theory, in which world capitalism was controlled by a cabal including the [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild family|Rothschild]]s, the [[Rockefeller]]s, [[Henry Kissinger]], and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref name=King1989&gt;{{Cite book| last = King | first =  Dennis | year = 1989 | title = Lyndon LaRouche and the new American fascism | isbn = 978-0-385-23880-9 | publisher = Doubleday | location = New York | oclc = 18684318 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BerletBellman&gt;{{Cite book|last=Berlet|first=Chip|authorlink=Chip Berlet|author2=Joel Bellman|year=1989|title=Lyndon LaRouche: Fascism Wrapped in an American Flag|publisher=Political Research Associates|url=http://www.publiceye.org/larouche/nclc1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BerletLyons&gt;{{cite news| last1 = Berlet | first1 = Chip | last2 = Lyons | first2 = Matthew N. | year = 2000 | title = Right-wing populism in America: Too Close for Comfort | isbn = 978-1-57230-562-5 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | oclc = 185635579 | url = http://www.publiceye.org/larouche/synthesis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Pipes]] said that LaRouche personalizes his conspiracy theories, and associates "all of his adversaries with the forces of darkness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conspiracy: How the Paranoid Style Flourishes and Where It Comes From|first =Daniel|last=Pipes|page=12|publisher=Middle East Forum|year= 1999 |isbn=978-0-684-87111-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIR in 2007 ran an "investigative report" titled ''Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy At It Again, With a New Twist.''  It says:
: ''Perhaps the only name that sends the VRWC gang more into orbit than either Bill and Hillary Clinton, is the name Lyndon LaRouche. The very same apparatus that waged a billion-dollar slander campaign against the President and the First Lady throughout much of the mid- and late 1990s, has an even longer track record of venomous slander and frame-up campaigns against LaRouche and his political movement.''

===The "British" conspiracy===
LaRouche is known for alleging conspiracies by the British. LaRouche has said that the dominant imperialist strategic force acting on the planet today is not the United States, but the "Anglo-Dutch liberal system" of the [[British Empire]], which he asserts is an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] financial consortium like that of medieval [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], more like a "financial slime-mold" than a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vasilyev |first=Mikail |title=Attacks in India staged by England |url=http://news.km.ru/terakty_v_indii_ustroila_angliya/print |newspaper=KM.Ru News |date=March 2, 2009 |access-date=October 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207114600/http://news.km.ru/terakty_v_indii_ustroila_angliya/print |archive-date=February 7, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, London financial circles protect themselves from competition by using techniques of "controlled conflict" first developed in Venice, and LaRouche attributes many wars in recent memory to this alleged activity by the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schenk |first=Vladimir |title=Warmongers |url=http://nacbez.ru/society/article.php?id=1644 |publisher=Project NatsBez.ru |date=April 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524102919/http://nacbez.ru/society/article.php?id=1644 |archivedate=May 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chip Berlet]] and Dennis King, LaRouche has always been stridently anti-British and has included [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], the British Royal Family, and others, in his list of conspirators who are said to control the world's political economy and the international drug trade.&lt;ref name=King1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=BerletBellman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://lyndonlarouche.org/review4.htm |title= The outer limits of American politics: Lyndon LaRouche And the New American Fascism by Dennis King |author= David J. Garrow |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= July 30, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jonathan Vankin and John Whalen, LaRouche is the "most illustrious" [[Anglophobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Eighty greatest conspiracies of all time |first= Jonathan |last= Vankin |author2=John Whalen |publisher= Citadel Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-0-8065-2531-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views are reflected in three books authored by members of his organization:

*''Dope, Inc.'' by [[David P. Goldman]], Konstandinos Kalimtgis and Jeffrey Steinberg, 1978 ({{ISBN|0-918388-08-2}}): this book discusses the history of narcotics trafficking, beginning with the [[Opium War]], and alleges that British interests have continued to dominate the field up to the modern era, for example through [[money laundering]] in British [[offshore banking]] colonies. The heart of the conspiracy, according to LaRouche, is the financial elite of the [[City of London]].&lt;!--[these refs need to be specified]&lt;ref name="nbc-queen-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsnight1980"/&gt;--&gt;
*''The Civil War and the American System'' by Allen Salisbury, 1979 ({{ISBN|0918388023}}): alleges that British interests encouraged and financed the secession movement and supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] against the Union in the [[American Civil War]], because they preferred North America to be a primitive agrarian economy that they could dominate through policies of [[free trade]].
*''The New Dark Ages Conspiracy'' by Carol White, 1980 ({{ISBN|0-933488-05-X}}): alleges that a group of British intellectuals led by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[H.G. Wells]] attempted to control scientific progress in order to keep the world backward and more easily managed by [[Imperialism]]. In this conspiracy theory, Wells wished Science to be controlled by some kind of priesthood and kept from the common man, while Russell wished to stifle it altogether by restricting it to a closed system of formal [[logic]], that would prohibit the introduction of new ideas. This conspiracy also involved the promotion of the [[counterculture]].

====The Queen and Prince Philip====
According to book critic and columnist Scott McLemee:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookcriticscircle.blogspot.com/2008/05/nbcc-good-reads-3-long-tail-scott.html|title=Blogger|author=|date=|website=bookcriticscircle.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emergence of the [LaRouche Youth Movement] is all the more surprising, given that LaRouche himself has long since become the walking punchline to a very strange joke. He is known for some of the most baroque conspiracy theories ever put into circulation. Members of the LYM now deny that he ever accused the Queen of England of drug trafficking—though in fact, he did exactly that throughout the 1980s. At the time, he won admirers on the extreme right wing by denouncing Henry Kissinger as an agent of the KGB and calling for AIDS patients to be quarantined.&lt;ref name=McLemee&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=McLemee |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/mclemee/mclemee132 |title=The LaRouche Youth Movement |work=Inside Higher Ed |date=July 11, 2007 |archivedate=April 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xdcoepJT?url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/mclemee/mclemee132 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, in a segment about the death of [[Jeremiah Duggan]] during a LaRouche Youth Movement cadre school in Wiesbaden in March 2003, BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' re-broadcast a BBC interview with LaRouche from 1980, in which he said about the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]: "Of course she's pushing drugs. That is, in the sense of a responsibility, the head of a gang that is pushing drugs, she knows it's happening and she isn't stopping it."&lt;ref name=Samuels&gt;Samuels, Tim. "Jeremiah Duggan's death and Lyndon LaRouche", ''Newsnight'', BBC, February 2004, at 3:49 of part 1 as hosted on ''YouTube''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1998 editorial in LaRouche's ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]'' cited a statement by [[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that described LaRouche as the "publisher of a book that accuses the Queen of being the world's foremost drug dealer", characterising it as a "bit of black propaganda" and a "reference to the book Dope, Inc., [...] which laid bare the role of the London-centered offshore financial institutions and allied intelligence services, in running the global drug trade, from the time of Britain's nineteenth-century Opium Wars against China."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larouchepub.com/other/1998/eir_edit_2524.html "LaRouche's enemies are Clinton's enemies"], ''Executive Intelligence Review'', June 12, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans-Pritchard further said LaRouche had claimed that the Queen was involved in the [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref name=Telegraphcult&gt;Pritchard-Evans, Ambrose. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050412210745/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1998%2F06%2F04%2Fndi104.html "US cult is source of theories"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', June 4, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Executive Intelligence Review'' responded that Evans-Pritchard's article was "pure fiction", written in response to ''Executive Intelligence Review'' reporter Jeff Steinberg's appearance on a British [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television program about the Diana controversy. In a brief part of an interview with Steinberg broadcast the following day by [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'', Steinberg said that while there was "no smoking gun proof" that Prince Philip asked British intelligence to assassinate Diana, he could not "rule out" the possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Jeffrey, [http://www.larouchepub.com/other/1998/2525_diana_wars.html "New `Diana Wars' in Britain Put Focus on LaRouche"], ''Executive Intelligence Review'', June 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leo Strauss===
LaRouche's initial essay on the influence of [[Leo Strauss]] within [[Neoconservatism]] and the George W. Bush administration, "The Essential Fraud of Leo Strauss", was written in March 2003.&lt;ref name="ZuckertZuckert2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckert|first1=Catherine H.|last2=Zuckert|first2=Michael P.|title=The truth about Leo Strauss: political philosophy and American democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-PpPtGojpoC|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-99332-4|pages=11–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a series of pamphlets entitled "Children of Satan" later consolidated into a book, began appearing. LaRouche charges that there was a conspiracy dominated by what are called [[Straussians]] (followers of [[Leo Strauss]]) within the Bush administration, and that the dominant personality in this conspiracy was [[Dick Cheney]] (whose photo appears on the cover of the book.) LaRouche claimed that these conspirators deliberately misled the American public and the US Congress in order to initiate the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He writes that the Straussians created the [[Office of Special Plans]] in order to fabricate intelligence and bypass traditional intelligence channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2003/3019lar_expose_strauss.html |last= Steinberg |first=Jeffrey |title=LaRouche Exposé of Straussian `Children of Satan' Draws Blood |newspaper=Executive Intelligence Review |date= May 16, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to LaRouche movement member Tony Papert, an important part of this theory is the LaRouchian analysis of the ideas of Leo Strauss which borrows heavily from the writings of [[Shadia Drury]].&lt;ref&gt;Papert, Tony,  [http://www.larouchepub.com/pr/site_packages/2003/leo_strauss/3015secret_kingdom_ap_.html "The Secret Kingdom of Leo Strauss"], ''Executive Intelligence Review'', April 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bartley]] of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' has condemned LaRouche's views on this subject, and says that it may have influenced other commentators who subsequently published a similar analysis, such as [[Seymour Hersh]] and James Atlas of the ''[[New York Times]]''. Bartley quotes the assertion by LaRouche movement member Jeffrey Steinberg that a "cabal of Strauss disciples, along with an equally small circle of allied neo-conservative and Likudnik fellow-travelers" have plotted a "not-so-silent coup" using the [[September 11 attacks]] as a justification, similar to the [[Reichstag fire]] of 1933. Bartley complains that Strauss's "words are twisted from their meaning" in order to justify the theory.&lt;ref name=Bartley&gt;{{cite news|title=Joining LaRouche In the Fever Swamps|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/rbartley/?id=110003602|first= Robert L. |last=Bartley|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 9, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian journalist Jeet Heer writes that LaRouche's followers "argue that Strauss is the evil genius behind the Republican Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The philosopher, the late Leo Strauss has emerged as the thinker of the moment in Washington, but his ideas remain mysterious.

===Bush family===

The ''Executive Intelligence Review'' (EIR) published an article by  [[Anton Chaitkin]] alleging that [[Prescott Bush]] "had persevered with his comrades in the old Auschwitz gang" and that "the smoldering bodies in Auschwitz followed logically upon the race propaganda festival which had been staged by the Harriman-Bush enterprise a decade earlier in New York."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2000/2733_prescott_bush_hitler.html CRIMES OF THE BUSH DYNASTY Dubya's Grandpa and Great-Granddad Helped Put Adolf Hitler into Power] by Anton Chaitkin, ''Executive Intelligence Review'' August 25, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

EIR published a book, ''George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography'', by Webster Griffin Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin, in 1992, which said that "virtually all the Nazi trade with the United States was under the supervision of the Harriman-Bush interests", and that "Bush’s family had already played a central role in financing and arming Adolf Hitler for his takeover of Germany; in financing and managing the buildup of Nazi war industries for the conquest of Europe and war against the U.S.A.; and in the development of Nazi genocide theories and racial propaganda, with their well-known results. [...] The President’s family fortune was largely a result of the Hitler project. The powerful Anglo-American family associations, which later boosted him into the Central Intelligence Agency and up to the White House, were his father’s partners in the Hitler project."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2006/2006_30-39/2006_30-39/2006-37/pdf/43-53_637_stratbush.pdf The Hitler Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813025344/http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2006/2006_30-39/2006_30-39/2006-37/pdf/43-53_637_stratbush.pdf |date=August 13, 2011 }} by Anton Chaitkin, EIR 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Indiana (May 18, 2004).

In 2006, The Larouche Political Action Committee and EIR published “Larouche to Rumsfeld: FDR Defeated the Nazis, While Bushes Collaborated”.
:''LaRouche blasted Rumsfeld, reminding him that it was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who defeated Hitler and the Nazis, while many American right-wingers of the 1930s and ’40s were promoters of Mussolini, Hjalmar Schacht, and Hermann Goering. And among the extreme American Fascists and Nazis of the period, there were some who openly sympathized with Adolf Hitler, by intention or practice.''
:''“Let us not ignore the role of George Shultz, the man behind the Bush Presidency, the power of Vice President Cheney, and the promotion of Don Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense. Even leading Republicans know Shultz to be an outright totalitarian, who has used the Bush Presidency to impose a ‘Pinochet Model’ of top-down dictatorship and radical free-market economics upon the United States. Shultz’s promotion of the privatization of war, on the SS model, has been backed,” LaRouche noted, “by Felix Rohatyn.”''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2006/eirv33n37-20060915/eirv33n37-20060915_042-larouche_to_rumsfeld_fdr_defeate.pdf "FDR Defeated the Nazis, While Bushes Collaborated"], ''Executive Intelligence Review'' 33, no. 37 (September 15, 2006): 42–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==PANIC proposal and AIDS==
In 1974, an organisation affiliated to LaRouche predicted that there would be pandemics in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;introduction by Warren Hammerman, EIR Special Report, ''AIDS Gobal Showdown, Mankind's Total Victory or Total Defeat'', January 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Marcia Merry, "NYC's Big Mac: Rohatyn's Model for Destroying Gov'ts," ''EIR'' August 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When AIDS was first recognized as a medical phenomenon in the early 1980s, LaRouche activists were convinced that this was the pandemic about which the task force had warned. LaRouche and his followers stated that HIV, the AIDS virus, could be transmitted by casual contact,&lt;ref name=Roderick10-06&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| page = 21| last = Roderick| first = Kevin| title = Paper Tied to LaRouche Attacks Gay Movement| work = Los Angeles Times |issue=pre-1997 Fulltext| date = October 6, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Rutgers University Press| isbn = 9780813522852| page = 84| last = Toumey| first = Christopher P.| title = Conjuring science| year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing as supporting evidence the high incidence of the disease in Africa, the Caribbean and southern Florida.&lt;ref name="Air, Mosquitoes 1986. pg. 30"&gt;"AIDS Spread by Air, Mosquitoes, LaRouche Says" Los Angeles Times.

AIDS became a key plank in LaRouche's platform.&lt;ref name=Roderick10-17/&gt; His slogan was "Spread Panic, not AIDS!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 9780465022885| page = 308| last = Faderman| first = Lillian|author2=Stuart Timmons | title = Gay L.A.| date = January 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche's followers created "[[Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee]]" (PANIC), which sponsored California Proposition 64, the "LaRouche Initiative", in 1986.

A.23&lt;/ref&gt; said that there must be universal testing and mandatory quarantining of HIV carriers. "Twenty to 30 million out of 100 million people in central Africa have AIDS," Klenetsky said. "It is spreading because of impoverished economic conditions, and that is a direct result of IMF policies that have destroyed people's means of resisting the disease." Klenetsky said that LaRouche believed that not only drug users and homosexuals are vulnerable to the disease.&lt;ref&gt;"Looking at the World As Lyndon LaRouche Sees It; His Enemies List An Eclectic Mix" Thomas Oliphant, Globe Staff. Boston Globe Boston, Mass.: Apr 6, 1986. pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure was met with strong opposition and was defeated. A second AIDS initiative qualified for the ballot in 1988, but the measure failed by a larger margin. In response to a survey which predicted that 72% of voters would oppose the measure, a spokesman called the poll "an obvious fraud", saying that pollsters deliberately worded questions to prejudice respondents against the initiative.  He additionally said that the poll was part of a "big lie...witch hunt" orchestrated by [[Armand Hammer]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;"LaRouche backers repeat anti-AIDS initiative; Marc Lifsher:The Register.

LaRouche purchased a national TV spot during his 1988 presidential campaign, in which he summarized his views and proposals with respect to the AIDS epidemic. He said most statements about how AIDS is spread were an "outright lie" and that talk of [[safe sex]] was just propaganda put out by the government to avoid spending the money required to address the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| page = 3| last = Associated Press| title = The Deseret News. – Google News Archive Search| work = Deseret News| accessdate = 2009-07-06| date = February 5, 1988| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19880205&amp;id=XP4OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PoQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7146,1238472

==Environment and energy==
Meštrović says LaRouche follows [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] in seeing the human mind as a force transforming the [[biosphere]] into a higher form, the [[noösphere]].&lt;ref name="Meštrović" /&gt; LaRouche favors a highly industrialized civilization reaching for innovation and interplanetary colonization.

===Nuclear power===
LaRouche says that nuclear and especially fusion power is necessary for the continued growth of civilization. He founded the [[Fusion Energy Foundation]], which published the journal ''Fusion'' (later renamed to ''21st Century Science &amp; Technology''). In his 1980 presidential platform, LaRouche promised 2500 nuclear power plants if elected.&lt;ref name="Rowell1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowell|first=Andrew|title=Green backlash: global subversion of the environmental movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AFvZb3PoghwC|accessdate=May 15, 2011|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-12828-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 LaRouche reiterated his position, saying that only the "massive investment" in fission and fusion technology could prevent the "collapse of human existence on this planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= March 9, 2007|work=Executive Intelligence Review|title=The Great Luddite Hoax of 2007|first=Lyndon H. |last=LaRouche, Jr.|url=http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2007/eirv34n10-20070309/04_710_feat.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement has targeted opponents of nuclear power. Members of the [[Clamshell Alliance]], non-violent protesters at the [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant|Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]] in New Hampshire, were called "terrorists" in 1977.

==Music and science==
LaRouche is fascinated by musical theory, as well as mathematics and physics, and this fascination also translates into his teachings; his followers for example have attempted to link the musical scale to his Neoplatonist model of economic evolution, and study singing and geometry. A common teaser used by the movement is to ask people whether they know how to "double the square"—draw a square whose area is twice the size of an existing square. A motto of LaRouche's European Workers' Party is "Think like Beethoven"; movement offices typically include a piano and posters of German composers, and members are known for their choral singing at protest events, using satirical lyrics tailored to their targets.&lt;ref&gt;For LaRouche's interests, see LaRouche, Lyndon.

In 1988 LaRouche advocated that classical orchestras should return to the "Verdi pitch," a pitch that [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] had enshrined in Italian legislation in 1884. Orchestras' pitches have risen since the 18th century, because a higher pitch produces a more brilliant orchestral sound, while imposing an additional strain on singers' voices. [[Giuseppe Verdi]] succeeded in 1884 in having legislation passed in Italy that fixed the reference pitch for [[A (musical note)|A]] at 432&amp;nbsp;Hz, but in 1938, the international standard was raised to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, with some major orchestras tuning as high as 450&amp;nbsp;Hz in recent times. LaRouche spoke about the resulting strain on singers' voices in his 1988 presidential campaign videos. By 1989 the initiative had attracted support from more than 300 opera stars, including [[Joan Sutherland]], [[Plácido Domingo]],  [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[Montserrat Caballé]]. While many of these singers may or may not have been aware of LaRouche's politics, [[Renata Tebaldi]] and [[Piero Cappuccilli]] ran for the European Parliament on LaRouche's "Patriots for Italy" platform and appeared as featured speakers at Schiller Institute conferences on the topic. The discussions led to debates in the Italian parliament about reinstating Verdi's legislation. LaRouche himself gave an interview to [[National Public Radio]] on the initiative in 1989 from prison. [[Stefan Zucker]], the editor of ''Opera Fanatic'' (and, incidentally, the "world's highest tenor") opposed the initiative on the grounds that it would result in the establishment of a "pitch police," arguing that the way it presented the history of the tuning pitch was a "simplification", and that LaRouche was using the issue to gain credibility. The initiative in the Italian Senate failed to result in corresponding legislation being passed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/timesdispatch/access/615637631.html?dids=615637631:615637631&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+16%2C+1989&amp;author=Francis+Church&amp;pub=Richmond+Times+-+Dispatch&amp;desc=SHALL+LYNDON+LAROUCHE+CALL+THE+TUNING+PITCH%3F&amp;pqatl=google "Shall Lyndon LaRouche call the tuning pitch?"], ''Richmond Times Dispatch'', September 16, 1989.

==Opposition to Obama's health reforms==

LaRouche's organization opposed the Obama administration's [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health-care reform]] proposals.{{Why|date=June 2018}} Posters of Obama wearing a Hitler-style mustache appeared at a LaRouche movement rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama's plan blasted as Nazi-like: LaRouche demonstrations across the North Fork question health care policy|work=The Suffolk Times (Long Island, NY)|date=July 23, 2009|first=Erin|last=Schultz|url=http://www2.timesreview.com/ST/Stories/T071609_Obama_ES|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218141859/http://www2.timesreview.com/ST/Stories/T071609_Obama_ES|archivedate=February 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As town-hall meetings on this issue during the summer of 2009 began to attract very large and angry crowds, the comparison of Obama to Hitler began to show up on many signs and banners. ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that LaRouche supporters "patented the Obama-is-Nazi theme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marc |last=Ambinder |title=The Town Halls, Independents, And Lyndon LaRouche |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/08/the-town-halls-independents-and-lyndon-larouche/23208/ |newspaper= The Atlantic |date=August 13, 2009 }}

==Sexuality and politics==

In 1973, LaRouche wrote an article called "Beyond Psychoanalysis".  He theorized that each culture had characteristic flaws that resulted in blocks to effective political organizing. LaRouche and his colleagues conducted studies of different "national ideologies," including German, French, Italian, English, Latin American, Greek, and Swedish.&lt;!-- [this link no longer appear to work]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ex-iwp.org/docs/1973/beyondpsychoanalysis.htm&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaRouche, Lyndon, [http://www.larouchepub.com/lar/2001/2825_greenspin.html "Marat, De Sade, And `Greenspin'"], ''EIR'', June 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article, "The Sexual Impotency of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party", LaRouche criticised [[Machismo]].  Regarding the role of women, he adds, "The task of real women's liberation is to generally strengthen women's self-consciousness and their power and opportunities to act upon self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ex-iwp.org/related001.php |title=The sexual impotence of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party |access-date=August 16, 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723211253/http://ex-iwp.org/related001.php |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
During the 1980s, LaRouche and his supporters made comments that were seen as anti-gay.&lt;ref name=Roderick10-17&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| page = 3| last = Roderick| first = Kevin| title = LaRouche Wrote of Using AIDS to Win Presidency| work = Los Angeles Times (pre-1997 Fulltext)| date = October 17, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Berlet&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = South End Press| isbn = 9780896085237| page = 99| last = Berlet| first = Chip| title = Eyes right!| year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; A LaRouche-affiliated newspaper wrote that demonstrators against the LaRouche-sponsored AIDS initiative in California were from the "lower sexual classes."&lt;ref&gt;Roderick, Kevin, "Paper Tied to LaRouche Attacks Gay Movement" [http://articles.latimes.com/1986-10-06/news/mn-4531_1_larouche-supporters], Los Angeles Times, October 6, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism and Zionism===
British journalist [[Roger Boyes]] wrote, "Anti-Semitism is at the core of LaRouche's conspiracy theories, which he adapts to modern events -most recently the war in Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blame the jews|first=Roger|last= Boyes|authorlink= Roger Boyes|work=The Times|location= London (UK)|date=November 7, 2003|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Levitas wrote in 1995 that LaRouche "has been consistent in creating and elaborating conspiracy theories that contain a strong dose of antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Levitas, "Antisemitism and the Far Right: "Hate" Groups, White Supremacy, and the Neo-Nazi Movement", in ed. [[Jerome Chanes|Jerome A. Chanes]], ''Antisemitism in America Today: Outspoken Experts Explode the Myths'', (New York: Birch Lane Press/Carol Publishing, 1995), pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of LaRouche's alleged antisemitism, Dennis King cited LaRouche's statement (under the pen name L. Marcus) in ''The Case of Ludwig Feuerbach'' (1973), "Jewish culture ... is merely the residue left to the Jewish home after everything saleable has been marketed to the [[Goyim]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Jewish Question |chapter-url=http://lyndonlarouche.org/fascism6.htm |title=Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism|first=Dennis|last=King |isbn=978-0-385-23880-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charge of antisemitism in the LaRouche network resurfaced in the media in 2004 in accounts of the death of a young Jewish student, [[Jeremiah Duggan]], who had been attending a [[Schiller Institute]] event in Germany. British press reports described LaRouche as "the American leader of a sect with a fascist and antisemitic ideology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National: Courts: Victory for family of man found dead in Germany|first=Afua|last=Hirsch|work=The Guardian|location=London (UK)|date=November 6, 2008|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said he was "infamous for his anti-Semitic views and claims the world's governments have been taken over by a Zionist conspiracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It was murder, say family of boy in cult suicide riddle|first=Gordon |last=Rayner|work=Daily Mail|location=London (UK)|date=March 28, 2007|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche has long denied that his movement is antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sj-r.com/firstinprint/x227288797/First-in-Print-Former-LaRouche-aide-lands-state-job |title=Former LaRouche aide lands state job |first=Bernard |last=Schoenberg |date=July 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, LaRouche said, "Religious and racial hatred, such as anti-Semitism [is] the most evil expression of criminality to be seen on the planet today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://larouchepub.com/lar/2006/3339_pope_press_hoax.html |title=Britain's Bernard Lewis and His Crimes |date=September 17, 2006 |first=Lyndon H. |last=LaRouche, Jr |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debra Freeman, a spokesperson for LaRouche, told a newspaper in 2010 that, "Hitler was a lunatic, but his policies were based principally on economic policy and staying in power. We mourn the loss of six million Jews and countless others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Larouche supporters make their case on the Taunton Green on Election Day |date=November 3, 2010 |first=CHARLES |last=WINOKOOR |work=Taunton Gazette |url=http://my.ojornal.com/sports-news/larouche-supporters-make-their-case-taunton-green-election-day |archivedate=March 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xNyHLfhN?url=http://my.ojornal.com/sports-news/larouche-supporters-make-their-case-taunton-green-election-day |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche's critics have said he is a "disguised anti-Semite", in that he takes the classical antisemitic conspiracy theory and substitutes the word "Zionist" for the word "Jew", and ascribes the classical antisemitic caricature of the "scheming Jew" to particular Jewish individuals and groups of Jews, rather than to the Jews as a whole.&lt;ref name=King1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=BerletBellman/&gt;&lt;ref name=BerletLyons/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berlet2005&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Berlet|first=Chip|title=Protocols to the Left, Protocols to the Right: Conspiracism in American Political Discourse at the Turn of the Second Millennium (dedicated to Jeremiah Duggan),  | conference = Reconsidering "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion": 100 Years After the Forgery | location = The Elie Wiesel Center for Judaic Studies, Boston University|date= October 30–31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Modern Zionism was not created by Jews, but was a project developed chiefly by [[Oxford University]]," LaRouche says. He says, "Zionism is not Judaism."&lt;ref name="Zionism is not Judaism,"&gt;Special issue, [http://wlym.com/PDF-77-85/CAM7812.pdf "Zionism is not Judaism,"] ''Campaigner'', December 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the same year LaRouche's article cited ''[[Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion|The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]],'' the LaRouche group published ''Dope, Inc.: Britain’s Opium War against the U.S.,'' which cited the Protocols and defended its authenticity, likening the "Elders of Zion" to the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] banking family, the [[British Royal family]], and the [[Italian Mafia]], and the Israeli [[Mossad]], [[Albert Pike|General Pike]], and the [[B'nai B'rith]]. (Dope, Inc.) Later editions left out cites to ''The Protocols''. This is the genesis of the claim that LaRouche has said Queen Elizabeth runs drugs. When asked by an NBC reporter in 1984 about the Queen and drug running, LaRouche replied, "Of course she's pushing drugs...that is in a sense of responsibility: the head of a gang that is pushing drugs; she knows it's happening and she isn't stopping it."&lt;ref&gt;(NBC News, First Camera, March 4, 1984, transcript from NBC News, excerpt used with permission).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chip Berlet]] argues that LaRouche indirectly expresses antisemitism through the use of "coded language" and by attacking [[neoconservatives]].&lt;ref name=Berlet2005/&gt; Dennis King maintains, for example, that words like "British" were really code words for 'Jew.'"&lt;ref&gt;George, John and Wilcox, Laird, ''American Extremists: Militias, Supremacists, Klansmen, Communists &amp; Others,'' Prometheus Books, Amherst, NY. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics of LaRouche believe that LaRouche’s anti-British statements disparage the British system rather than the Jewish religion. [[Laird Wilcox]] and John George write that "Dennis King goes to considerable lengths to paint LaRouche as a neo-Nazi, even engaging in a little conspiracy-mongering of his own."

===Race===
[[Manning Marable]] of Columbia University wrote in a 1997 column that LaRouche had a "long attempted to destroy and manipulate black leaders, political organizations and the black church".&lt;ref name=Marable1997&gt;{{cite news|title=No Compromise with Racism: Farrakhan, Chavis and Lyndon La Rouche – Part One of a Two Part Series|authorlink=Manning Marable|first=Manning |last=Marable|date= January 17, 1997|work=Columbus Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Leadership|first=Manning |last=Marable|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-231-10746-4|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During LaRouche's slander suit against NBC in 1984, [[Roy Innis]], leader of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], took the stand for LaRouche as a character witness, stating under oath that LaRouche's views on racism were "consistent with his own." Asked whether he had seen any indication of racism in LaRouche's associates, he replied that he had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|George|Wilcox|1992|pp=317, 322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis received criticism from many blacks for having testified on LaRouche's behalf.&lt;ref name="Manning 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bivins, Larry. "Frist embraces King's legacy," ''USA Today'', January 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The African American civil-rights leader [[James Bevel]] was LaRouche's running mate in the 1992 presidential election, and in the mid-1990s, the LaRouche movement entered into an alliance with [[Louis Farrakhan]]'s [[Nation of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|1998|pp=177–182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another LaRouche movement member with a distinguished civil-rights history is [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]], who is vice-president of the Schiller Institute; she has described the movement as following in the footsteps of [[Martin Luther King]]: "Mr. And Mrs. LaRouche built a movement, taking up where Dr. King had left off. They realized ... there must be an universal image of mankind, which transcends all racial differences and barriers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-85200835.html LaRouche supporter discusses civil rights movement at U.

==Accusations of fascism against the LaRouche movement==
[[File:Laroucheobamahitler.JPG|thumb|LaRouche supporter sign portraying Barack Obama with a "Hitler mustache"]]

LaRouche's movement has frequently been accused of being fascist. Those making the accusation include Democratic National Committee chairman [[Paul G. Kirk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ISSUES|work=New York Times|date=August 13, 1986|page=A.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a local Texas Democratic district committee.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White, GOP brass come out swinging on convention rounds|work=Houston Chronicle |date=May 18, 1986|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Democratic activist [[Bob Hattoy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ELECTIONS '88 39TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT Marquis Finds LaRouche Link Wins Enemies|first=DANA |last=PARSONS|work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 19, 1988|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis King, a former [[Marxist-Leninist]] and member of the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, used this thesis in the title of his book-length study of LaRouche and his movement, ''Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism'' (1989). ''[[Lyndon LaRouche#1973: Political shift; "Operation Mop-Up"|Operation Mop-Up]],'' which is said to have consisted of violent physical attacks on left-wing meetings, is used as a basis for such accusations.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronology of Labor Committee Attacks, issued by New York Committee to Stop Terrorist Attacks, 1973; contemporary articles and photographs in the ''Daily World'', the ''Militant'', ''Workers Power'', the ''Fifth Estate'', the ''Boston Phoenix'', and the ''Drummer'';  "An Introduction to NCLC: "The Word is Beware", Liberation New Service, #599, March 23, 1974; Charles M.

Andrei Fursov, a Russian historian and academician at the International Academy of Sciences in Innsbruck, Austria, was interviewed in 2012 by the Russian think tank and web portal ''Terra America'' and asked to comment on the characterizations of LaRouche in Western media. He replied that intellectuals who have called LaRouche a fascist do not deserve to be called intellectuals, and that the charge has no basis in any real scientific analysis of politics. According to Fursov, it comes from the fact that LaRouche criticizes the supposedly "democratic" but actually "liberal totalitarian" system of the West. Fursov said that in Russia not so many people know of LaRouche, although, of course, the important thing is not the quantity, but the quality.&lt;ref&gt;Benedictine, Kyrill, interview with Andrei Fursov, [http://terra-america.ru/intellektuali-nazivaushie-larusha-fashistom-ne-yavlyautsya-intellektualami.aspx Intellectuals who have called LaRouche a fascist do not deserve to be called intellectuals] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715220632/http://terra-america.ru/intellektuali-nazivaushie-larusha-fashistom-ne-yavlyautsya-intellektualami.aspx |date=July 15, 2012 }}, Terra-America, April 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]], in a review of King's book in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that King's presentation of LaRouche as a "would-be Führer" was "too neat", and that it failed to take into account that several members of LaRouche's inner circle were themselves Jewish, while acknowledging that LaRouche's "conspiracy theory is designed to appeal to anti-Semitic right-wingers as well as to Black Muslims and nuclear engineers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Johnson |first=George|authorlink=George Johnson (writer)|title=A Menace or Just a Crank?|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DF123CF93BA25755C0A96F948260&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=March 12, 2011 |date=June 18, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1983 book, ''Architects of Fear'', Johnson described LaRouche's dalliances with radical groups on the right as "a marriage of convenience", and less than sincere; as evidence he cited a 1975 party memo that spoke of uniting with the right simply for the purpose of overthrowing the established order: "Once we have won this battle, eliminating our right-wing opposition will be comparatively easy." At the same time, Johnson says, LaRouche also sought contact with the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Baath Party]] in Iraq; failing to recruit either the Soviets or right-wingers to his cause, LaRouche attempted to adopt a more mainstream image in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laird Wilcox]] and John George similarly stated that King had gone too far in trying "to paint LaRouche as a neo-Nazi" and that LaRouche's most severe critics, like King and Berlet, came from extreme leftist backgrounds themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John George|author2=Laird M.

'''Walter Samuel Hunter''' (March 22, 1889 – August 3, 1954) contributed to [[psychology]] by leading an effort to develop psychology as a science.&lt;ref name=Walter&gt;Walter S. Hunter: Pioneer Objectivist in Psychology,1954&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter was one of the first scholars of the time to focus not on the study of subjective mental processes but rather on the observation of animal behavior. In 1912, Hunter completed his doctoral dissertation on Delayed Reaction in Animals and Children.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;Mitchell, Martha. "Encyclopedia Brunoniana | Hunter, Walter S."&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pioneer in the effort of scientific documentation, having created [[Psychological Abstracts]] in 1927, which contained documents from psychologists in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;ref name=Walter/&gt;

==Biography==
Walter Samuel Hunter was born in [[Decatur, Illinois]], on March 22, 1889. His mother died when he was 12 years old.&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;Hunt 1956, Walter Samuel Hunter. Psychological Review&lt;/ref&gt; After his mother’s death, his father, George Hunter, moved him and his brother to Fort Worth, Texas.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; In January 1913, Hunter married his first wife, Katherine Pratt. The couple had a daughter named Thayer.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; Katherine Pratt died at the age of 27, shortly after the birth of their daughter.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; Hunter married his second wife, Alda Grace Barber, in 1917. His second daughter, Helen Barbara, was born in 1920.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; Hunter had a full career studying psychology before he died suddenly in 1954 from a [[coronary occlusion]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

==Education==
Hunter attended the Preparatory School of the Polytechnic College in 1905&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; where he was introduced to psychology by his roommate.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; He then attended the [[University of Texas]], from which he graduated with a concentration in psychology in 1908. After graduation, he began graduate work at the [[University of Chicago]], where he received a PhD. in psychology.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;Gram 1959, WALTER SAMUEL HUNTER." Biographical Memoirs,127&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter returned to the [[University of Texas]] in 1912 as an instructor.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; In 1916, Hunter accepted a professorship of psychology at the University of Kansas.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; In 1925, Hunter accepted the position to become the first G. Stanley Hall Professor of Genetic Psychology at [[Clark University]].&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; In 1936, Hunter became the chairman of the Department of Psychology at Brown University.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

== Accomplishments ==
During his time at the University of Kansas in 1919, he produced his first textbook, entitled ''General Psychology''. While at [[Clark University]], Hunter was the editor of the Psychological Index. He also wrote a second textbook entitled Human Behavior, established Psychological Abstracts, and served as president of the [[American Psychological Association]] from 1930 to 1931.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;APA Presidential Addresses&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Clark he also published 21 experimental papers, five theoretical studies, and four book chapters.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; While he was American Psychological Association President, he delivered an address on the Psychological Study of Behavior.&lt;ref name=psychological&gt;The psychological study of behavior,1930&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Hunter was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and in 1935, he was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; In 1936, Hunter became the chairman of the Department of Psychology at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

==Psychology and the military==
Hunter served in the military for sixteen months during World War I. He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the predictive value of group psychological tests.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; His work persuaded government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately led military officials to order the recording of data on the national origins of the troops tested.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; The data collected was used in a way that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

Hunter served as chairman of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the National Research Council from 1936 to 1938. During this time Hunter's influence contributed to the utilization of psychology by the government and the military during World War II.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

From 1943-1945, he served as a chairman of the Applied Psychology Panel of the [[National Defense Research Committee]].&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; In 1943, he was unofficially drafted to direct and coordinate research for the military.&lt;ref name=Walter/&gt; Little has been publicly documented as to exactly what Hunter did during World War II.&lt;ref name=Walter/&gt; However, it was enough for President Truman to award Hunter the President’s [[Medal for Merit]] in 1948, for “having recognized that research on the psychological and physiological capacities of man in relation to the new instruments of warfare could contribute materially to the more effective utilization of both military personnel and instruments”.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

==Research==
Hunter was interested in studying delayed reaction in animals.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; Through his research, he developed the idea of symbolic process.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; According to Hunter, this is the process by which specific animals can change their orientation to a stimulus during a delay and afterward still be able to remember where the stimulus was originally.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; Hunter believed that his work on the aftereffect of visual motion was some of his best.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; He was so interested in delayed reaction that he expanded his work to include children after the birth of his first daughter. Hunter observed his daughter between the time she was thirteen months old and sixteen months old. Hunter found that young children could demonstrate the appropriate delayed reaction even when their body orientation changed during the delayed period.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; Hunter agreed with the [[behaviorist]] point of view, however he continued to see consciousness and voluntary actions as problems that still needed to be explained.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; Hunter did not like the term psychology—he preferred to use the term "anthroponomy" to replace psychology.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; Hunter wanted to avoid misunderstandings that arise when the term psychology is used to describe his work. The term was not widely accepted and Hunter was mocked for his suggestion.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4861">[[File:Władysław Heinrich.jpg|185px|thumb|Władysław Heinrich]]'''Władysław Heinrich''' ([[Warsaw]], 1 January 1869 – 30 June 1957, [[Kraków]], [[Poland]]) was a Polish historian of philosophy, psychologist, professor at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]] and member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]].

==Life==
Władysław Heinrich studied mathematics, the [[natural sciences]] and philosophy. In philosophy he was a student of [[Richard Avenarius]] at the [[University of Zurich]] and applied his radical [[positivism]] to psychology:  Heinrich pointed out that the new [[experimental psychology]] of the time was based on [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] concepts and premises, on constructions and introjections. In opposition to it, he proposed a psychology based on pure experiment (''Die moderne physiologische Psychologie in Deutschland''—Modern Physiological Psychology in Germany, 1897).&lt;ref name="III p. 359"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'' (History of Philosophy), vol. III, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Settling in [[Kraków]], Heinrich conducted research in this spirit (''Teorie i wyniki badań psychologicznych''—Theories and Results of Psychological Research, 1902).  He authored the first report in experimental psychology to be presented to the [[Polish Academy of Learning|Academy of Learning]], ''O wahaniach natężenia zaledwie dostrzegalnych wrażeń'' (On Fluctuations in the Intensity of Barely Perceptible Sensations, 1898).&lt;ref name="III p. 359" /&gt;  

Heinrich worked at Kraków University in the physics department, then took over a chair of psychology and philosophy. He was also active in the [[history of philosophy]] (proposing the creation, in the Academy of Learning, of the Committee for the History of Philosophy in Poland). Above all, he was the first in Kraków to develop the new radical [[empiricist]] philosophy connected with the natural sciences.&lt;ref name="III p. 359" /&gt; He was concerned especially with [[methodological]] questions, and was the first to present these at the [[Polish Academy of Learning|Academy of Learning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys dziejów...'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Yogācāra, along with the [[Madhyamaka]], is one of the two principal philosophical schools of Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Jones, Lindsay 2005"&gt;Jones, Lindsay (Ed. in Chief)(2005). ''Encyclopedia of Religion''. (2nd Ed.) Volume 14; Masaaki, Hattori (Ed.)(1987 &amp; 2005)"''Yogācāra''": p.9897. USA:  Macmillan Reference.  {{ISBN|0-02-865983-X}} (v.14)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origination===
The earliest text of this tradition is the [[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra'']] which might be as early as the first or second century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=John|title=Hermeneutics and Tradition in the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3jIh-xPVhIC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1926-9|pages=4–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes new theories such as the basis-consciousness ([[Eight Consciousnesses|''ālaya-vijñāna'']]), and the doctrine of cognition-only (''vijñapti-mātra'') and the "three natures" (''trisvabhāva''). However, these theories were not completely new, as they have predecessors in older theories held by previous Buddhist schools, such as the [[Sautrāntika]] theory of seeds (''[[bīja]]'') and the [[Sthavira nikāya]]'s [[abhidharma]] theory of an unconscious [[Bhavanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=William S|title=The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the Context of Indian Buddhist Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9iCAgAAQBAJ|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42886-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard King has also noted the similarity of the Sautantrika representationalism and the Yogacara: 
{{quote|The Sautrantika accept that it is only the form (''akara'') or representation (''vijñapti'') of an object which is perceived. Where the schools differ is in the Yogacara refusal to accept the validity of discussing external objects as causes (''nimitta'') given that an external object is never (directly) perceived.&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard; Vijnaptimatrata and the Abhidharma context of early Yogacara&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra'', as the doctrinal trailblazer of the Yogācāra, inaugurated the paradigm of the [[Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma]], with its own tenets in the "third turning".&lt;ref name="Jones, Lindsay 2005" /&gt; The Yogācāra texts are generally considered part of the third turning along with the relevant [[sutra]]. (Some traditions categorize this teaching as within the "fourth turning" of the wheel of Dharma.) Moreover, Yogācāra discourse surveys and synthesizes all three turnings and considers itself as the final definitive explanation of Buddhism.

The orientation of the Yogācāra school is largely consistent with the thinking of the Pāli [[nikāya]]s. It frequently treats later developments in a way that realigns them with earlier versions of Buddhist doctrines. One of the agendas of the Yogācāra school was to reorient the complexity of later refinements in Buddhist philosophy to accord with early Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ|date=4 February 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-97342-3|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asaṅga and Vasubandhu===
[[File:TheFutureBuddhaGandhara3rdCentury.jpg|thumb|[[Maitreya]] and disciples. [[Gandhara]], 3rd century CE]]
[[File:Kofukuji Monastery Hosso Patriarchs of Hokuendo (Seshin) (413).jpg|thumb|Statue of Vasubandhu (jp. Seshin), [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara]] [[Japan]].]]
Yogācāra, which had its genesis in the ''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra'', was largely formulated by the [[brahmin]]-born half-brothers [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] and [[Vasubandhu]]. Asaṅga spent many years in intense meditation, during which time tradition says that he often visited the [[Tushita|Tuṣita Heaven]] to receive teachings from [[Maitreya]]. Heavens such as Tuṣita are said to be accessible through [[meditation]] and accounts of this are given in the writings of the Indian Buddhist monk [[Paramartha|Paramārtha]], who lived during the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex. ''Untying the Knots in Buddhism: Selected Essays.'' 1997. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xuanzang]] tells a similar account of these events:
{{quote|In the great mango grove five or six ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' to the southwest of the city ([[Ayodhya|Ayodhyā]]), there is an old monastery where Asaṅga Bodhisattva received instructions and guided the common people. At night he went up to the place of Maitreya Bodhisattva in Tuṣita Heaven to learn the ''{{IAST|[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra]]}}'', the ''{{IAST|[[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|Mahāyāna-sūtra-alaṃkāra-śāstra]]}}'', the ''{{IAST|[[Madhyanta-vibhaga-karika|Madhyānta-vibhāga-śāstra]]}}'', etc.; in the daytime, he lectured on the marvelous principles to a great audience.&lt;ref name="Rongxi 1996, p. 153"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Xuanzang|authorlink1=Xuanzang|author2=Bianji|authorlink2=Bianji|last3=Li|first3=Jung-hsi|authorlink3=Li Rongxi|title=The great Tang dynasty record of the western regions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ABuAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation &amp; Research|isbn=978-1-886439-02-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Asaṅga went on to write many of the key Yogācāra treatises such as the ''Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra'', the ''[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]'' and the ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]'' as well as other works, although there are discrepancies between the Chinese and Tibetan traditions concerning which works are attributed to him and which to Maitreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucci|first=Giuseppe|authorlink=Giuseppe Tucci|title=On Some Aspects of the Doctrines of the Maitreya (Natha) and Asanga: Being a Course of Five Lectures Delivered at the University of Calcutta \|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VVXPwAACAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Chinese Materials Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yogācāra school held a prominent position in Indian Buddhism for centuries after the time of Asaṅga and Vasubandhu. Teachings and derivations of this school have influenced and become well-established in East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism.

===Yogācāra and Madhyamaka===
According to Tibetan sources, this school was in protracted [[Dialectic#Buddhist dialectic|dialectic]] with the Madhyamaka. However, there is disagreement among contemporary Western and traditional Buddhist scholars about the degree to which they were opposed, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Conze |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Conze |editor= |others= |title= A Short History of Buddhism |url= |edition=2nd |series= |volume= |year=1993 |publisher= Oneworld |location= |isbn=1-85168-066-7 |oclc= |doi=  |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}:50f.&lt;/ref&gt; To summarize the main difference: while the Madhyamaka held that asserting the existence or non-existence of any ultimately real thing was inappropriate, some later exponents of Yogācāra asserted that the mind (or in the more sophisticated variations, primordial wisdom) and only the mind is ultimately real. This is, however, a later interpretation of Yogācāra, and Vasubandhu and Asaṅga in particular did not assert that mind was truly inherently existent.

The position that Yogācāra and Madhyamaka were in dialectic was expounded by Xuanzang in the 7th century. After a suite of debates with exponents of the Madhyamaka school in India, Xuanzang composed in Sanskrit the no longer extant three-thousand verse treatise ''The Non-difference of Madhyamaka and Yogācāra''.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus, Dan 2007"&gt;Lusthaus, Dan (undated). ''Xuanzang (Hsüan-tsang)''.

Yogācāra and Madhyamaka philosophers demonstrated two opposing tendencies throughout the history of Buddhist philosophy in India, one which worked to separate and distance the two systems and one tendency which worked towards harmonizing them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Komarovski, Yaroslav'', Visions of Unity: The Golden Paṇḍita Shakya Chokden’s New Interpretation of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The harmonizing tendency can be seen in the work of philosophers like  [[Śāntarakṣita]] and also the work of the Yogācāra thinker [[Ratnākaraśānti|Ratnakaraksanti]] (c. 1000). These thinkers also saw the Yogācāra Alikākāravāda ("false aspectarian", those Yogācāras who believe that mental appearances are false or don't ultimately exist) view as the highest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Śāntarakṣita]] (8th century), whose view was later called "Yogācāra-Svatantrika-Madhyamaka" by the Tibetan tradition, saw the Mādhyamika position as ultimately true and at the same time saw the Yogācāra view as a useful way to relate to conventionalities and progress students more skillfully toward the ultimate.&lt;ref name="Padmakara120"&gt;Shantarakshita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.117-122&lt;/ref&gt; This synthesized view between the two positions, and also incorporated the views of valid cognition ([[pramana]]) from [[Dignāga]] and [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]].

Later Tibetan Buddhist thinkers like [[Sakya Chokden|Shakya Chokden]] would also work to show the compatibility of the Alikākāravāda sub-school with [[Madhyamaka]], arguing that it is in fact a form of [[Madhyamaka]].&lt;ref&gt;Komarovski, Yaroslav'', Visions of Unity: The Golden Paṇḍita Shakya Chokden’s New Interpretation of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Chödrak Gyatso, 7th Karmapa Lama|Seventh Karmapa Chödrak Gyamtso]] has a similar view which holds that the "profound important points and intents" of the two systems are one.&lt;ref&gt;Komarovski, Yaroslav'', Visions of Unity: The Golden Paṇḍita Shakya Chokden’s New Interpretation of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]] is also another Tibetan philosopher whose project is aimed as showing the harmony between Yogacara and Madhyamaka, arguing that there is only a very subtle difference between them, being a subtle clinging by Yogacaras to the existence of an "inexpressible, naturally luminous cognition" (''rig pa rang bzhin gyis ’od gsal ba'').&lt;ref&gt;Komarovski, Yaroslav'', Visions of Unity: The Golden Paṇḍita Shakya Chokden’s New Interpretation of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka''.

===Yogācāra in East Asia===

Translations of Indian Yogācāra texts were first introduced to China in the early 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Diana. ''Philosophy of Mind in Sixth-Century China: Paramartha's Evolution of Consciousness.'' 1984. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was [[Guṇabhadra]]'s translation of the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' in four fascicles, which would also become important in the early history of [[Chan Buddhism]]. During the sixth century, the Indian monk and translator Paramārtha widely propagated Yogācāra teachings in China. His translations include the ''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra'', the ''Madhyāntavibhāga-kārikā'', the ''[[Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā]]'', and the ''Mahāyānasaṃgraha''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Diana. ''Philosophy of Mind in Sixth-Century China: Paramartha's Evolution of Consciousness.'' 1984. pp. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt; Paramārtha also taught widely on the principles of Consciousness Only, and developed a large following in southern China.&lt;ref name="Paul, Diana 1984. pp. 32-33"&gt;Paul, Diana. ''Philosophy of Mind in Sixth-Century China: Paramartha's Evolution of Consciousness.'' 1984. pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Many monks and laypeople traveled long distances to hear his teachings, especially those on the ''Mahāyānasaṃgraha''.&lt;ref name="Paul, Diana 1984. pp. 32-33"/&gt;

Although Yogācāra teachings had been propagated widely in China before the 7th century, most look to Xuanzang as the most important founder of East Asian Yogācāra. At the age of 33, Xuanzang made a dangerous journey to India in order to study Buddhism there and to procure Buddhist texts for translation into Chinese.&lt;ref name="Liu, JeeLoo 2006. p. 220"&gt;Liu, JeeLoo. ''An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy: From Ancient Philosophy to Chinese Buddhism.'' 2006. p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Lusthaus writes that Xuanzang had come to the conclusion that issues of dispute in Chinese Buddhism could be resolved with the availability of important texts, and especially the ''Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra''.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus, Dan 2007" /&gt;

Xuanzang spent over ten years in India traveling and studying under various Buddhist masters.&lt;ref name="Liu, JeeLoo 2006. p. 220"/&gt; Lusthaus writes that during this time, Xuanzang discovered that the manner in which Buddhists understood and interpreted texts was much richer and more varied than the Chinese materials had previously indicated, and drew meaning from a broad cultural context.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus, Dan 2007" /&gt; Xuanzang's teachers included [[Śīlabhadra]], the abbot of Nālandā, who was then 106 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Wei Tat. ''Cheng Weishi Lun.'' 1973. p. li&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang was tutored in the Yogācāra teachings by Śīlabhadra for several years at Nālandā. Upon his return from India, Xuanzang brought with him 657 Buddhist texts, including important Yogācāra works such as the ''Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra''.&lt;ref name="Liu, JeeLoo 2006. p. 220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hosso"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tagawa | first = Shun'ei | editor= Charles Muller | title = Living Yogacara: An Introduction to Consciousness-Only Buddhism | publisher = Wisdom Publications | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-86171-589-6 | page=xx-xxi (forward)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to China, he was given government support and many assistants for the purpose of translating these texts into Chinese.

As an important contribution to East Asian Yogācāra, Xuanzang composed the treatise ''[[Cheng Weishi Lun]]'', or "Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only."&lt;ref name="Liu, JeeLoo 2006. p. 221"&gt;Liu, JeeLoo. ''An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy: From Ancient Philosophy to Chinese Buddhism.'' 2006. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; This work is framed around Vasubandhu's ''Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā'', or "Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only." Xuanzang upheld [[Dharmapala of Nalanda|Dharmapāla]]'s commentary on this work as being the correct one, and provided his own explanations of these as well as other views in the ''Cheng Weishi Lun''.&lt;ref name="Liu, JeeLoo 2006. p. 221"/&gt; This work was composed at the behest of Xuanzang's disciple Kuiji, and became a central representation of East Asian Yogācāra.&lt;ref name="Liu, JeeLoo 2006. p. 221"/&gt; Xuanzang also promoted devotional meditative practices toward Maitreya Bodhisattva. Xuanzang's disciple [[Kuiji]] wrote a number of important commentaries on the Yogacara texts and further developed the influence of this doctrine in China, and was recognized by later adherents as the first true patriarch of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Lusthaus, Dan (undated).

===Yogācāra in Tibet===
{{see also|Rangtong-Shentong}}
Yogācāra was first transmitted to Tibet by Śāntarakṣita and then later again by [[Atiśa]].  Yogācāra terminology (though not necessarily its view) is also employed by the Nyingmapa in attempting to describe the nondenumerable ultimate phenomenon ({{bo|t=རྣམ་གྲངས་མ་ཡིན་པའི་དོན་དམ་}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=Ridding Oneself of the Two Sets of Obscurations in Sutra and Highest Tantra According to Nyingma and Sakya |url=http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/sutra/level4_deepening_understanding_path/path/eliminating_2_sets_obscurations.html?query=nondenumerable+ultimate+phenomenon+dzogchen|accessdate=20 June 2016|origyear=2004|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogācāra is, therefore, an integral part of the history of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=Khyentse&gt;{{cite book|last=Khyentse Rinpoche|first=Dzongsar Jamyang|authorlink=Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche|title=Introduction to the Middle Way: Chandrakirti's Madhyamakavatara with Commentary|year=2003|publisher=Khyentse Foundation|location=Dordogne, France|page=8|url=http://www.siddharthasintent.org/|edition=1st|editor=Alex Trisoglio|accessdate=7 January 2013|format=PDF|chapter=Introduction|quote=In the 8th century, Shantarakshita went to Tibet and founded the monastery at Samyé.  He was not a direct disciple of Bhavaviveka, but the disciple of one of his disciples.  He combined the Madhyamika-Svatantrika and Cittamatra schools, and created a new school of Madhyamika called Svatantrika-Yogachara-Madhyamika.  His disciple Kamalashila, who wrote The Stages of Meditation upon Madhyamika (uma’i sgom rim), developed his ideas further, and together they were very influential in Tibet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (whose reforms to Atiśa's [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] tradition are generally considered the beginnings of the [[Gelug]] school)&lt;ref name="Berzin Life"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=The Life of Tsongkhapa|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/spiritual-teachers/tsongkhapa/the-life-of-tsongkhapa|accessdate=6 June 2016|location=Munich, Germany|date=December 2003|quote=There was a very famous Nyingma lama at the time called Lhodrag Namka-gyeltsen, and this Nyingma lama had, continually, visions of Vajrapani.  And he invited Tsongkhapa, and they became mutual teacher and disciple.  It’s from this Nyingma lama that Tsongkhapa got his main lam-rim transmissions from the Kadam tradition&amp;nbsp;— two of the main Kadam lineages.  There are three Kadampa lineages that had split.  He got two of them from this Nyingma lama and one from a Kagyu lama.  The Kadampa was divided into three: One was the lam-rim teachings, one was the textual teachings, and one was the oral guideline teachings.  So he got the lam-rim and the oral guideline lineages from this Nyingma lama, and the textual tradition from a Kagyu lama.  This I find very interesting.  One always thinks that he got them from Kadampa lamas; he didn’t.  And that Gelugpa was so separate from all these other traditions; it wasn’t.  Look at this Kagyu lama, Lama Umapa, that Tsongkhapa studied Madhyamaka with; he had studied Madhyamaka with Sakya.  The Sakyas were the main Madhyamaka people of those days.}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued in favour of Yogācāra views (specifically regarding the existence and functioning of [[Eight Consciousnesses]]) early in his career, the prevailing Gelug view eventually came to hold Yogācāra views as a matter of interpretable meaning, therefore distinct from Madhyamaka logic which was held to be of definitive meaning&lt;ref name=Ocean&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Je Tsongkhapa]]|others=Sparham, Gareth, trans.; in collaboration with Shotaro Iida|title=Ocean of Eloquence: Tsong kha pa's Commentary on the Yogacara Doctrine of Mind|year=1993|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0791414795|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0791414795/|edition=1st.|editor=Kapstein, Matthew|accessdate=18 December 2012|language=Tibetan, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of Buddhist [[two truths doctrine]].

For their part, [[Jonang]] teachers, including [[Taranatha]], held their own [[Rangtong-Shentong|shentong]] ("other-voidness" {{bo|t=གཞན་སྟོང་|w=gzhan-stong}}) views expressed in terms of "Great Madhyamaka" to be ultimately definitive in meaning, in contrast to the circumstantially definitive rangtong ("self-voidness" or [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction|prasaṅgika]], {{bo|t=རང་སྟོང་|w=rang-stong}}) philosophy of what they termed "general Madhyamaka", comprising both Svatantrika and Prasaṅgika Madhyamaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taranatha |title=An Ascertainment of the Two Systems |url=http://www.jonangfoundation.org/great-madhyamaka |publisher=Jonang Foundation |accessdate=19 December 2012 |quote=Accordingly, those who adhere to rangtong take the first wheel of the Buddha's teachings which is the Wheel of Dharma that teaches the Four Noble Truths to be provisional in meaning, the middle Wheel of Dharma that teaches the absence of characteristics as ultimately definitive in meaning, and the final excellently distinguished Wheel of Dharma as teaching the circumstantial definitive meaning, which is provisional in meaning.

Current discussions between Tibetan scholars regarding the differences between shentong and rangtong views may therefore appear similar to historical debates between Yogācāra and Madhyamaka, but the specific distinctions have, in fact, evolved much further.&lt;ref name="Brief Survey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=Brief Survey of Self-voidness and Other-voidness Views|url=http://studybuddhism.com/web/x/nav/group.html_943849830.html|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although later Tibetan views may be said to have evolved from the earlier Indian positions, the distinctions between the views have become increasingly subtle, especially as Yogācāra has evolved to incorporate the Madhyamaka view of the ultimate. [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]], the 19th century [[Rimé movement]] commentator, wrote in his commentary on Śāntarakṣita's synthesis, that the ultimate view in both schools is the same, and that each path leads to the same ultimate state of abiding.&lt;ref name="Padmakara120" /&gt;

===Principal exponents of Yogācāra===
Principal exponents of Yogācāra categorized and alphabetized according to location:
* China: [[Paramartha|Paramārtha]] (真諦 ; 499–569), [[Xuanzang]] (玄奘 ; 602–664)  and [[Kuiji|Kuījī]] (窺基 ; 632–682)
* India: the half-brothers [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] (無著) and [[Vasubandhu]] (世親); [[Sthiramati]] (安慧), [[Dharmapala of Nalanda|Dharmapāla]] (護法), [[Śīlabhadra|Silabhadra]] (戒賢)
* Japan: [[Chitsū]] (智通) and [[Chidatsu]] (智達) of the [[Kusha-shū]] school, [[Dōshō|Dosho]] (道昭), [[Jōkei (monk)|Jokei]] (貞慶), [[:ja:善珠|Zenju]] (善珠), [[Tokuitsu]] (徳一)
* Korea: Daehyeon (大賢), Sinhaeng (神行 ; 704-779), [[Woncheuk]] (圓測 ; 631-696)  and [[Wonhyo]] (元曉 ; 원효 ; 617 - 686)

==Textual corpus==

===Sutras===
The ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'' ("Sūtra of the Explanation of the Profound Secrets"; 2nd century CE), was the seminal Yogācāra sutra and continued to be a primary referent for the tradition. The ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' also assumed considerable importance and portions of this text were considered by [[Étienne Lamotte]] as being contemporaneous with the Saṃdhinirmocana.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti. ''Being as Consciousness: Yogācāra Philosophy of Buddhism'', p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of Buddhism, by Rupert Gethin. Oxford University Press: 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-289223-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other texts include the [[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]] and the ''Ghanavyūha sūtra'' (Secret adornment) both which refer to the doctrine of the ''alaya-vijñana''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti. ''Being as Consciousness: Yogācāra Philosophy of Buddhism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Also containing Yogācāra elements were the ''[[Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra]]'' (1st century CE) and ''[[Ten Stages Sutra|Daśabhūmika Sūtra]]'' (pre-3rd century CE).&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Buddhism'' by Andrew Skilton, Windhorse Publications: 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-904766-92-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=March 2016}} These two sutras contain statements about the mental character of everything.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Five treatises of Maitreya===
[[File:Asanga.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] depiction of Asaṅga and [[Maitreya]]]]
Among the most important texts to the Yogācāra tradition is the ''Five Treatises of Maitreya''. These texts are said to have been related to Asaṅga by the Bodhisattva [[Maitreya]] from Tusita Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;''The Buddha Within'' by S. K. Hookham. SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0358-0}}, pgs 325-6&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars like [[Erich Frauwallner]] and [[Giuseppe Tucci]] held that Maitreya may have been a historical person and Asanga's teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Being as Consciousness: Yogācāra Philosophy of Buddhism. Tola, Fernando and Carmen Dragonetti. Motilal Banarsidass: 2004 pg xv&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=126}} Others like Eric Obermiller are of the opinion that Asanga wrote these five treatises himself.&lt;ref name="Ashok Kumar Chatterjee page 33"&gt;Ashok Kumar Chatterjee; The Yogācāra Idealism, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] likewise doubted the historicity of Maitreya.&lt;ref name="Ashok Kumar Chatterjee page 33"/&gt; Whatever the case, the texts are as follows:

# ''Ornament for Clear Realization'' (''[[Abhisamayalankara|Abhisamayālaṅkāra]],'' Tib. ''mngon-par rtogs-pa'i rgyan'')
# ''Ornament for the Mahāyāna Sutras'' (''[[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra]],'' Tib. ''theg-pa chen-po'i mdo-sde'i rgyan'')
# ''Exposition of the Jeweled Lineage'' (''[[Ratnagotravibhāga]],'' Tib. ''theg-pa chen-po rgyud bla-ma'i bstan'') also known as the ''Uttaratantraśāstra''
# ''Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being'' (''[[Dharma-dharmata-vibhaga|Dharmadharmatāvibhāga]],'' Tib. ''chos-dang chos-nyid rnam-par 'byed-pa'')
# ''Distinguishing the Middle and the Extremes'' (''Madhyāntavibhāga,'' Tib. ''dbus-dang mtha' rnam-par 'byed-pa'')

A commentary on the ''Ornament for Clear Realization'' called "''Clarifying the Meaning''" by [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]] is also often used, as is one by [[Vimuktisena]] ({{bo|t=རྣམ་གྲོལ་སྡེ་}}).

Most of these texts were also incorporated into the Chinese tradition, which was established several centuries earlier than the Tibetan.  However, the ''Ornament for Clear Realization'' is not mentioned by Chinese translators up to the 7th century, including Xuanzang, who was an expert in this field. This suggests it may possibly have emerged from a later period than is generally ascribed to it.

===Asanga===
Authorship of critical Yogācāra texts is also ascribed to [[Asaṅga]] personally (in contrast to the ''Five Treatises of Maitreya''). Among them are the ''[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]'' and the ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]''. Sometimes also ascribed to him is the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra]]'', a massive encyclopedic work considered the definitive statement of Yogācāra, but most scholars believe it was compiled a century later, in the 5th century, while its components reflect various stages in the development of Yogācāra thought. Asaṅga also composed a commentary to the [[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]].

===Vasubandhu===
Vasubandhu is considered to be the systematizer of Yogacara-thought.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=126}}

Vasubandhu wrote three foundational texts of the Yogācāra:
# ''Trisvabhāva-nirdeśa'' (''Treatise on the Three Natures'', Tib. ''Rang-bzhin gsum nges-par bstan'')
# ''Viṃśaṭikā-kārikā'' (''Treatise in Twenty Stanzas'')
# ''Triṃśikaikā-kārikā'' (''Treatise in Thirty Stanzas'')

He also wrote an important commentary on the ''Madhyantavibhaṅga''. According to Buddhist scholar Jay Garfield:
{{quote|While the Trisvabhāva-nirdeśa is arguably the most philosophically detailed and comprehensive of the three short works on this topic composed by Vasubandu, as well as the clearest, it is almost never read or taught in contemporary traditional cultures or centers of learning. The reason may be simply that this is the only one of Vasubandhu’s root texts for which no autocommmentary exists. For this reason, none of Vasubandhu’s students composed commentaries on the text and hence there is no recognized lineage of transmission for the text. So nobody within the Tibetan tradition (the only extant Mahāyāna scholarly tradition) could consider him or herself authorized to teach the text. It is therefore simply not studied, a great pity. It is a beautiful and deep philosophical essay and an unparalleled introduction to the Cittamatra system.&lt;ref name=jlg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garfield|first1=Jay L.|title=Empty words : Buddhist philosophy and cross-cultural interpretation|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195145519|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cgJyMXJgN_oC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}}}}

===Later texts===
[[Dignāga]]  (c. 480 – c. 540 CE) wrote an important Yogacara work, the ''Alambanapariksa'' and its ''vrtti''.

Other important commentaries on various Yogācāra texts were written by [[Sthiramati]] (6th century) and [[Dharmapala of Nalanda]] (7th century), and an influential Yogācāra-Madhyamaka synthesis was formulated by [[Śāntarakṣita]] (8th century).

==Tenets==
{{Buddhist Philosophy sidebar}}
Yogacara is "meant to be an explanation of experience, rather than a system of ontology".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} It uses various concepts in providing this explanation: representation-only, the eight consciousnesses, the three natures, emptiness. They form a complex system, and each can be taken as a point of departure for understanding Yogacara:
{{quote|[I]n the vast and complex system that is known as Yogācāra, all of these different approaches and categories are ultimately tied into each other, and thus, starting with any one of them, one can eventually enter into all of the rest."&lt;ref name="Muller, A. Charles 2008"&gt;Muller, A. Charles (2005; 2007). ''Wonhyo's Reliance on Huiyuan in his Exposition of the Two Hindrances.'' (Published in Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism. Imre Hamar, ed., Harrassowitz Verlag, 2007, p. 281-295.) Source: [http://www.acmuller.net/articles/wonhyo-huiyuan-2006.html] (accessed: April 7, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Yogacara is usually treated as a philosophical system, but it is a school of practice as well:
{{quote|[Yogācāra] attaches importance to the religious practice of yoga as a means for attaining final emancipation from the bondage of the phenomenal world. The stages of yoga are systematically set forth in the treatises associated with this tradition.&lt;ref name="Jones, Lindsay 2005" /&gt;}}
Yogācārins developed an [[Abhidharma]] literature set within a Mahāyāna framework.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, "An Introduction to Buddhism." Cambridge University Press, 1993, page 106.&lt;/ref&gt; John Keenan, who has translated the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'' into English, writes:&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, John P. (tr). ''The Scripture on the Explication of the Underlying Meaning.'' 2000. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Yogācāra masters inherited the mystical approach of the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] texts. However, they did not reject the validity of theoretical Abhidharma. Rather they attempted to construct a critical understanding of the consciousness that underlies all meaning, both mystical and theoretical. Their focus was on doctrine, but as it flowed from the practice of meditative centering (''yoga''), rather than as it was understood in acts of conceptual apprehension.}}

===Vijñapti-mātra===
One of the main features of Yogācāra philosophy is the concept of ''vijñapti-mātra''. It is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Several modern researchers object to this translation, and the accompanying label of "absolute idealism" or "idealistic monism".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} A better translation for ''vijñapti-mātra'' is ''representation-only'',{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}} while an alternative translation for ''citta'' (mind, thought) ''mātra'' (only, exclusively) has not been proposed.

According to [[Dan Lusthaus]], this theory is similar in some ways to Western [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenological]] theories and [[Epistemological idealism|Epistemological Idealism]], but it is not a metaphysical idealism because Yogācāra rejects the construction of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lusthaus, Dan, What is and isn't Yogacara, http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro.html&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding ''Vijñapti-mātra,'' Lusthaus translates it as "nothing but conscious construction" and states it is:&lt;blockquote&gt;A deceptive trick is built into the way consciousness operates at every moment. Consciousness projects and constructs a cognitive object in such a way that it disowns its own creation - pretending the object is "out there" - in order to render that object capable of being appropriated. Even while what we cognize is occurring within our act of cognition, we cognize it ''as if'' it were external to our consciousness. Realization of ''vijñapti-mātra'' exposes this trick intrinsic to consciousness's workings, thereby eliminating it. When that deception is removed one's mode of cognition is no longer termed ''vijñāna'' (consciousness); it has become direct cognition (''jñāna'') (see above). Consciousness engages in this deceptive game of projection, dissociation, and appropriation because there is no "self." According to Buddhism, the deepest, most pernicious erroneous view held by sentient beings is the view that a permanent, eternal, immutable, independent self exists. There is no such self, and deep down we know that. This makes us anxious, since it entails that no self or identity endures forever. In order to assuage that anxiety, we attempt to construct a self, to fill the anxious void, to do something enduring. The projection of cognitive objects for appropriation is consciousness's main tool for this construction. If I own things (ideas, theories, identities, material objects), then "I am." If there are eternal objects that I can possess, then I too must be eternal. To undermine this desperate and erroneous appropriative grasping, Yogācāra texts say: Negate the object, and the self is also negated (e.g., ''Madhyānta-vibhāga'', 1:4, 8).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Thomas Kochumuttom, Yogācāra is a ''realistic pluralism''. It does not deny the existence of individual beings:{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}}
{{quote|What it denies is:
# That the absolute mode of reality is consciousness/mind/ideas,
# That the individual beings are transformations or evolutes of an absolute consciousness/mind/idea,
# That the individual beings are but illusory appearances of a monistic reality.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1-2}}}}

''Vijñapti-mātra'' then means "mere representation of consciousness":
{{quote|[T]he phrase ''vijñaptimātratā-vāda'' means a theory which says that the world ''as it appears'' to the unenlightened ones is mere representation of consciousness. Therefore, any attempt to interpret ''vijñaptimātratā-vāda'' as idealism would be a gross misunderstanding of it.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}}}

The term ''vijñapti-mātra'' replaced the "more metaphysical"{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=135}} term ''citta-mātra'' used in the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=126}} The ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' "appears to be one of the earliest attempts to provide a philosophical justification for the Absolutism that emerged in Mahayana in relation to the concept of Buddha".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=122}} It uses the term ''citta-mātra'', which means properly "thought-only". By using this term it develops an ''ontology'', in contrast to the ''epistemology'' of the term vijñapti-mātra. The ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' equates ''citta'' and the absolute. According to Kochumuttom, this is not the way Yogacara uses the term vijñapti:{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5-6}}
{{quote|[T]he absolute state is defined simply as emptiness, namely the emptiness of subject-object distinction. Once thus defined as emptiness (''sunyata''), it receives a number of synonyms, none of which betray idealism.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=6}}}}

The term ''citta-mātra'' was used in Tibet and East Asia interchangeably with "Yogācāra", although modern scholars believe it is inaccurate to conflate the two terms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empty Words: Buddhist philosophy and Cross-Cultural Interpretation|last=Garfield|first=Jay|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780195146721|location=Oxford and New York|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the uniformity of an assumed "Yogācāra school" has been put into question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/pdf/digitale_texte/Bayer_2012-AS-Karman-Corrigenda.pdf Bayer 2012, pp. 3, 7] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714232918/http://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/pdf/digitale_texte/Bayer_2012-AS-Karman-Corrigenda.pdf |date=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consciousness===
{{Main|Eight Consciousnesses}}
Yogacara gives a detailed explanation of the workings of the mind and the way it constructs the reality we experience. Vasubandhu used the concept of the [[Vijñāna#Six vijñānas|six consciousnesses]], on which he elaborated in the ''Triṃśikaikā-kārikā'' (Treatise in Thirty Stanzas).{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=135-143}}

According to the traditional interpretation, Vasubandhu states that there are eight consciousnesses: the five sense-consciousnesses, mind (perception), manas (self-consciousness),{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138-140}} and the storehouse-consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137-139}} According to Kalupahana, this classification of eight consciousnesses is based on a misunderstanding of Vasubandhu's Triṃśikaikā-kārikā by later adherents.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Kalupahana: "The above explanation of ''alaya-vijnana'' makes it very different from that found in the ''Lankavatara''. The latter assumes ''alaya'' to be the eight consciousness, giving the impression that it represents a totally distinct category. Vasubandhu does not refer to it as the eight, even though his later disciples like Sthiramati and Hsuan Tsang constantly refer to it as such".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}}}

====Karma, seeds and storehouse-consciousness====
According to the traditional explanation, the theory of the consciousnesses attempted to explain all the phenomena of cyclic existence, including how rebirth occurs and precisely how [[karma]] functions on an individual basis{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}. It addressed questions that had long vexed Buddhist philosophers, such as,
* 'If one carries out a good or evil act, why and how is it that the effects of that act do not appear immediately?'
* 'Insofar as they do not appear immediately, where is this karma waiting for its opportunity to play out?'

The answer given by later Yogācārins was the [[store consciousness]] (Sanskrit: ''ālayavijñāna''), also known as the basal, or [[eighth consciousness]]. It simultaneously acts as a storage place for karmic latencies and as a fertile matrix of predispositions that bring karma to a state of fruition.

The likeness of this process to the cultivation of plants led to the creation of the metaphor of seeds (Sanskrit: ''[[bīja]]'') to explain the way karma is stored in the eighth consciousness. In the Yogācāra formulation, all experience without exception is said to result from the ripening of karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey, Brian Peter|title=An Introduction to Buddhist ethics: Foundations, Values, and Issues|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2000|isbn= 0-521-55640-6 |page= 297 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=URZNk9noWJEC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22due+to+karma%22+yogacara&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ug8YVFASFC&amp;sig=ASkknejfBRiFHO4RfQaDiAIX0U4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rGFPS7b9OZXU8QbM_u2TCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22due%20to%20karma%22%20yogacara&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seemingly external world is merely a "by-product" (''adhipati-phala'') of karma. The term ''[[vāsanā]]'' ("perfuming") is also used, and Yogācārins debated whether vāsāna and bija were essentially the same, the seeds were the effect of the perfuming, or whether the perfuming simply affected the seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lusthaus, Dan |title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih lun|publisher= RoutledgeCurzon|year= 2002|isbn= 0-415-40610-2 |page= 194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeiwsT-XqwQC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=conditioning+buddhism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3J5qEoez8F&amp;sig=kbQ75qvMRURcje0GPsMfS68rdJ4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8xNRS-npJ4mb8AaQnrCZCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=conditioning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type, quantity, quality and strength of the seeds determine where and how a sentient being will be reborn: one's race, gender, social status, proclivities, bodily appearance and so forth. The conditioning of the mind resulting from karma is called ''[[Saṅkhāra|saṃskāra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lusthaus, Dan |title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih lun|publisher= RoutledgeCurzon|year= 2002|isbn= 0-415-40610-2 |page= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Treatise on Action'' (''Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa''), also by Vasubandhu, treats the subject of karma in detail from the Yogācāra perspective.&lt;ref&gt;''Karmasiddhiprakarana: The Treatise on Action'' by Vasubandhu. translated by Etienne Lamotte and Leo M. Pruden. Asian Humanities Press: 2001 {{ISBN|0-89581-908-2}}. pg 13, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transformations of consciousness====
The traditional interpretation may be discarded on the ground of a reinterpretation of Vasubandhu's works. According to scholar Roger R. Jackson, a "'fundamental unconstructed awareness' (''mūla-nirvikalpa-jñāna'')" is "described [...] frequently in Yogacara literature.",&lt;ref&gt;"How Mystical is Buddhism?" by Roger R. Jackson ''Asian Philosophy'', Vol. 6, No.2, 1996 pg 150&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kalupahana, instead of positing additional consciousnesses, the Triṃśikaikā-kārikā describes the ''transformations'' of this consciousness:
{{quote|Taking ''vipaka'', ''manana'' and ''vijnapti'' as three different kinds of functions, rather than characteristics, and understanding ''vijnana'' itself as a function (''vijnanatiti vijnanam''), Vasubandhu seems to be avoiding any form of substantialist thinking in relation to consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137}}}}

These transformations are threefold:{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137}}
{{quote|Whatever, indeed, is the variety of ideas of self and elements that prevails, it occurs in the transformation of consciousness. Such transformation is threefold, [namely,]{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=192, Trimsika verse 1}}}}

The first transformation results in the ''alaya'':
{{quote|the resultant, what is called mentation, as well as the concept of the object. Herein, the consciousness called ''alaya'', with all its seeds, is the resultant.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=194, Trimsika verse 2}}}}

The alaya-vijnana therefore is not an eight consciousness, but the resultant of the transformation of consciousness:
{{quote|Instead of being a completely distinct category, ''alaya-vijnana'' merely represents the normal flow of the stream of consciousness uninterrupted by the appearance of reflective self-awareness. It is no more than the unbroken stream of consciousness called the life-process by the Buddha. It is the cognitive process, containing both emotive and conative aspects of human experience, but without the enlarged egoistic emotions and dogmatic graspings characteristic of the next two transformations.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}}}

The second transformation is ''manana'', self-consciousness or "Self-view, self-confusion, self-esteem and self-love".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138}} According to the Lankavatara and later interpreters it is the seventh consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=140}} It is "thinking" about the various perceptions occurring in the stream of consciousness".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=140}} The alaya is defiled by this self-interest;
{{quote|[I]t can be purified by adopting a non-substantialist (''anatman'') perspective and thereby allowing the ''alaya''-part (i.e. attachment) to dissipate, leaving consciousness or the function of being intact.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138}}}}

The third transformation is ''visaya-vijnapti'', the "''concept'' of the object".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141}} In this transformation the ''concept'' of objects is created. By creating these concepts human beings become "susceptible to grasping after the object":{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141}}
{{quote|Vasubandhu is critical of the third transformation, not because it relates to the conception of an object, but because it generates grasping after a "real object" (''sad artha''), even when it is no more than a conception (''vijnapti'') that combines experience and reflection.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141-142}}}}

A similar perspective is given by [[Walpola Rahula]]. According to Walpola Rahula, all the elements of the Yogācāra storehouse-consciousness are already found in the Pāli Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the three layers of the mind (''citta'', ''manas'', and ''vijñana'') as presented by Asaṅga are also mentioned in the Pāli Canon:
{{quote|Thus we can see that 'Vijñāna' represents the simple reaction or response of the sense organs when they come in contact with external objects. This is the uppermost or superficial aspect or layer of the 'Vijñāna-skandha'. 'Manas' represents the aspect of its mental functioning, thinking, reasoning, conceiving ideas, etc. 'Citta' which is here called 'Ālayavijñāna', represents the deepest, finest and subtlest aspect or layer of the Aggregate of consciousness. It contains all the traces or impressions of the past actions and all good and bad future possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, quoted in Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Fb0q9bKJjIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=development+of+the+theory+of+karma+buddhism&amp;lr=#PPA66,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Tathagata-garba thought====
The store consciousness concept developed along with the [[Tathāgatagarbha|Buddha nature]] doctrine and resolved into the concept of [[mindstream]] or the "consciousness-continuity" (Sanskrit: ''citta-santāna'')&lt;ref&gt;Source:  [http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/dic3_c.htm] (accessed: November 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid being denounced as running counter to the doctrine of [[shunyata|emptiness]] (''śūnyatā'') and the tenets of [[anatman|selflessness]] (''anātman'').

It may be ultimately traceable to the "[[luminous mind]]" mentioned once in the ''[[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]]'', but according to Kalupahana,
{{quote|The concept of ''alaya'' is borrowed from ''Lankavatara''; but it does not have the same characteristics nor does it function in the same way. It is neither "the originally pure mind" (''prakrti-prabhasvara-citta'') nor "the location of the womb (of enlightenment)" (''garbha-samsthana'').{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=136}}}}

To account for the notion of [[Buddha-nature]] in all beings, Yogacara scholars in China such as Tz'u-en (慈恩, 632-682) the first patriarch in China, advocated two types of nature: the latent nature found in all beings (理佛性) and the Buddha-nature in practice (行佛性).  The latter nature was determined by the innate seeds listed above.&lt;ref name="groner" /&gt;

===The Three Natures===
The Yogācārins defined three basic modes by which we perceive our world.  These are referred to in Yogācāra as the three natures of perception.  They are:
# '''Parikalpita''' (literally, "fully conceptualized"): "imaginary nature", wherein things are incorrectly comprehended based on conceptual construction, through attachment and erroneous discrimination.
# '''Paratantra''' (literally, "other dependent"): "dependent nature", by which the correct understanding of the [[dependently originated]] nature of things is understood.
# '''Pariniṣpanna''' (literally, "fully accomplished"): "absolute nature", through which one comprehends things as they are in themselves, uninfluenced by any conceptualization at all.

Also, regarding perception, the Yogācārins emphasized that our everyday understanding of the existence of external objects is problematic, since in order to perceive any object (and thus, for all practical purposes, for the object to "exist"), there must be a sensory organ as well as a correlative type of consciousness to allow the process of cognition to occur.

===Emptiness in Yogācāra===
The doctrine of ''[[śūnyatā]]'' is central to Yogācāra, as to any Mahāyāna school. Early Yogācāra texts, such as the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'' and the ''Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra'', often act as explanations of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. Related concepts as dependent origination (''pratītyasamutpāda'') and the doctrine of [[Two Truths Doctrine|two truths]] are also central in Yogācāra thought and meditation.&lt;ref name="Keenan, John P. 1993 pp.203" /&gt; But the Yogacara-school developed its own insights on the nature of sunyata:
{{quote|[T]he Yogācāra thinkers did not simply comment on Mādhyamika thought. They attempted to ground insight into emptiness in a critical understanding of the mind, articulated in a sophisticated theoretical discourse.&lt;ref name="Keenan, John P. 1993 pp.203"&gt;Keenan, John P. (1993). ''Yogācarā''. p.203 published in Yoshinori, Takeuchi; with Van Bragt, Jan; Heisig, James W.; O'Leary, Joseph S.; Swanson, Paul L.(1993). ''Buddhist Spirituality:  Indian, Southeast Asian, Tibetan, and Early Chinese.'' New York City: The Crossroad Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-8245-1277-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yogacara has a positive approach of emptiness:
{{quote|Although meaning 'absence of inherent existence' in Madhyamaka, to the Yogācārins &lt;nowiki&gt;[emptiness]&lt;/nowiki&gt; means 'absence of duality between perceiving subject [''grāhaka, 'dzin-pa''] and the perceived object [''grāhya, bzhung-ba''].'"&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew (1994). ''A Concise History of Buddhism''. Windhorse Publications, London:. pg 124&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Each of the three natures has its corresponding "absence of nature":
# ''parikalpita'' =&gt; ''lakṣana-niḥsvabhāvatā'', the "absence of inherent characteristic"
# ''paratantra'' =&gt; ''utpatti-niḥsvabhāvatā'', the "absence of inherent arising"
# ''pariniṣpanna'' =&gt; ''paramārtha-niḥsvabhāvatā'', the "absence of inherent ultimacy"
Each of these "absences" is a form of emptiness, i.e. the nature is "empty" of the particular qualified quality.

Yogācāra gave special significance to the ''Lesser Discourse on Emptiness'' of the ''Āgamas''.&lt;ref&gt;Gadjin M. Nagao, ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Majhima Nikaya 121: Cula-suññata Sutta &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.121.than.html Cula-suññata Sutta: The Lesser Discourse on Emptiness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is often quoted in later Yogācāra texts as a true definition of emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Gadjin M. Nagao, ''Madhyamika and Yogacara.'' Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, page 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alikākāravāda and Satyākāravāda ===
An important debate about the reality of mental appearances within Yogācāra led to its later subdivision into two systems of Alikākāravāda ([[Tibetic languages|Tib.]] ''rnam rdzun pa'', False Aspectarians) and Satyākāravāda (''rnam bden pa'', True Aspectarians) or "Aspectarians" (''ākāra'') and "Non-Aspectarians" (''anākāra''). The core issue is whether appearances or “aspects” (''rnam pa, ākāra'') of objects in the mind are treated as true (''bden pa, satya'') or false (''rdzun pa, alika'').&lt;ref&gt;Komarovski, Yaroslav'', Visions of Unity: The Golden Paṇḍita Shakya Chokden’s New Interpretation of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; While this division did not exist in the works of the early Yogācāra philosophers, tendencies similar to these views can be discerned in the works of Yogacara thinkers like [[Dharmapala of Nalanda|Dharmapala]] (c. 530–561?) and [[Sthiramati]] (c. 510–570?).&lt;ref&gt;Komarovski, Yaroslav'', Visions of Unity: The Golden Paṇḍita Shakya Chokden’s New Interpretation of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yaroslav Komarovski the distinction is:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although Yogācāras in general do not accept the existence of an external material world, according to Satyākāravāda its appearances or “aspects” (''rnam pa, ākāra'') reflected in consciousness have a real existence, because they are of one nature with the really existent consciousness, their creator. According to Alikākāravāda, neither external phenomena nor their appearances and/in the minds that reflect them really exist. What exists in reality is only primordial mind (''ye shes, jñāna''), described as self-cognition (''rang rig, [[Svasaṃvedana|svasamvedana]]/ svasamvitti'') or individually self-cognizing primordial mind (''so so(r) rang gis rig pa’i ye shes'').&lt;ref&gt;Komarovski, Yaroslav'', Visions of Unity: The Golden Paṇḍita Shakya Chokden’s New Interpretation of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Meditation and awakening==

===Meditation===
As the name of the school suggests, meditation practice is central to the Yogācāra tradition. Practice manuals prescribe the practice of mindfulness of body, feelings, thoughts and [[dharma]]s in oneself and others, out of which an understanding of the non-differentiation of self and other is said to arise. This process is referred to in the Yogācāra tradition as ''āśraya-parāvṛtti'', "turning about in the basis", or "revolution of the basis",{{sfn|Park|1983|p=126-132}}{{sfn|King|1998|p=5-18}} the basis being the store-house consciousness:
{{quote|... a sudden revulsion, turning, or re-turning of the ālaya vijñaña back into its original state of purity [...] the Mind returns to its original condition of non-attachment, non-discrimination and non-duality".{{sfn|Park|1983|p=127}}}}
In this awakening it is realized that observer and observed are not distinct entities, but mutually co-dependent.

===Five Categories of Beings===
One of the more controversial teachings espoused by the Yogacara school was an extension of the teachings on seeds and store-conscious.  Based on the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'' and the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', the Yogacara school posited that sentient beings had innate seeds that would make them capable of achieving a particular state of enlightenment and no other.  Thus, beings were categorized in 5 ways:&lt;ref name="groner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Groner|first=Paul|title=The Establishment of the Tendai School|year=2000|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0824823710|pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to achieve full Buddhahood (i.e. Bodhisattva path).
# Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to achieve the state of a [[pratyekabuddha]] (private Buddha).
# Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to achieve the state of an [[arhat]].
# Beings whose innate seeds had an indeterminate nature, and could potentially be any of the above.
# Beings whose innate seeds were incapable of achieving enlightenment ever.

The fifth class of beings, the [[Icchantika]], were described in various Mahayana sutras as being incapable of achieving Enlightenment, unless in some cases through the aid of a Buddha or Bodhisattva.  Nevertheless, the notion was highly criticized by adherents of the Lotus Sutra (e.g. the [[Tiantai]] school) and its teaching of universal Buddhahood. This tension appears in East Asian Buddhist history.&lt;ref name="groner" /&gt;

==Contemporary scholarship==
According to [[Dan Lusthaus|Lusthaus]],&lt;ref&gt;Lusthaus, Dan (1999). ''A Brief Retrospective of Western Yogaacaara Scholarship in the 20th century''. Florida State University. (Presented at the 11th International Conference on Chinese Philosophy, [[Chengchi University]], Taipei, Taiwan, July 26–31, 1999.)

===Philosophical dialogue: Yogācāra, idealism and phenomenology===
Yogācāra has also been identified in the western philosophical tradition as [[idealism]], or more specifically [[subjective idealism]]. This equation was standard until recently, when it began to be challenged by scholars such as Kochumuttom, Anacker, Kalupahana,{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}} Dunne, Lusthaus,&lt;ref name="Lust"&gt;[[Dan Lusthaus]], ''What is and isn't Yogacara.''

Philosophy East and West, Volume 46, Number 4, October 1996, pages 447-476: "Of course, the Yogacara put its trust in the subjective search for truth by way of a samadhi. This rendered the external world not less real, but less valuable as the way of finding truth. The tide of misinformation on this, or on any other topic of Indian lore comes about because authors frequently read just a few verses or paragraphs of a text, then go to secondary sources, or to treatises by rivals, and presume to speak authoritatively. Only after doing genuine research on such a topic can one begin to answer the question: why were those texts and why do the moderns write the way they do?"}} Buddhist scholar Jay Garfield continues to uphold the equation of Yogācāra and idealism, however.&lt;ref name="jlg" /&gt;{{rp|155}} To the same effect, Nobuyoshi Yamabe states that "Dignāga also clearly inherited the idealistic system of Yogācāra." &lt;ref&gt;Yamabe, Nobuyoshi (2004), "Consciousness, Theories of", in Buswell, Jr., Robert E., Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, USA: Macmillan Reference USA, pp. 177, {{ISBN|0-02-865910-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many contemporary scholars, Yamabe is aware that the texts considered to be Yogācāra treatises reflect various stages in addressing the issue of mind and matter.
Yogācāra has also been aligned with [[phenomenalism]]. In modern western philosophical [[discourse]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] have approached what western scholarship generally concedes to be a standard Yogācāra position.

==Legacy==
There are two important aspects of the Yogācāra schemata that are of special interest to modern-day practitioners. One is that virtually all schools of Mahāyāna Buddhism came to rely on these Yogācāra explanations as they created their own doctrinal systems, including the [[Zen]] schools. For example, the early Zen tradition in China was sometimes referred to simply as the "{{IAST|Laṅkāvatāra}} school" (Ch. 楞伽宗, ''Léngqié Zōng''), due to their strong association with the ''{{IAST|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra}}''.&lt;ref name="dumoulin"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dumoulin|first=Heinrich|year=2005|title=Zen Buddhism: A History|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=World Wisdom|volume=vol. 1 India and China|page=52|isbn=0-941532-89-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sūtra draws heavily upon Yogācāra theories of the eight consciousnesses, especially the ''{{IAST|ālayavijñāna}}''. Accounts recording the history of this early period are preserved in ''Records of the {{IAST|Laṅkāvatāra}} Masters'' (Ch. 楞伽師資記, ''[[Léngqié Shīzī Jì]]'').

That the scriptural tradition of Yogācāra is not yet well known among the community of western practitioners is perhaps attributable to the fact that most of the initial transmission of Buddhism to the west has been directly concerned with meditation and basic doctrines. However, within Tibetan Buddhism more and more western students are becoming acquainted with this school.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Very little research in English has been carried out on the Chinese Yogācāra traditions.

'''Zeno of Elea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|n|oʊ|...|ˈ|ɛ|l|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|[[wikt:Ζήνων|Ζήνων]] ὁ Ἐλεάτης}}; {{c.|490|430 BC}}) was a [[pre-Socratic]] Greek [[philosopher]] of [[Magna Graecia]] and a member of the [[Eleatic School]] founded by [[Parmenides]].  [[Aristotle]] called him the inventor of the [[dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], 8.57, 9.25&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], which [[Bertrand Russell]] has described as "immeasurably subtle and profound".&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1996 [1903]), p. 347: "In this capricious world nothing is more capricious than posthumous fame. One of the most notable victims of posterity's lack of judgement is the Eleatic Zeno. Having invented four arguments all immeasurably subtle and profound, the grossness of subsequent philosophers pronounced him to be a mere ingenious juggler, and his arguments to be one and all sophisms. After two thousand years of continual refutation, these sophisms were reinstated, and made the foundation of a mathematical renaissance..."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Little is known for certain about Zeno's life. Although written nearly a century after Zeno's death, the primary source of biographical information about Zeno is [[Plato]]'s ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]] (c. 380 – 367 BC). [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/parmenides.html ''Parmenides''], translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]]. Internet Classics Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is also mentioned in Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle (c. mid 4th century BC), ''Physics'' 233a and 239b.&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue of ''Parmenides'', Plato describes a visit to [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by Zeno and Parmenides, at a time when Parmenides is "about 65", Zeno is "nearly 40", and [[Socrates]] is "a very young man".&lt;ref name=parm&gt;Plato, ''Parmenides'' 127b–e.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming an age for Socrates of around 20 and taking the date of Socrates' birth as 469 BC gives an approximate date of birth for Zeno of 490 BC. Plato says that Zeno was "tall and fair to look upon" and was "in the days of his youth … reported to have been beloved by Parmenides".&lt;ref name=parm /&gt;

Other perhaps less reliable details of Zeno's life are given by [[Diogenes Laërtius]] in his ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]]. ''The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'', translated by C. D. Yonge. London: Henry G. Bohn, 1853. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlzeno-eleatic.htm Scanned and edited for Peithô's Web].&lt;/ref&gt; where it is reported that he was the son of Teleutagoras, but the adopted son of Parmenides, was "skilled to argue both sides of any question, the universal critic", and that he was arrested and perhaps killed at the hands of a tyrant of [[Velia|Elea]].

According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], Zeno conspired to overthrow [[Nearchus of Elea|Nearchus the tyrant]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers''. Book IX.5.26.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Zeno was arrested and tortured.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boethius]], [[The Consolation of Philosophy]]. Book 1.III.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Valerius Maximus]], when he was tortured to reveal the name of his colleagues in conspiracy, Zeno refused to reveal their names, although he said that he did have a secret that would be advantageous for Nearchus to hear. When Nearchus leaned in to listen to the secret, Zeno bit his ear. He "did not let go until he lost his life and the tyrant lost that part of his body".&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ''Memorable Deeds and Sayings''. Foreign Stories 3. ''ext.'' 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;{{cite book |last=Maximus |first=Valerius |last2=Walker |first2=Henry J. |year=2004 |title=Memorable Deeds and Sayings: One Thousand Tales from Ancient Rome |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5imDC6VN-FcC&amp;pg=PA97 97] |publisher=Hackett Pub. |isbn=978-0-87220-674-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within ''Men of the Same Name'', Demetrius said that the nose was bit off instead.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers''. Book IX.5.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeno may have also interacted with other tyrants. According to Laertius, [[Heraclides Lembus]], within his ''[[Satyrus the Peripatetic|Satyrus]]'', these events occurred against Diomedon instead of Nearchus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Valerius Maximus recounts a conspiracy against the tyrant [[Phalaris]], but this would be impossible as Phalaris had died before Zeno was even born.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ''Memorable Deeds and Sayings''. Foreign Stories 3. ''ext.'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Plutarch]], Zeno attempted to kill the [[List of ancient Greek tyrants#Elea|tyrant Demylus]]. After failing, he had "with his own teeth bit off his tongue, he spit it in the tyrant’s face".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Against Colotes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Although many ancient writers refer to the writings of Zeno, none of his works survive intact. The main sources on the nature of Zeno's arguments on motion, in fact, come from the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia]].&lt;ref name=Cajori1920&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cajori |first1=Florian |title=The Purpose of Zeno's Arguments on Motion |journal=Isis |date=1920 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7–20 |doi=10.1086/357889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato says that Zeno's writings were "brought to Athens for the first time on the occasion of" the visit of Zeno and Parmenides.&lt;ref name=parm /&gt; Plato also has Zeno say that this work "meant to protect the arguments of Parmenides",&lt;ref name=parm /&gt; was written in Zeno's youth, stolen, and published without his consent. Plato has Socrates paraphrase the "first thesis of the first argument" of Zeno's work as follows: "If being is many, it must be both like and unlike, and this is impossible, for neither can the like be unlike, nor the unlike like."&lt;ref name=parm /&gt;

According to [[Proclus]] in his ''Commentary on Plato's Parmenides'', Zeno produced "not less than forty arguments revealing contradictions",&lt;ref&gt;Proclus, ''Commentary on Plato's'' Parmenides, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; but only nine are now known.

Zeno's arguments are perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', literally meaning ''to reduce to the absurd''. Parmenides is said{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} to be the first individual to implement this style of argument.  This form of argument soon became known as the ''epicheirema'' ({{lang|grc|ἐπιχείρημα}}). In Book VII of his ''Topics'', [[Aristotle]] says that an ''epicheirema'' is "a dialectical [[syllogism]]". It is a connected piece of reasoning which an opponent has put forward as true. The disputant sets out to break down the dialectical syllogism. This destructive method of argument was maintained by him to such a degree that [[Seneca the Younger]] commented a few centuries later: "If I accede to Parmenides there is nothing left but the One; if I accede to Zeno, not even the One is left."&lt;ref name=zeno&gt;''Zeno'' in ''The Presocratics'', Philip Wheelwright ed., The Odyssey Press, 1966, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeno is also regarded as the first philosopher who dealt with the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical [[infinity]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]], in [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] (1870)&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite DGRBM |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pr8_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=cosmogony+of+Parmenides,+which+was+carried+out+very&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8oBpVcvrAa2v7AaezoP4Dg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cosmogony%20of%20Parmenides%2C%20which%20was%20carried%20out%20very&amp;f=false |title=Parmenides |year=1870 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Others content themselves with reckoning [[Parmenides]] as well as ''Zeno'' as belonging to the [[Pythagorean school]], or with speaking of a ''Parraenidean life'', in the same way as a ''Pythagorean life'' is spoken of; and even the censorious Timon allows Parmenides to have been a high-minded man; while Plato speaks of him with veneration, and Aristotle and others give him an unqualified preference over the rest of the Eleatics.''

== Zeno's paradoxes ==
{{Main| Zeno's paradoxes}}
Zeno's paradoxes have puzzled, challenged, influenced, inspired, infuriated, and amused philosophers, mathematicians, and physicists for over two millennia. The most famous are the arguments against motion described by Aristotle in his ''Physics'', Book VI.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle.
