      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1809">'''André Jodin''' is an [[archaeologist]] known for explorations and excavations in [[North Africa]], especially in [[Morocco]].
André Jodin (1921-2003) studied Phoenician and Punic sites in Morocco in the 1960s and 1970s. Mogador (Essaouira) (Kerné?)  became then the most extreme place of Phoenician merchants in the South Atlantic African coast. 
His contribution to Volubilis (Muley Idris) followed Carcopino’s thesis about the regia of  king Juba II (25 BP-23 AD) in Morocco.
In the 1980s André Jodin participated in the archaeological study of the Iberian necropolis of Cabezo Lucero (Guardamar del Segura, Alicante).

Originally named the "Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the [[Dark Knight (nickname)|Dark Knight]], and the World's Greatest Detective.&lt;ref name="Fleisher"&gt;Fleisher, Michael L. ''The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes Volume 1 Batman'' Collier Books 1976 {{ISBN|978-0-02-080090-3}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Batman's [[secret identity]] is '''Bruce Wayne''', a wealthy American [[playboy lifestyle|playboy]], [[socialite]], [[philanthropy|philanthropist]], and owner of [[Wayne Enterprises]]. After witnessing the murder of his parents [[Thomas Wayne|Dr. Thomas Wayne]] and [[Martha Wayne]] as a child, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a [[Batsuit|bat-inspired]] persona to fight crime.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 40–44 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batman operates in the fictional [[Gotham City]] with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]], police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|Gordon]], and vigilante allies such as [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]; rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]], including his [[archenemy]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].

The character became popular soon after his introduction in 1939 and gained his own comic book title, ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'', the following year. As the decades went on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series used a [[Camp (style)|camp]] aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in 1986 with ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]. The success of [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]' live-action [[Batman in film|''Batman'' feature films]] have helped maintain the character's prominence in mainstream culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/the-big-question-what-is-the-history-of-batman-and-why-does-he-still-appeal-873780.html | title=The Big Question: What is the history of Batman, and why does he still appeal? | work=[[The Independent]] | date=July 22, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729223151/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/the-big-question-what-is-the-history-of-batman-and-why-does-he-still-appeal-873780.html | archivedate=July 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An American cultural icon, Batman has garnered enormous popularity and is among the most identifiable comic book characters.

===Creation===
[[File:Batman ad.jpg|thumb|right|First published image of Batman, in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #12, announcing the character's debut in the forthcoming ''Detective Comics'' #27&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/389/ |title=DIAL B for BLOG - THE WORLD'S GREATEST COMIC BLOGAZINE |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819193839/http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/389/ |archivedate=August 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In early 1939, the success of [[Superman]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' prompted editors at [[National Comics Publications]] (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, [[Bob Kane]] created "the Bat-Man".&lt;ref&gt;[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]]. ''Batman: The Complete History''. Chronicle Books, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-8118-4232-7}}, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborator [[Bill Finger]] recalled that "Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of&amp;nbsp;... reddish tights, I believe, with boots&amp;nbsp;... no gloves, no gauntlets&amp;nbsp;... with a small [[domino mask]], swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign&amp;nbsp;... BATMAN".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]]. ''The Steranko History of Comics 1''. Reading, PA: Supergraphics, 1970. ({{ISBN|978-0-517-50188-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired as a child by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]]'s sketch of an [[ornithopter]] flying device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Batman - The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Dark Knight|author=Les Daniels|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Batman_The_Complete_History.html?id=73wknu2cVIkC|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finger suggested giving the character a [[cowl]] instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 21, 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Havholm, Peter|title=Corporate Authorship: A Response to Jerome Christensen|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=30|issue=1|date=Autumn 2003|page=192|issn=0093-1896|doi=10.1086/380810|last2=Sandifer|first2=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archives 3"&gt;Biography by Joe Desris, in ''Batman Archives'', Volume 3 ([[DC Comics]], 1994), p. 223. {{ISBN|978-1-56389-099-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Les Daniels |last=Daniels |first=Les |title=Batman: The Complete History |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8118-4232-7 |pages=21, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: "Bruce Wayne's first name came from [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock&amp;nbsp;... then I thought of [[Anthony Wayne|Mad Anthony Wayne]]."&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;Kane, Andrae, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; He later said his suggestions were influenced by [[Lee Falk]]'s popular ''[[The Phantom]]'', a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was also familiar.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kane, Andrae, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods, and weaponry. Details find predecessors in [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], [[comic strip]]s, [[newspaper]] headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Les. ''DC Comics: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes''. New York: Billboard Books/Watson-Guptill Publications, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-8230-7919-3}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had predecessors in [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] (created by [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]], 1903) and [[Zorro]] (created by [[Johnston McCulley]], 1919). Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane noted the influence of the films ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like [[Doc Savage]], [[The Shadow]], [[Dick Tracy]], and [[Sherlock Holmes]], made the character a master sleuth.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, Bill. "Batman: Commodity as Myth." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Batman - The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Dark Knight|author=Les Daniels|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Batman_The_Complete_History.html?id=73wknu2cVIkC|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:
{{quote|One day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man and I've made some crude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at.' He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it look more ominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

===Golden age===

====Subsequent creation credit====
Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say "Batman created by Bob Kane"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] began receiving a "created by" credit on the Superman titles, along with [[William Moulton Marston]] being given the byline for creating [[Wonder Woman]], Batman stories began saying "Created by Bob Kane" in addition to the other credits.

Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of ''Batman'' #169 (February 1965) for example, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] names him as the creator of the [[Riddler]], one of Batman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, "Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by."&lt;ref name="creation" /&gt; At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.

[[Jerry Robinson]], who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Comics Journal]]'':
{{quote|Bob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn't sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why&amp;nbsp;... [he was] going to leave [Kane's employ].&amp;nbsp;... [Kane] should have credited Bill as co-creator, because I know; I was there.&amp;nbsp;... That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for, was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman. As with Siegel and Shuster, it should have been the same, the same co-creator credit in the strip, writer, and artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Groth |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Groth |date=October 2005 |title=Jerry Robinson |journal=The Comics Journal |volume=1 |issue=271 |pages=80–81 |issn=0194-7869 |url=http://www.tcj.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=350&amp;Itemid=48 |accessdate=November 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224083859/http://www.tcj.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=350&amp;Itemid=48 |archivedate=December 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that "it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Batman, t' {{sic}} as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue." Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. "The trouble with being a 'ghost' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit', then one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' 3. Winter 1999. [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Kane revisited Finger's situation, recalling in an interview: {{quote|In those days it was like, one artist and he had his name over it [the comic strip] — the policy of DC in the comic books was, if you can't write it, obtain other writers, but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version. So Bill never asked me for it [the byline] and I never volunteered — I guess my ego at that time. And I felt badly, really, when he [Finger] died.&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Book Interview Super Special: Batman" Fictioneer Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 2015, [[DC Entertainment]] revealed that Finger would be receiving credit for his role in Batman's creation on the 2016 superhero film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' and the second season of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' after a deal was worked out between the Finger family and DC.&lt;ref name="FingerSep2015" /&gt; Finger received credit as a creator of Batman for the first time in a comic in October 2015 with ''Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]] Eternal'' #3 and ''Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis'' #3. The updated acknowledgment for the character appeared as "Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger".&lt;ref name="FingerOct2015" /&gt;

====Early years====
[[File:Detective Comics 27.jpg|thumb|Batman made his debut in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27 (May 1939). Cover art by [[Bob Kane]].]]

The first Batman story, "[[The Case of the Chemical Syndicate]]", was published in ''Detective Comics'' #27 (May 1939). Finger said, "Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in ''Detective Comics''. By that time, Detective Comics was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-7450-5}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The two characters were featured side-by-side as the stars of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', which was originally titled ''World's Best Comics'' when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including [[Jerry Robinson]] and [[Dick Sprang]] also worked on the strips during this period.

Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. "About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman", Kane said.&lt;ref name = "vapzdg"&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Batman's utility belt|Batman's characteristic utility belt]] was introduced in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939), followed by the [[boomerang]]-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the [[Batplane]], in #31 (Sept. 1939). The character's origin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that "by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|inker=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|issue=33|title=Detective Comics|story=The Batman and How He Came to Be|publisher=DC Comics|date=Nov. 1939|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=560 ''Detective Comics'' #33] (Nov. 1939), [[Grand Comics Database]]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5msHPiGRt?url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=560 |date=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Jefferson Darowski, "[http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontentdm.lib.byu.edu%2FETD%2Fimage%2Fetd2158.pdf&amp;images=yes The Mythic Symbols of Batman]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421063924/http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontentdm.lib.byu.edu%2FETD%2Fimage%2Fetd2158.pdf&amp;images=yes |date=April 21, 2008 }}" December 2007.

The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in ''Detective Comics'' #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], Batman's junior counterpart.&lt;ref name = "Wright_p17"&gt;Wright, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion, because Batman needed a "[[Dr. Watson|Watson]]" with whom Batman could talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of "kid sidekicks".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|2003|p=36}}{{full citation needed|reason=Daniels 2003 is not listed in the references|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of the solo spin-off series ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and [[Catwoman]], but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death. That story prompted editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]] to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun.&lt;ref name="dan42"&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos.&lt;ref name = "Boichel_p9"&gt;Boichel, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following World War II, DC Comics "adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy". The impact of this editorial approach was evident in ''Batman'' comics of the postwar period; removed from the "bleak and menacing world" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a "bright and colorful" environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wright|2001|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver and Bronze ages===

====1950s and early 1960s====
Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story "The Mightiest Team in the World" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discover each other's secret identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmund Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Curt Swan]]|story=The Mightiest Team In the World|title=Superman #76|date=June 1952|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this story, ''World's Finest Comics'' was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team-up of the characters was "a financial success in an era when those were few and far between";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; this series of stories ran until the book's cancellation in 1986.

Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954. Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed [[homosexual]] overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Comics Code Authority]], a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry. The tendency towards a "sunnier Batman" in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have suggested that the characters of [[Batwoman]] (in 1956) and the pre-[[Barbara Gordon]] [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]] (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=York |first=Christopher |title=All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s |journal=The International Journal of Comic Art |year=2000 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=100–110 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science fiction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; New characters such as Batwoman, [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #28 (Feb. 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year.

===="New Look" Batman and camp====
By 1964, sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was "planning to kill Batman off altogether".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] was assigned to the Batman titles. He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the "New Look". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist [[Carmine Infantino]] to help overhaul the character. The [[Batmobile]] was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and Bat-Mite were retired. Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed) while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet, came to live with Bruce Wayne and [[Dick Grayson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=Gotham Gang Line-Up!|title=[[Detective Comics]]|issue=328|date=June 1964|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debut of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character. The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and ''Batman'' reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Mike. ''The Comic Book in America: An Illustrated History''. Dallas: Taylor, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-87833-659-3}}, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements such as the character of [[Batgirl]] and the show's [[Camp (style)|campy]] nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, "When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1969, writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a "grim avenger of the night".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neil said his idea was "simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William. "Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story "[[The Secret of the Waiting Graves]]" in ''Detective Comics'' #395 (Jan. 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker [[Dick Giordano]], and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was "tremendous".&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Giordano said: "We went back to a grimmer, darker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; While the work of O'Neil and Adams was popular with fans, the acclaim did little to improve declining sales; the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and penciler [[Marshall Rogers]] in ''Detective Comics'' #471–476 (Aug. 1977&amp;nbsp;– April 1978), which went on to influence the 1989 movie ''Batman'' and be adapted for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', which debuted in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&amp;id=40748|work=SciFi Wire|date=March 28, 2007|title=Batman Artist Rogers is Dead|postscript=none|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201081512/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&amp;id=40748 |archivedate=February 1, 2009}}: "Even though their Batman run was only six issues, the three laid the foundation for later Batman comics. Their stories include the classic 'Laughing Fish' (in which the Joker's face appeared on fish); they were adapted for ''Batman: The Animated Series'' in the 1990s. Earlier drafts of the 1989 Batman movie with Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight were based heavily on their work."&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern age===

====''The Dark Knight Returns''====
{{See also|Alternative versions of Batman}}
[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s limited series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (Feb.–June 1986) returned the character to his darker roots, both in atmosphere and tone. The comic book, which tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated interest in the character. ''The Dark Knight Returns'' was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pp. 147, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

That year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC's status quo-altering miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pp. 155, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; One outcome of this new approach was the "[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]" storyline in ''Batman'' #404–407 (Feb.–May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] redefined the character's origins. Writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Brian Bolland]] continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'', in which the Joker, attempting to drive [[Commissioner Gordon]] insane, cripples Gordon's daughter [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara]], and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically.

The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a [[Premium-rate telephone number|900 number]] for readers to call to vote on whether [[Jason Todd]], the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a narrow margin of 28 votes (see ''[[Batman: A Death in the Family]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Knightfall''====
The 1993 "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]" story arc introduced a new villain, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], who critically injures Batman after pushing him to the limits of his endurance. Jean-Paul Valley, known as [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]], is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Bruce Wayne's convalescence. Writers [[Doug Moench]], [[Chuck Dixon]], and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] worked on the Batman titles during "Knightfall", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's "[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]" storyline served as the precursor to 1999's "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]", a year-long storyline that ran through all the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion of "No Man's Land", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by [[Bob Schreck]].&lt;ref name="nerd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weldon|first1=Glen|title=The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture|date=2016|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-4767-5669-1|url=https://www.amazon.com/Caped-Crusade-Batman-Rise-Culture/dp/1476756694|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was [[Jeph Loeb]]. Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries (''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Victory|Dark Victory]]'') that pit an early in his career version of Batman against his entire [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]] (including [[Two-Face]], whose origin was re-envisioned by Loeb) while dealing with various mysteries involving [[serial killer]]s [[Holiday Killer|Holiday]] and [[Hangman (DC Comics)|the Hangman]]. In 2003, Loeb teamed with artist [[Jim Lee]] to work on another mystery arc: "[[Batman: Hush]]" for the main Batman book. The 12–issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire rogues gallery, including an apparently resurrected [[Jason Todd]], while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]].&lt;ref name="visual"&gt;{{cite book|chapter= 2000s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. The series became #1 on the [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] sales chart for the first time since ''Batman'' #500 (Oct. 1993) and Todd's appearance laid the groundwork for writer [[Judd Winick]]'s subsequent run as writer on ''Batman'', with another multi-issue arc, "[[Batman: Under the Hood|Under the Hood]]", which ran from ''Batman'' #637–650 (April 2005 – April 2006).

====''All-Star Batman and Robin''====

{{See also|All Star DC Comics}}
In 2005, DC launched ''[[All-Star Batman and Robin]]'', a stand-alone comic series set outside the main DC Universe continuity. Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee, the series was a commercial success for DC Comics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006| title=Diamond's 2005 Year-End Sales Charts &amp; Market Share | publisher=newsarama.com | url=http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/05Year_End.html | archivedate=May 25, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525013002/http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/05Year_End.html | accessdate=October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2005| title=July 2005 Sales Charts: All-Star Batman &amp; Robin Lives Up To Its Name | publisher=newsarama.com | url=http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/july05sales.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907063905/http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/july05sales.html|archivedate=September 7, 2006| accessdate=October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was widely panned by critics for its writing and strong depictions of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071219052808/http://www.craveonline.com/articles/comics/04649326/all_star_batman_and_robin.html Review by Iann Robinson], Crave Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/comics/all-star-batman-robin-1-3.shtml Review by William Gatevackes], PopMatters, February 10, 2006  {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5msHPXkN2?url=http://www.popmatters.com/comics/all-star-batman-robin-1-3.shtml |date=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Paul Dini]] were the regular writers of ''Batman'' and ''Detective Comics'', with Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore. Most notably of these elements were the science fiction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training. Morrison's run climaxed with "Batman R.I.P.", which brought Batman up against the villainous "Black Glove" organization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. "Batman R.I.P." segued into ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (also written by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of [[Darkseid]]. In the 2009 miniseries ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', Wayne's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman, and Wayne's son Damian becomes the new Robin.&lt;ref name="comics.ign.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Dan |title=Grant Morrison's New Batman and Robin |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p1.html |date=August 8, 2009 |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 8, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609172555/http://comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p1.html |archivedate=June 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web |last=George |first=Richard |title=Morrison discusses ''Batman and Robin'' |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/961/961488p1.html |date=March 11, 2009 |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 6, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305225820/http://comics.ign.com/articles/961/961488p1.html |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing ''Batman'', while Grant Morrison was given his own series, titled ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]''.&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilkins |first=Alasdair |title=Batman Is Reborn&amp;nbsp;...

In 2010, the storyline ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'' saw Bruce travel through history, eventually returning to the present day. Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman, he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well. Bruce decided to take his crime-fighting cause globally, which is the central focus of ''[[Batman Incorporated]]''. DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in ''Batman'', ''Detective Comics'', and ''Batman and Robin'', while Wayne would be the main character in ''Batman Incorporated''. Also, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]''.

====The New 52====

{{See also|The New 52}}
In September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero comic books, including its ''Batman'' franchise, were canceled and relaunched with new #1 issues as part of [[the New 52]] [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and is featured in [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']], ''[[Detective Comics]]'', ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'', and ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]''. Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract new readers, Batman's history remains mostly intact. ''Batman Incorporated'' was relaunched in 2012–2013 to complete the "Leviathan" storyline.

With the beginning of the New 52, [[Scott Snyder]] was the writer of the ''Batman'' title. His first major story arc was "[[Night of the Owls]]", where Batman confronts the [[Court of Owls]], a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was "[[Death of the Family]]", where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was "[[Batman: Zero Year]]", which redefined Batman's origin in The New 52. It followed ''Batman'' #0, published in June 2012, which explored the character's early years. The final storyline before the "[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]" (2015) storyline was "[[Batman: Endgame|Endgame]]", depicting the supposed final battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus onto Gotham City. The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker's supposed deaths.

Starting with ''Batman'' vol. 2, #41, Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce's mantle as a new, state-sanctioned, robotic-Batman, debuting in the [[Free Comic Book Day]] special comic ''Divergence''. However, Bruce Wayne is soon revealed to be alive, albeit now suffering almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his life as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne finds happiness and proposes to his girlfriend, [[Julie Madison]], but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to destroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a "strange star" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne discovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot (it is heavily implied that this is the amnesic Joker) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories as the reborn Bruce Wayne. He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor. Gordon gets his job back as the commissioner, and the government Batman project is shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/23/scott-snyder-and-greg-capullo-batman-50-interview |title=Batman's Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo on the New Batsuit and Bloom's Identity |author=Joshua Yehl |date=March 23, 2016 |work=IGN |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423225606/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/23/scott-snyder-and-greg-capullo-batman-50-interview |archivedate=April 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, DC Comics released ''[[The Dark Knight III: The Master Race (comic)|The Dark Knight III: The Master Race]]'', the sequel to Frank Miller's ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and ''The Dark Knight Strikes Again''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/arts/dark-knight-iii-the-master-race-comic-book-prompts-reflection-and-a-look-ahead.html |title=‘Dark Knight III: The Master Race’ Comic Book Prompts Reflection and a Look Ahead |date=November 23, 2015 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126023014/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/arts/dark-knight-iii-the-master-race-comic-book-prompts-reflection-and-a-look-ahead.html |archivedate=November 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DC Universe====

In June 2016, the [[DC Rebirth]] event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles. ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' was rebooted as starting with a one-shot issue entitled ''Batman: Rebirth'' #1 (Aug. 2016). The series then began shipping twice-monthly as a third volume, starting with ''Batman'' vol. 3, #1 (Aug. 2016). The third volume of ''Batman'' was written by [[Tom King (comic book writer)|Tom King]], and artwork was provided by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]] and Mikel Janín. The ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' series introduced two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl. ''Detective Comics'' resumed its original numbering system starting with June 2016's #934, and the New 52 series was labeled as volume 2 with issues numbering from #1-52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/action-comics-detective-comics-return-original-numbering-rebirth |title="Action," "Detective Comics" Return To Original Numbering For "Rebirth" |date=February 18, 2016 |publisher=ComicBookResources.com |quote="Action Comics'" numbering will pick up with #957 and "Detective" will be at #934.

Writer [[James Tynion IV]] and artists [[Eddy Barrows]] and Alvaro Martinez worked on ''Detective Comics'' #934, and the series initially featured a team consisting of [[Tim Drake]], [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]], [[Cassandra Cain]], and [[Clayface]], led by Batman and [[Batwoman]].

DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding in December 2017, opting to include everything under a larger "DC Universe" banner and naming. The continuity established by Rebirth continues across DC's comic book titles, including volume one of ''Detective Comics'' and the third volume of ''Batman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rich|title=The End Of DC Rebirth Announced At New York Comic-Con|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/06/end-dc-rebirth-announced-new-york-comic-con|website=bleedingcool|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonthuys|first=Darryn|title=The Rebirth era is over, as a new direction begins in DC Universe|url=https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/rebirth-era-new-direction-begins-dc-universe|website=criticalhit|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==

===Bruce Wayne===
[[File:Bruce Wayne Concept Art.png|thumb|300px|DC Comics concept art of Bruce Wayne]]
Batman's [[secret identity]] is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, [[Thomas Wayne|Dr. Thomas Wayne]] and [[Martha Wayne]], which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, [[Wayne Manor]]. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of [[Wayne Enterprises]], his inherited conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis O'Neil]] ''Batman: Knightfall''. 1994, [[Bantam Books]]. {{ISBN|978-0-553-09673-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, 1999{{Page needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pearson|Uricchio|1991|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time.&lt;ref name="Inc0"&gt;{{cite comic|Writer = [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = [[Batman Incorporated]]|Volume = 2|Issue = 0|Date = Sept. 2012|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Beatty, ''The Batman Handbook: The Ultimate Training Manual''. 2005, Quirk Books, p51. {{ISBN|978-1-59474-023-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the post-Crisis Superman, whose [[Clark Kent]] persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the facade.&lt;ref&gt;Aichele, G. (1997). ''Rewriting Superman.'' In G. Aichele &amp; T. Pippin (Eds.), ''The Monstrous and the Unspeakable: The Bible as Fantastic Literature'', pp. 75–101. Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' vol. 2, #53&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Batman Unmasked'', a television documentary about the psychology of the character, behavioral scientist [[Benjamin Karney]] notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that "Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better".

Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title=Batman versus Superman as class warfare? Grant Morrison: 'Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss'|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/13/batman-versus-superman-as-class-warfare-bruce-has-a-butler-clark-has-a-boss/|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=Aug 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015182152/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/13/batman-versus-superman-as-class-warfare-bruce-has-a-butler-clark-has-a-boss/ |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that both heroes "believe in the same kind of things" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. He notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: "Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss." T. James Musler's book ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All'' explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman.&lt;ref&gt;T. James Musler. 2006. ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Will Brooker notes in his book ''Batman Unmasked'' that "the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the young audience&amp;nbsp;... he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him&amp;nbsp;... and they're never wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Batman Unmasked |last=Brooker |first=Will |year=2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=NY/London |isbn= 978-0-8264-1343-7 |page=368 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GNRreYO91ogC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Unmasking+Batman |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as ''"wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession"''.&lt;ref name="pearson pg 186" /&gt; The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: "[[Julius Schwartz|Julie Schwartz]] did a Batman in ''Batman'' and ''Detective'' and [[Murray Boltinoff]] did a Batman in the ''Brave and the Bold'' and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson; Uricchio. "Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil" p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that "there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes".&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Detective Comics #33 (Nov. 1939), Bill Finger, Bob Kane&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Batman #1 Spring 1940, Bill Finger, Bob Kane&lt;/ref&gt; and to train his body into physical perfection&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; to fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Another of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the "reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pearson|Uricchio|1991|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures.&lt;ref name="pearson pg 186" /&gt;

Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as "a [[Dionysus|dionysian]] figure, a force for [[anarchy]] that imposes an individual order".&lt;ref&gt;Sharrett, Christopher. "Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller". ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty [[conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis O'Neil, Wizard Batman Special 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into Batman's characterization,&lt;ref name="Terrence R. Wandtke 91"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Amazing Transforming Superhero!: Essays on the Revision of Characters on the Revision of Characters in Comic Books, Film and Television|author=Terrence R. Wandtke|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and increasingly alienated behavior. Batman's original character was changed in the 1950s when the now-defunct [[Comics Code Authority|comic book codes]] went into effect, and DC editor Whitney Ellsworth reinvented Batman as having a stringent moral code which never allowed him to kill.&lt;ref name="Terrence R. Wandtke 91"/&gt; Miller's Batman was closer to the original, golden-age version, who was willing to kill criminals if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature|author1=Alex S. Romagnoli |author2=Gian S. Pagnucci |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
{{Main|Alternative versions of Batman}}
On several occasions former Robin [[Dick Grayson]] has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010.&lt;ref name="visual"/&gt; As part of DC's [[The New 52|2011 continuity relaunch]], Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the ''Flashpoint'' crossover event.

In an interview with [[IGN]], Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and [[Damian Wayne]] as Robin represented a "reverse" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, "a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin". Morrison explained his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: "Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the [[Teen Titans]], and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; {{sic|hide=y|He's}} a lot looser and more relaxed."&lt;ref name="comics.ign.com"/&gt;

Over the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence.  [[Jean Paul Valley]], also known as [[Azrael]], assumed the cowl after the events of the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' saga.&lt;ref name="visual"/&gt; [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] donned a mech-suit after the events of ''[[Batman: Endgame]]'', and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016.

Additionally, members of the group [[Batman, Incorporated]], Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world.&lt;ref name="visual"/&gt; Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne.

==Supporting characters==
{{Main|List of Batman supporting characters}}

Batman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.&lt;ref name="pearson pg 186" /&gt;

===Adversaries===
[[File:BatmanRoguesGallery.jpg|thumb|Batman surrounded by his enemies. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]
{{Main|List of Batman Family adversaries}}

Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime.&lt;ref name = "Boichel_p8"/&gt; These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's ''[[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic rogues gallery|rogues gallery]]''. Batman's "most implacable foe" is the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker represents "everything Batman [opposes]".&lt;ref name = "Boichel_p9"/&gt; Other long time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery include [[Catwoman]] (a [[burglary|cat burglar]] antiheroine who is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Riddler]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Clayface]], and [[Killer Croc]] among others. Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at [[Arkham Asylum]].

===Allies===

;Alfred
{{Main|Alfred Pennyworth}}
Batman's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], first appeared in ''Batman'' #16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. Alfred raised Bruce after his parents' death and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character "[lends] a homely touch to Batman's environs and [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand" to the hero and his sidekick.&lt;ref name = "Boichel_p8"&gt;Boichel, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

;"Batman Family"
The informal name "[[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman family]]" is used for a group of characters closely allied with Batman, generally masked vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit approval. They include: [[Barbara Gordon]], Commissioner Gordon's daughter, who has fought crime under the vigilante identity of [[Batgirl]] and, during a period in which she was confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, the [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] Oracle; [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], the sole surviving member of a mob family turned vigilante, who has worked with Batman on occasion, primarily as [[Huntress (comics)|the Huntress]] and as Batgirl for a brief stint; [[Cassandra Cain]], the daughter of professional assassins [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], and [[Lady Shiva]], who succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl.

;Civilians
[[Lucius Fox]], a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne's business manager who is well aware of his employer's clandestine vigilante activities; [[Leslie Thompkins|Dr. Leslie Thompkins]], a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate parental figure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity; [[Vicki Vale]], an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman's activities for the Gotham Gazette; [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], Batman's canine partner who was mainly active in the 1950s and 1960s;&lt;ref name="138D"&gt;Daniels (1995), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bat-Mite]], an extra-dimensional imp mostly active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.&lt;ref name="138D" /&gt;

;GCPD
{{main|Gotham City Police Department}}

As Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, [[Chief of police|Commissioner]] [[James Gordon (comics)|James "Jim" Gordon]] debuted along with Batman in ''Detective Comics'' #27 and has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-fighting [[everyman]], he shares Batman's goals while offering, much as the character of [[Dr. Watson|Watson]] does in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, a normal person's perspective on the work of Batman's extraordinary genius.

;Justice League
{{main|Justice League}}

Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the [[Justice League of America]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of ''World's Finest'' and ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they are still close friends but an uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 (Dec. 2003), [[Superman]] observes, "Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer = [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | penciller = [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | inker = [[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]] | title = [[Superman/Batman]] | story = Running Wild | issue = 3 | date = Dec. 2003 | publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Batman &amp; Robin (Batman vol. 1 -9 Feb. 1942).jpg|thumb|upright|Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Art by [[Jack Burnley]].]]
Robin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because "Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Travis|title=Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero [[Nightwing]]. A second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the [[Red Hood]], and became an [[antihero]] vigilante with no qualms about using [[firearms]] or [[deadly force]]. [[Carrie Kelly]], the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.

The third Robin in mainstream comics is [[Tim Drake]], who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series, and currently goes by [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]], a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the first decade of the new millennium, [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made vigilante identity The Spoiler,  and later as [[Batgirl]].&lt;ref&gt;Langley, 180–210&lt;/ref&gt; After Stephanie Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to [[Damian Wayne]], the ten-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and [[Talia al Ghul]], in the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Esposito | first = Joey | title = Why Damian Wayne is the Best Robin  | publisher = IGN | date = March 5, 2013 | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/06/why-damian-wayne-is-the-best-robin/ | accessdate = February 17, 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140301042547/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/06/why-damian-wayne-is-the-best-robin| archivedate = March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damian's tenure as ''du jour'' Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of ''[[Batman Incorporated]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Saul | first = Josh | title = DC killing off Batman's 'Boy Wonder' Damian Wayne in new comic book | publisher = The New York Post| date = February 25, 2013 | url = https://nypost.com/2013/02/25/dc-killing-off-batmans-boy-wonder-damian-wayne-in-new-comic-book/ | accessdate = February 17, 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140429184730/http://nypost.com/2013/02/25/dc-killing-off-batmans-boy-wonder-damian-wayne-in-new-comic-book/| archivedate = April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the [[ornithology|ornithological]] theme nonetheless; she debuted the codename and identity of [[Bluebird (DC Comics)|Bluebird]] in 2014.

;Wayne family

[[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]] is the biological daughter of [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Bruce Wayne]] and [[Catwoman#Golden and Silver Age versions|Selina Kyle]] of an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] established in the early 1960s ([[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]) where the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden-age]] stories took place.

[[Damian Wayne]] is the biological son of Bruce Wayne and [[Talia al Ghul]],&lt;ref name="comics.ign.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #666 (page 2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant Morrison. Batman #676"&gt;Grant Morrison. ''Batman'' #676&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the grandson of [[Ra's al Ghul]].

[[Terry McGinnis]] is the biological son of Bruce Wayne in the [[DC animated universe]], and has taken over the role as Batman when Bruce has become too elderly to do it.

===Romantic interests===
Writers have varied in the approach over the years to the "playboy" aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona. Some writers show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman, while others have depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the benefits of being "Gotham's most eligible bachelor". Bruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically linked with many women throughout his various incarnations. The most significant relationships occurred with Selina Kyle, who is also [[Catwoman]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;geek-news.mtv.com/2011/03/22/batman's-top-10-love-interests/{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Talia al Ghul]], as both women gave birth to his biological offsprings, Helena Wayne and Damian Wayne, respectively.

Batman's first romantic interest was [[Julie Madison]] in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #31 (Sept. [[1939 in comics|1939]]), however their romance was short-lived. Some of Batman's romantic interests have been women with a respected status in society, such as [[Julie Madison]], [[Vicki Vale]], and [[Silver St. Cloud]]. Batman has also been romantically involved with allies, such as [[Batwoman#Kathy Kane|Kathy Kane (Batwoman)]], [[Sasha Bordeaux]], and [[Wonder Woman]], and with villains, such as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle (Catwoman)]], Jezebel Jet, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Pamela Isley (Poison Ivy)]], and [[Talia al Ghul]].

;Catwoman
{{main|Catwoman}}
[[File:Adam Hughe's Catwoman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Catwoman]] is Batman's most enduring romance.&lt;ref name="Love Interests"/&gt; Art by [[Adam Hughes]].]]
While most of Batman's romantic relationships tend to be short in duration, [[Catwoman]] has been his most enduring romance throughout the years.&lt;ref name="Love Interests"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Batman's Top 10 Love Interests | work = MTV News | date = 2011-03-22 | accessdate = 2016-05-01 | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/2621111/batmans-top-10-love-interests/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160410030145/http://www.mtv.com/news/2621111/batmans-top-10-love-interests/ | archivedate = 2016-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attraction between Batman and Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear. Although Catwoman is typically portrayed as a villain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic connection.

In an early 1980s storyline, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as "Bruce". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Out of costume, Bruce and Selina develop a romantic relationship during ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]''. The story shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called "[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, "Hush" sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the entire [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]] and rekindling their romantic relationship. In "'Hush", Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.

The [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world, partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Selina Kyle, as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211. They have a daughter named [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who becomes the Huntress. Along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]], the Huntress takes the role as Gotham's protector once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.

Batman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on the roof of a building in ''Catwoman'' vol. 4, #1 (2011); the same issue implies that the two have an ongoing sexual relationship.&lt;ref name="Catwoman #1 September 2011"&gt;''Catwoman'' #1 (Sept. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2016 DC Rebirth continuity reboot, the two once again have a sexual encounter on top of a building in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #14 (2017).&lt;ref name="Batman' 2017"&gt;''Batman'' vol. 3, #14 (March 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2016 DC Rebirth continuity reboot, Batman and Catwoman work together in the third volume of ''Batman''. The two also have a romantic relationship, in which they are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop and sleeping together.&lt;ref name="Batman' 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' vol. 3, #15 (March 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Batman vol. 3, #32 Dec. 2017"&gt;''Batman'' vol. 3, #32 (Dec. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce proposes to Selina in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #24 (2017),&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' vol. 3, #24 (Aug. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and in issue #32, Selina asks Bruce to propose to her again. When he does so, she says, "Yes." &lt;ref name="Batman vol. 3, #32 Dec. 2017"/&gt;

''Batman Annual'' vol. 3, #2 (Jan. 2018) centers on a romantic storyline between Batman and Catwoman. Towards the end, the story is flash-forwarded to the future, in which Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle are a married couple in their golden years. Bruce receives a terminal medical diagnosis, and Selina cares for him until his death.&lt;ref name="Batman vol. 3, #32 Dec. 2017"/&gt;

==Abilities==

===Skills and training===
Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess".&lt;ref name = "Wright_p17"/&gt; Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient [[scientist]], he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Conray, ''500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes''. 2002, Collins &amp; Brown. {{ISBN|978-1-84411-004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Greenberger |first= Robert|date= 2008|title= The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |publisher= Del Rey Books|isbn= 0-345-50106-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[polymath]], his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison]]|penciller=[[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter]]|story=War of the Worlds|title=JLA|issue=3|date=March 1997|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman. In the ''[[Superman: Doomed]]'' story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Lobdell]]|penciller=[[Ed Benes]] and Jack Herbert|story=Superman: Doomed|title=Superman|issue=31|date=July 2014|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batman has trained extensively in various martial arts, mastering many different types, making him one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe. Superman describes Batman as "the most dangerous man on Earth", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first storyline in ''JLA.''

Batman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist most forms of [[telepathy]] and [[mind control]]. He is a master of [[disguise]], multilingual, and an expert in [[espionage]], often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone. Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and [[escapology]], which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable [[Deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]] with little to no harm.

Batman is an expert in [[interrogation]] techniques and his [[intimidation|intimidating]] and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the [[Batplane]]), as well as being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he underwent some magician training.

In the comic, The Many Deaths of the Batman which focused on a former demolitions teacher of Batman who killed Batman's other teachers which included a race car driver, chemist, body builder, and gymnast all of whom were experts in their field.

===Technology===
Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian [[Les Daniels]] credits [[Gardner Fox]] with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the [[batarang]] and the "Batgyro" in ''Detective Comics'' #31 and #32 (Sept., Oct. 1939).&lt;ref name = "vapzdg"/&gt;

;Personal armor
{{Main|Batsuit}}
Batman's [[body armor]]ed costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Daniels (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists' interpretations, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.&lt;ref name="A1" /&gt; Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey;&lt;ref name="A1" /&gt; as well as black and grey. In the [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle. [[Ben Affleck]]'s Batman in the [[DC Extended Universe]] films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.

Batman's [[batsuit]] aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both [[Kevlar]] and [[Nomex]]. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, "We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same&amp;nbsp;... Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it."&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pp. 159–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Batmobile
{{main|Batmobile}}
[[File:USD205998.png|thumb|The 1966 television Batmobile, built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] from a [[Lincoln Futura]] [[concept car]]]]
Batman's primary vehicle is the [[Batmobile]], which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] that suggest a bat's wings. Batman also has an aircraft called the [[Batplane]] (later called the "Batwing"), along with various other means of transportation. In proper practice, the "bat" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' live-action television show]] and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series) stretched the practice to [[Camp (style)|campy]] proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a [[Batboat]], [[Bat-Sub]], and [[Batcycle]], among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such "bat-" names as the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-[[shark repellent]] bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline "A Death in the Family" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the "bat" prefix on his own. In ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', Batman tells [[Carrie Kelley]] that the original Robin came up with the name "Batmobile" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle. The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics [[The New 52|relaunched]] its entire line of comic books, with the batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics.

;Utility belt
{{main|Batman's utility belt}}
Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his [[Batman's utility belt|utility belt]]. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are [[gun]]s, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents' murder.

;Bat-Signal
{{Main|Bat-Signal}}
When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a [[searchlight]] with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.

In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]], Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, [[Wayne Manor]], specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.

;Batcave
{{Main|Batcave}}
The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]]. As his command center, the Batcave serves multiple purposes; supercomputer, surveillance, redundant power-generators, forensics lab, medical infirmary, private study, training dojo, fabrication workshop, arsenal, hangar and garage. It houses the vehicles and equipment Batman uses in his campaign to fight crime. It is also a trophy room and storage facility for Batman's unique memorabilia collected over the years from various cases he has worked on. In both the comic ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #45 and the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the cave is said to have been part of the [[Underground Railroad]].

==Fictional character biography==
Batman's history has undergone many [[retroactive continuity]] revisions, both minor and major. Elements of the character's history have varied greatly. Scholars [[William Uricchio]] and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, "Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades."&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Annual'' vol. 3, #2 (Jan. 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

====Origin====
[[File:Thomas Wayne 1939.png|thumb|right|[[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]] are shot by Joe Chill in ''Detective Comics'' #33 (Nov. 1939). Art by Bob Kane.]]
The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's [[origin story]].&lt;ref name="pearson pg 186" /&gt; As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] and his wife [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], murdered with a gun by a mugger named [[Joe Chill]]. Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, "Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number",&lt;ref name="pearson pg 186"&gt;Pearson; Uricchio. "'I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise.'" p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.&lt;ref name="pearson pg 191"&gt;Pearson, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golden age====
{{See also|Batman (Earth-Two)}}
In Batman's first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story=The Case of the Chemical Syndicate|title=Detective Comics #27|date=May 1939|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman's origin is first presented in ''Detective Comics'' #33 (Nov. 1939) and is later expanded upon in ''Batman'' #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable [[Gotham City]] socialites. Bruce is brought up in [[Wayne Manor]], and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named [[Joe Chill]] while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot", Wayne remarks, "so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible&amp;nbsp;..." As if responding to his desires, a [[bat]] suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Bill Finger|penciller=Bob Kane|story=The Batman Wars Against the Dirigible of Doom|title=Detective Comics #33|date=Nov. 1939|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne has a fiancée named [[Julie Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;She first appears in ''Detective Comics'' #31 (Sept. 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Detective Comics'' #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, [[Dick Grayson]], who becomes his vigilante partner, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Batman also becomes a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Paul Levitz]]|penciller=[[Joe Staton]]|story=The Untold Origin of the Justice Society |title=DC Special|issue=29|date=Sept. 1977|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he, like Superman, is an honorary member,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Gardner Fox]]|penciller= |story= |title=[[All Star Comics]]|issue=3|date=Winter 1940/1941|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of [[Gotham City Police Department|Gotham City's police department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story= |title=Batman|issue=7|date=Nov. 1941|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as their butler.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #16 (May 1943); his original last name, Beagle, is revealed in ''Detective Comics'' #96 (Feb. 1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silver age====
The [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as a new, updated version of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as [[Earth-One]]. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the golden and silver ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.

After the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the golden age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle. The two have a daughter, [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]], once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or [[Green Lantern]], Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the golden age.&lt;ref&gt;One example is the Englehart/Rogers run of the late 1970s, which has editorial notes directing readers to issues such as ''Batman'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in ''Batman'' #208, Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=The First Batman|title=Detective Comics|issue=235|date=Sept. 1956|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmond Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Dick Sprang]]|story=When Batman Was Robin|title=Detective Comics|issue=226|date=Dec. 1955|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 then-editor [[Paul Levitz]] commissioned the ''Untold Legend of the Batman'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.

Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the silver age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''Brave and the Bold'' became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different [[DC Universe]] superhero each month.

====Bronze age====
In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]] into a [[penthouse apartment]] atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early golden age) of the Joker as a homicidal [[psychopathy|psychopath]], and the arrival of [[Ra's al Ghul]], a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes [[Nightwing]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

In the final issue of ''Brave and the Bold'' in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. He serves as the team's leader until ''Batman and the Outsiders'' #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.

====Modern age====
After the 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline "[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]" from ''Batman'' #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Frank | authorlink = Frank Miller (comics)| author2 = [[David Mazzucchelli]] |author3=Richmond Lewis | title =[[Batman: Year One]] | publisher = DC Comics| year = 1987 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-1-85286-077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's silver-age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of golden-age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following ''Crisis'', DC launched a new Batman title called ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the "Year One" period.

Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crime-fighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when [[Tim Drake]] becomes the new Robin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]|penciller=[[Norm Breyfogle]]|story=Master of Fear|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|issue=457|date=Dec. 1990|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]". During the storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] to take on the role. After the end of "Knightfall", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in "KnightsEnd", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Chuck. et al. "Batman: Prodigal". ''Batman'' 512–514, ''Shadow of the Bat'' 32–34, ''Detective Comics'' 679–681, ''Robin'' 11–13. New York: DC Comics, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline "[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]" changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.

Batman once again becomes a member of the [[Justice League]] during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled ''JLA''. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's "[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]".

Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of "Batman: Officer Down" and "Batman: War Games/War Crimes"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] are forced out of the police department in "Officer Down", while "War Games" and "War Crimes" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. [[Lex Luthor]] arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the "Bruce Wayne: Murderer?" and "[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]" story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as "Checkmate" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from [[Talia al Ghul]] in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #1–6.

===21st century===

====2000s====
DC Comics' 2005 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' reveals that JLA member [[Zatanna]] had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from [[lobotomy|lobotomizing]] [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] after he raped [[Sue Dibny]]. Batman later creates the [[OMACs|Brother I]] satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.

Following ''Infinite Crisis'', Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to "rebuild Batman".&lt;ref&gt;"Infinite Crisis" #7, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]'' storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. Part of this absence is captured during Week 30 of the ''52'' series, which shows Batman fighting his inner demons.&lt;ref&gt;''52'' #30&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in ''52'', Batman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in [[Nanda Parbat]]. This becomes an important part of the regular ''Batman'' title, which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime fighter while undergoing this ritual, having "hunted down and ate" the last traces of fear in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #673&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #681&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the "Face the Face" story arc, Bruce officially adopts Tim (who had lost both of his parents at various points in the character's history) as his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]]|penciller=[[Don Kramer]]|story=Face the Face – Conclusion|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|issue=654|date=Aug. 2006|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The follow-up story arc in ''Batman'', ''[[Batman and Son]]'', introduces [[Damian Wayne]], who is Batman's son with [[Talia al Ghul]]. Although originally in [[Son of the Demon]], Bruce's coupling with Talia was implied to be consensual, this arc ret-conned it into Talia forcing herself on Bruce.&lt;ref&gt;Batman issue 656 published October 2006:&lt;br&gt;Bruce: "I remember being drugged senseless and refusing to co-operate in some depraved eugenics experiment."&lt;br&gt;Talia: "Believe me, you cooperated&amp;nbsp;... magnificently."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Morrison]]'s 2008 storyline, "[[Batman R.I.P.]]" featured Batman being physically and mentally broken by the enigmatic villain [[Simon Hurt|Doctor Hurt]] and attracted news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion, which would speculated to feature the death of Bruce Wayne.&lt;ref name="INDY"&gt;Adams, Guy.

Bruce publicly announced that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as "Batman, Incorporated". However, due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, [[the New 52]], Dick Grayson was restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch also interrupted the publication of ''Batman, Incorporated'', which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit the new status quo.

==Cultural impact==
Batman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989 ''Batman'' film and its accompanying merchandising "brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness".&lt;ref name="introduction"&gt;Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William.

Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the character, ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is modern mass culture.

===In other media===
{{Main|Batman franchise media}}
[[File:Batman and Robin 1966.JPG|upright|thumb|right|[[Adam West]] as Batman (right) and [[Burt Ward]] as Robin in the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series]]
The character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic books, such as newspaper syndicated [[comic strip]]s, books, radio dramas, television, a [[Batman Live|stage show]], and several theatrical [[Batman in film|feature films]]. The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October 25, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part [[Serial film|serial]] ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'', with [[Lewis Wilson]] becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made occasional guest appearances in ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor [[Bud Collyer]] needed time off.&lt;ref name="Dan99p64"&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; A second movie serial, ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'', followed in 1949, with [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]] taking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s "helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who never bought a comic book".&lt;ref name="Dan99p64"/&gt;

In the 1964 publication of [[Donald Barthelme]]'s collection of short stories ''Come Back, Dr. Caligari'', Barthelme wrote "The Joker's Greatest Triumph". Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olsen |first1=Lance |title=Linguistic Pratfalls in Barthelme |journal=[[South Atlantic Review]] |date=November 1986 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=69 |doi=10.2307/3199757 |jstor=3199757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television====
The ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, starring [[Adam West]], premiered in January 1966 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. Inflected with a [[Camp (style)|camp]] sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, ''Back to the Batcave'', West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a [[farce]] or [[Parody|lampoon]], and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes; ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the ''Batman'' television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966). [[The Who]] recorded the theme song from the ''Batman'' show for their 1966 EP [[Ready Steady Who]], and [[The Kinks]] performed the theme song on their 1967 album [[Live at Kelvin Hall]].

The popularity of the ''Batman'' TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]'' and ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'' which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's ''[[Super Friends]]'' series; which was animated by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. [[Olan Soule]] was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during ''Super Friends'' by Adam West, who also voiced the character in [[Filmation]]'s 1977 series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.

In 1992, ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television network; produced by [[Warner Bros.

To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the character, Warner Bros aired the television [[short film]], ''[[Batman: Strange Days]]'', that was also posted on DC's YouTube channel.

In 1989, [[Warner Bros.]] released the live-action feature film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''; directed by [[Tim Burton]] and starring [[Michael Keaton]] as the title character. The film was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing film of the year, but at the time was the fifth highest-grossing film in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batman.htm | title= Batman (1989) | publisher=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=May 27, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070513103130/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batman.htm| archivedate= May 13, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also won the [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1223147717805 |title=Batman |work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=October 4, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=Brojam |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's success spawned three sequels: ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995) and ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997); the latter two of which were directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with [[Val Kilmer]] and [[George Clooney]], respectively. The second Schumacher film failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned; causing Warner Bros. to cancel the planned fourth sequel, ''[[Batman in film#Batman Unchained|Batman Unchained]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-movie-series-list-unmade-802032 |title=Before 'Batman Begins': Secret History of the Movies That Almost Got Made |publisher= |accessdate=January 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201014016/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-movie-series-list-unmade-802032 |archivedate=February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and end the initial [[Batman (1989 film series)|film series]].

===Interpretations===

====Gay interpretations====
{{Further|Homosexuality in the Batman franchise}}

Gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]] asserted in ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954 that "Batman stories are psychologically homosexual&amp;nbsp;... The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;Wertham, Fredric. ''Seduction of the Innocent''. Rinehart and Company, Inc., 1954. pp. 189–90.&lt;br/&gt;For discussion of Wertham's impact see Brooker (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay "Batman, Deviance, and Camp" that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because "he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;Medhurst, Andy. "Batman, Deviance, and Camp." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of film and cultural studies [[Will Brooker]] argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character.&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Will (2001) ''Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon'', Continuum. {{ISBN|978-1-62356-752-1}}, pp. 101 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, "The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay&amp;nbsp;... everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane&amp;nbsp;... none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm | title=Is Batman Gay? | accessdate=December 28, 2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201072032/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm | archivedate=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting so much so that he's "borderline pathological", concluding "He'd be much healthier if he ''were'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;Sharrett, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grant Morrison]] said that "Gayness is built into Batman&amp;nbsp;... Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay. I think that's why people like it. All these women fancy him and they all wear fetish clothes and jump around rooftops to get to him. He doesn't care—he's more interested in hanging out with the old guy and the kid."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120422174916/http://www.playboy.com/playground/entertainment/culture/the-super-psyche ''Playboy'' Grant Morrison interview], accessed May 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, DC refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from ''Batman'' #79, 92, 105, and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper "All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beatty |first=Bart |title=Don't Ask, Don't Tell: How Do You Illustrate an Academic Essay about Batman and Homosexuality? |journal=The Comics Journal |year=2000 |volume= |issue=228 |pages=17–18 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of [[watercolor]]s depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Chamberlain (American, 1967) |publisher=Artnet |url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/mark-chamberlain/past-auction-results|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309070124/http://www.artnet.com/artists/mark-chamberlain/past-auction-results|archivedate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting DC to threaten legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167032.stm | title=Gallery told to drop 'gay' Batman | publisher=BBC News Online | date=August 19, 2005| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104232835/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167032.stm | archivedate=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological interpretations====
Batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time, and there have been a number of interpretations into the character's psyche.

In ''Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight'', Travis Langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists [[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] is present in the Batman mythos, such that the character represents the "shadow archetype".  This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own dark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself. Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil. Langley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our "shadow selves".&lt;ref name="Langley"&gt;Langley, Travis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2954">'''Cell of origin''' ('''COO''') is a [[mobile-positioning]] technique for finding a caller's cell (the basic geographical coverage unit of a [[cellular telephone]] system) location.

== Overview ==

Crude COO positioning considers the location of the base station to be the location of the caller. This is not very accurate, as the majority of mobile network cells are projected from an antenna with a spread of 120° (i.e. three mounted on a mast to give complete coverage) giving a signal coverage area with the base station at one corner, rather than the centre. Omnidirectional cells may be used in rural locations (which typically have large ranges and hence uncertain locations for phones within them) and in cities (where they may have ranges of a few hundred metres). The underlying issue is that mobile phone networks are optimised for capacity and call handling rather than locating phones.

Most commercially implemented systems rely on 'enhanced' COO. In the [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] system this relies on the fact that the phones constantly measure the signal strength from the closest 6 base stations and lock on to the strongest signal (the reality is slightly more complex than this and includes parameters that each individual network can optimise, including signal quality and variability. Most networks endeavour to optimise for minimum power consumption, but the overall effect approximates to each phone locking onto the strongest signal).

All networks generate 'splash maps' predicting signal coverage when planning and managing their networks. These maps can be processed to analyse the area which will be dominated by each base station and to approximate each area by a circle (the actual area of coverage may not be exactly where predicted... and in any case will be an irregular shape, rather than a circle).

In practice a network offering location services to third parties will present an [[Application programming interface|API]] to which queries can be sent by validated users, to which a reply will be sent comprising the centre of a circle and a radius representing the expected error (the size of the circle in which the phone is expected to be).

For this reason, when precision is important COO is often used in conjunction with some other technology, such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) or Time of Arrival (TOA).

COO is the only positioning technique that is widely used in wireless networks and is used for Phase 1 of [[9-1-1|911]] service in the [[United States]]. 

Location service using COO have been adopted by the emergency services in many countries. Commercial services have been slower to take off than many in the industry expected. One of the first services to make widespread use of COO based mobile location was the Zingo taxi hailing system, launched in London in 2003

The '''Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army''' (also known as '''CIRCA''' and '''Clown Army'''&lt;ref name=ent /&gt;) is an [[anti-authoritarian]] [[left-wing]] [[activist]] group that uses [[clowning]] and [[non-violence|non-violent]] tactics to act against corporate [[globalisation]], [[war]], and on other issues. The group originated circa 2003 in the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
CIRCA emerged from the [[direct action]] movement and has participated in protests against [[George W. Bush]]'s visit to the UK in 2003 and demonstrations against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

The group was particularly prominent in many of the actions organised around the [[31st G8 summit]] held in [[Gleneagles, Scotland|Gleneagles]] during July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburgh.cfm?id=719802005{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Rebel clowns are in town], ''Edinburgh Evening News'', 30 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of CIRCA entertained children in [[Auchterarder]] while waiting for permission to march near the summit.&lt;ref name=ent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4658007.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Scotland - Day of uncertainty and contrasts|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIRCA has active groups in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], and [[Israel]], and many other groups have appeared that have been inspired by the work of the original group.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Appearance==
Those participating in CIRCA actions typically dress in military-style [[camouflage]] clothing supplemented with brightly coloured trimmings and political logos. The costumes both create a comical atmosphere and serve to maintain anonymity during protests. 'Armaments' are usually limited to [[feather duster]]s, although some carry [[Squirt gun|water pistols]]. The complete ensemble of the costume and traditional clown make-up (usually consisting of a white face and red nose) creates a sense of ridiculousness which seeks to challenge preconceptions of radical activists.

==Beliefs==
CIRCA claims that there is more to the group than simply dressing up and being playful. There is also a [[psychology]] which informs its actions: the clown persona can be used to defuse tense situations and engage with [[police]] in public order situations. In order to learn this 'recruits' must participate in a training workshop aka Big Shoe Camp before deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beautifultrouble.org/case/clandestine-insurgent-rebel-clown-army/|title=Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army|work=beautifultrouble.org|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about the G8 protests, the ''Edinburgh Evening News'' described CIRCA as "''an [[anarchist]] splinter group,''" but a member of the organization denied this, saying that while some members would describe themselves as anarchists "''...most would consider themselves '[[horizontalidad|horizontalist]]s' where we engage people without the need for leaders.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://austria.indymedia.org/node/310 Rebel Clowns Army | at.indymedia.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520132853/http://austria.indymedia.org/node/310 |date=May 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2010}}
'''Consequentialist justifications of the state''' are philosophical arguments which contend that the [[State (polity)|state]] is justified by the good results it produces. 

[[The justification of the state]] is the source of legitimate authority for the state or [[government]]. Typically, a justification of the state explains why the state should exist, and what a legitimate state should or should not be able to do. Consequentialist justifications of the state focus on the results that are achieved when certain institutions are put in place. They are based on [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] theories such as [[utilitarianism]]. Consequentialism is sometimes confused with utilitarianism, but utilitarianism is only one member of a broad family of consequentialist theories.

Consequentialist theories usually maintain that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on whether the results of the action are desirable. They are frequently contrasted to [[deontology|deontological]] theories of morality, which typically hold that certain actions are either forbidden or wrong ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''.

== Justifications of state ==

In law and political theory, a state or [[sovereignty|sovereign]] is an institution that legitimates a particular government. Sometimes arguments about legitimacy have a mystical side to them, as when kings claim [[divine right of kings|divine right]]. 

Different political philosophies have distinct opinions concerning the state as a domestic organization [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopolizing force]].

As an example, consequentialists might observe that the state builds bridges. They would ask whether those bridges would have been built in the absence of the state and whether those bridges are valued by those who use them. If the bridges would not have otherwise been built and they are valuable to those who use them, then the existence of the state is justified.

A philosopher who doubts or denies the legitimacy of the state might respond by questioning the ethical premise, saying for example that the workers who built that bridge were exploited by the government that ordered it built, and/or by the investors in the private contractors who profited. The philosopher might have a [[deontology|deontological]] theory of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].

Alternatively, a skeptic might concede that the bridge is a good consequence but contend that even on consequentialist grounds the argument fails. He might argue that an even better bridge might have been built under [[Anarchism|anarchist]] conditions. This counter-argument raises the issue of [[opportunity cost]] and the whole issue becomes an exercise in economic reasoning.

A '''coppersmith''', also known as a '''brazier''', is a person who makes artifacts from [[copper]] and [[brass]]. '''[[Brass]]''' is an alloy of copper and '''zinc'''.The term redsmith is used for a tinsmith that uses tinsmithing tools and techniques to make copper items.

==History==
Anthropologists believe copper to be the first metal used by humans due to its softness and ease to manipulate.  In antiquity, copper's durability and resistance to rust or corrosion proved valuable.  Copper's relationship with man is thought to date back over six thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Webster B. Sixty Centuries of Copper.  Hutchinson &amp; Co. Ltd, London. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper was particularly worked in England, with ores smelted in Wales as early as the 1500s.  Copper was found in great quantities in North America, especially Montana, as well as archaic copper mines near Lake Superior, which was recording by a Jesuit missionary in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, John.  Art of Coppersmithing.  Astragal Press, Lakeville MN. 1993.  Reprinting from original work published in 1894.  {{ISBN|1-879335-37-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coppersmithing as a trade benefited strongly from the invention of sheet metal rollers.  Copper sheet was then available in a much more versatile and easy form for creating copper wares.  By the 1700s, coppersmiths lived in the American colonies, but did not have access to much sheet copper due to the Crown's regulation of copper and other goods to the Americas.  Sheet metal production was prohibited in the colonies as well before the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Henry J. ''American Copper &amp; Brass.''  Masthof Press, Morgantown PA.  1968. {{ISBN|1-883294-22-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coppersmith Trade==

Most coppersmiths can create, from a pattern, copper wares from a sheet of tin.  They can also repair, clean and re-tin copper cookware interiors.  Some cooper smiths make barrels.Some coppersmiths will specialize in specific forms or items, such as a particular type of biscuit oven or mug or kettle.  In the 1700 and 1800's, coppersmiths typically had a few apprentices in various stages of learning the trade working together.

Apprentices would start learning the trade usually around 8 or 9 years old.  Typical duties of a youth in the copper shop would include tasks such as breaking coke or sal ammoniac blocks, scouring copper pieces to prepare them for tinning, and polishing hammers and tools.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, John. Art of Coppersmithing: A Practical Treatise on Working Sheet Copper into all Forms.  Astragal Press, Lakeville MN. 1993. {{ISBN|1-879335-37-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where copper is mined like Iberia and India there are a number of centres where the coppersmith trade has flourished.

==Examples of objects made by modern coppersmiths ==
These include:-
* jewellery, sculptures, [[weather vane]]s, overmantels, fenders, decorative panels, and challenge shields; 
*plates and cookware, [[cigarette case]]s, tobacco jars, tea and coffee pots, jugs, vases, trays, frames, rose bowls, timpani, kettles (cooking, brewing, dying, fish and hatter), stew, fry and sauce pans, warming pans or kettledrum bowls; 
*awnings, light fixtures, fountains, [[Extractor hood|range hoods]], cupolas, and [[still]]s.
*[[butter churn]], ship sheathing, copper mugs, ladles, funnels, basins, [[coal scuttle]], glue pots.

Notable copper styles in the UK include [[Newlyn Copper|Newlyn]] in [[Cornwall]] and [[Keswick School of Industrial Art|Keswick]] in [[Cumbria]]. Coppersmith work started waning in the late 1970s and early 1980s and those in the sheetmetal trade began doing the coppersmith's work, the practices used being similar to those in the [[plumber|plumbing]] trade. Coppermiths in recent years have turned to pipe work, not only in copper but also stainless steel and aluminium, particularly in the aircraft industry. They are one of the few trades that have a mention in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;2 Timothy 4:14(KJV), [[Alexander the coppersmith]], although later editions mention a metalworker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of copper==
Copper is generally considered to be a soft metal, meaning it can be worked without heating. Over a period of working the metal in this way it can "work-harden". This means that the molecules within the copper are compressed and irregular in their arrangement. This causes stress in the metal and eventually cracking the metal along these stress points. In order for the copper to be worked to any extensive degree it must be [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]]. This process involves heating the metal and then rapidly cooling it in water. The cooling stage is known as [[quenching]]. By heating the copper, the molecules in the metal are relaxed, and thus able to align themselves in a more uniform fashion. This allows for easier shaping of the metal. In order to keep this uniformity within the metal, it is cooled instantly. This prevents the molecules from moving around and causing tension in the structure of the metal. Unlike ferrous metals—which must be cooled slowly to anneal—copper can be cooled slowly in air or quickly by quenching in water.

The '''Da Yu ''ding''''' ({{zh|c=大盂鼎|p=Dà Yú dǐng}}) is an ancient Chinese bronze circular ''ding'' vessel from the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty (1046&amp;ndash;771 BC).{{sfnb|Qiu Xigui|2000|p=68}} Excavated in Li Village, [[Mei County]], [[Shaanxi]], it is on display in the [[National Museum of China]].{{sfnb|Li Song|2015|p=30}} 

The Da Yu ''ding'', the [[Da Ke ding|Da Ke ''ding'']] in the [[Shanghai Museum]], and the [[Mao Gong Ding|Mao Gong ''ding'']] in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]] are famous  bronze  dings.

==Description==
The tripod is round, with three legs, a common shape during the Western Zhou dynasty. It is {{convert|101.9|cm|adj=on}} high and weighs {{convert|153.5|kg}}. Its aperture is {{convert|77.8|cm|adj=on}}. Its mouth was engraved with [[Taotie]] patterns and its four legs was engraved with animal face patterns. The king is attributed to [[King Kang of Zhou]] (1020&amp;ndash;996 BC), and the date is attributed to the 23rd Year of the king, the [[Western Zhou|Western Zhou dynasty]](1046&amp;ndash;771 BC) &lt;ref&gt;Shanghai Museum 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscription==
[[File:Da Yu ding inscription.jpg|thumb|Inscription inside the Da Yu ''ding'']]
The tripod has 291 Chinese characters in 19 lines inside the tripod&lt;ref&gt;Da yu Ding Chinese Rubbing Collection Harvard University, USA  WEBsite&lt;/ref&gt;.
Most is The King's Speech.
1st speech  is a Historical Overview in  which he provides a moral rationale for  the fall of the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600&amp;ndash;1046 BC) and the rise of the Western Zhou. Here, the King said that  the excess  of drinking wine made Yin dynasty had lost the heaven grace  and army. And the Kings of Zhou have not excess drinking in even ceremonial scenes. And, the King commands Yu({{zh|s=盂|t=|labels=no}}).  support the King, and  work official service throughout  days.
The 2nd is a short charge to Yu to emulate  his  late  grandfather, Nang Gong.
The 3rd is the appointment of king's   minister   with army power. And the detailed  inventory  granted by the King. At last, Yu himself  recorded that he  made  this  tripod for his  deceased grandfather Nang Gong in response  to  the kings kindness. It was  the king's 23th year&lt;ref&gt; Jeffrey R. Thersen 2015 103-127p &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Robert Eno, Indiana University Document&lt;/ref&gt;.
The 1726 slaves in the inventory, is　an important  historic material  for  studying slavery.

==History==
[[File:Zuo Zongtang 1875.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Zuo Zongtang]] (1812&amp;ndash;1885), the fifth ower of the Da Yu ''ding'']]
[[File:潘祖蔭.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Pan Zuyin]] (1830&amp;ndash;1890), the sixth ower of the Da Yu ''ding'']]
In the [[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang era]]  (1821&amp;ndash;1851) of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911), this  tripod  was unearthed in Li village, [[Mei County, Shaanxi]].  Song Jinjian ({{zh|s=宋金鉴|t=宋金鑒|labels=no}}; 1821&amp;ndash;1863), a local rich man, acquired it. Next, the governnor Zhou Gengsheng ({{zh|s=周庚盛|t=|labels=no}}) expropriated it. After he died, Song Jinjian  recovered the  tripod &lt;ref&gt; record in Shaanxi Epigraphy({{zh|s= |t=陕西金石志, 1934|labels=no}}) in  Shanghai Museum 1959. Another record showed the owner  another Ko family.  there is controversy&lt;/ref&gt;.   

Before 1873 winter, Yuan Baoheng ({{zh|s=袁保恒|t=|labels=no}}; 1826&amp;ndash;1878), a follower of [[Zuo Zongtang]]  bought it at a price of 700 tael of silver&lt;ref&gt;Wu Dacheng(1835-1902)  appreciated and  recorded  the  tripod in Yuan's estate in Shaanxi in 1873  winter. &lt;/ref&gt;. Yuan might send the tripod he bought to Zuo Zongtang.  In 1875&lt;ref&gt;On the letter at 1875 March ([[Guangxu Emperor]] era 1st year January(Chinese calendar) 11th) from Chen Jieqi(1813-1884) to Pan Zuyin &lt;/ref&gt;, Zuo Zongtang presented the tripod he treasured as a gift to [[Pan Zuyin]](({{zh|s=潘祖荫|t=潘祖蔭|labels=no}};; 1830&amp;ndash;1890) in Beijing&lt;ref&gt;Shanghai Museum 1959 &lt;/ref&gt;.
Pan Zuyin was a famous collector with rich knowledge in [[Chinese characters]]. In 1890, Pan acquired  the [[Da Ke ding|Da Ke ''ding'']], the second largest bronzeware of the Western Zhou dynasty after the Da Yu ''ding''. His younger brother Pan Zunian ({{zh|s=潘祖年|t=|labels=no}}; 1870&amp;ndash;1925) inherited the family property. In about 1896, Pan Family moved to [[Suzhou]] from Beijing  with their collection  including two tripods.

In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. Fearing  looting  or  destruction, Pan family packed the two  tripods in a wood box and  buried it  in the  earth.

In 1951, Pan Dayu({{zh|s=潘达于|t=潘達于|labels=no}}; 1906&amp;ndash;2007)  donated  the two  tripod to  the nation. &lt;ref&gt;Pan Dayu wrote a short letter, intending to donate the two tripods to Shanghai Museum. A few months later, Liu Ruli ({{zh|s=刘汝醴|t=劉汝醴|labels=no}}) and Shen Gengmei  ({{zh|s=沈羹梅|t=|labels=no}})  went to Suzhou accompanied by Pan Jiahua ({{zh|s=潘家华|t=潘家華|labels=no}}), daughter of Pan Dayu, to take the tripods. Mao Dun (1896–1981), the Minister of Culture, personally inscribed an honorary credential for her.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shanghai Museum displayed the two tripods and  published &lt;ref&gt;Shanghai Museum 1959 &lt;/ref&gt;. In 1959, the Da Yu ''ding'' was transferred to Beijing and became one of the most valuable treasure in [[National Museum of China]]. In March 2004, in order to celebrate Pan Dayu's 100 birthday, the Da Yu ''ding'' was transferred to Shanghai Museum for a special and short display. It's their reunion for half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2004-03-02/04001937654s.shtml |script-title=zh:大克鼎和大盂鼎：半世纪后再聚首|trans-title=Da Yu ''ding'' and Da Ke ''ding'': reunited after half a century |newspaper=sina |date=2004-03-02 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://news.qq.com/a/20040229/000200.htm |script-title=zh:国宝级文物大盂鼎大克鼎五十年后上海相聚|trans-title=National treasures the Da Yu ''ding'' and Da Ke ''ding'' are reunited half a century later in Shanghai |newspaper=Tencent |date=2004-02-09 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dame Lorraine''' ([[Trinidad and Tobago]])as it is called in the land of its birth [[Trinidad]], and in the wider diaspora, or ''Mother Sally'' in Barbados, is a historical Trinidad [[Carnival Character]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tntislandh.com/carnivalcharacters.html "Dame Lorraine or Dame Lorine"], Traditional Carnival Characters.&lt;/ref&gt; She is characterized as a voluptuously large woman who wears a long dress and dances in the mas. According to the Trinidad and Tobago National Library, the character is "imitative of the mas played by the 18th and early 19th century French planters, who would dress up in elegant costumes of the French aristocracy and parade in groups at private homes, particularly on Carnival Sunday night. They also performed the sophisticated dances of the period. The liberated slaves recreated these costumes – complete with elaborate fans and hats – in their own fashion, using materials that were readily available, such as assorted rags and imitation jewellery-type items, but emphasizing and exaggerating the physical characteristics, and dancing to small bandol and cuatro bands. they also put pillows or stuffings to make their behind and bosoms bigger".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Carnival/tabid/105/Default.aspx?PageContentID=81 "Traditional Carnival Characters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215172237/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Carnival/tabid/105/Default.aspx?PageContentID=81 |date=2014-12-15 }}, NALIS.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the past it was mainly men who dressed as the Dame Lorraine character, lately more women portray the character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncctt.org/new/index.php/carnival-history/trad-carnival-characters/317-traditional-mas-characters-dame-lorraine.html "Traditional Mas Characters - Dame Lorraine"], National Carnival Commission of Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

[[Feminists]] have long struggled with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s classical model of gender and identity development and reality, which centers around the [[Oedipus complex]]. Freud's model, which became integral to orthodox [[psychoanalysis]], suggests that because women lack the visible genitals of the male, they feel they are "missing" the most central characteristic necessary for gaining [[narcissistic]] value—therefore developing feelings of [[gender inequality]] and [[penis envy]]. In his late theory on the feminine, Freud recognized the early and long lasting libidinal attachment of the daughter to the mother during the pre-oedipal stages. [[Psychoanalytic feminism|Feminist psychoanalysts]] have confronted these ideas (particularly the female relationship to the real, imaginary and symbolic [[phallus]]) and reached different conclusions. Some generally agree with Freud's major outlines, modifying it through observations of the pre-Oedipal phase. Others reformulate Freud's theories more completely.

==Hélène Deutsch==
[[Helene Deutsch|Hélène Deutsch]] (1884–1982) was one of Freud's first female pupils and the first analyst who made an integral, chronological study of woman's psychological development. In short, Deutsch claims that women have a passive-masochistic sexuality, they are born for reproduction and their development must be seen as different from the development of men.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Psychoanalyse en vrouwelijke seksualiteit'', pp.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deutsch sees the female development as exceedingly difficult and tortuous, because at some point she must transfer her primary sexual object choice from her mother to her father (and males), if she is to attain her expected heterosexual adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Juschka, D.M. “Feminism in the Study of Religion”, pp.88.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deutsch, the girl blames her father, not her mother, for the lack of a penis; thus, she stops identifying with her father and masculinity.  Because of this relationship with her father, she develops [[libido|libidinous]] fantasies of being raped. Thus, the rape fantasy is universal and non-pathological, a key part of female sexuality.  Meanwhile, the girl identifies herself with her mother through the wish for an '[[anal stage|anal child]]'. When she recognizes her failure, a decline to the [[genital stage|pre-genital stage]] takes place: a wish for the earlier active ([[phallic]]) clitoris. [[Sadomasochism|Masochistic]] tensions in the girl prevail and she longs to be castrated by her father. The desire for a child also becomes masochistic.

==Nancy Chodorow==
[[Nancy Chodorow]] noted that Freud believed that males possess physical superiority and that a woman's personality is inevitably determined by her lack of a penis. Like Freud, but for different reasons, Chodorow emphasizes that the female Oedipal crisis is not resolved completely, unlike the male crisis: a girl cannot and does not completely reject her mother in favour of men, but continues her relationship of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to her. The strength and quality of her relationship with her father are completely dependent upon the strength and quality of her relationship with her mother. Chodorow claims that most women are genitally heterosexual, but they have other, equally deep relationships with their children and with other women, as a result of the primary relationship with the mother.&lt;ref&gt;Chorodow, ''Family structure and feminine personality'', pp.87-89&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, a girl represses neither her pre-Oedipal nor her Oedipal attachment to her mother nor her Oedipal attachment to her father. This means that she grows up with more ongoing preoccupation with [[depressive position|internalized object relationships]] and with external relationships. Because a girl does not have to repress her pre-Oedipal and Oedipal attachment to father and mother, she reaches a more relational sensibility than boys. Chodorow illustrated this through studies suggesting that men love (and fall in love) romantically, where women love and fall in love sensibly and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Chorodow, ''Feminism and psychoanalytic theory'', pp.73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luce Irigaray==
In [[Freud]]'s model there is no place for [[femininity]] unless it is related to [[masculinity]]. [[Luce Irigaray]], a student of [[Jacques Lacan]], disagrees with the thoughts about the importance of the penis and phallic for women.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.73&lt;/ref&gt; She hypothesizes that the reason the penis is privileged in Freud's model is that it is visible. This is also the reason that male sexuality is based, in early Lacanianism, on having (a penis) and [[female sexuality]] is based on lack. In Freud's paradigm, female desire is the desire for a baby to substitute for penis, thus female pleasure is derived from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.57,34&lt;/ref&gt; Irigaray disagrees: "How can we accept that the entire female sexuality is being controlled by the lack and envy of the penis?"&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.58&lt;/ref&gt; Female sexuality is not solely related to reproduction, but neither is it less valuable in reproduction, and thus it should not hold less social power.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, she says that Freud is forgetting the mother-daughter relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.119&lt;/ref&gt; To enter the Oedipus-complex, a girl must hate her mother. Irigaray says this view makes it impossible for a girl to give meaning to the relationship with her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.120&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The [[flag]] and the [[coat of arms]] of Terengganu''' are [[federated state|state]] [[symbol]]s of [[Terengganu]], a [[States of Malaysia|state]] in [[Malaysia]]. Like the majority of state symbols for states with Malay royalties, the flag and the arms of Terengganu centre on [[Sultan of Terengganu|its royalty]], as well as [[Islam]], the state's traditional religion.

The white signifies the [[Sultan of Terengganu]], while the black signifies the state's citizens; with the white border surrounding the black panel, the layout represents the Sultan's duty to protect his subjects.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov flag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=871 |title=Bendera Negeri |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708115532/http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=871 |archivedate=8 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The star and crescent denote [[Islam]] as the official religion of the state.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov flag"/&gt;

In October 2006, then-[[List of Menteris Besar of Terengganu|''Menteri Besar'' of Terengganu]] [[Idris Jusoh]] voiced intentions by the state government to "[brighten] up" the flag and incorporate an emblem by first seeking opinions from professions, citing feedback of the flag being too "simple and dull".&lt;ref name="star idris"/&gt; As of 2008, there have been no reports of further action.

=== Variants ===

==== District flags ====
Terengganu has eight [[Daerah|administrative districts]] (''[[daerah]]''), each assigned their own district-level flags.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov districts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=872 |title=Bendera Daerah |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All eight of the flags consist of only a single coloured [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|field]] with the state flag on the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|canton]]; the only distinction is the colour of the field, which corresponds to respectable districts and represents their qualities:&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov districts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fotw district"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/my-ter-m.html |title=Municipal flags in Terengganu (Malaysia) |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author=Various authors |date=19 July 2008 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Royal Standards ====
Terengganu's royalty, mostly prominently the [[Sultan of Terengganu]], fly their own [[Royal Standard]]s.

[[File:Bendera Sultan Terengganu.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Royal Standard of the Sultan.]]

The Sultan's Royal Standard is known as ''Tanah Putih'' and consists of a white flag bearing a partial rendition of [[#Coat of arms|the state emblem]], as well as a wreath of [[rice]] stalks and a [[motto]].&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="king standard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3334 |title=The Body Flag Of His Royal Highness The Sultan Of Terengganu |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234551/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3334 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a plain white flag,&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; the additional emblem, which is coloured yellow, was added to identify the flag to Terengganu's royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_putih.php |title=Laman Web Rasmi |publisher=Istana.terengganu.gov.my |date= |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101010/http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_putih.php |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the ''Pemaisuri''{{'}}s (Queen's) Royal Standard (which is given the name ''Tanah Kuning Tua'') is very similar to that of the Sultan's, but features a reversed arrangement of colours, with a white emblem against a yellow field.&lt;ref name="queen standard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3335 |title=The Body Flag Of Her Royal Highness The Queen Of Terengganu |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234705/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3335 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_tua.php |title=Laman Web Rasmi |publisher=Istana.terengganu.gov.my |date= |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143709/http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_tua.php |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Standard of the ''Yang Di-pertuan Muda'' (Crown Prince) bears a similar colour configuration as the Queen's, but features only the partial rendition of the state emblem, which is significantly larger than that of the Sultan's and the Queen's. The Royal Standard for the Crown Prince is named as ''Tanah Kuning Muda''.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prince standard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3336 |title=The Body Flag Of His Highness The Crown Prince Of Terengganu |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234719/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3336 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_kuning.php |title=Laman Web Rasmi |publisher=Istana.terengganu.gov.my |date= |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103738/http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_kuning.php |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Obsolete flags ====
Prior to the adoption of the present flag, the state flag of Terengganu previously sported a significantly different design, although many of its elements would be carried over to its successor. The earliest known variant of the state flag was used between 1925 and 1933, and consisted of only a white-black flag divided vertically with the black stripe two times wider than the white stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;

[[File:Flag of Terengganu (1912 - 1933).svg|200px|thumb|left|Flag used until 1933.]]

In 1933, a star and crescent that pointed upwards and featured rounder crescent was added on the black band, signifying Terengganu's recognition of Islam as the state's religion.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; The flag remained in use until the introduction of the current flag.

[[File:Flag of Terengganu (1933 - 1947).svg|200px|thumb|left|Flag used until 1953.]]

Additionally, the state government of Terengganu formerly flew its own "Governmental Service Flag", which design originated in the same manner as the state flag. Bearing the same vertical white-black layout, a white [[saltire]] was also included on the black stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; Similarly, a star and crescent was also added in a later date, but was placed on the white stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; The flag was rendered obsolete following the adoption of the present state flag, which was also to be used by the state government.

==State Emblem==

=== Design ===
[[File:Coat of arms of Terengganu.svg|thumb|The state emblem of Terengganu.]]

Approved for official use by the State Ministers Committee in 1932, the state arms or emblem (Malay: ''Jata'') of Terengganu was designed by several state officials during the reign of [[Zainal Abidin III|Sultan Zainal Abidin III]] (1881–1918), and is thought to have been drawn by Mohamad bin Abdul Rahim, the relative of Dato' Nara Wangsa (Dato' Mata-Mata).&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=653 |title=Jata Kebesaran |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907064520/http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=653 |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms originally consisted of a white outlined oval that encompassed a series of symbols coloured in yellow and a [[Jawi script|Jawi]] [[motto]].&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt; During the rule of [[Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu|Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah]] (1945–1979), the emblem was modified with the addition of a dotted figure of a [[Seal (device)|seal]] around all of the symbols except the [[star and crescent]], which resides over the seal, the addition of a pair of maces and the shortening of the motto.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

Details of the emblem's components are as follows:&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

;Star and crescent
:The [[star and crescent]] reside atop the seal, pointing upwards. As a symbol of the [[Islam|Islamic faith]], they represent Terengganu as an Islamic state.

;Seal
:The seal consists of a near-oval, shield-like dotted outline that encompasses virtually all symbols in the emblem with the exception of the star and crescent, including:
:* A [[crown (heraldry)|crown]], located near the top, which represents the sovereignty of the [[Sultan of Terengganu]];
:* a [[sword]], a long ''[[kris]]'' and a pair of [[ceremonial mace]]s (The sword and ''kris'' crisscrosses each other to the top, while the maces crisscrosses each other lower down), which symbolise the royal paraphernalia of Terengganu;&lt;ref name="royal regalia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3326 |title=ROYAL PARAPHERNALIA |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234726/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3326 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* two books, located on opposing sides of the seal below the upper half of a mace and the lower half of the sword or ''kris'', represent two important books in Terengganu: The Book of Law—placed on the left—denoting justice and the [[Qur'an]]—placed on the right—denoting the Law; and
:* a [[scarf]] (''wali'' or ''selampai''), which wraps around the sword or ''kris'' and over the maces, signify a portion of the state's cultural regalia.&lt;ref name="royal regalia"/&gt;

;Motto
The [[motto]], "Terengganu" written in [[Jawi script|Jawi]] (ترڠڬانو), is located below the seal. When introduced in 1932, the emblem's motto originally read "''Jawatan Kerajaan Terengganu''" (Terengganu Government Post) in Jawi.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt; During the rule of [[Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah]], "''Jawatan Kerajaan''" was omitted from the motto, resulting in its present form.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

=== Royal Standard variants ===
The state emblem of Terengganu is included on the [[#Royal Standards|Royal Standards of Terengganu's royal family]], but differs slightly, as it is only duplicated partially, without the outlining oval border and seal, the "Terengganu" [[motto]] and the star and crescent. Two elements are added on the emblem in the case of the Royal Standards for the Sultan and the Queen: a [[wreath]] of [[rice]] stalks and a different motto depicted in the form of banner to be written in [[Jawi script|Jawi]].&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt; The motto corresponds to the individual the Standard is assigned to; as such, the motto for the Standard of the Sultan reads "''Sultan Terengganu''" while that of the Queen reads "''Pemaisuri Terengganu''".&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt; The emblem on the Royal Standard of the Crown Prince consists of only the partial replication of the state emblem.&lt;ref name="prince standard"/&gt;

As the Standard of the Sultan has a white field, the emblem retains its yellow colour.&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt; However, as the Standard of the Queen and the Crown Prince bare yellow fields, their emblems are white.&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prince standard"/&gt;

'''Gustaf Hermann Dalman''' (9 June 1855 – 19 August 1941) was a German [[Lutheran]] theologian and [[Oriental studies|orientalist]]. He did extensive field work in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] before the First World War, collecting inscriptions, poetry, and proverbs. He also collected physical articles illustrating the life of the indigenous farmers and herders of the country, including rock and plant samples, house and farm tools, small archaeological finds, and ceramics. He pioneered the study of biblical and early post-biblical [[Aramaic]], publishing an authoritative grammar (1894) and dictionary (1901), as well as other works. His collection of 15,000 historic photographs and 5,000 books, including rare 16th century prints, and maps formed the basis of the Gustaf Dalman Institute at [[University of Greifswald|Ernst Moritz Arndt Universität]], [[Greifswald]], which commemorates and continues his work.

The theologian and translator [[Franz Delitzsch]], who translated the [[New Testament]] into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], entrusted to Dalman the work of "thoroughly revising" the Hebrew text.&lt;ref&gt;Dalman, G., "The Hebrew New Testament of Franz Delitzsch", ''The Old and New Testament Student'', Vol. 15, No. 3/4 (Sep. - Oct., 1892), pp. 145-150, available at https://www.jstor.org/stable/3158076&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12783">The '''haversine formula''' determines the [[great-circle distance]] between two points on a [[sphere]] given their [[longitude]]s and [[latitude]]s. Important in [[navigation]], it is a special case of a more general formula  in [[spherical trigonometry]], the '''law of haversines''', that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles.

The first [[table of haversines]] in English was published by James Andrew in 1805,&lt;ref name="Brummelen_2013"&gt;{{cite book | first=Glen Robert | last=van Brummelen | author-link=Glen Robert van Brummelen | title=Heavenly Mathematics: The Forgotten Art of Spherical Trigonometry | date=2013 | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | isbn=9780691148922 | id=0691148929 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BCCz8Sx5wkC&amp;pg=PR7 | access-date=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Florian Cajori]] credits an earlier use by [[José de Mendoza y Ríos]] in 1801.&lt;ref name="Ríos_1795"&gt;{{cite book | first=Joseph | last=de Mendoza y Ríos | author-link=José de Mendoza y Ríos | title=Memoria sobre algunos métodos nuevos de calcular la longitud por las distancias lunares: y aplication de su teórica á la solucion de otros problemas de navegacion | language=Spanish | url=https://books.google.cat/books?id=030t0OqlX2AC | year=1795 | publisher=Imprenta Real | location=Madrid, Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cajori_1929"&gt;{{cite book | first=Florian | last=Cajori | author-link=Florian Cajori | title=A History of Mathematical Notations | volume=2 | orig-year=1929&lt;!-- 1929-03 --&gt; | publisher=[[Open court publishing company]] | location=Chicago, USA | date=1952 | edition=2 (3rd corrected printing of 1929 issue) | page=172 | isbn=978-1-60206-714-1 | id=1602067147 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bT5suOONXlgC | access-date=2015-11-11 | quote=The haversine first appears in the tables of logarithmic versines of [[José de Mendoza y Rios]] (Madrid, 1801, also 1805, 1809), and later in a treatise on navigation of [[James Inman]] (1821).}} (NB. ISBN and link for reprint of 2nd edition by Cosimo, Inc., New York, USA, 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[haversine]]'' was coined in 1835 by [[James Inman]].&lt;ref name="Inman_1835"&gt;{{cite book | first=James | last=Inman&lt;!-- Rev. D.D. --&gt; | author-link=James Inman | title=Navigation and Nautical Astronomy: For the Use of British Seamen | date=1835 | orig-year=1821 | edition=3 | publisher=W. Woodward, C. &amp; J.

These names follow from the fact that they are customarily written in terms of the haversine function, given by {{math|haversin(''θ'') {{=}} sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;({{sfrac|''θ''|2}})}}. The formulas could equally be written in terms of any multiple of the haversine, such as the older [[versine]] function (twice the haversine). Prior to the advent of computers, the elimination of division and multiplication by factors of two proved convenient enough that tables of haversine values and [[logarithm]]s were included in 19th and early 20th century navigation and trigonometric texts.&lt;ref&gt;H. B. Goodwin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSNKAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA735&amp;pg=PA735 The haversine in nautical astronomy], ''Naval Institute Proceedings'', vol. 36, no. 3 (1910), pp. 735–746: ''Evidently if a Table of Haversines is employed we shall be saved in the first instance the trouble of dividing the sum of the logarithms by two, and in the second place of multiplying the angle taken from the tables by the same number.  This is the special advantage of the form of table first introduced by Professor Inman, of the Portsmouth Royal Navy College, nearly a century ago.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Sheppard and C. C. Soule, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8S0wAAAAYAAJ Practical navigation] (World Technical Institute: Jersey City, 1922).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Hedrick, [https://archive.org/details/logarithmictrigo00hedriala Logarithmic and Trigonometric Tables] (Macmillan, New York, 1913).&lt;/ref&gt;  These days, the haversine form is also convenient in that it has no coefficient in front of the {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} function.

==Formulation==
Let the [[central angle]] {{math|&amp;Theta;}} between any two points on a sphere be:
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta = \frac{d}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* {{math|''d''}} is the distance between the two points (along a [[great circle]] of the sphere; see [[Great-circle distance|spherical distance]]),
* {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere.
The ''haversine formula'' {{math|hav}} of {{math|&amp;Theta;}} is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hav}\left(\Theta\right) = \operatorname{hav}(\varphi_2 - \varphi_1) + \cos(\varphi_1) \cos(\varphi_2)\operatorname{hav}(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* {{math|''φ''{{sub|1}}, ''φ''{{sub|2}}}}: latitude of point 1 and latitude of point 2,
* {{math|''λ''{{sub|1}}, ''λ''{{sub|2}}}}: longitude of point 1 and longitude of point 2.
Finally, the [[haversine function]] (half a [[versine]]) of an angle {{math|''&amp;theta;''}} (applied above to the differences in latitude and longitude) is:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hav}(\theta)=\sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)=\frac{1-\cos(\theta)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

To solve for the distance {{math|''d''}}, apply the [[inverse haversine]] {{math|hav&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;}} to the central angle {{math|&amp;Theta;}} or use the [[arcsine]] (inverse sine) function:
:&lt;math&gt;d = r \operatorname{hav}^{-1}(h) = 2 r \arcsin\left(\sqrt{h}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''h''{{=}}hav(&amp;Theta;)}}, or more explicitly:
:&lt;math&gt;d = 2 r \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\operatorname{hav}(\varphi_2 - \varphi_1) + \cos(\varphi_1) \cos(\varphi_2)\operatorname{hav}(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = 2 r \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\varphi_2 - \varphi_1}{2}\right) + \cos(\varphi_1) \cos(\varphi_2)\sin^2\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

When using these formulae, one must ensure that {{math|''h''}} does not exceed 1 due to a [[floating point]] error ({{math|''d''}} is only [[real number|real]] for {{math|''h''}} from 0 to 1). {{math|''h''}} only approaches 1 for ''antipodal'' points (on opposite sides of the sphere)—in this region, relatively large numerical errors tend to arise in the formula when finite precision is used. Because {{math|''d''}} is then large (approaching {{math|π''R''}}, half the circumference) a small error is often not a major concern in this unusual case (although there are other [[great-circle distance]] formulas that avoid this problem).  (The formula above is sometimes written in terms of the [[arctangent]] function, but this suffers from similar numerical problems near {{math|''h''}} = 1.)

As described below, a similar formula can be written using cosines (sometimes called the [[spherical law of cosines]], not to be confused with the [[law of cosines]] for plane geometry) instead of haversines, but if the two points are close together (e.g. a kilometer apart, on the Earth) you might end up with {{math|cos({{sfrac|''d''|''R''}})}} = 0.99999999, leading to an inaccurate answer. Since the haversine formula uses sines, it avoids that problem.

Either formula is only an approximation when applied to the [[Earth]], which is not a perfect sphere: the "[[Earth radius]]" {{math|''R''}} varies from 6356.752&amp;nbsp;km at the poles to 6378.137&amp;nbsp;km at the equator.  More importantly, the [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] of a north-south line on the earth's surface is 1% greater at the poles (≈6399.594&amp;nbsp;km) than at the equator (≈6335.439&amp;nbsp;km)&amp;mdash;so the haversine formula and law of cosines cannot be guaranteed correct to better than 0.5%. More accurate methods that consider the Earth's ellipticity are given by [[Vincenty's formulae]] and the other formulas in the [[geographical distance]] article.

==The law of haversines{{anchor|Law}}==
[[File:Law-of-haversines.svg|right|thumb|Spherical triangle solved by the law of haversines]]
Given a unit sphere, a "triangle" on the surface of the sphere is defined by  the [[great circle]]s connecting three points {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}}, and {{math|'''w'''}} on the sphere.  If the lengths of these three sides are {{math|''a''}} (from {{math|'''u'''}} to {{math|'''v'''}}), {{math|''b''}} (from {{math|'''u'''}} to {{math|'''w'''}}), and {{math|''c''}} (from {{math|'''v'''}} to {{math|'''w'''}}), and the angle of the corner opposite {{math|''c''}} is {{math|''C''}}, then the law of haversines states:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hav}(c) = \operatorname{hav}(a - b) + \sin(a) \sin(b) \, \operatorname{hav}(C).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical handbook for scientists and engineers: Definitions, theorems, and formulas for reference and review |first1=Grandino Arthur |last1=Korn |first2=Theresa M. |last2=Korn |edition=3&lt;!-- (based on 1968 edition by McGrawHill, Inc.) --&gt; |date=2000 |orig-year=1922 |publisher=[[Dover Publications, Inc.]] |location=Mineola, New York, USA |chapter=Appendix B: B9. Plane and Spherical Trigonometry: Formulas Expressed in Terms of the Haversine Function |pages=892–893 |isbn=978-0-486-41147-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this is a unit sphere, the lengths {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are simply equal to the angles (in [[radian]]s) subtended by those sides from the center of the sphere (for a non-unit sphere, each of these arc lengths is equal to its [[central angle]] multiplied by the radius of the sphere).

In order to obtain the haversine formula of the previous section from this law, one simply considers the special case where {{math|'''u'''}} is the [[Geographic North Pole|north pole]], while {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} are the two points whose separation {{math|''d''}} is to be determined.  In that case, {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are {{math|{{sfrac|π|2}} − ''φ''{{sub|1,2}}}} (i.e., 90°&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;latitude), {{math|''C''}} is the longitude separation {{math|Δ''λ''}}, and {{math|''c''}} is the desired {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''R''}}}}.  Noting that {{math|sin({{sfrac|π|2}} − ''φ'') {{=}} cos(''φ'')}}, the haversine formula immediately follows.

To derive the law of haversines, one starts with the [[spherical law of cosines]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(c) = \cos(a) \cos(b) + \sin(a) \sin(b) \cos(C). \,&lt;/math&gt;

As mentioned above, this formula is an ill-conditioned way of solving for {{math|''c''}} when {{math|''c''}} is small.  Instead, we substitute the identity that {{math|cos(''θ'') {{=}} 1 − 2 hav(''θ'')}}, and also employ the [[trigonometric identity#Addition/subtraction theorems|addition identity]] {{math|cos(''a'' − ''b'') {{=}} cos(''a'')cos(''b'') + sin(''a'')sin(''b'')}}, to obtain the law of haversines, above.

'''Honor Frost''' (28 October 1917 – 12 September 2010) was a pioneer in the field of [[underwater archaeology]], who led many mediterranean archaeological investigations, especially in the Lebanon, and was noted for her typology of stone anchors and skills in [[archaeological illustration]].&lt;ref&gt;Norton (1999) p235, Shea (1981), Vagnetti (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
An only child, Frost was born in [[Nicosia]], Cyprus. She was orphaned at an early age and became the [[Ward (law)|ward]] of Wilfred Evill, a London solicitor and art collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/8097603/Honor-Frost.html|title=Obituary: Honor Frost|publisher=The Daily Telegraph, UK|accessdate=30 October 2010|location=London|date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended art school, worked on ballet set design and held a job at Tate Britain. Alongside these artistic pursuits, she was also the adventurous sort who once donned a WW2 diving suit at a friend’s party in Wimbledon in order to go diving into the 17th-century well in the backyard. From this first foray into diving onward, Frost was enamoured with the practice, once claiming that, “Time spent out of the water was time wasted.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Honor Frost   {{!}} TrowelBlazers|url = http://trowelblazers.com/honor-frost/|website = trowelblazers.com|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Frost became a diver soon after [[Jacques Cousteau|Cousteaus]]'s invention of [[Scuba set|SCUBA]], and worked as a diver and artist in the early 1950s in France and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld p11&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the world’s first scuba diving club, the Club Alpin Sous-Marin,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; her first experience of the underwater excavation of shipwrecks was with [[Frederic Dumas]].&lt;ref&gt;Norton (1999) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; S

An expedition in Turkey resulted in the discovery of a late Bronze Age shipwreck at [[Gelidonya]], for which Frost is credited as having realised its significance. The wreck had been previously discovered by Turkish diver Mustafa Kapkin and U.S. photo-journalist [[Peter Throckmorton]]  in 1959. However, it was Frost who recognised that the wreck was not Mycenean, but Phoenician, thus providing the first evidence that Phoenicians had been trading on the seas before the Iron Age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She convinced [[Joan du Plat Taylor]], who she had met at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] in London, to become co-director of the excavation at Gelidonya. It was later the site of [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George Bass]]'s and [[Peter Throckmorton]]'s first work in underwater archaeology at [[Cape Gelidonya]] in the Antayla region of southern Turkey. The Bronze Age ship wreck, which dated to the 12th century BC, was the oldest known shipwreck in the world at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld pp11-12, Norton(1999) p. 234, pp. 248–252, 253–258&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation of this wreck is of special significance, as it was the first to be conducted following a rigorous scientific approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1968 she led an [[UNESCO]] expedition to survey the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] site in the Port of Alexandria, for which she was later awarded, in 1997, a French government medal for pioneering submarine archaeology in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1997); Dept. Culture; Hairy (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1971 she led the investigation of the [[Marsala (ship)|Marsala Punic Warship]] in [[Sicily, Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;The Times (2004); Frost (1974), ''see selected papers''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[British Sub-Aqua Club|BSAC]] awarded her the Colin McLeod award for ''Furthering international co-operation in diving'' for her work in archaeology&lt;ref&gt;BSAC (2005–2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

She died on 12 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 17 September 2010; Gambin (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carswell|first1=John|title=Honor Frost obituary: Pioneer of underwater archaeology fascinated by the Mediterranean|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/26/honor-frost-obituary|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial art collection that she had inherited upon Wilfred Evill's death was used to endow the Honor Frost Foundation which supplies funds for underwater archaeology in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Infinite Summer''' was an online [[book discussion club|book club]]–style project started by writer Matthew Baldwin. Sponsored by ''[[The Morning News (online magazine)|The Morning News]]'', participants were challenged to read and complete [[David Foster Wallace]]'s novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' at a rate of about 75 pages a week from June 21 to September 22, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/afterword/archive/2009/06/22/an-interview-with-infinite-summer-creator-matthew-baldwin.aspx|title=An interview with Infinite Summer creator Matthew Baldwin|date=June 22, 2009|first=Ron|last=Nurwisah|accessdate= August 3, 2009|work=The National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/06/infinite-summer-reading-group-kicks-off-june-21.html|title=David Foster Wallace Remembered with Infinite Summer Reading Group|first= Sean|last=Gandert|date= June 8, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009|work=Paste Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1870628_1904492_1904480,00.html|title=The Short List of Things to Do|date=June 12, 2009|work=Time magazine|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldwin and three other writers acted as "guides", providing commentary on the main Infinite Summer website. Participants in the project also contributed commentary over a variety of [[social networking]] services, including [[Facebook]], [[Tumblr]], and [[Twitter]], where related posts were marked with the hashtag #infsum. 

Baldwin said in interviews that the project was prompted in part by Wallace's death in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2009/06/infinite-summer.html|first=Jacob|last=Silverman|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate= August 3, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|title=The story behind Infinite Summer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|History of Jaipur}}
[[File:1 Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II ca 1725 Jaipur. British museum.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jai Singh II]], the founder of Jaipur]]

The city of Jaipur was founded in 1727 by [[Jai Singh II]], the [[Amer, India|Raja of Amer]] who ruled from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amer, {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} from Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water.&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt; Jai Singh consulted several books on architecture and architects while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under the architectural guidance of [[Vidyadhar Bhattacharya]], Jaipur was planned based on the principles of [[Vastu shastra]] and [[Shilpa Shastra]].&lt;ref name="Jaipur history"/&gt; The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years to complete the major roads, offices and palaces. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the state buildings and palaces, with the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified gates.&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jaipur.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/jaipur/en/about-jaipur/history.html|title=About Jaipur|publisher=Government of Rajasthan|access-date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaipur is a standout amongst the most socially rich legacy urban areas in India. Established in the year 1727, the city is named after Maharaja Jai Singh II who was the primary organizer of this city. He was a Kachhwaha Rajput and ruled the region in the vicinity of 1699 and 1744.

During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh I, the city was painted pink to welcome the Prince of Wales, later [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], in 1876.&lt;ref name="POW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/rajasthan/jaipur/history|title=History of Jaipur|publisher=Lonely Planet|access-date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the avenues remained painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet ''Pink city''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwone/edward_vii_02.shtml |title=History in depth: Edward VII: The First Constitutional Monarch|publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and by 1900 it had a population of 160,000. The wide boulevards were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and [[marble]], fostered by a school of art founded in 1868.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The city had three colleges, including a [[Sanskrit]] college (1865) and a girls' school (1867) opened during the reign of the Maharaja [[Ram Singh II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V13_405.gif|title=Jaipur City or Jainagar|year=1909|publisher=[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]|pages=399–402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?volume=13&amp;objectid=DS405.1.I34_V13_388.gif|title=Jaipur State|year=1909|publisher=[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]|pages=382–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large areas of the city including the airport were flooded in August 1981, resulting in the death of eight people and much damage to the city's [[Dravyavati River]].&lt;ref name="jda-May2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rejuvenation of Amanishah Nallah including Area Development|url=http://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/FormB/EC/EIA_EMP/05052016GHYEVHEZAnnexure-documentofEIAEMP.pdf|publisher=[[Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change]]|page=25|date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floods were caused by three days of cloud burst that produced more rain than the annual average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Sharad K.|last2=Agarwal|first2=Pushpendra K.|last3=Singh|first3=Vijay P.|title=Hydrology and Water Resources of India|date=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402051807|page=883|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZKs1gBhJSWIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">'''Joan Eileen Annie Liversidge''' [[Fellow of The Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (May 1914 - 16 January 1984) was an English archaeologist who specialised in [[Roman Britain]].

== Biography ==
Liversidge was an Honorary Keeper of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the [[University of Cambridge]], a research fellow at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], and a faculty lecturer at Cambridge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697731.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697731-e-004|title=The Development of Artefact Studies|last=Swift|first=Ellen|date=2016-09-01|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697731.013.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a Founding Fellow of [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb1932-lcca%2Flp5|title=Papers of Joan Liversidge - Archives Hub|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work was focussed on artefactual and artistic evidence. Liversidge took a social history approach to Roman Britain which was undervalued in subsequent decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As with the undervaluing of her social history approach, her findings that several Roman villas in Britain ([[Box, Wiltshire#History|Box]], [http://www.bradfordonavonmuseum.co.uk/atworth-villa Atworth], East Grinstead, Stroud, and [https://www.titsey.org/history Titsey]) were of more than one storey in height were overshadowed by assertions of [[R. G. Collingwood|R.G.Collingwood]] and [[Ian Richmond]] that such structures had only one story, but re-evaluations in 1982 found that such buildings could be of greater height.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, D.S.

British Archaeological Report: Oxford p.153-171&lt;/ref&gt;

She was secretary of the [[Cambridge Antiquarian Society]] for 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Joan Liversidge", ''The Times'', 24 February 1984, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal English''' is the type of [[English language|English]] as used in [[legal writing]]. In general, a legal language is a formalized language based on [[logic]] rules which differs from the ordinary [[natural language]] in [[vocabulary]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]], as well as other linguistic features,&lt;ref&gt;Wydick, 2005b, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to achieve [[consistency]], [[Validity (logic)|validity]], [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] and [[soundness]], while keeping the benefits of a human-like language such as intuitive execution, complete [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and open [[upgrade]]. However, Legal English has been referred to as a "sublanguage",&lt;ref&gt;Tiersma, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; as legal English differs from ordinary English. A specialized use of certain terms and linguistic patterns governs the teaching of legal language. Thus, "we study legal language as a kind of second language, a specialized use of vocabulary, phrases, and syntax that helps us to communicate more easily with each other".&lt;ref&gt;Ramsfield, 2005, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''legal[[wikt:-ese|ese]]&lt;!--redirect--&gt;''', on the other hand, is a [[pejorative]] term associated with a traditional style of legal writing that is part of this specialized discourse of lawyers: communication that "lay readers cannot readily comprehend".&lt;ref&gt;Oates &amp; Enquist, 2009, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; This term describes poor legal writing that is cluttered, wordy, indirect, and that includes unnecessary technical words or phrases.&lt;ref name="Butler201332"&gt;Bain Butler, 2013, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, legalese is language a lawyer might use in drafting a contract or a pleading but would not use in ordinary conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Oates &amp; Enquist, 2009, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the traditional style of legal writing has been labeled reader-unfriendly.&lt;ref name="Butler201332"/&gt; Proponents of [[Plain English|plain language]] argue that legal "writing style should not vary from task to task or audience to audience...; whatever lawyers write must be Clear, Correct, Concise, and Complete".&lt;ref name="Wydick2005b3"&gt;Wydick, 2005b, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; These 4 Cs describe "characteristics of good legal writing style" in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wydick2005b3"/&gt;

There are different kinds (genres) of legal writing: for example, (a) academic legal writing as in law journals, (b) juridical legal writing as in court judgments, and (c) legislative legal writing as in laws, regulations, contracts, and treaties.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Another variety is the language used by lawyers to communicate with clients requiring a more "reader-friendly" style of written communication than that used with law professionals.&lt;ref name="Goddard2010"&gt;Goddard, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

For lawyers operating internationally, communicating with clients and other professionals across cultures requires a need for transnational [[legal awareness]] and transcultural linguistic awareness.&lt;ref name="Goddard2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bain Butler, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the form of legal writing, legal skills and language skills form a vital part of higher education and professional training.&lt;ref&gt;Bain Butler, 2013, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal English has particular relevance when applied to [[legal writing]] and the [[Draft document|drafting of written material]], including:
* legal documents: contracts, [[licence]]s, etc.
* [[Pleading|court pleadings]]: [[summons]]es, [[Brief (law)|briefs]], [[judgments]], etc.
* laws: [[Acts of Parliament]] and subordinate [[legislation]], case reports
* legal correspondence

Legal English has traditionally been the preserve of lawyers from [[List of countries where English is an official language|English-speaking countries]] (especially the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Kenya]], and [[South Africa]]) which have shared common law traditions. However, due to the spread of Legal English as the predominant language of [[international business]], as well as its role as a legal language within the [[European Union]], Legal English is now a global [[phenomenon]]. It may informally be referred to as '''lawspeak'''.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Historical development==
Modern legal English is based on [[standard English]]. Modern legal English contains, however, a number of unusual features. These features largely relate to [[terminology]], linguistic structure, linguistic conventions, and [[punctuation]], and have their roots in the [[History of the English language|history of the development of English]] as a legal language.

In [[prehistoric Britain]], traditional common law was discussed in the vernacular (see [[Celtic law]]). The legal language and legal tradition changed with waves of conquerors over the following centuries. [[Roman Britain]] (after the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest]] beginning in AD 43) followed Roman legal tradition, and its legal language was Latin. Following the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] circa 410 and the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]], the dominant tradition was instead [[Anglo-Saxon law]], which was discussed in the Germanic vernacular (Anglo-Saxon, [[Old English]]), and written in Old English since circa 600, beginning with the [[Law of Æthelberht]]. Following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of England in 1066]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] became the official language of legal proceedings in England for a period of nearly 300 years until the [[Pleading in English Act 1362]] (and continued in minor use for another 300 years), while [[Medieval Latin]] was used for written records for over 650 years. Some English technical terms were retained, however (see [[Anglo-Saxon law#Language and dialect|Anglo-Saxon law: Language and dialect]] for details).

In legal pleadings, Anglo-Norman developed into [[Law French]], from which many words in modern legal English are derived. These include ''property'', ''estate'', ''chattel'', ''lease'', ''executor'', and ''tenant''. The use of Law French during this period had an enduring influence on the general [[Register (sociolinguistics)|linguistic register]] of modern legal English. That use also accounts for some of the complex linguistic structures used in legal writing. In 1362, the [[Statute of Pleading]] was enacted, which stated that all legal proceedings should be conducted in English (but recorded in Latin). This marked the beginning of formal Legal English; Law French continued to be used in some forms into the 17th century, although Law French became increasingly degenerate.

From 1066, [[Latin]] was the language of formal records and [[statutes]], and was replaced by English in the [[Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730]]. However, because only learned persons were fluent in Latin, it never became the language of legal pleading or debate. The influence of Latin can be seen in a number of words and phrases such as ''[[ad hoc]]'', ''[[de facto]]'', ''[[bona fide]]'', ''inter alia'', and ''[[ultra vires]],'' which remain in current use in legal writing (see [[Legal Latin]]).

===Style===
In 2004, [[David Crystal]] proposed a stylistic influence upon English legal language. During the [[Medieval]] period, lawyers used a mixture of [[Latin]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. To avoid ambiguity, lawyers often offered [[legal doublet|pairs of words]] from different languages. Sometimes there was little ambiguity to resolve and the pairs merely gave greater emphasis, becoming a stylistic habit. This is a feature of legal style that continues to the present day. Examples of mixed language doublets are: "breaking and entering" (English/French), "fit and proper" (English/French), "lands and tenements" (English/French), and "will and testament" (English/Latin). Examples of English-only doublets are "let and hindrance" and "have and hold".

Modern English vocabulary draws significantly from Germanic languages, French, and Latin, the lattermost often by way of French. These vocabularies are used preferentially in different registers, with words of French origin being more formal than those of Germanic origin, and words of Latin origin being more formal than those of French origin. Thus, the extensive use of French and Latin words in Legal English results in a relatively formal style.

Further, legal English is useful for its dramatic effect: for example, a [[subpoena]] compelling a witness to appear in court often ends with the archaic threat "Fail not, at your peril"; the "peril" isn't described (being arrested and held in [[contempt of court]]) but the formality of the language tends to have a stronger effect on the recipient of the subpoena than a simple statement like "We can arrest you if you don't show up".

Whereas legal language in the Medieval period combined Latin, French, and English to avoid ambiguity. According to Walter Probert, judicial lawyers, roughly starting in the twentieth century, often manipulate the language to be more persuasive of their campaign ideals.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6975&amp;context=penn_law_review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2011}}
As noted above, legal English differs greatly from standard English in a number of ways. The most important of these differences are as follows:

* Use of [[Technical terminology|terms of art]]. Legal English, in common with the language used by other trades and professions, employs a great deal of technical terminology which is unfamiliar to the [[layman]] (e.g. ''[[waiver]], [[restraint of trade]], [[restrictive covenant]], [[Estoppel|promissory estoppel]]''). Much of this vocabulary is derived from French and Latin.
* These terms of art include ordinary words used with special meanings. For example, the familiar term ''[[consideration]]'' refers, in legal English, to [[contract]]s, and means, ''an act, forbearance or promise by one party to a contract that constitutes the price for which the promise of the other party is bought'' (Oxford Dictionary of Law). Other examples are ''construction, prefer, redemption, furnish, hold,'' and ''find''.
* Lack of [[punctuation]]. One aspect of archaic legal drafting – particularly in conveyances and [[deed]]s – is the conspicuous absence of punctuation. This arose from a widespread idea among lawyers that punctuation was ambiguous and unimportant, and that the meaning of legal documents was contained only in the words used and their context. In some situations punctuation is omitted simply because it can be added undetectably to a document after it comes into effect, altering its meaning, so the view was, and still sometimes is, that a safer course is to omit punctuation altogether so that, if any should appear, it is apparent that it has been added later to change the meaning of the document, possibly fraudulently. In modern legal drafting, punctuation is often used, in the hope that clarifies [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butt|first1=Peter|last2=Castle|first2=Richard|title=Modern Legal Drafting: A Guide to Using Clearer Language|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521001861|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of [[Legal doublet|doublets and triplets]]. As noted above, the mix of languages used in early legalese led to the tendency in legal English to string together two or three words to convey what is usually a single legal concept. Examples of this are ''null and void, fit and proper, (due) care and attention, perform and discharge, terms and conditions, dispute, controversy or claim,'' and ''promise, agree and covenant''. While originally being done to help all lawyers no matter which vocabulary they might use (English, French, or Latin) it now sometimes repeats words used mean exactly the same thing, and has become a stylistic standard for other legal concepts (''dispute, controversy or claim'', ''search and seizure'').
* Unusual [[word order]]. At times, the word order used in legal documents appears distinctly strange. For example, ''the provisions for termination hereinafter appearing'' or ''will at the cost of the borrower forthwith comply with the same''. There is no single clear reason for this, although the influence of [[French grammar|French grammatical structures]] is certainly a contributory factor.
* Use of unfamiliar [[pro-form]]s. For example, ''the same, the said, the aforementioned'' etc. The use of such terms in legal texts is interesting since very frequently they do not replace the noun – which is the whole purpose of pro-forms – but are used as adjectives to modify the noun. For example, ''the said John Smith''.
* Use of [[pronominal adverbs]].  Words like ''hereof, thereof,'' and ''whereof'' (and further derivatives, including ''-at, -in, -after, -before, -with, -by, -above, -on, -upon'') are not often used in ordinary modern English. They are used in legal English primarily to avoid repeating names or phrases. For example, ''the parties hereto'' instead of ''the parties to this contract''.
* ''-er, -or,'' and ''-ee'' name endings. Legal English contains some words and titles, such as employer and employee; lessor and lessee, in which the reciprocal and opposite nature of the relationship is indicated by the use of alternative endings.
* Use of [[phrasal verbs]]. Phrasal verbs play a large role in legal English, as they do in standard English, and are often used in a quasi-technical sense. For example, ''parties '''enter into''' contracts, '''put down''' deposits, '''serve''''' [documents] '''''upon''' other parties, '''write off''' debts, '''attend at''' locations'', and so on.

==Education==
{{More citations needed|date=June 2007}}
Because of the prevalence of the English language in international business relations, as well as, its role as a legal language globally, a feeling has existed for a long period in the international legal community that traditional English language training is not sufficient to meet lawyers’ English language requirements. The main reason for this is that such training generally ignores the ways in which English usage may be modified by the particular demands of legal practice – and by the conventions of legal English as a separate branch of English in itself.

As a result, non-native English speaking legal professionals and law students increasingly seek specialist training in legal English, and such training is now provided by law schools, language centres,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cambridgelawstudio.co.uk/|title=Home|date=2012-03-19|work=Cambridge Law Studio|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; private firms and podcasts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://studylegalenglish.com/|title=The Study Legal English Podcast|last=|first=|date=|website=Study Legal English|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focus on legal language. The UK [[TOLES]] examination was set up to teach legal English to non-native English speakers. The exams focus on the aspects of legal English noted as lacking by lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toles.co.uk/pages/toles-and-other-legal-english-exams.php|title=Legal English TOLES Exam English For Lawyers|work=TOLES|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual [[Global Legal Skills Conference]] was also established as a forum for professors of Legal English and other skills professionals to exchange information on teaching methods and materials.&lt;ref&gt;http://glsc.jmls.edu/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3384">'''Lincoln/Net''' is a [[digital history]] project created by the [[Abraham Lincoln]] Historical Digitization Project, based at [[Northern Illinois University]] in [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]], [[Illinois]]. It preserves (in digital format) and provides access to primary documents relating to Lincoln's time in Illinois (1830-1861) as well as documents from the early years of Illinois' statehood. The historical materials include books, manuscripts, images, speeches, writings, and other types of documents. There are over 30,000,000 words of searchable text and over 3,000 audio/visual artifacts. These items are supplemented by biographical information and  historical interpretations.

The archive materials can be accessed in a variety of ways. They are searchable using the site's search tool or you can browse by type of document. They have also been arranged thematically by the project staff, allowing users to explore a particular topic of interest. The themes included are: frontier settlement; Native American relations; economic development; women's experience and gender roles; African-Americans' experience and American racial attitudes; law and society; religion and culture; and political development. Each of these themes is accompanied by an essay which provides historical context and interpretation for the associated documents.

This project brought together and digitized materials from the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Newberry Library]], the [[Chicago Historical Society]], [[Illinois State University]], the [[Illinois State Archives]], [[Lewis University]], and [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]]. Work on the project was done collaboratively by a large group of people, including nearly 80 student assistants. [[Drew VandeCreek|Drew E. VandeCreek]] is the Project Director.

The holiday was first observed in 1921, during the [[First Red Scare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:U5H82eALRQQJ:www.wausaudailyherald.com/wdhlocal/285353761408034.shtml+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209032026/http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:U5H82eALRQQJ:www.wausaudailyherald.com/wdhlocal/285353761408034.shtml+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 9, 2012 |last=Conn |first=Matt |title=Loyalty Day celebration set for return to Medford |date=March 24, 2004 |newspaper=Wausau Daily Herald |location= Wausau, Wisconsin |publisher=Gannett}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "Americanization Day,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patriotic Days |url=https://www.vfw.org/community/community-initiatives/patriotic-days |website=VFW Veterans of Foreign Wars |access-date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was intended to replace the May&amp;nbsp;1 ("[[May Day]]") celebration of the [[International Workers' Day]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-0429-loyalty-day-20160429-story.html |title=Not to be a downer, but here's a reality check on 'Loyalty Day' |type=Editorial |accessdate=1 May 2017|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which commemorates the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A short history of May Day |url=http://libcom.org/history/1886-haymarket-martyrs-mayday |website=Libcom.org |date=September 11, 2006 |access-date=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''M.D.''''' was a short lived [[comic book]] published by [[EC Comics]] in 1955, the sixth title in its ''New Direction'' line. The bi-monthly comic was published by [[Bill Gaines]] and edited  by [[Al Feldstein]]. It lasted a total of five issues before being cancelled along with EC's other ''New Direction'' comics.

==Content==
''M.D.'' focused on medical stories, surgical practices and the day-to-day work of doctors. Each issue featured four stories, plus at least one text piece about a real-life major medical figure.

The frontispiece to the first issue set out its role:
{{cquote|This magazine, ''M.D.'', is the sixth of E.C.'s "New Direction" publications. It is dedicated to Mankind's tireless and unceasing battle against disease and to the man who fights that never-ending battle day after day after day... your Family Doctor... your M.D.

But although the M.D. is the protagonist in this magazine, he is not necessarily the hero! The ''real'' hero is the man, woman, or child who enters into the M.D.'s stirring and grim world of real medicine to seek out the help and relief his wisdom and experience can give.

This, then, is the theme of ''M.D.'' It will contain stories of ''people''... people who are helped by their Family Doctor and his associates in the Medical Profession. It will deal frankly and honestly with the diseases and misfortunes that beset people. It will deal graphically and candidly with the treatment they receive. At times, its stories will be poignant... at time they will be sad... at times they will be grim. But at all times, they will be ''true to life!''

And now, because we feel it best epitomizes the ideals of the Medical Profession, we, the editors of ''M.D.'' offer the view taken by all M.D.'s... "The Hippocratic Oath":}}
...the [[Hippocratic Oath]] was then reprinted in full.

The [[letters page]] (upon the first of which the above text appeared in lieu of early letters) was titled "The Needles", and contributors to ''M.D.'' include [[Graham Ingels]], [[Marie Severin]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[Reed Crandall]] and [[Carl Wessler]].

==Reprints==
''M.D.'' was reprinted as part of publisher [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]]'s ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#The Complete EC Library|Complete EC Library]]'' collection, alongside ''[[Valor (EC Comics)|Valor]]'' and ''[[Impact (EC Comics)|Impact]]'' as Volume 2 of the "New Direction Part 2" slipcased set (1985). Between September 1999 and January 2000, Cochran and [[Gemstone Publishing]] reprinted the five individual issues. This complete run was later rebound, with covers included, in a single softcover ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#EC Annuals|EC Annual]]''.

A '''majority–minority''' or '''minority–majority''' area is a term used in the United States to refer to a [[sub-national jurisdiction|jurisdiction]] in which one or more racial and/or [[ethnic minorities]] (relative to the whole country's population) make up a majority of the local population. The term is often used in [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] law to designate voting districts which are altered under the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]] to enable ethnic or language minorities "the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice."&lt;ref&gt;United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144 97 S.Ct. 996 (Supreme Court of the United States March 01, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, the term is first used by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144 97 S.Ct. 996 (Supreme Court of the United States March 01, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had previously used the term in employment discrimination and labor relations cases.&lt;ref&gt;Sledge (Harrison) v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., Not Reported in F.Supp. 1975 WL 278 (United States District Court;  E.D. North Carolina, Wilson Division. December 22, 1975); Winchester Spinning Corp. v. N. L. R.

In the United States of America '''majority–minority''' or '''minority–majority''' area is a [[United States state]] or jurisdiction whose population is composed of less than 50% [[non-Hispanic whites]]. Racial data is derived from self-identification questions on the [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] and on [[U.S. Census Bureau]] estimates. (See [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census]]).

*Five states are majority–minority as of 2016: [[Hawaii]] (which is the only state that has never had a white majority), [[New Mexico]], [[California]], [[Texas]] and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. whites will soon be the minority in number, but not power - Baltimore Sun|periodical=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-op-0809-minority-majority-20170808-story.html|format=|accessdate=2018-01-21|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8902484/ |title=Minority population surging in Texas |date=August 18, 2005 |work=msnbc.com |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demographics of these states changed markedly from the 1890s through the 1950s, as two waves of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] led more than 6,500,000 African-Americans to abandon the economically depressed, segregated Deep South in search of better employment opportunities and living conditions, first in Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, and later west to California. One-fifth of Florida's Black population had left the state by 1940, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;Maxine D. Rogers, et al., ''Documented History of the Incident Which Occurred at Rosewood, Florida in January 1923'', December 1993, p.5 {{cite web|url=http://mailer.fsu.edu/~mjones/rosewood/rosewood.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515152951/http://mailer.fsu.edu/~mjones/rosewood/rosewood.html |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |df= }}, March 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the last thirty years of the twentieth century into the twenty-first century, scholars have documented a reverse [[New Great Migration]] of Blacks back to southern states, but typically to destinations in the [[New South]], which have the best jobs and developing economies.&lt;ref name=NewGM/&gt;

The District of Columbia, one of the magnets for Great Migration Blacks, was long the sole majority–minority federal jurisdiction in the continental U.S. The Black proportion has declined since the 1990s due to [[gentrification]] and expanding opportunities, with many Blacks moving to suburban Maryland and others migrating to jobs in states of the [[New South]] in [[New Great Migration|a reverse of the Great Migration]].&lt;ref name=NewGM&gt;William H.

At the same time, Asian and Hispanic populations have increased in the District, keeping it a majority–minority area.

Since [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|1965]], [[wikt:foreign|foreign]] immigration has spurred increases in the number of majority–minority areas, most notably in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/tab19.pdf |title=Table 19. California – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1850 to 1990 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its legal resident population was 89.5% 'non-Hispanic white' in the 1940s, but in 2017 was estimated at 37.2% 'non-Hispanic white'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/06 | title=California: Population estimates, July 1, 2016, (V2016) | publisher=United States Census Bureau QuickFacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cities===
Many cities in the United States became majority–minority by 2010.&lt;ref name="census1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |title=Population Division Working Paper – Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990 – U.S. Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the top 15 cities by population, [[Jacksonville, Florida]] and [[Fort Worth, Texas]] are the only ones not classified as majority–minority.

===Data collection===
The first data for New Mexico was a 5% sample in 1940 which estimated non-Hispanic whites at 50.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/tab46.pdf |title=Table 46. New Mexico – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1850 to 1990 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanics do not constitute a race but an ethnic and cultural group: of respondents who listed Hispanic origin, some listed White race, roughly half gave responses tabulated under "Some other race" (e.g. giving a national origin such as "Mexican" or a designation such as "[[Mestizo]]" as race), and much smaller numbers listed Black, Native American, or Asian race.

In U.S. censuses since 1990, self-identification has been the primary way to identify race.  Presumption of race based on countries or regions given in the ancestry question is used only when a respondent has answered the ancestry question but not the race question. The U.S. Census currently defines "White people" very broadly as "people having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa,&lt;ref name="Wpop"&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-4.pdf The White Population: 2000], Census 2000 Brief C2KBR/01-4, U.S. Census Bureau, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. [[Caucasoid]]s. This definition has changed through the years.

Although the Census attempts to enumerate both [[United States nationality law|citizens and non-citizens]], the [[illegal immigrant population of the United States|undocumented immigrant population of the United States]] has proven hard to quantify; the census uses a 12,000,000 base estimate nationally. However, current estimates based on national surveys, administrative data and other sources of information indicate that the current population may range as high as 20-30,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Other uses===
{{see also|Religion in the United States|Hawaii#Religion}}
Normally, a state is considered to be majority–minority because of its ethnic/racial makeup, but other criteria is occasionally used, such as religion, disability, or age. For example, the majority of Utah residents are [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]], a Christian denomination that is a religious minority throughout the rest of the United States. In addition to Utah, Rhode Island and Louisiana, which have [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] majorities, are the only states in the U.S. where a single denomination constitutes a majority of the population. However, no U.S. state has a majority composed of any non-Christian group, except for Hawaii, where 51.1% of the population follow religions that would be non-mainstream in the rest of the United States. Hawaii is classified as religious majority of ''Unaffiliated'', including agnostics, [[atheism|atheists]], [[humanism|humanists]], the [[Irreligion|irreligious]], and [[Secularists]] (non-practicing).

===Criticism===
In January 2016, CUNY sociologist Richard Alba wrote an article in the American Prospect arguing that the way in which majority-minority calculations are made by the Census are misleading. Anyone with any Hispanic, Asian, or Black ancestry is seen as non-white, even if they also have white ancestry. Alba argues that the incomes, marriage patterns, and identities of people of who are mixed Hispanic-white and Asian-white are closer to those of white people than monoracial Hispanics or Asians. Thus, when the Census says that non-Hispanic whites are projected to be less than 50% of the population by the 2040s, people of mixed-race ancestry are improperly excluded from that category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/likely-persistence-white-majority-0|title=The Likely Persistence of a White Majority|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International applications==
While the concept exists in other nations, the exact term differs from place to place and language to language.

In many large, contiguous countries like China, there are many [[autonomous regions]] where a minority population is the majority. These regions are generally the result of historical population distributions, not because of recent immigration or recent differences in birth and fertility rates between various groups.

====Australia====
It is estimated that Europeans first outnumbered [[Indigenous Australians]] in Australia in the 1840s.{{Sfnp|Broome|1988|pp=102–103}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ross|last=Gittins|title=Maybe the colonialists were actually a minority|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/maybe-the-colonialists-didnt-outnumber-our-aboriginal-population-swiftly-20151224-gluntd.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 December 2015|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are still a number of rural and regional towns and communities where Indigenous Australians outnumber Europeans. [[Anglo-Celtic Australians]], who make up 74% of Australia's population, have become a minority in some of Sydney's [[Western Sydney|western suburbs]] in the late-twentieth century. [[Fairfield, New South Wales|Fairfield]] and [[Cabramatta]] in [[Fairfield City Council]], [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] and [[Bankstown]] in [[Canterbury-Bankstown Council]], and [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]] in [[Cumberland Council, New South Wales|Cumberland Council]], are one of the largest non-Anglo suburbs in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=census /&gt; Here is a list of the suburbs in Sydney's metropolitan area where non-Anglo ethnic groups are the majority:

*[[Vietnamese people]] are the majority in the [[Greater Western Sydney|greater western]] suburbs of Cabramatta,&lt;ref name=abs2011pop&gt;{{Census 2011 AUS|id=SSC10421|name=Cabramatta (State Suburb)|accessdate=April 29, 2013|quick=on}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canley Vale]], [[Canley Heights]], [[Carramar, New South Wales|Carramar]], [[Birrong]], and also in the suburbs of [[Fairfield East]], [[Fairfield West]], [[St Johns Park, New South Wales|St John's Park]], [[Bonnyrigg, New South Wales|Bonnyrigg]], [[Wakeley, New South Wales|Wakeley]] and [[Green Valley, New South Wales|Green Valley]], which also have a large Assyrian community.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; Furthermore, people of Chinese ancestry are also significant in these suburbs.&lt;ref name=census /&gt;

==== Canada ====
* Unlike in the United States where there are five minority-majority states, none of the Canadian provinces are minority-majority. It must be noted that the definition of an ethnic minority differs between US and Canada, since, whereas in the US this term includes anyone who is either not White or who is Hispanic (Hispanic Whites are considered as minority), in Canada it is defined (by the [[Employment Equity Act]], used by [[Statistics Canada]]) as "persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour." Thus, (a) Aboriginals are considered majority, (b) Hispanic whites are considered majority, but (c) non-white Arabs and West Asians are considered a minority, even if Caucasian in race. However, the numbers are not close, so this difference does not bear any practical significance except for the territory of [[Nunavut]], which would be minority-majority if the US-style definition of racial minority were to be applied (24,875 of 29,325 residents are Inuit).
* The province with the highest proportion of visible minorities (2006 Census) is British Columbia (24.8%), followed by Ontario (22.8%). This means that in no Canadian province has the percentage of the racial majority (Aboriginals + White Caucasians) yet fallen under 75%.
* No census metropolitan area (CMA) is minority–majority yet. However, [[Greater Toronto Area|Toronto]] and [[Metro Vancouver|Vancouver]] CMAs are on the tip of becoming such; in particular, according to the 2006 Census, the Toronto CMA has 42.9% of visible minorites, while the Vancouver CMA has 41.7% of visible minorities. These are the only metropolitan areas in Canada where the percentage of the racial majority has fallen under 60%. Taking into account the 20 largest census metropolitan areas, [[Calgary Region|Calgary]] comes a distant third with 22.2%.
* Racial or "[[visible minorities]]" (as they are known in Canada) are the majority in Vancouver, and Toronto. 
*The [[Toronto]] district of [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] has a population made up of 67.4% [[visible minorities]]; all but one of the ten Scarborough wards are visible-minority-majority, of which, in particular, Scarborough-Agincourt and Scarborough-Rouge River are Chinese-majority (53.4% and 57.3% respectively; 83.7% and 87.8% respectively for all visible minorities). Likewise, 19 of 25 Scarborough neighbourhoods (as designated by the City of Toronto) are visible-minority-majority. For purposes of contradistinction, in the "Old" (pre-amalgamation) City of Toronto, 68% of the population are white Caucasian (or Aboriginal) and the visible-minority-majority neighbourhoods are five in a total of 44 neighbourhoods (Regent Park, North St. James Town, Bay Street Corridor, Kensington-Chinatown, and Parkdale).
* The [[Toronto]] suburbs of [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] (77.93%) and [[Brampton]] (73.31%) also have a minority–majority population, of primarily Chinese and East Indian ethnic origin respectively.
* The [[Vancouver]] suburbs of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] (76.3%) and [[Burnaby]] (63.6%) also have a minority-majority population, of primarily Chinese ethnic origin in both cases.
* The [[French Canadian|French linguistic minority]] is the majority in the province of Quebec (79.0% have French as their mother tongue, according to the 2006 Census), and has been since before [[Canadian Confederation]].
* The province of Saskatchewan may also have an [[Aboriginal people in Canada|Aboriginal]] majority by 2050, according to some research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.uregina.ca/sipp/documents/pdf/Dr.%20Howe's%20Paper.pdf | title=Saskatchewan with an Aboriginal Majority: Education and Entrepreneurship | date=April 2006 | author=Eric C.

* Regarding religion (2001 Census data), Quebec and New Brunswick have a Roman Catholic majority, while Newfoundland and Labrador and [[Nunavut]] have a Protestant majority. In the other provinces and territories, no denomination exceeds the 50% mark; however, Protestants are the largest denomination first in all provinces and territories except only Prince Edward Island and [[Northwest Territories]] where Catholics are the largest denomination. No other Christian denomination, other religion, or lack of religious affiliation as first or second in any province or territory.

===Brazil===
[[File:Brancos no Brasil.png|thumb|left|100px|Brazilian states according to the percentage of [[Whites]] in 2009.]]
Brazil has become a majority "non-White" country as of the 2010 census,&lt;ref name="miher"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cps.fgv.br/cps/bd/clippings/nc0670.pdf | title=For the first time, blacks outnumber whites in Brazil. | work=The Miami Herald | date=May 24, 2011 | author=Barnes, Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the [[States of Brazil|federative units]] of [[Espírito Santo]], the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], [[Goiás]], and [[Minas Gerais]].

Those identifying as White declined to 47.7% (about 91 million people) in the 2010 census from 52.9% (about 93 million people) in 2000 in the entire country.&lt;ref name="miher"/&gt; However, in Brazil, this is not simply a matter of origin and birthrate, but identity changes as well. The Black minority did not enlarge its representation in the population to more than 1.5% in the period, while it was mostly the growth in the number of ''pardo'' people (~38% in 2000, 42.4% in 2010) that caused the demographic plurality of Brazil.

===Bulgaria===
[[File:Ethnic composition of Bulgaria, 2011.PNG|thumb|right|200px|The green areas have an ethnic Turkish majority or plurality, while the pink and light red areas have an ethnic Bulgarian plurality but not a majority.]]

SPOHP director Paul Ortiz began conducting oral history field work in the Mississippi Delta in 1995 as a graduate research coordinator of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]-sponsored "Behind the Veil: Documenting African American Life in the Jim Crow South" project at the Center for Documentary Studies, and maintained a relationship with the Sunflower County Civil Rights Organization, a local civil rights veteran group. Since 2008, the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program has traveled to the Delta on annual research trips with undergraduate students, graduate students, and program staff for the Mississippi Freedom Project to collect oral histories of the local movement.&lt;ref name="oralhistoryforsocialchange.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oralhistoryforsocialchange.org/blog/2014/5/13/uf-oral-history-program-digs-deep-in-the-delta|title=UF Oral History Program Digs Deep in the Delta|author= Sarah Blanc|date=2014-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_61ca00ee-1c4c-11df-97aa-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Presentation relives civil rights memories|first=ANDREW WYZAN, Alligator Contributing|last=Writer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, SPOHP returned to the Delta on its annual trip for 50th anniversary celebrations honoring movement veterans of Freedom Summer from June 23–29.&lt;ref name="Gainesville14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/mfp/delta-research-trip/|title=Delta Research Trip »  Samuel Proctor Oral History Program » University of Florida|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mississippi Freedom Project oral history collections focus on history of the civil rights movement in the [[Mississippi Delta]] from veteran activists and notable residents. In Summer 2013, UF's [[George A. Smathers Libraries]] approved a mini-grant proposal to transcribe the SPOHP's Mississippi Freedom Project collection. The grant improved online access to the Mississippi Freedom Project collection, sponsoring the processing of over 50 interviews, creation of educational podcasts, and development of expanded online media content. Over 70 interviews are now available as of July 2014, timed to coincide with Freedom Summer anniversaries.&lt;ref name="Gainesville14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00019512|title=Mississippi Freedom Project Interviews to be Available on University of Florida Digital Collections for MLK Celebration, Freedom Summer Anniversary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/freedom/|title=UFDC Home - Mississippi Delta Freedom Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native Point''' ([[Inuktitut]]: ''Tunirmiut''&lt;ref&gt;Issenman, Betty. ''Sinews of Survival: The living legacy of Inuit clothing''. UBC Press, 1997. pp252-254&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Tuneriut'') is a peninsula in [[Kivalliq Region]], [[Nunavut]], [[Canada]]. It is located on [[Southampton Island]]'s [[Bell Peninsula]] at the mouth of [[Native Bay]]. It is notable for being the location of an abandoned [[Sallirmiut|Sadlermiut]] settlement, currently an archaeological site.

==Archaeological site==
The [[Sallirmiut|Sadlermiut]] settlement, situated on the west side of the point, was abandoned after the Sadlermiut became extinct during the winter between 1902 and 1903. Now a notable [[archeological site]], it is referred to as "T1" because of the [[Inuktitut]] name, "Tuneriut", for Native Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eskimo Prehistory|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1964|pages=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZC0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22native+point%22+%22southampton+island%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=%22native%20point%22%20%22southampton%20island%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; T1 is the largest Sadlermiut site on the island.&lt;ref name="edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mailhub.edu.nu.ca/kivalliq/orientation/CoralHarbour.html|title=History|publisher=edu.nu.ca|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material culture of the Sadlermiut were limited to chipped [[stone tool]]s and various manufactured organic artifacts. Among the artifacts found in the site were human figurines called ''aarnguaq'', which was probably used for a healing ritual. This indicates that the Sadlermiut were [[Shamanism|shamanistic]]. In addition, multiple human remains were found on the site. Merbs and Wilson grouped the burials intro three series, each with chronological significance: the "village" graves, which were thought to be the oldest, "peripheral" burials located northeast and southeast of the settlement which were given of intermediate age, and a series of "meat-cache" graves, suggested to primarily represent casualties from the 1902-1903 epidemic which decimated the Sadlermiut population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryan |first1=Karen |last2=Young |first2=Janet |title=Identification of a probable aarnguaq in a Sadlermiut grave from Native Point, Southampton island, Nunavut, Canada |journal=Arctic Anthropology |date=2013 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=22–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Newton Jasper Earp''' (October 7, 1837 – December 18, 1928) was the eldest child of [[Nicholas Porter Earp]] and Abigail Storm.  He was the half-brother of [[Old West]] lawmen [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]], and [[Morgan Earp]].

==Early life and Civil War service==
Newton was born in [[Ohio County, Kentucky]], to Nicholas Earp and his first wife, Abigail Storm. Newton Earp, and half-brothers [[James Earp|James]] and Virgil, were close for their entire lives. He married Jennie (last name unknown) in 1854. She died before 1887.&lt;ref name=eagle/&gt; He ran against his younger half-brother Wyatt for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wyattearp.net/marriage.html |title= Marriage to Urilla Sutherland |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |first1=Steve|last1=Gatto }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Earp enlisted in the [[Union Army]] (along with both James and Virgil) on November 11, 1861. Earp served with Company F of the [[4th Regiment Iowa Volunteer Cavalry|Fourth Cavalry, Iowa Volunteers]].&lt;ref name=eagle/&gt;

He was promoted to fourth sergeant on January 1, 1865. His brother James was badly wounded in a battle near [[Fredericktown, Missouri]] and returned home only months after his enlistment. Virgil and Newton, however, served the entire war. Newton mustered out of the Army on June 26, 1865 in Louisville, Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footnote.com/page/386/civil-war-pension-index-cards-of-newton-earp,-james-earp,-and-virgil-earp./  ''Newton Earp card'']; Original Document; Civil War Pension Index Card;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eagle&gt;[http://www.pictures.eaglefreeenterprises.com/newton_earp.htm ''Newton Earp '']; picture archival webpage; Eagle Free Enterprises; accessed May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Civil-War==
After Earp's return from the [[American Civil War]], he married Nancy Jane Adam in [[Marion County, Missouri]] on 12 Sep 1865.&lt;ref name="Missouri Marriages, 1750-1920"&gt;{{cite web|title=Missouri Marriages, 1750-1920|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V285-|website=FamilySearch|ref=Marion,Missouri; FHL microfilm 980,297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newlyweds then joined his father and siblings in [[San Bernardino, California]] in southern California, where most of the family had relocated. There, Newton worked as a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] manager.&lt;ref name=eagle/&gt;

Earp and family returned to the Midwest in 1868, first settling in [[Lamar, Missouri]], where Earp took up farming. The family later relocated to Kansas. The Earps had five children: Effie May, Wyatt Clyde, Mary Elizabeth, Alice Abigail, and Virgil Edwin. They named their first-born son (born on August 25, 1872) after his not-yet-famous younger brother, [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]]; and their second son (born April 19, 1880) after his younger brother, [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]].&lt;ref name=eagle/&gt;

==Later life and death==
Following another relocation to California, Newton became a carpenter, building homes in northern California and northwestern Nevada. Daughter Effie May and wife Jennie both died on March 29, 1898 in Paradise Hill, Nevada, also known as [[Paradise Valley, Nevada|Paradise Valley]]. Newton died at age 91 in [[Sacramento, California]] on December 18, 1928. Only his brother Wyatt survived him, with Wyatt dying almost a month later on January 13, 1929. He is buried in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]'s [[East Lawn Memorial Park]] Cemetery.&lt;ref name=eagle/&gt;

{{Music eras}}
'''''Prehistoric music''''' (previously '''''primitive music''''') is a term in the [[history of music]] for all [[music]] produced in [[literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Geological history of the Earth|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in different parts of the world, but still exists in isolated areas. However, it is more common to refer to the "prehistoric" music which still survives as [[folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. Prehistoric music is studied alongside other periods within [[music archaeology]]. 

Findings from [[Paleolithic]] archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found [[Paleolithic flutes]] carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The [[Divje Babe flute]], carved from a [[cave bear]] [[femur]], is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of [[String instrument|stringed instruments]], such as the [[Ravanahatha]], have been recovered from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN8170173329&amp;id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments&amp;sig=0baqFLb6KItfPYLoCdFWFTCD8Sk ''The Music of India''] By Reginald MASSEY, Jamila MASSEY. Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world—references to [[Indian classical music]] (''marga'') are found in the [[Vedas]], ancient scriptures of the [[Hindu]] tradition.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=RE|year=1971|title=India's Music|journal=Readings in Ethnomusicology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in [[China]] and dates back to between 7000 and 6600&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="wilkinson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Endymion |authorlink=Endymion Wilkinson|title=Chinese history|publisher=Harvard University Asia Center|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Tone|section|date=August 2013}}

Some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt; It may also serve entertainment (game)&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; or practical functions (for example, luring animals in hunt)&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;.

Another possible origin of music is [[motherese]], the vocal-gestural communication between mothers and infants. This form of communication involves melodic, rhythmic and movement patterns as well as the communication of intention and meaning, and in this sense is similar to music.&lt;ref&gt;Dissanayake, E. (2000). Antecedents of the temporal arts in early mother-infant interaction. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 389-410. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pg 389-410&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller suggests musical displays play a role in "demonstrating fitness to mate". Based on the ideas of [[honest signal]] and the [[handicap principle]], Miller suggested that music and dancing, as energetically costly activities, were to demonstrate the physical and psychological fitness of the [[singing]] and [[dancing]] individual to the prospective mates.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. (2000). Evolution of human music through sexual selection. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 329-360. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pg. 389-410&lt;/ref&gt;

Communal singing by both sexes occurs among [[cooperative breeding|cooperatively breeding]] [[songbird]]s of [[Australia]] and [[Africa]] such as [[Australian magpie|magpies]],&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Eleanor D. and Farabaugh, Susan M.; “Song Sharing in a Group-Living Songbird, the Australian Magpie, ''Gymnorhina tibicen''. Part III. Sex Specificity and Individual Specificity of Vocal Parts in Communal Chorus and Duet Songs” in ''Behaviour'', Vol. 118, No. 3/4 (September 1991), pp. 244-274&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[white-browed sparrow weaver]]&lt;ref&gt;Voigt, Cornelia; Leitner, Stefan and Gahr, Manfred; [http://vogelwarte.mpg.de/documents/leitner/Behaviour2.pdf “Repertoire and structure of duet and solo songs in cooperatively breeding white-browed sparrow weavers”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628235710/http://vogelwarte.mpg.de/documents/leitner/Behaviour2.pdf |date=2007-06-28 }} in ''Behaviour''; Vol. 143, No. 2 (February 2006), pp. 159-182&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Prehistoric musical instruments==

It is likely that the first [[musical instrument]] was the [[human voice]] itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from [[singing]], [[Hum (sound)|hum]]ming and [[whistling]] through to [[Click consonant|click]]ing, [[cough]]ing and [[yawn]]ing. (See Darwin’s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' on music and speech.)

Most likely the first rhythm instruments or [[percussion instruments]] involved the [[clapping]] of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to create [[rhythm]] and there are examples of musical instruments which date back as far as the [[paleolithic]], although there is some ambiguity &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705110132/http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over archaeological finds which can be variously interpreted as either musical or non-musical instruments/tools. Examples of paleolithic objects which are considered unambiguously musical are bone flutes or pipes; paleolithic finds which are open to interpretation are pierced [[phalanges]] (usually interpreted as "phalangeal [[whistle]]s"), objects interpreted as [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], and [[rasp]]s.

Music can be theoretically traced to prior to the [[Paleolithic]] age, the [[anthropological]] and [[archaeological]] designation suggests that music first arose (among humans) when stone tools first began to be used by [[Hominidae|hominid]]s. The [[noise]]s produced by work such as pounding seed and roots into meal is a likely source of rhythm created by early humans.

The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered in [[Wicklow]], [[Ireland]], in the winter of 2003. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://Flutopedia.com/dev_flutes_euroasia.htm#Wicklow_Pipes |title=The Wicklow Pipes / The Development of Flutes in Europe and Asia|author=Clint Goss |year=2012 |work=Flutopedia |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, several [[Gudi (instrument)|gudi]] (literally "bone flutes") were found in [[Jiahu]] in Henan Province, China. They date to about 6000 BCE. They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the [[red-crowned crane]]. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of [[Xia Zhi]] and six-note scale of [[Qing Shang]] of the ancient [[Chinese musical system]].

==Archaeoacoustic methodology==
The use of the term 'music' is problematic within prehistory. It may be that, as in the traditional music of much of sub-Saharan Africa, the concept of 'music' as we understand it was somewhat different. Many languages traditionally have terms for music that include dance, religion or cult. The context in which prehistoric music took place has also become a subject of much study, as the sound made by music in prehistory would have been somewhat different depending on the acoustics present. The field of [[archaeoacoustics]] uses acoustic techniques to explore prehistoric sounds, soundscapes and instruments, and has included the study of ringing rocks and lithophones, of the acoustics of ritual sites such as chamber tombs and stone circles, and the exploration of prehistoric instruments using acoustic testing. Such work has included acoustic field tests to capture and analyse the impulse response of archaeological sites; acoustic tests of lithophones or 'rock gongs'; and reconstructions of soundscapes as experimental archaeology.

An academic research network, the [http://ambpnetwork.wordpress.com/ Acoustics and Music of British Prehistory Research Network], has explored this field.

{{Further|Music of ancient Greece|Cycladic culture}}
On the island of [[Keros]] (Κέρος), two marble statues from the late [[Neolithic]] culture called [[Early Cycladic culture]] (2900-2000 BCE) were discovered together in a single grave in the 19th century. They depict a standing [[aulos|double flute]] player and a sitting musician playing a triangular-shaped [[lyre]] or [[harp]]. The harpist is approximately {{convert|23|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} high and dates to around 2700-2500 BCE. He expresses concentration and intense feelings and tilts his head up to the light. The meaning of these and many other figures is not known; perhaps they were used to ward off evil spirits or had religious significance or served as toys or depicted figures from [[mythology]].

{{Socialism sidebar |Variants}}

'''Reformism''' is a political doctrine advocating the [[reform]] of an existing system or institution instead of its abolition and replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/reformism | title=Reformism | author=Collins English Dictionary | year= | website= | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers | accessdate=8 August 2017 | quote= a doctrine or movement advocating reform, esp political or religious reform, rather than abolition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[socialist]] movement, reformism is the view that gradual changes through existing institutions can eventually lead to fundamental changes in a society’s [[Political system|political]] and [[economic system]]s. Reformism as a political tendency and hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that revolutionary upheaval is a necessary precondition for the structural changes necessary to transform a [[capitalist]] system to a qualitatively different socialist economic system.

As a doctrine, reformism is distinguished from the act of pragmatic reform: pragmatic reform aims to safeguard and permeate the status quo by preventing fundamental structural changes to it, whereas reformism posits that an accumulation of reforms can eventually lead to the emergence of entirely different economic and political systems than those of present-day capitalism and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today and Jesus followers | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | website= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are two types of reformism. One has no intention of bringing about socialism or fundamental economic change to society and is used to oppose such structural changes. The other is based on the assumption that while reforms are not socialist in themselves, they can help rally supporters to the cause of revolution by popularizing the cause of socialism to the working class.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate on the ability for [[social democratic]] reformism to lead to a socialist transformation of society is over a century old.

Reformism is criticized for being paradoxical: it seeks to overcome the existing economic system of capitalism, but it tries to improve the conditions of capitalism thereby making it appear more tolerable to society. According to [[Rosa Luxemburg]], under reformism, "(capitalism) is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm | title=Do We Support Reformist Demands? | author=Duncan Hallas | year=1973 | website=Controversy: Do we support reformist demands? | publisher=International Socialism | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Stan Parker of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] argues that reforms are a diversion of energy for socialists and are limited because they must adhere to the logic of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French social theorist [[Andre Gorz]] criticized reformism by advocating a third alternative to reformism and social revolution that he called "non-reformist reforms", specifically focused on structural changes to capitalism, as opposed to reforms for improve living conditions within capitalism or to prop it up through economic interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/363/do-we-need-reform-or-revolution |title=Do we need reform of revolution?|author=Lois Clifton |date=November 2011 |publisher=Socialist Review |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1875 [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) adopted a [[Gotha Program]] that proposed "every lawful means" on a way to a "socialist society" and was criticized by [[Karl Marx]] who considered the [[communist revolution]] a required step. One of the delegates to the SPD congress,  [[Eduard Bernstein]], expanded on the concept, proposing ''evolutionary socialism''. Bernstein was a leading [[social democracy|social democrat]] in Germany. Reformism was quickly targeted by [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]], with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemning Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Reform or Revolution?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm Rosa Luxemburg. ''Reform or Revolution'' (1900)]&lt;/ref&gt; While Luxemburg died in the [[German Revolution]], the reformists soon found themselves contending with the [[Bolsheviks]] and their satellite [[Communism|communist]] parties for the support of intellectuals and the [[working class]].

In 1959, the [[Godesberg Program]] (signed at a party convention in the West German capital of [[Bad Godesberg]]) marked the shift of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) from a Marxist program espousing an end to capitalism to a reformist one focused on social reform.

After [[Joseph Stalin]] consolidated power in the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Comintern]] launched a campaign against the Reformist movement by denouncing them as "[[Social fascism|social fascists]]".  According to ''[[The God that Failed]]'' by [[Arthur Koestler]], a former member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], the largest communist party in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Interwar period]], communists, aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], continued to consider the "social fascist" Social Democratic Party of Germany to be the real enemy in [[Germany]], even after the [[Nazi Party]] had gotten into power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler|Koestler, Arthur]]. ''[[The God That Failed]].'' Edited by [[Richard Crossman]]. Bantam Matrix, Tenth Edition. pp 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, reformists are seen as [[centre-left]]. Some social democratic parties, such as the Canadian [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, are still considered to be reformist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/dowson/ndp.html#3|title=The Socialist Vanguard and the New Democratic Party|last=Dowson|first=Ross|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformism in the British Labour Party==
The term was applied to elements within the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the 1950s and subsequently, on the party's right. [[Anthony Crosland]] wrote ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956) as a personal manifesto arguing for a reformulation of the term. For Crosland, the relevance of [[nationalization]] (or [[public ownership]]) for socialists was much reduced as a consequence of contemporary [[full employment]], [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] management of the economy and reduced [[capitalism|capitalist]] exploitation. In 1960, after the third successive defeat of his party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 General Election]] [[Hugh Gaitskell]] attempted to reformulate the original wording of [[Clause IV]] in the party's constitution, but proved unsuccessful.

Some of the younger followers of Gaitskell, principally [[Roy Jenkins]], [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] left the Labour Party in 1981 to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], but the central objective of the [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellites]] was eventually achieved by [[Tony Blair]] in his successful attempt to rewrite Clause IV in 1995.

The use of the term is distinguished from the [[gradualism]] associated with [[Fabianism]] (the ideology of the [[Fabian Society]]), which itself should not be seen as being in parallel with the revisionism associated with Bernstein and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, as originally the Fabians had explicitly rejected [[Marxism]].

The '''Research Centre in Cairo, Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw,''' (Polish: ''Stacja Badawcza Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego w Kairze'', Arabic: مركز البحوث بالقاهرة، المركز البولندي لآثار منطقة البحر الأبيض المتوسط جامعة وارسو, ''Markaz al-Bohouth bi Al-Qahira, Al-Markaz al-Bulandi lil-Athar Mintaqat al-Bahr al-Abyad al-Mutawassit Jami’at Warsu'') is the only Polish scientific research institution in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://naukawpolsce.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news,406092,nowy-dyrektor-jedynej-polskiej-placowki-naukowej-w-afryce-i-na-bliskim-wschodzie.html|title=Nowy dyrektor jedynej polskiej placówki naukowej w Afryce i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Zdziebłowski|first=Szymon|date=11 August 2015|work=Nauka w Polsce|access-date=2017-06-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has operated since 1959 in [[Cairo]]. The mission of the Research Centre is to develop and expand Polish research in the region, particularly in [[Nile|the Nile Valley]]. It is operated by the [[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]], an independent research institute of the [[University of Warsaw]]. The PCMA Cairo Research Centre is located in two buildings situated in close proximity to one another in the Cairo [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] district — in antiquity the centre of a religious cult and the location of the Egypt's reputedly largest temple.

== History ==
Polish archaeologists first started to work in [[Egypt]] during the times of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918-1939). [[Kazimierz Michałowski]], the founder of the Polish school of Mediterranean archaeology, initiated Polish research in Egypt, and joined as a field director a project of the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale|French Institute for Oriental Archaeology]] in Cairo (IFAO) at [[Edfu]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Od Edfu do Faras|last=Michałowski|first=Kazimierz|publisher=Wydawnictwa Artystyczne i Filmowe|year=1983|isbn=|location=Warsaw|pages=10, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was suspended after three seasons because of the outbreak of [[World War II|WWII]]. Twenty years later, despite the tense political situation in the Middle East, Polish archaeologists were back in Egypt. In 1956, they were granted a concession to explore [[Athribis|Tell Atrib]] in the suburbs of [[Banha|Benha]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/pl/wydarzenia/niepodpiete/stulecie-urodzin-k-michalowskiego/|title=Profesor Kazimierz Michałowski i polska szkoła archeologii śródziemnomorskiej|last=Pawlicki|first=Franciszek|date=|website=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but work did not begin until a year later due to the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Daszewski|first=Wiktor Andrzej|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=25 lat istnienia Stacji Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 Professor Michałowski established the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw in Cairo, which is still operated today under the name Research Center in Cairo.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Polish archaeologists facing new archaeological tasks, such as coordination of new research, preparing for publication the results of the excavations, contributing to the international [[UNESCO]] campaign to save [[Nubia]]n archaeological heritage, greatly benefitted from having a permanent location in Egypt&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1960 Polish archaeologists began excavations in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Kiss|first=Zolt|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=117|chapter=Alexandria. Past research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961–1964, led by Michałowski, they became an important part of the UNESCO campaign to save the archaeological heritage of [[Nubia]], which was to be inundated by the waters of the newly created artificial [[Lake Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/artykul/skarby-faras-ukryte-w-piaskach-pustyni|title=Skarby Faras ukryte w piaskach pustyni|last=Sural|first=Agnieszka|date=|website=culture.pl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Poles hit the Nubian lottery jackpot",'' reported the international press about the Polish discoveries at [[Faras]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even as the first season of excavation at Faras was in full swing, Michałowski was approached by the Egyptian authorities to take on the task of completing the restoration of the Upper Terrace of the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|Temple of Hatshepsut]] in [[Luxor]]. The work in [[Deir el-Bahari]] began in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Szafrański|first=Zbigniew|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=93|chapter=Deir el-Bahari. Temple of Hatshepsut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Michałowski headed the international committee of experts created by the Egyptian government to rescue the [[Abu Simbel temples|rock temples of Abu Simbel]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Polish Centre in Cairo was named after its founder by the Senate of the [[University of Warsaw]] on 21 December 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Białkowski|first=Grzegorz|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Wstęp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment and development into a reputed international archaeological institution is considered among his greatest achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadurska|first=Anna|date=1981|title=Nekrologi|url=|journal=Archaeologia|volume=32|pages=244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all, "''the current level of culture in any country is measured by whether it runs its own excavations in Egypt,"'' Michałowski used to say.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1980s saw a rapid development of archaeological research with the opening of new sites in Egypt as well as in other countries of the Middle East. This resulted in an administrative reorganization in 1986. The head office was moved to Warsaw, establishing the [[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]] of the University of Warsaw in Warsaw in charge of supervising the Research Centre in Cairo as its main branch, as well as all the Polish archaeological missions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Near East and Northeastern Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, there was a dozen or so Polish archaeological missions working in Egypt. Every year several hundred Polish researchers of different specialties, not only archaeologists, from different Polish and foreign scientific institutions participate in research in Egypt.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of the Research Centre in Cairo are as follows:
* to ensure the efficient progress of archaeological and restoration work carried out by Polish missions in Egypt;
* to represent Polish researchers, archaeologists and conservators, to the Egyptian authorities responsible for antiquities, most of all the Ministry of Antiquities, as well as to other archaeological units in Egypt;
* to develop and popularize knowledge, by organizing public lectures and seminars presenting archaeological research in Egypt and Polish achievements in this field, as well as running a reference library allowing the Centre's residents and visitors to access to publications on archaeology and history of the Middle East;
* to provide support for a scholarship program of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland, granted to students, graduates and PhD candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/pl/stacja-badawcza-w-kairze/|title=Stacja Badawcze w Kairze|last=|first=|date=|website=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Artur Obłuski (2015 –).

== Polish archaeological missions in Egypt ==
* Polish-Egyptian Archaeological and Conservation Mission at Kom el-Dikka in [[Alexandria]], since 1960. One of the main quarters of the ancient city located in the center of the modern town is among the greatest discoveries of Polish archaeologists in Egypt. Preserving non-stop occupation from the city's founding in the 3rd century BC through the medieval 13th- – 14th-century Islamic burial ground, the site that is visited today as an archaeological park open to tourists encompasses buildings from the 4th through 6th centuries AD, including the oldest known ruins of an institution of higher learning (Alexandria's ancient academy) composed of lecture halls, an assembly hall vel theater or rather odeon, a late Roman imperial bathhouse and a habitation quarter of houses and workshops. Kom el-Dikka is the largest and the most important archaeological site in Alexandria. It was discovered by chance&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; when a high-rise construction project turned up wall remains identified by Polish archaeologists called in to consult the finds, as Egypt's only surviving Roman-age theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/SITE_Alexandria_Theater.htm|title=Alexandria Amphitheater (Kom el-Dikka)|last=|first=|date=|website=Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish Archaeological Mission at [[Marina, Egypt|Marina el-Alamein]], excavating an ancient [[Graeco-Roman]] town and necropolis since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Daszewski|first=Wiktor Andrzej|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=147|chapter=Marina el-Alamein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following three decades of research and conservation, the urban plan has been established and archaeologists have uncovered the main city square, lined with colonnaded stoas, districts of private houses with rich painted and sculpted decoration and an extensive necropolis of underground hypogea with many chambers as well as masonry tombs decorated with tall pillars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/fileadmin/template/main/img/historia/tablica25.jpg|title=Marina Al-Alamein.

* Polish Archaeological Mission at Marea, research since 2000. The team has explored a bath from the 6th century AD supplied with water from a well operated by a ''saqiya'' (wheel device moved by animal power). Since 2003 archaeologists have been excavating a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]], the second largest in Egypt, after the one in Abu Mena.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; The structures date from the heyday of the town when it was a major stop on the pilgrimage route to the nearby [[Abu Mena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Szymańska|first=Hanna|last2=Babraj|first2=Krzysztof|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=162–163|chapter=Marea on lake Maryut}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the shops on the street along the eastern facade of the basilica yielded a hoard of several hundred bronze coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naukawpolsce.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news,407282,polskie-wykopaliska-na-wystawie-w-aleksandryjskim-muzeum-narodowym.html|title=Polskie wykopaliska na wystawie w aleksandryjskim Muzeum Narodowym|last=|first=|date=13 November 2015|website=Nauka w Polsce|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish-Slovakian Archaeological Mission at Tell el-Retaba, studying a fortress of the [[Ramesside Period|Ramesside period]] (New Kingdom, 13th–11th centuries BC) since 2007. The site is identified as the fortress of [[Pithom]] mentioned in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aigyptos.sk/en/tel-el-retabi|title=Tell el-Retaba, Aigyptos Foundation [dostęp 2017-06-27].|last=|first=|date=|website=Aigyptos Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the discoveries is the only known stable for horses from the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] and an army barracks structure.
* Polish Archaeological Mission at Tell el-Farkha, working since 1998. The site is a settlement on three mounds, located on a major trade route passing through the Nile Delta to the Mediterranean coast and Syria. Its peak development can be dated to the [[Amratian culture|Nagada period]]. Of highest significance among the discoveries are two golden statues of presumed rulers from the pre-Dynastic period, indicating that the site was a power center of some substance in this part of Egypt, before its decline about the time of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, resulting from changing trade routes and the increased importance of water transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farkha.org/english/stanowisko.html|title=Tell el-Farkha archaeological site|last=|first=|date=|website=Polish Archaeological Expedition to the Eastern Nile Delta - Tell el-Farkha|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish-Egyptian Archaeological Mission at [[Saqqara]], opened in 1987, working regularly since 1997, in a sector of the necropolis located to the west of the oldest [[pyramid]] in the world, the [[Pyramid of Djoser|step-pyramid of Djoser]], built around 2650 BC. Polish archaeologists proved that the site was not an ancient dump, although the tombs discovered there were located in and ancient stone quarry from the Third Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dwadzieścia lat polskich badań w Sakkarze,|last=Myśliwiec|first=Karol|publisher=Wydawnictwo Instytutu Kultur Śródziemnomorskich i Orientalnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lavishly decorated tombs (preserving the ancient polychromed reliefs in excellent condition) belonged to high-ranking nobles from the Sixth Dynasty, such as the vizier [[Merefnebef]] (discovered in 1997) and the admiral Nyankhnefertem, priest and trusted secretary of the pharaoh (discovered in 2003).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Polish Archaeological Mission at Naqlun (Deir el-Malak) in [[Faiyum Oasis|Fayum Oasis]], research since 1986 in a monastic complex established in the 5th century and still functional today. The site comprises scattered hermitages, a central compound of extended monastic buildings, church, refuse dump and two cemeteries, one from the 6th and the other a large medieval Christian cemetery of the 12th–13th century. Finds include pottery, burial textiles, basketry and many others. The written documents: letters, codices, literary texts, psalms and fragments of Gospels, in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], Greek, Arabic and Latin, are evidence of monastic continuity and the level of the monks’ education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Godlewski|first=Włodzimierz|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=176|chapter=Naqlun}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish–Egyptian Archaeological and Conservation Mission at the Temple of [[Hatshepsut]] at [[Deir el-Bahari]], operating since 1961. The main task of the mission is the restoration of the Upper Terrace of this magnificent temple of the New Kingdom Pharaoh-Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templeofhatshepsut.uw.edu.pl/en|title=About us|last=Szafrański|first=Zbigniew|date=|website=Polish-Egyptian Archaeological Mission at the Temple of Hatshepsut|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Polish Archaeological Mission at Sheikh Abd al-Gurna (“Hermitage Mission”), established in 2003 to study the 6th–8th century AD Coptic hermitage installed in two Middle Kingdom nobles' tombs in Western [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Górecki|first=Tomasz|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=185–186|chapter=Sheikh Abd el-Gurna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the mission has started to investigate the underground parts of the tombs. One of the most interesting finds are fragments of linen with ink-painted hieroglyphs, a gift of [[Ptolemy XII Auletes|Ptolemy XII]], the father of [[Cleopatra]], for the nearby temple at [[Deir el-Medina]].
* Polish–American Mission in [[Baris, Egypt|Berenike]] and the Eastern Desert, excavations since 2008 in the Hellenistic and Roman ruins of the Red Sea port. The port was built in the 3rd century BC, a prime purpose being the import of elephants from eastern Africa for the needs of the Ptolemaic armies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/7,75400,21114289,niezwykle-cmentarzysko-zwierzat-domowych-sprzed-2000-lat.html|title=Niezwykłe cmentarzysko zwierząt domowych sprzed 2000 lat|last=Grabowska|first=Joanna|date=13 December 2016|work=Wyborcza|access-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harbor was an important stop on the major Greek and Roman trade routes to India, from where spices and precious stones were brought, and probably China, from where silk was imported. Incense and myrrh were brought from Arabia. The goods were transported by land from the port to Coptos on the Nile (modern Qift), and then by water to the Nile Delta and further to [[Rome]]. A cemetery of animals (cats, dogs, monkeys) is being excavated on the outskirts of the harbor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Rock [[Petroglyph]] Unit, part of the Dakhleh Oasis Project, surveying and documenting the largest gallery of rock art in the eastern Sahara since 1985. Some of the finest carvings show giraffes, oryxes and bulls, most common representations include sandals and feet impressions). The oldest petroglyphs have been dated to 8000–3000 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polacynadnilem.uw.edu.pl/sezony/2006-2007/misje-polskie-egipt/35-dachla-dakhla-oasis-project-petroglyph-unit/|title=Dakhla Oasis Project, Petroglyph Unit|last=|first=|date=|website=Polacy nad Nilem|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conservation Project in the [[Emir Qurqumas Complex|Emir Kabir Qurqumas Complex in Cairo]], in 1972–2000. The impressive complex erected by Qurqumas in the first decade of the 16th century was not only a burial monument to the owner, but part of his religious foundation (the so-called waqf); it also included a Quranic school, Sufi convent and the residential rooms of the emir.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Bronze Age]] site of '''Százhalombatta-Földvár''' is situated on the right bank of the [[Danube]], near the town of [[Százhalombatta]], 30&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Budapest]] in [[Hungary]]. It is one of the largest [[temperate]] [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] settlements from this period in central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Poroszlai, I. (2000) Excavation campaigns on the Bronze Age [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] site Százhalombatta-Földvár, I. 1989-1991. II. 1991-1993. In: Poroszlai-Vicze ed., SAX Annual Report I.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation at the site is ongoing and producing substantial new data revealing a detailed and hitherto unknown picture of Bronze Age life from 2000-1400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Sørensen, M.L.S. and Vicze, M.

== The Site ==
[[File:SAXTell.JPG|thumb|An aerial photo of the site]]
The site of Százhalombatta is 200 m by 100 m in area. It is estimated that up to two thirds of the original area was destroyed during clay extraction by a local brick factory and by [[erosion]] from the River Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Vicze, M. and Poroszlai, I. (eds.) (2005) Százhalombatta Archaeological Expedition. Report 2. Százhalombatta.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bronze Age settlement was built on a bluff with valleys to north and south, the [[River Danube]] to the east and it was fortified with a ditch to the west, a feature common to other [[Vatya culture|Vatya]] [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]s. It was strategically positioned at the end of the [[Benta, Hungary|Benta valley]], potentially controlling access to other sites including smaller settlements within the valley. It overlooks a long stretch of the River Danube and may have been involved in river-borne trade and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Vicze, M. and Poroszlai, I. (eds.) (2000) Százhalombatta Archaeological Expedition (SAX) Annual Report I. Százhalombatta.&lt;/ref&gt;
The settlement was first occupied at the end of the [[Early Bronze Age]] (the transition from the classic Nagyrév (Szigetszentmiklós) to the late Nagyrév (Kulcs). It was continuously inhabited through the Middle Bronze Age Vatya and [[Vatya-Koszider]] period. This was followed by a hiatus in occupation until the [[Urnfield]] phase of the [[Late Bronze Age]] from which there are only a few traces. Occupation layers at the site are up to 6 m deep. 
Finds from the site include pottery, daub, plaster, metalwork, moulds, loom weights, [[bone tool]]s, [[antler]] objects, ground stone, [[Stone tool|lithics]], [[amber]], animal and occasional human bones.&lt;ref&gt;Vicze, M. (2004) Excavation methodology on the Százhalombatta Project, In: Kisfaludi, J. (ed.) Archaeological Investigations in Hungary 2002. Budapest, 131-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Bronze Age houses were burnt. This has resulted in outstanding preservation of organic material including botanical remains such as [[thatch]] from house roofs and Bronze Age food like [[crabapple]]s, peas, beans and lentils.&lt;ref&gt;Berzsényi, B. (2009) Prehistoric food and plant resources from the Middle Bronze Age tell site of Százhalombatta-Földvár in Pest County (the Budapest hinterland, Hungary). In: Morel, J. P. and Mercuri, A. (eds.)

'''Text linguistics''' is a branch of [[linguistics]] that deals with [[Textuality|text]]s as [[communication system]]s. Its original aims lay in uncovering and describing text [[grammar]]s. The application of text linguistics has, however, evolved from this approach to a point in which text is viewed in much broader terms that go beyond a mere extension of traditional grammar towards an entire text. Text linguistics takes into account the form of a text, but also its setting, i. e. the way in which it is situated in an interactional, communicative context. Both the author of a (written or spoken) text as well as its [[addressee]] are taken into consideration in their respective (social and/or institutional) roles in the specific communicative context. In general it is an application of [[discourse analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Trappes-Lomax, Hugh (2004) "Discourse analysis", in ''The Handbook of Applied Linguistics'' ed. by A. Davies &amp; C. Elder. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 133–64.&lt;/ref&gt; at the much broader level of text, rather than just a sentence or word.

==Introduction==
===Reasons for text linguistics===
Much attention has been given to the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] as a self-contained unit, and not enough has been given to studying how sentences may be used in connected stretches of language. It is essentially the presentation of language as sets of sentences.

Text is extremely significant in [[human communication|communication]] because people communicate not by means of individual words or fragments of sentences in languages, but by means of texts. It is also the basis of various disciplines such as law, religion, medicine, science, politics, et cetera.&lt;ref name="sauduniversity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Al-Amri|first=K. H.|title=Text-linguistics for students of translation|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/kamri/Pages/Text-linguistics.aspx|publisher=King Saud University|year=2007|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
"A text is an extended structure of [[syntactic unit]]s [i. e. text as super-sentence] such as words, groups, and clauses and textual units that is marked by both [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] among the elements and completion ... [Whereas] a non-text consists of random sequences of linguistic units such as sentences, paragraphs, or sections in any temporal and/or spatial extension." (Werlich, 1976: 23)&lt;ref&gt;Werlich, E. (1976), ''A text grammar of English.'' Heidelberg: Quelle &amp; Meyer.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A naturally occurring manifestation of language, i. e. as a communicative language event in a context. The ''surface text'' is the set of expressions actually used; these expressions make some knowledge ''[[explicit knowledge|explicit]]'', while other knowledge remains ''[[implicit knowledge|implicit]]'', though still applied during processing." (Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981: 63)&lt;ref name='introtext'&gt; De Beaugrande, R., &amp; Dressler, W. U. (1981) ''Introduction to text linguistics'' / Robert-Alain De Beaugrande, Wolfgang Ulrich Dressler. London ; New York : Longman, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[A term] used in linguistics to refer to any passage- spoken or written, of whatever length, that does form a unified whole [….] A text is a unit of language in use. It is not a grammatical unit, like a [[clause]] or a sentence; and it is not defined by its size [….] A text is best regarded as a ''semantic'' unit; a unit not of form but of meaning." (Halliday and Hasan, 1976: 1–2)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. (1976)  "'Cohesion in English London: Longman'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

"A text is made up of sentences, but there exist separate principles of text-construction, beyond the rules for making sentences." (Fowler, 1991: 59)&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fowler. (1991) ''Language in the News: Discourse and Ideology in the Press.'' London/ New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[Text is] a set of mutually relevant communicative functions, structured in such a way as to achieve an overall [[rhetorical]] purpose." (Hatim and Mason, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;Hatim, Basil &amp; Ian Mason. (1990) ''Discourse and the Translator''. London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Text linguists generally agree that text is the natural domain of language, but they still differ in their perspectives of what constitutes a text. This variance is mainly due to the different methods of observations of different linguists, and as such, the definition of text is not yet concrete.&lt;ref name="sauduniversity" /&gt;

===Significance of contexts===
There is a text and there is other text that accompanies it: text that is 'with', namely the [[context (language use)|con-text]]. This notion of what is 'with the text', however, goes beyond what is said and written: it includes other non-verbal signs-on-the total environment in which a text unfolds. (Halliday and Hasan, 1985: 5)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK and R Hasan. (1985) ''Language, Context, and Text: Aspects of Language in a Social-Semiotic Perspective''. Geelong: Deakin University.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Halliday, text is a sign representation of a socio-cultural event embedded in a context of situation. Context of situation is the [[semiotics|semio]]-socio-cultural environment in which the text unfolds. Text and context are so intimately related that neither concept can be comprehended in the absence of the other.

===Three features of context of situation===

====The field of discourse – experiential meaning====
This is the meaning that the social actions and the engagements of the participants are giving to the understanding of the text.&lt;ref name=kavcic&gt;Kavcic, A. (2008) ''Text linguistics''. Informally published manuscript, English and German Studies, Retrieved from www.englistika.info/podatki/3_letnik/besediloslovje-I-izpiski.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

====The tenor of discourse – interpersonal meaning====
This is the meaning that the roles of and relationships among participants give to the understanding of the text. These relationships may be permanent or temporary. The contribution to meaning by social statuses of the participants also fall within this feature.&lt;ref name=kavcic /&gt;

====The mode of discourse – logical meaning====
This is the meaning that the language, written or spoken, gives to the understanding of the text. This includes the symbolic organization of the text, as well as its intended function within the context.&lt;ref name=kavcic /&gt;

===Texture ===
Texture is the basis for unity and semantic interdependence within text. Any text that lacks texture would simply be a bunch of isolated sentences that have no relationship to each other. (Crane, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Crane|first=Paul|title=Texture in Text: A Discourse Analysis  of a News Article Using  Halliday and Hasan’s Model of Cohesion|url=http://library.nakanishi.ac.jp/kiyou/gaidai(30)/08.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of texture is "sequential implicativeness", as suggested by Schegloff and Sacks (1974). This refers to the property of language such that each line in a text is linked from or linked to the previous line. As such, language contains a linear sequence and this linear progression of text creates a context of meaning.&lt;ref name='ss'&gt;Schegloff, E.A. and Sacks, H. (1974) "Opening up Closings", ''Semiotica'' 7(4): 289–327 (reprinted in Turner, R 1974 "'Ethnomethodology: selected readings,'" Harmondsworth: Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt; This contextual meaning, at the paragraph level is referred to as "coherence", while the internal properties of meaning are referred to as "cohesion". (Eggins, 1994: 85)&lt;ref name='eggins'&gt;Eggins, S. (1994) ''An Introduction to Systemic Functional Linguistics'' London: Pinter&lt;/ref&gt; There are two aspects of coherence, namely, "situational" coherence and "generic" coherence. There is situational coherence when field, tenor, and mode can be identified for a certain group of clauses. On the other hand, there is generic coherence when the text can be recognized as belonging to a certain genre. Thereby, cohesion is the result of "semantic ties", which refers to the dependent links between items within a text. These ties come together to create meaning. Texture is, therefore, created within text when the properties of coherence and cohesion are present.

===Text types===
Most linguists agree on the classification into five text-types: narrative, descriptive, argumentative, instructive, and comparison/contrast (also called expositive). Some classifications divide the types of texts according to their function. Others differ because they take into consideration the topic of the texts, the producer and the addressee, or the style. Adam and Petitjean, (1989) proposed analyzing of overlaps of different text types with text sequences. Virtanen (1992) establishes a double classification (discourse type and text type) to be used when the Identification text-text type is not straightforward.&lt;ref name="lopezmedina"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medina|first=Beatriz López|title=The role of text linguistics in the foreign language class|journal=Encuentro Revista de investigación e innovación en la clase de idiomas|year=2002/2003|pages=148–156|url=http://www.encuentrojournal.org/textos/13.14.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
As a science of text, text linguistics describes or explains among different types of text the:
* Shared features
* Distinct features
Text linguistics is the study of how texts function in human interaction. Beaugrande and Dressler define a text as a “communicative occurrence which meets seven standards of textuality” – Cohesion, Coherence, Intentionality, Acceptability, Informativity, Situationality and Intertextuality, without any of which the text will not be communicative. Non-communicative texts are treated as non-texts.&lt;ref name=introtext /&gt;

===Cohesion===
Surface texts are the exact words that people see or hear. [[Cohesion (linguistics)|Cohesion]] concerns the ways in which the components of the surface text are connected within a sequence. Grammatical forms and conventions are adhered to by surface components and therefore cohesion rests upon grammatical dependencies. The grammatical dependencies in surface texts are major signals for sorting out meanings and uses. Cohesion encompasses all of the functions that can be used to signal relations among surface elements.
{{cquote| SLOW &lt;br&gt;
CARS &lt;br&gt;
HELD UP}}
Such a text can be divided up into various dependencies. Someone might construe it as a notice about "slow cars" that are "held up", so that conclusions could be drawn about the need to drive fast to avoid being held up. However, it is more likely for one to divide the text into "slow" and "cars held up', so that drivers will drive slowly to avoid accidents or take alternative routes to avoid being caught in the slow traffic. A science of text should explain how [[ambiguities]] such as this are possible, as well as how they are precluded or resolved without much difficulty. For efficient communication to take place there must be interaction between cohesion and other standards of textuality because the surface alone is not decisive.

===Coherence===
[[Coherence (linguistics)|Coherence]] concerns the ways in which concepts and relations, which underlie the surface text, are linked, relevant and used, to achieve efficient communication.
* A concept is a cognitive content which can be retrieved or triggered with a high degree of [[consistency]] in the mind
* Relations are the links between concepts within a text, with each link identified with the concept that it connects to
Surface texts may not always express relations explicitly therefore people supply as many relations as are needed to make sense out of any particular text. In the example of the road sign "SLOW CARS HELD UP', "cars" is an object concept and "held up" an action concept, and the "cars" are the link to "held up'. Therefore, "slow" is more likely to be interpreted as a motion than as the speed at which cars are travelling.
Types of relations include:

;I. [[Causality]]: {{quote|"Itsy Bitsy spider climbing up the spout. Down came the rain and washed the spider out."}} The event of "raining" causes the event of "washing the spider out" because it creates the necessary conditions for the latter; without the rain, the spider will not be washed out.

;II. Enablement: {{quote|"Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall."}} The action of sitting on the wall created the necessary but not sufficient conditions for the action of falling down. Sitting on a wall makes it possible but not obligatory for falling down to occur.

;III. Reason: {{quote|"Jack shall have but a penny a day because he can't work any faster."}} In contrast to the rain which causes Itsy Bitsy spider to be washed out, the slow working does not actually cause or enable the low wage. Instead, the low wage is a reasonable outcome; "reason" is used to term actions that occur as a rational response to a previous event.

;IV. Purpose: {{quote|"Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to get her poor dog a bone."}} In contrast to Humpty Dumpty's action of sitting on the wall which enables the action of falling down, there is a plan involved here; Humpty Dumpty did not sit on the wall so that it could fall down but Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard so that she could get a bone. "Purpose" is used to term events that are planned to be made possible via a previous event.

;V. Time: 
"Cause", "enablement" and "reason" have forward directionality with the earlier event causing, enabling or providing reason for the later event. "Purpose', however, has a backward directionality as the later event provides the purpose for the earlier event.

More than just a feature of texts, coherence is also the outcome of cognitive processes among text users. The nearness and proximity of events in a text will trigger operations which recover or create coherence relations.
:{{quote|"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts;&lt;br&gt;The Knave of Hearts, he stole the tarts; &lt;br&gt;The King of Hearts, called for the tarts."}}

In the explicit text, there is a set of actions (making, stealing and calling); the only relations presented are the agent and the affected entity of each action. However, a text receiver is likely to assume that the locations of all three events are close to one another as well as occur in a continuous and relatively short time frame. One might also assume that the actions are meant to signal the attributes of the agents; the Queen is skilled in cooking, the Knave is dishonest and the King is authoritative. As such, coherence encompasses inferencing based on one's knowledge.

For a text to make sense, there has to be interaction between one's accumulated knowledge and the text-presented knowledge. Therefore, a science of texts is probabilistic instead of deterministic, that is, inferences by users of any particular text will be similar most of the time instead of all of the time. Most text users have a common core of cognitive composition, engagement and process such that their interpretations of texts through "sensing" are similar to what text senders intend them to be. Without cohesion and coherence, communication would be slowed down and could break down altogether. Cohesion and coherence are text-centred notions, designating operations directed at the text materials.

===Intentionality===
Intentionality concerns the text producer's attitude and intentions as the text producer uses cohesion and coherence to attain a goal specified in a plan. Without cohesion and coherence, intended goals may not be achieved due to a breakdown of communication. However, depending on the conditions and situations in which the text is used, the goal may still be attained even when cohesion and coherence are not upheld.
{{cquote| "'Want I carry you on my back?'" }}
Even though cohesion is not maintained in this example, the text producer still succeeds in achieving the goal of finding out if the text receiver wanted a piggyback.

===Acceptability===
Acceptability concerns the text receiver's attitude that the text should constitute useful or relevant details or information such that it is worth accepting. Text type, the desirability of goals and the political and sociocultural setting, as well as cohesion and coherence are important in influencing the acceptability of a text.

Text producers often speculate on the receiver's attitude of acceptability and present texts that maximizes the probability that the receivers will respond as desired by the producers. For example, texts that are open to a wide range of interpretations, such as "Call us before you dig. You may not be able to afterwards," require more inferences about the related consequences. This is more effective than an explicit version of the message that informs receivers the full consequences of digging without calling because receivers are left with a large amount of uncertainty as to the consequences that could result; this plays to the risk averseness of people.

===Informativity===
[[Informativity]] concerns the extent to which the contents of a text are already known or expected as compared to unknown or unexpected. No matter how expected or predictable content may be, a text will always be informative at least to a certain degree due to unforeseen variability. The processing of highly informative text demands greater cognitive ability but at the same time is more interesting. The level of informativity should not exceed a point such that the text becomes too complicated and communication is endangered. Conversely, the level of informativity should also not be so low that it results in boredom and the rejection of the text.

===Situationality===
[[Situationality]] concerns the factors which make a text relevant to a situation of occurrence. The situation in which a text is exchanged influences the comprehension of the text. There may be different interpretations with the road sign
{{cquote|SLOW &lt;br&gt;
CARS&lt;br&gt;
HELD UP}}
However, the most likely interpretation of the text is obvious because the situation in which the text is presented provides the context which influences how text receivers interpret the text. The group of receivers (motorists) who are required to provide a particular action will find it more reasonable to assume that "slow" requires them to slow down rather than referring to the speed of the cars that are ahead. Pedestrians can tell easily that the text is not directed towards them because varying their speeds is inconsequential and irrelevant to the situation. In this way, the situation decides the sense and use of the text.

Situationality can affect the means of cohesion; less cohesive text may be more appropriate than more cohesive text depending on the situation. If the road sign was "Motorists should reduce their speed and proceed slowly because the vehicles ahead are held up by road works, therefore proceeding at too high a speed may result in an accident', every possible doubt of intended receivers and intention would be removed. However, motorists only have a very short amount of time and attention to focus on and react to road signs. Therefore, in such a case, economical use of text is much more effective and appropriate than a fully cohesive text.

===Intertextuality===
[[Intertextuality]] concerns the factors which make the utilization of one text dependent upon knowledge of one or more previously encountered text. If a text receiver does not have prior knowledge of a relevant text, communication may break down because the understanding of the current text is obscured. Texts such as parodies, rebuttals, forums and classes in school, the text producer has to refer to prior texts while the text receivers have to have knowledge of the prior texts for communication to be efficient or even occur. In other text types such as puns, for example "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana', there is no need to refer to any other text.

==Main contributors==
===Robert-Alain de Beaugrande===
[[Robert-Alain de Beaugrande]] was a text linguist and a discourse analyst, one of the leading figures of the Continental tradition in the discipline. He was one of the developers of the Vienna School of Textlinguistik (Department of Linguistics at the University of Vienna), and published the seminal ''Introduction to Text Linguistics'' in 1981, with [[Wolfgang U. Dressler]]. He was also a major figure in the consolidation of critical discourse analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beaugrande|first=Robert de|title=Robert de Beaugrande Homepage|url=http://www.beaugrande.com/|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to language learning==

Text linguistics stimulates reading by arousing interest in texts or novels. Increases background knowledge on literature and on different kinds of publications. Writing skills can be improved by familiarizing and duplicating specific text structures and the use of specialized vocabulary.&lt;ref name="lopezmedina" /&gt;

'''''The Procuress''''' is the name given to a number of similar paintings by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] painter [[Dirck van Baburen]]. The painting is in the [[Caravaggio|Caravaggiesque]] style of the [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Utrecht school]].

==The painting==
The painting shows three figures, a prostitute on the left, the client in the middle and the procuress on the right pointing to her palm to indicate that she is expecting payment. The client is holding a coin between his fingers as he puts his arm around the prostitute, who is playing a [[lute]]. The painting is an example of the popular genre known as ''Bordeeltjes'', or brothel scenes (see also the overlapping genre of [[Merry company]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Schneider, ''Vermeer, 1632–1675: veiled emotions'', Taschen, 2000, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cropped, close-up figures close to the [[picture plane]] against a flat blank background are typical of [[Utrecht Caravaggism]].&lt;ref name = "jmm"/&gt;

There are at least three versions of the painting. The versions in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011141312/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/collectie/zoeken/asset.jsp?id=SK-C-612&amp;lang=en Rijksmuseum catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-procuress-33414 |title=MFA catalogue |publisher=Mfa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; are attributed to [[Dirck van Baburen]] or his studio. One copy of the painting was owned by [[Maria Thins]], mother-in-law of [[Johannes Vermeer]], who reproduced it in the background of two of his own paintings.  A copy owned by the [[Courtauld Institute]] in London has been identified as the work of the forger [[Han van Meegeren]]. This was featured in the third episode of the BBC TV series, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''.&lt;ref name="FoF3"&gt;{{Cite episode

==Vermeer==
[[File:Vermeer The concert.JPG|thumb|left|Vermeer's ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall at the upper right]]
[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Zittende Klavecimbelspeelster (1673-1675).jpg|thumb|Vermeer's ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'', in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall behind the figure]]

One of these paintings was owned by [[Vermeer]]'s mother-in-law, and it may have been an influence on one of his own early paintings on a similar subject, also known as ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656).&lt;ref name = "jmm"&gt;John Michael Montias, ''Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History'', Princeton University Press, 1991, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in the background of two of Vermeer's later paintings, ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' (c.1664) and ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'' (c.1670). In both of these later paintings the blatant lust depicted by Baburen is contrasted with the genteel, but erotically charged, middle-class world occupied by Vermeer's women. The contrast between the images may also imply "a more general association between music and love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/johannes-vermeer-a-young-woman-seated-at-a-virginal |title=National Gallery |publisher=National Gallery |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeer sets up a series of contrasts between his own delicate, restrained style and Baburen's vulgar realism. According to Michael Wayne Cole and Mary Pardo this represents Vermeer's own move away from such low-life subjects. The older, cruder style of Baburen is relegated to the background, "eclipsing it with the more modern kind of genteel subject that Vermeer would soon paint exclusively".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wayne Cole, Mary Pardo, ''Inventions of the studio, Renaissance to Romanticism'', UNC Press Books, 2005, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Geoffrey Webb]] presented a version of the painting to the Courtauld Institute. At the end of the [[Second World War]], he had been an allied officer in Europe investigating art works looted by the Nazis. He believed it was a fake painted by [[Han van Meegeren]], and he presented it to the Courtauld as such. In his own defense, van Meegeren claimed that the painting had been bought in an antique shop by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8612890/Master-forgery-17th-century-work-exposed-as-a-fake.html |title=report in the Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the painting was initially believed to be a fake, its authenticity remained controversial, and in 2009 a scientific study indicated that the painting was likely to be genuine, as no modern pigments were found. A spokesperson for the gallery stated that they were "surprised" by the results, but that the evidence indicated that it was "likely to be a 17th-century painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akbar |first=Arifa |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/fake-painting-revealed-as-dutch-masterpiece-1794254.html |title=Independent article |publisher=Independent article |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following this, the BBC TV programme ''Fake or Fortune?'' conducted a further investigation.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The resulting film was first shown July 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; [[Philip Mould]] and [[Fiona Bruce]] traveled to Amsterdam where they obtained samples of the paints used by van Meegeren.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; These included an artificial resin which turned out to be [[Bakelite]].&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The use of Bakelite had the effect of hardening the paint and thus making it difficult to detect that it was new.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Chemical analysis showed Bakelite in the Courtauld painting, thus confirming that it was a modern forgery.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Van Meegeren is the only forger known to have used this technique, so the painting was attributed to him.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It was probably intended to be used as a prop in Vermeer forgeries.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It is more valuable as a van Meegeren forgery than as a 17th-century studio copy.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt;

'''''The Shadow of the Sun''''' ({{lang-pl|Heban}}, literally "Ebony") is a [[Travel literature|travel memoir]] by the Polish writer and journalist [[Ryszard Kapuściński]]. It was published by [[Penguin Books]] in 2001 with the English translation by Klara Glowczewska. Kapuściński spent nearly 30 years in various African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]], [[Nigeria]], [[Ethiopia]] and more, detailing his accounts as a white, foreign visitor, of the development of the African states.&lt;ref name=Dyer/&gt;

Kapuściński's experience in Africa was unique, because he had the opportunity to stay with people of various classes in society, staying with ministers, as well as peasants in rural villages which gave him an honest perspective on what was the current situation of the continent.&lt;ref name=Ryle&gt;John Ryle (2001), "At play in the bush of ghosts" originally published as the “Tales of Mythical Africa” by the ''Times Literary Supplement'', 27 July 2001. Review of: Ryszard Kapuściński, ''The Shadow of the Sun'', translated by Klara Glowczewska, 336 pp, [[Penguin Books]], 2001. See: [http://www.richardwebster.net/johnryle.html Reprint of the review in full.]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The early pages of ''The Shadow of the Sun'', a compendium of further adventures in Africa, find [[Ryszard Kapuściński]] in [[Dar es Salaam]] in 1962, where he hears that [[Uganda]] is about to gain independence. He and a friend, Leo, promptly set off for [[Kampala]] via the [[Serengeti]], with its teeming wildlife. "It's all improbable, incredible. As if one were witnessing the birth of the world, that precise moment when the earth and sky already exist, as do water, plants, and wild animals, but not yet Adam and Eve." They have no maps, they're lost, and they're confronted with an enormous herd – "stretching almost to the horizon" – of buffalo. They press on regardless.&lt;ref name=Dyer&gt;Geoff Dyer (2 June 2001), [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/02/politics  Book review: ''The Shadow of the Sun'' by Ryszard Kapuscinski, trans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5046">'''Trixie''' is a generally derogatory [[slang]] term referring to a young [[urban area|urban]] [[White American|white]] [[woman]], typically single and in her 20s or early 30s.  The term originated during the 1990s in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  The term was  popularized by a [[satire|satirical]] website dedicated to the '''Lincoln Park Trixie Society''', a fictional [[social club]] based in Chicago's upscale [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park neighborhood]].&lt;ref name="redeye"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-05-20/news/0405210029_1_boyfriend-bars-boutique | title=My love-hate affair with Trixies | work=Chicago Redeye (Tribune Co.) | date=May 20, 2004 | accessdate=July 7, 2009 | author=Nikki Usher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Trixies are  described as "social climbing, marriage-minded, money-hungry young ladies that seem to flock to the upwardly-mobile neighborhood of Lincoln Park."&lt;ref name="ind01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indignantonline.com/humor/trixie.htm|title=Another Tale of Money-Hungry Lincoln Park Girls|last=Allen|first=Todd|date=March 12, 2001|work=Indignant Online|accessdate=28 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421225031/http://indignantonline.com/humor/trixie.htm|archivedate=April 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another description calls them "the women with [[Kate Spade]] bags for every day of the week; the ex-[[sorority]] girls still lusting after big, dumb [[Jock (subculture)|jocks]]; the women who go to [[law school]] to find husbands."&lt;ref name="flak01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flakmag.com/web/trixie.html|title=Lincoln Park Trixie Society|last=Risen|first=Clay|date=September 10, 2001|work=Flak Magazine|accessdate=28 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114203853/http://flakmag.com/web/trixie.html|archivedate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypical counterparts of Trixies, and the men they usually end up marrying, are referred to in slang as "[[Chad (slang)|Chads]]".&lt;ref name="kk01"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaduk|first=Kevin|title=Wrigleyworld: A Season in Baseball's Best Neighborhood|year=2006|publisher=NAL Hardcover|isbn=978-0-451-21812-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shane DuBow of  [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], reporting about the Lincoln Park Trixie Society website, wrote that the Trixie stereotype describes a "[[blond]], late-twenties woman with a [[ponytail]] who works in [[Public relations|PR]] or [[marketing]], drives a black [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]], gets [[manicure]]s and no-foam skim [[latte]]s", noticing that the website looked like a straight-faced parody.&lt;ref name="ng01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0205/feature7/assignment1.html|title=Field Notes From Author Shane DuBow|last=DuBow|first=Shane|year=2002|work=National Geographic|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plays and musical stage works==
Selected stage works that were important to Gilbert's career or were otherwise notable, in chronological order, excluding those listed under other headings below:
* ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866 [[Victorian burlesque|musical spoof]] of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]''). Gilbert's first solo success for the theatre, and the first of his five "[[Victorian burlesque|operatic burlesques]]".
* ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'' (1867), a parody of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[La fille du régiment|La figlia del regimento]]''
* ''[[Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren]]'' (1867), a Christmas [[pantomime]].
* ''[[The Merry Zingara]]'' (1868), a parody of [[Michael Balfe]]'s ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]''
* ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868), a parody of [[Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Robert le diable (opera)|Robert le diable]]''.  One of Gilbert's most successful early plays, it opened the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] and ran in the provinces for 3 years.
* ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'' (1869), a parody of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' – the last of Gilbert's five "operatic burlesques"
* ''[[An Old Score]]'' (1869) (rewritten as "Quits!" in 1872) Gilbert's first full-length comedy.
* ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'' (1870). Musical farce; the precursor to ''[[Princess Ida]]''.
* ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870). The first of Gilbert's [[blank verse]] "Fairy Comedies". 
* ''[[Creatures of Impulse]]'' (1871), with music by [[Alberto Randegger]], based on Gilbert's 1870 short story called "A Strange Old Lady".
* ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' (1871). Gilbert's most successful work up to this time.  A reinterpretation of the [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] myth in which the innocent former statue, [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], is unable to bear the cynicism and jealousies of the real world.
* ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'' (1871). A comedy that opened the [[Royal Court Theatre]].
* ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873). A fairy comedy about how mortal love upsets the fairy world.
* ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873). This work was briefly banned for its sharp satire of government ministers. It also travesties ''The Wicked World''.
* ''[[The Realm of Joy]]'' (1873). Set in the box office of a thinly-disguised ''The Happy Land'', it satirises the audience for scandalous plays and the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s censorship of plays.
* ''[[The Wedding March (play)|The Wedding March]]'' (1873) a farce adapted from ''Un Chapeau de Paille d'Italie'' by [[Eugène Marin Labiche|Eugène Labiche]]
* ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern]]'' (published 1874, performed 1891).  Gilbert's burlesque of ''Hamlet''.
* ''[[Charity (play)|Charity]]'' (1874). Concerns Victorian attitudes towards sex outside of marriage.  Anticipates the 1890s "problem plays" of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]].
* ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874). A drama about love revisited after 30 years.
* ''[[Tom Cobb]]'' (1875). This was possibly one of Gilbert's best comedies.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther (2000), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875).  The last of Gilbert's "fairy comedies", this was one of Gilbert's favourite plays.
* ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876). A three-act drama that introduced antecedents of some of Gilbert's later characters.
* ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877). Probably the most famous of Gilbert's non-[[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]] works for the theatre.
* ''[[The Ne'er-do-Weel]]'' (1878); rewritten as "The Vagabond" after a few weeks.  Friendship, sacrifice and rotating lovers: it unsuccessfully combined sentimental scenes with comedy.
* ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'' (1878).  An "amateur pantomime at the Gaiety," written with three other writers, in which WSG played Harlequin.
* ''[[Gretchen (play)|Gretchen]]'' (1879). One of Gilbert's favorites – his take on the ''Faust'' legend.
* ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'' (1881).  Gilbert's ''Back to the Future'' play.
* ''[[Brantinghame Hall]]'' (1888), a drama.  Gilbert's biggest flop, it sent producer [[Rutland Barrington]] into bankruptcy. 
* ''[[The Fortune Hunter]]'' (1897). Not a good play; its reception provoked WSG to announce retiring from writing for the stage.
* ''[[The Fairy's Dilemma]]'' (1904).  WSG finally works out a lifelong obsession with pantomime and harlequinade.
* ''[[The Hooligan]]'' (1911).  Gilbert's last play, written in a new, serious style.

==German Reed Entertainments==
Gilbert wrote six one-act musical entertainments for the [[German Reed Entertainments|German Reeds]] between 1869 and 1875.  They were successful in their own right and also helped form Gilbert's mature style as a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbridge Wilson, Frederic. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/10942 "Reed, Thomas German"],  Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 31 January 2013 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* ''[[No Cards]]'' (1869)
* ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869).  Gilbert's first collaboration with [[Frederic Clay]], and his first hit with the German Reeds, running for 350 performances.
* ''[[Our Island Home]]'' (1870)
* ''[[A Sensation Novel]]'' (1871)
* ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872)
* ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875)

==Early comic operas==
* ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]'' (1870; music by [[Frederic Clay]]).  The score is lost.
* ''[[Les Brigands]]'' (1871), an English adaptation of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s operetta.
* ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874; music by [[Alfred Cellier]]). This one-act operetta concerns a country that is the opposite of England. The score is lost.
* ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1876; music by [[Frederic Clay]]). A three-act opera, Gilbert's last with Clay.

==The [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas==
All of these comic operas are full-length two-act works, except for ''Trial by Jury'', which is in one act, and ''Princess Ida'', which is three acts. All except for ''Trial by Jury'' contain spoken dialogue; the dialogue in ''Princess Ida'' is written in [[blank verse]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' (1871)
* ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1875)
* ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877)
* ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878)
* ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1879)
* ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881)
* ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882)
* ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884)
* ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885)
* ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887)
* ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888)
* ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889)
* ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893)
* ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896)

==Later operas without Sullivan==
Though not as popular as the works with [[Arthur Sullivan]], a few of Gilbert's later comic operas arguably have stronger plots than the last two Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Wolfson, pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'' (1892; music by [[Alfred Cellier]]). This is the "lozenge plot" that Sullivan declined to set on several occasions.
* ''[[Haste to the Wedding]]'' (1892; music by [[George Grossmith]]). An unsuccessful adaptation of ''[[The Wedding March (play)|The Wedding March]]''.
* ''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'' (1894; with music by [[Osmond Carr]]). Gilbert felt that if Sullivan had set it, the piece would have been "another Mikado".
* ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' (1909; music by [[Edward German]]). Gilbert's last opera, which was a failure.

==Parlour ballads==
Gilbert is known to have written lyrics for twelve [[parlour ballad]]s.&lt;ref name=Allen74&gt;Allen, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  These are:
*"The Yarn of the Nancy Bell", with music by Alfred Plumpton.  One of the [[Bab Ballads]].  Published by Charles Jeffreys in 1869.&lt;ref name=Allen74 /&gt;
*"Thady O'Flynn", with music by [[James Lynam Molloy|James L. Molloy]].  Published by Boosey &amp; Co on 7 October 1868.  From ''[[No Cards]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Allen p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Would You Know that Maiden Fair", with music by [[Frederic Clay]].  From ''[[Ages Ago]]''. Published by Boosey c. 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Allen p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Corisande", with music by James L. Molloy.  Published by Boosey on 18 June 1870.&lt;ref name=Allen74 /&gt;
*"Eily's Reason", with music by James L. Molloy.  Published by Boosey on 27 February 1871.&lt;ref name=Allen74 /&gt;
*Three songs from ''[[A Sensation Novel]]'': "The Detective's Song", "The Tyrannical Bridegroom", and "The Jewel".  Published by Hopwood &amp; Co in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Allen p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The Distant Shore", with music by [[Arthur Sullivan]].  Published by Chappell &amp; Co on 18 December 1874.&lt;ref name=Allen74 /&gt;

'''Willard Chase''' (February 1, 1798 – March 10, 1871) was a resident of 19th-century New York and an early associate of [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].

==Biography==
Chase was born to parents Clark Chase (b. August 22, 1770) and Phebe Mason. Chase had two older siblings, Durfee and Mason, and seven younger siblings: Sarah "Sally", Edmund, Purley, Lucinda, Henry, Abel D., and Asa S.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Reed |first= William Field |year= 1902 |title= The descendants of Thomas Durfee of Portsmouth, R.I. |volume= 1 |place= Washington, D.C. |publisher= Gibson Bros., Printers |oclc= 5933884 |page= [https://archive.org/stream/descendantsoftho00reed#page/212/mode/2up 213–214] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase married Malissa Sanders Sounders. The couple had two children: Luther M. and Clark S.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=

Chase was a carpenter and lay [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Anderson |first= Richard Lloyd |authorlink= Richard Lloyd Anderson |date= August 1987 |title= The Alvin Smith Story: Fact and Fiction |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/08/the-alvin-smith-story-fact-and-fiction |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase died in Palmyra, New York, on March 10, 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Wymetal |first= Ritter von Wilhelm |year= 1886 |title= Joseph Smith, the Prophet, His Family and His Friends |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Salt Lake Tribune|Tribune Printing and Publishing Co.]] |oclc= 1538597 |pages= [https://archive.org/stream/josephsmithproph01wyme#page/230/mode/2up 230–231] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Early Mormonism==
Chase engaged in the practice of treasure hunting or "money digging". Neighbors, such as physician John Stafford, recalled that Chase's sister Sally used a [[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]] to locate treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Bushman |first= Richard L |authorlink= Richard Bushman |year= 1984 |title= Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism |place= Urbana |publisher= University of Illinois Press |isbn= 0252011430 |oclc= 10605085 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8raNwgaxvRIC&amp;pg=PA70 70] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase lived "over the hill to the East" of the Smiths in Palmyra.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Ashurst-McGee |first= Mark |authorlink= Mark Ashurst-McGee |year= 2008 |title= Zion Rising: Joseph Smith's Early Social and Political Thought |publisher= Arizona State University, [[ProQuest]] |type= Ph. D. Thesis |oclc= 436729912 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=90M0XiJvWjMC&amp;pg=PA80 80] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833, Chase swore an [[Mormonism Unvailed#Affidavit of Willard Chase|affidavit that was published]] in the book ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]'' by [[E. D. Howe]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;I became acquainted with the Smith family, known as the authors of the Mormon Bible, in the year 1820. At that time, they were engaged in the money digging business, which they followed until the latter part of the season of 1827.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Seer stone discovery and dispute===
Chase relates the story of the 1822 discovery of Joseph Smith's [[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]], which was "chocolate-colored and about the size of an egg":
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the year 1822, I was engaged in digging a well. I employed Alvin and Joseph Smith .... We discovered a singularly appearing stone .... Joseph put it into his hat, and then his face into the top of his hat.&lt;br/&gt; After obtaining the stone, he began to publish abroad what wonders he could discover by looking in it .... I ordered the stone to be returned to me again. He had it in his possession about two years. &lt;br/&gt;Some time in 1825, Hiram came to me, and wished to borrow the same stone .... I told him  if he would pledge me his word and honor, that I should have it when called for, he might take it;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chase describes a dispute over the ownership of the stone:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the fall of 1826, a friend called upon me and wished to see that stone .... On going to Smith's, and asking him for the stone, he said, "you cannot have it;" I told him it belonged to me, repeated to him the promise he made me, at the time of obtaining the stone: upon which he faced me with a malignant look and said, "I don't care who in the Devil it belongs to, you shall not have it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As late as 1830, Chase was still trying to recover the stone.&lt;ref&gt;"In April, 1830, I again asked Hiram [sic] for the stone which he had borrowed of me; he told me I should not have it, for Joseph made use of it in translating his Bible. I reminded him of his promise, and that he had pledged his honor to return it; but he gave me the lie, saying the stone was not mine nor never was."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early story of gold plates===
Chase records hearing an early version of Smith's [[golden plates]] story from [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the month of June, 1827, Joseph Smith, Sen., related to me the following story: "That some years ago, a spirit had appeared to Joseph his son, in a vision, and informed him that in a certain place there was a record on plates of gold, and that he was the person that must obtain them, and this he must do in the following manner: On the 22d of September, he must repair to the place where was deposited this manuscript, dressed in black clothes, and riding a black horse with a switch tail, and demand the book in a certain name, and after obtaining it, he must go directly away, and neither lay it down nor look behind him. They accordingly fitted out Joseph with a suit of black clothes and borrowed a black horse. He repaired to the place of deposit and demanded the book, which was in a stone box, unsealed, and so near the top of the ground that he could see one end of it, and raising it up, took out the book of gold; but fearing some one might discover where he got it, he laid it down to place back the top stone, as he found it; and turning round, to his surprise there was no book in sight. He again opened the box, and in it saw the book, and attempted to take it out, but was hindered. He saw in the box something like a toad, which soon assumed the appearance of a man, and struck him on the side of his head. — Not being discouraged at trifles, he again stooped down and strove to take the book, when the spirit struck him again, and knocked him three or four rods, and hurt him prodigiously. After recovering from his fright, he enquired why he could not obtain the plates; to which the spirit made reply, because you have not obeyed your orders. He then enquired when he could have them, and was answered thus: come one year from this day, and bring with you your oldest brother, and you shall have them. This spirit, he said was the spirit of the prophet who wrote this book, and who was sent to Joseph Smith, to make known these things to him. Before the expiration of the year, his oldest brother died; which the old man said was an accidental providence!
&lt;br&gt;

"Joseph went one year from that day, to demand the book, and the spirit enquired for his brother, and he said that he was dead. The spirit then commanded him to come again, in just one year, and bring a man with him. On asking who might be the man, he was answered that he would know him when he saw him."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Role of Samuel T. Lawrence===
According to Chase, Joseph Smith collaborated with seer [[Samuel T. Lawrence]]. Chase reported that "Joseph believed that one Samuel T. Lawrence was the man alluded to by the spirit, and went with him to a singular looking hill, in Manchester, and [showed] him where the treasure was."

Lawrence who was able to "see" not only the gold plates but also "saw" the pair of spectacles, which in Mormonism would later be identified with the biblical [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]]. Chase wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lawrence asked him if he had ever discovered any thing with the plates of gold; he said no: he then asked him to look in his stone, to see if there was any thing with them. He looked, and said there was nothing; he told him to look again, and see if there was not a large pair of specks with the plates; he looked and soon saw a pair of spectacles, the same with which Joseph says he translated the Book of Mormon.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lawrence reportedly warned Smith that "it would not be prudent to let these plates be seen for about two years". Lawrence reported that Smith later "altered his mind, and said L. was not the right man, nor had he told him the right place."

Chase described how "in the fall of 1826, [Smith] wanted to go to Pennsylvania to be married". He reportedly attempted to enlist Lawrence in "a very rich mine of silver" on "the bank of the Susquehannah River".

===Stowel diggings===
Chase describes the diggings on the property of Josiah Stowell:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, being still destitute of money, he set his wits at work, how he should get back to Manchester, his place of residence; he hit upon the following plan, which succeeded very well. He went to an honest old Dutchman, by the name of Stowel, and told him that he had discovered on the bank of Black River, in the village of Watertown, Jefferson County, N.Y. a cave, in which he had found a bar of gold, as big as his leg, and about three or four feet long. --That he could not get it out alone, on account of its being fast at one end; and if he would move him to Manchester, N.Y. they would go together, and take a chisel and mallet, and get it, and Stowel should share the prize with him. Stowel moved him.
&lt;br&gt;

A short time after their arrival at Manchester, Stowel reminded Joseph of his promise; but he calmly replied, that he would not go, because his wife was now among strangers, and would be very lonesome if he went away. Mr. Stowel was then obliged to return without any gold, and with less money than he came.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chest requested===
Chased described Smith's request for a chest, writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the fore part of September, (I believe, ) 1827, the Prophet requested me to make him a chest, informing me that he designed to move back to Pennsylvania, and expecting soon to get his gold book, he wanted a chest to lock it up, giving me to understand at the same time, that if I would make the chest he would give me a share in the book. I told him my business was such that I could not make it: but if he would bring the book to me, I would lock it up for him. He said that would not do, as he was commanded to keep it two years, without letting it come to the eye of any one but himself. This commandment, however, he did not keep, for in less than two years, twelve men said they had seen it. I told him to get it and convince me of its existence, and I would make him a chest; but he said, that would not do, as he must have a chest to lock the book in, as soon as he took it out of the ground. I saw him a few days after, when he told me that I must make the chest. I told him plainly that I could not, upon which he told me that I could have no share in the book.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chase attempts to obtain the plates===
{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
Although Chase's affidavit makes no mention of it, Lucy Mack Smith recalled that Chase and others attempted to obtain the Golden Plates themselves. Lucy wrote: "10 or 12 men were clubbed together with one Willard Chase, a Methodist class leader at their head, and what was most ridiculous they had sent for a conjuror to come 60 miles to divine the place where the record was deposited".&lt;ref name="josephsmithpapers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/lucy-mack-smith-history-1844-1845?p=63#!/paperSummary/lucy-mack-smith-history-1844-1845&amp;p=63|title=Lucy Mack Smith, History, 1844–1845, Page 63|publisher=josephsmithpapers.org|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plates discovered===
Chase relates the second-hand story about the discovery of the plates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A few weeks after this conversation, he came to my house, and related the following story: That on the 22d of September, he arose early in the morning, and took a one horse wagon, of some one that had stayed over night at their house, without leave or license; and, together with his wife, repaired to the hill which contained the book. He left his wife in the wagon, by the road, and went alone to the hill, a distance of thirty or forty rods from the road; he said he then took the book out of the ground and hid it in a tree top, and returned home. He then went to the town of Macedon to work. After about ten days, it having been suggested that some one had got his book, his wife went after him; he hired a horse, and went home in the afternoon, staid long enough to drink one cup of tea, and then went for his book, found it safe, took off his frock, wrapt it round it, put it under his arm and run all the way home, a distance of about two miles. He said he should think it would weigh sixty pounds, and was sure it would weigh forty. On his return home, he said he was attacked by two men in the woods, and knocked them both down and made his escape, arrived safe and secured his treasure. -- He then observed that if it had not been for that stone, (which he acknowledged belonged to me, ) he would not have obtained the book. A few days afterwards, he told one of my neighbors that he had not got any such book, nor never had such an one; but that he had told the story to deceive the d---d fool, (meaning me, ) to get him to make a chest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Martin Harris===
Chase recalls that Smith "met one day in the streets of Palmyra, a rich man, whose name was Martin Harris, and addressed him thus; 'I have a commandment from God to ask the first man I meet in the street to give me fifty dollars, to assist me in doing the work of the Lord by translating the Golden Bible.'".

Chase recalls that [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Harris]] "reported that the Prophet's wife ... would be delivered of a male child that would be able when two years old to translate the Gold Bible."

===Abel D. Chase===
In 1879, Chase's brother Abel Chase gave a sworn statement re-asserting claims Willard had made and asserting that the 1833 affidavit was genuine.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The true origin of the Book of Mormon|author=Shook, C.A.|date=1914|publisher=Standard Pub. Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnoTAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration for the Salamander Letter==
The Chase Affidavit was a source of inspiration for the [[Salamander letter]], a 20th-century forgery by [[Mark Hofmann]]. The Chase Affidavit describes "something like a toad", which was used as the source for Hofmann's "white salamander".&lt;ref name="mormoninformation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormoninformation.com/salamand.htm|title=The Salamander Letter|publisher=mormoninformation.com|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WindScan''' contains globally gridded, high resolution [[offshore wind]] speeds and directions on a 0.25&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; global grid and multiple time resolutions down to 6 hourly measurements. With 22 years of [[wind speed]] and directional data derived from multiple [[satellite]] measurements, WindScan provides weather risk analysis as well as site specific resource analysis for any offshore site in the world, whilst the 0.25° resolution allows analysis of differences in wind speed between sites, for example within individual offshore [[wind energy]] development zones.

The utilisation of multiple satellite measurements fills in the data gaps (in both space and time) of individual satellite samplings and reduces the subsampling aliases and random errors.

WindScan development was in response to the high demand for high resolution wind speed and direction data from the offshore wind energy industry. For example, developers want to make more accurate forecasts of offshore life cycle [[wind power]] output and annual variability/site [[climatology]].

==Assessment of composite global sea surface wind speeds==

Global 0.25&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; gridded, blended products with [[temporal resolution]]s of 6 hours, 12 hours and daily have become feasible since mid-2002, mid-1995 and January 1991, respectively (with 75% time coverage and 90% spatial coverage between 65&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;S–65&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;N). If the coverage is relaxed, the feasible times can be extended to earlier periods.

==Sea surface wind speed observations==

Sea surface wind has been traditionally observed from platforms such as ships and buoys. However, even today, observations still have very limited spatial coverage over the ocean surface. Sea surface wind speed has also been operationally observed from satellite sensors, starting with a US [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]] (DMSP) satellite in July 1987 to the constellation of 5 US satellites since 2000.

In situ observations still play a critical role in calibrating and validating satellite observations. However, with the dense satellite sampling, in-situ observations play a minor role in reducing random and sampling errors in blended analyses using satellite observations.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang et al., 2006, Assessment of composite global sampling: Sea surface wind speed, Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 33, L17714&lt;/ref&gt; 

The short-lived wind satellites are not used (e.g., the US National Aeronautics and Space Agency [[Scatterometer]] (NSCAT), the joint US/Japan SeaWinds on the Advanced Earth Observing Satellites (ADEOS I and [[ADEOS II]]), non-US satellites (e.g. the [[European Remote Sensing Satellite]]s (ERS) 1 and 2, which have narrow observing swaths and interrupted observations), and satellites from which sea surface wind speed can also be retrieved (presently with less accuracy) along with the primary product of sea level (e.g. the joint US/French altimetry satellites of Ocean Topography Experiment ([[TOPEX/Poseidon]]) and the follow-on [[Jason 1]]). Inclusion of these data would have limited positive impact for the corresponding time periods on the blended product.

Among the satellites used, the passive DMSP observations are from the microwave radiometers on the Special Sensor Microwave Imager ([[SSMI]] &lt;ref&gt;Hollinger, J., R. Lo, and G. Poe, Special Sensor Microwave/Imager User's Guide, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C., Sep. 14, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;). Later additions to these passive microwave observations are the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI &lt;ref&gt;Kummerow, C., 1998: Beamfilling errors in passive microwave rainfall retrievals. J. Appl. Meteor., 37, 356–370&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer of [[NASA]]’s Earth Observing System ([[Aqua (satellite)]]) AMSR-E.&lt;ref&gt;Wentz, F. J., and Meissner, T., 1999, AMSR Ocean Algorithm, Vol. 2 (Santa Rosa, CA, USA: Remote Sensing Systems)&lt;/ref&gt; The scatterometer (e.g. the Quick Scatterometer ([[QuikSCAT]])), which is active by nature, uses microwave radar and retrieves both wind speed and wind direction.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar et al., 1991a, 1991b; Liu et al., 1998, Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 33, L17714, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of data coverage==
At the temporal resolution of daily, one SSMI satellite provides data coverage over about 75% of the global 0.25&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; oceanic boxes between 65&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;S–65&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;N. With two or more satellites, the spatial coverage increases to about 100%.

At the temporal resolution of 12 hourly, one satellite provides data coverage to less than 30% of the oceanic grid boxes.

The addition of the second [[SSMI]] satellite drastically increases the spatial coverage to just below 75%. 

With three or more satellites, the spatial coverage increases to above 95%.

At the temporal resolution of 6 hourly, the spatial coverage is less than 30% with two or fewer satellites.

The coverage is about 42% with the three SSMI satellites.

With the addition of the TMI, the spatial coverage increases to about 56%. 

The addition of the [[QuikSCAT]] further increases the spatial coverage to about 66%. This modest increase is due to the close sampling times of the [[QuikSCAT]] and the SSMI satellites, although their ascending and descending tracks are out-of-phase. 

However, the addition of the AMSR-E dramatically increases the spatial coverage to above 90%. The critical importance of the AMSR-E for high resolution products (6 hourly in this case) is due to its unique sampling times compared to the other satellites.

Following this satellite data blending process, on the global 0.25&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; grid, blended products with temporal resolutions of 6 hours, have become feasible.

==Research findings using WindScan==

[[File:Offshore wind rose sample.JPG|thumb|right]]
Recent research undertaken using WindScan has shown significant differences in [[wind power]] output from different development areas in the [[North Sea]]. This has a large impact on the European [[wind farm]] industry. Different zones in the North Sea at the same distance from the coastline can give power outputs which differ by over 40%. Even within a single zone the energy yield can differ by up to 13% depending on the location chosen for development.&lt;ref&gt;Raynor, M., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The blended satellite data has also been used to generate a global rank of the offshore wind resource at current offshore wind farms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/windspeeds.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
