      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12929">The '''GSOC bugging scandal''' in February 2014 involved revelations that the offices of the [[Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission]], Ireland's independent police watchdog, were under covert electronic surveillance by an unknown party. John Mooney, security correspondent for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', first published the story alleging that GSOC had been the subject of surveillance by an unidentified party using "government level technology" to hack into its emails, [[Wi-Fi]] and telephone systems. The espionage operation was uncovered by a private British counter-surveillance firm, ''Verrimus'', whom GSOC hired after its suspicions became aroused of outside spying on the organisation and its activities.

The scandal and its aftermath are widely attributed to be one of the main reasons, along with the [[Garda whistleblower scandal]], for the resignations of the then [[Garda Commissioner]] [[Martin Callinan]] (in March 2014) and [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]] and [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Defence]] [[Alan Shatter]] (in May 2014). GSOC Chairman, Simon O'Brien, also resigned from his job in January 2015, ten months after the bugging allegations became public knowledge.

==Discovery of surveillance operation==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
''Verrimus'', the UK-based private counterintelligence company which uses countermeasures and specialist devices to uncover electronic surveillance, and employs former British military and intelligence personnel, was paid €18,000 by GSOC for its services over a number of days (it came to [[Dublin]] during the night to avoid arousing the suspicions of anyone watching GSOC) and found the following;
* A conference speaker phone on the upper floor of the GSOC building on [[Abbey Street]] may have been tampered with. This room was regularly used to hold case conferences on sensitive investigations.
* GSOC's internal [[Wireless LAN|wireless local area network]] (WLAN) was compromised in order to steal emails, data, confidential reports and possibly to eavesdrop on mobile phone calls.
* A second Wi-Fi network had been created to harvest GSOC data. It was operated using an IP address in the UK, which concealed the identities and whereabouts of those operating the network.
* Another device, which worked off GSOC's broadband network, was also found to have been compromised. However, it was wiped of all data by those involved in the illicit operation when it became clear that their activities had been detected.&lt;ref name="gsoc bugging 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mooney|first1=John|title=GSOC under high-tech surveillance|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1373695.ece|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A UK 4G cellular network was discovered in the vicinity of GSOC's headquarters, claimed to have been operated using an [[IMSI-catcher]] (cell tower spoofing) which instead of displaying an Irish Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC), displayed a UK country codes – probably by accident, resulting in the only reason why it was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK security firm Verrimus dismisses reports that experts' phones were source of detected anomaly at Garda Ombudsman offices|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/gsoc-bugging-uk-security-firm-3157967|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=Irish Mirror|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vodafone were testing the rollout of 4G at the time and it has also been claimed that this is this test network that was detected.

GSOC employed Verrimus after it had consulted with the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC), which is responsible for investigating complaints against police forces in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lally|first1=Conor|title=Bugging found at offices of Garda complaints watchdog|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/bugging-found-at-offices-of-garda-complaints-watchdog-1.1685345|accessdate=7 July 2016|publisher=The Irish Times|date=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspected culprits==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
{{original research|date=December 2017}}
The most likely explanation for the surveillance operation and those that stood most to gain from it and had the experience and access to the technology required were the [[Garda Síochána]], Ireland's national police service. Although no direct evidence was ever found linking the Garda force or its members to the espionage, GSOC investigated many sensitive matters relating to the force including investigations involving senior members of the force. It was reported that the reason GSOC ordered the bug sweep in the first place was because after a meeting with a senior Garda officer during the course of a malpractice investigation by the watchdog, the senior Garda inadvertently let slip that he was aware of contents of a secret report which GSOC had been working on, which had not yet been released, and that he was aware of text that actually never made it into the final report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GSOC feared ‘bug’ after garda slip-up|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1376536.ece|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units of the force which have the ability to carry out such high-tech monitoring include the [[Garda Crime and Security Branch|Crime and Security Branch]], [[Garda National Surveillance Unit|National Surveillance Unit]] and [[Special Detective Unit]].

The Irish [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] and [[Revenue Commissioners]] are the only other two state agencies in Ireland which have the legal authority to carry out covert surveillance operations. The Irish Army and its [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (Ireland)|Military Intelligence]] and [[Communications &amp; Information Services Corps]] have the ability to undertake sophisticated intelligence operations, but no evidence whatsoever was proffered implicating either the military or Revenue, nor would they have stood much to gain from any information gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Mark|title=GSOC judge must be given full powers|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/gsoc-judge-must-be-given-full-powers-259316.html|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom's [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] and other intelligence services in the past have collected information concerning actions taken by the Irish government, and a second unauthorised spoofing Wi-Fi network discovered at GSOC's head office was traced back to the UK, however it is believed that was a deliberate act to hide the culprit's tracks.&lt;ref name="gsoc bugging 1"/&gt; 

''The Sunday Times'' reported that the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] in the United States had in the past used very similar technology to spy on targets,&lt;ref name="gsoc bugging 1"/&gt; and in the aftermath of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|Edward Snowden leaks]] the year before, suspicion was rife about NSA activities in Europe. However, the US had little to gain by surveilling an Irish police watchdog's investigations into corruption and malpractice, and none of GSOC's current investigations involved either the UK or US.

===Motives===
According to journalist John Mooney, he linked the bugging operation to GSOC's investigation of the Garda handling of the [[Kieran Boylan affair|Kieran Boylan case]], a convicted drug-runner who was assisted by Gardaí in obtaining a passport, a haulage licence and had a prosecution for drug offences annulled in extraordinary circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mooney|first1=John|title=Gsoc probes ‘unsound’ convictions|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1162378.ece|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clifford|first1=Michael|title=GSOC the big loser as gardaí escape scrutiny|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/gsoc-the-big-loser-as-gardai-escape-scrutiny-271788.html|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the results of the security sweep, GSOC did not bring them to the attention of the Minister for Justice or the Garda Síochána (who would usually investigate such matters), instead they emerged through the media.

==Aftermath and resignations==
This was the second such security sweep GSOC had undertaken, and it was also understood to be concerned about the level of detail emerging publicly regarding ongoing cases. Electronic security procedures were improved after the sweep, including a conference room which cannot not be bugged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Callinan has ‘grave concern’ over Garda ombudsman bugging statement|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/callinan-has-grave-concern-over-garda-ombudsman-bugging-statement-1.1686246|accessdate=7 July 2016|publisher=The Irish Times|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government appointed retired [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] Judge John Cooke to conduct an independent inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of the Garda Siochána Ombudsman Commission. He could find neither conclusive evidence supporting the surveillance allegations, or by whom, or that it didn't occur in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No evidence GSOC offices were bugged - Cooke report|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/no-evidence-gsoc-offices-were-bugged-cooke-report-1.1827115|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=The Irish Times|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Cooke was the only person to undertake the inquiry, which did not include any technical expertise as had been called for by opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dáil Speech on Cooke Report by Fianna Fáil Justice Spokesperson Niall Collins TD|url=https://www.fiannafail.ie/dail-speech-on-cooke-report-by-fianna-fail-justice-spokesperson-niall-collins-td/|publisher=Fianna Fáil|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of weeks after news of the bugging at GSOC broke, on 25 March 2014, Garda Commissioner [[Martin Callinan]] resigned citing "early retirement" after it was believed the government lost confidence in his leadership and wanted a fresh face to head the force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6 reasons why Martin Callinan resigned as Garda Commissioner|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/why-did-martin-callinan-resign-1379772-Mar2014/|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister for Justice and Defence [[Alan Shatter]], who had a very close working relationship with Commissioner Callinan, resigned from government on 7 May 2014 and later lost his seat as a [[Teachta Dála|TD]] in [[Dáil Éireann]] at the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shatter|first1=Alan|title=Alan Shatter: Fennelly, Cooke reports show claims were untrue|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/alan-shatter-fennelly-cooke-reports-show-claims-were-untrue-1.2339681|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions had been raised about the unusual and potentially conflicting occurrence of a Minister holding not only both the Justice and Defence portfolios (housing the two main intelligence services of the state), but also in charge of both the Gardaí and the watchdog whose sole responsibility it is to investigate them.  

Chairman of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, Simon O'Brien, announced his resignation on 7 January 2015 with two years remaining on his contract to take up a role as chief executive of the [[Pensions Ombudsman]] Service in the UK. Both the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) and the Garda Representative Association (GRA) had previously called on him to step down over his handling of the bugging scandal, despite being the victim of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lally|first1=Conor|title=Simon O’Brien to quit as chair of Gsoc to take up role in UK|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/simon-o-brien-to-quit-as-chair-of-gsoc-to-take-up-role-in-uk-1.2057839|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=The Irish Times|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy''' (also known as the '''circular transactions controversy''') began in Dublin in December 2008 when [[Seán FitzPatrick]], the chairman of [[Anglo Irish Bank]] (the state's third-largest bank), admitted he had hidden a total of [[Euro|€]]87 million in loans from the bank, triggering a series of incidents which led to the eventual [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of Anglo on 21 January 2009. FitzPatrick subsequently resigned his position and was followed within twenty-four hours by the bank's non-executive director, [[Lar Bradshaw]] and chief executive, [[David Drumm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/anglo-business.html|title=Drumm quits Anglo in loans fall-out|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new chairman of Anglo, [[Donal O'Connor]], was quickly appointed from the board, a move welcomed by the Irish [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]], [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]]. A number of investigations have been launched into the reasons behind the three resignations. The [[Central Bank of Ireland]] is carrying out a review of the bank's dealings, although its [[Financial Regulator]], [[Patrick Neary]], has also since resigned his position. So too did a number of other chairmen, directors and executives involved with Anglo, [[Irish Life and Permanent]] and [[Irish Nationwide]].

Within days of the initial admission, an announcement was made that Anglo Irish Bank would be one of three (alongside [[Allied Irish Bank]] and [[Bank of Ireland]]) that would be recapitalised by the [[Irish government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/bank.html|title=Bank move a good deal for taxpayers: Lenihan|date=22 December 2008|accessdate=22 December 2008|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222215745/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/bank.html|archivedate= 22 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was expected to be effected in mid-January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialregulator.ie/frame_main.asp?pg=%2Fnews%2Fnw%5Farticle%2Easp%3Fid%3D440&amp;nv=%2Fnews%2Fnw%5Fnav%2Easp |title=Bank Government Announcement on Recapitalisation |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |publisher=[[Financial Regulator]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129125817/http://www.financialregulator.ie/frame_main.asp?pg=%2Fnews%2Fnw_article.asp%3Fid%3D440&amp;nv=%2Fnews%2Fnw_nav.asp |archivedate=29 January 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; following an [[Extraordinary General Meeting]] (EGM). Lenihan instead unexpectedly announced the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank the night before the EGM due to difficulties he encountered with the recapitalisation process. Recapitalisations of the other two banks mentioned were expected by the end of March 2009 but, according to [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]], were expected to be finalised in early February 2009 at a total of €7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0207/economy.html|title=Bank recapitalisation finalised soon - Cowen|date=7 February 2009|accessdate=7 February 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208193317/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0207/economy.html|archivedate=8 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank on 21 January 2009 followed two more resignations earlier that month. On 7 January 2009, another director, [[Willie McAteer]], resigned, becoming the fourth casualty of the controversy. Two days later the Financial Regulator Patrick Neary retired amidst much criticism over his handling of the affair. After the nationalisation, the Chairman of Irish Nationwide, Dr Michael Walsh, resigned on 17 February, one week to the day that government-appointed directors announced they were investigating a deposit of billions of euro by Irish Life and Permanent, placed in Anglo Irish Bank before the end of its financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0210/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo directors probe 'billions' deposit|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=10 February 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoiseach Brian Cowen denied claims that he was protecting a "[[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy#The "Golden Circle"|Golden Circle]]" of wealthy financiers from being identified. This mysterious group of ten businessmen is said{{By whom|date=March 2011}} to have received loans from Anglo Irish Bank in return for buying shares, in a move designed to keep the bank afloat.

==Background==
Starting in 1986, Seán "Seanie" FitzPatrick spent eighteen years as chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, during which time the bank grew from a small operator into the third-largest bank in Ireland. When he became the bank's chairman in 2005, handing over the position of chief executive to David Drumm, the bank was recording annual profits of over €500 million. The Anglo share price peaked at €17.60 in May 2007, an increase from under €1 ten years previously. Anglo was valued at nearly €13 billion and FitzPatrick's 4.5 million Anglo shares were worth nearly €80 million at this time. Prior to FitzPatrick's resignation, the Anglo share price had already dropped to €0.32, a drop of 98% with the entire bank valued at a low €242 million and FitzPatrick's stake reduced to €1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/seanie-turned-a-struggling-minnow-into-a-banking-giant-1580520.html|title='Seanie' turned a struggling minnow into a banking giant|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Financial Regulator first uncovered the €87 million loans in January 2008 when inspectors from the regulator's offices carried out an inspection into the loan book of rival lender, [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]]. The inspectors noticed that a large loan was provided to FitzPatrick at Anglo Irish Bank and later repaid. The Regulator discovered at a later date that similar loans were provided to FitzPatrick in September 2008 and repaid by him in October 2008. When the issue was raised with Anglo Irish Bank it was discovered that there were further loans between the two banks over an extended period of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1220/1229725700584.html|title=Regulator stumbled on loans during inspection of rival bank's books|date=20 December 2008|accessdate=20 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain which officials, if any, within the bank knew about the loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1220/1229725700319.html?via=rel|title=Anglo stays silent over who knew of loans|date=20 December 2008|accessdate=20 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Anglo annual report contained a note displaying the total loans given to directors of the bank. This total was measured at a single point in time. In the case of Anglo this occurred on 30 September. FitzPatrick, instead of revealing the true figures of his loans, transferred some of them to [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]], returning them to Anglo at a later date. He acted in a manner that thwarted transparency of Anglo's loan book. Financial authorities investigated if there were breaches of corporate governance. The Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator said that "a lay person would expect that issues of this nature and this magnitude would have been picked up" by the external auditors, [[Ernst &amp; Young]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0114/1231738222989.html FitzPatrick Anglo loans were more than €87m]&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving legal advice Ernst &amp; Young declined to appear before a parliamentary committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0202/anglo-business.html|work=RTÉ News|title=Anglo auditors won't be at committee|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This in turn led to inaccurate figures for the total directors' loans given for eight consecutive years in the end of year Anglo accounts. 2008 was the first occasion on which FitzPatrick revealed his true figure, that of €87 million or twice the total of the other twelve directors' loan figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/why-directors-loans-fell-below-the-radar-1580570.html|title=Why directors' loans fell below the radar|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|first=Maeve|last=Dineen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation was described as Ireland's version of [[Enron]], the American energy company which went bankrupt in 2001, and it was said that the principals would have been immediately arrested if this had occurred in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/financial-crisis/if-fitzpatrick-lived-in-new-york-hed---have-been-arrested-1605179.html If FitzPatrick lived in New York, he'd have been arrested]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resignations ==

=== Anglo Irish Bank ===
FitzPatrick issued a statement on the evening of 18 December 2008, linking his resignation with a €87 million loan he had from the bank. Ireland's Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan welcomed the appointment of a new chairman, Donal O'Connor, an official with a substantial commercial track record, saying he "seems a natural choice" for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1218/fitzpatricks.html|title=Chairman of Anglo Irish Bank resigns|date=18 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220080431/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1218/fitzpatricks.html|archivedate=20 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzPatrick's resignation came little over two months after he had admitted that his former bank had made mistakes but insisted it had not been "reckless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1004/bank.html|title=Mistakes made says Anglo Irish Bank chairman|date=4 October 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081223092341/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1004/bank.html|archivedate=23 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside FitzPatrick's resignation came that of Bradshaw who had held a loan jointly with FitzPatrick, a loan that was temporarily transferred to another bank prior to a year end audit without the knowledge of Bradshaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/anglo-chief-quits-after-hiding-euro87m--bank-loans-1580513.html|title=Anglo chief quits after hiding €87m bank loans|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=Irish Independent|first1=Maeve|last1=Dineen|first2=Brendan|last2=Keenan|first3=John|last3=Mulligan}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of 19 December, Drumm announced he would step down with immediate effect, but said he will continue to work with the chairman through a transition phase until a replacement chief executive is agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/angloirish.html|title=Anglo Irish chief third to resign|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221123534/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/angloirish.html|archivedate=21 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is appropriate for me to step down today given last evening's announcement in relation to the resignation of Seán FitzPatrick and given the strong statement of support for the Bank and its recapitalisation programme by the Minister for Finance. Good progress is being made on the recapitalisation. It is undoubtedly in the best interests of Anglo that a new Chief Executive is appointed to lead the Bank through its next phase of development. The appointment of Donal O'Connor as Chairman together with a new Chief Executive augurs well for the Bank and for all its stakeholders. It gives the Bank fresh impetus and an upward trajectory. I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their intense commitment and honest endeavour and for their friendship over the last 15 years.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1219/breaking45.html?via=rel|title=Anglo Irish Bank statement on Drumm resignation|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''The Irish Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 7 January 2009, Willie McAteer resigned his position as finance director and chief risk officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0107/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo Irish loses another director|date=7 January 2009|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial Regulator===
Following reports of a communication breakdown at the office of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the [[Financial Regulator]] Patrick Neary on 9 January 2009 announced his decision to retire as of 31 January that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0109/nearyp.html|title=Neary to retire as Financial Regulator|date=9 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111100225/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0109/nearyp.html|archivedate= 11 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neary's weakness in dealing with the issue has received much criticism, with [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] Senator [[Dan Boyle (politician)|Dan Boyle]] calling for a strengthening of powers within the organisation and saying that confidence in Irish financial services had been eroded by events of the previous six months. Financial observers indicated that a replacement for Neary might have to be located in the United States or in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0110/finance.html|title=Greens call for stronger finance regulator|date=10 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110204138/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0110/finance.html| archivedate=10 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also reports that the Financial Regulator may have known of the loans for eight years prior to their revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0124/1232474679328.html?via=mr|title=Regulator may have known of loans to FitzPatrick for eight years|date=24 January 2009|accessdate=24 January 2009|publisher=''The Irish Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton called for the board and senior management of the Financial Regulator to be sacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0222/breaking46.htm|work=The Irish Times|title=Financial Regulator board should be sacked|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Regulator hired a partner from Ernst &amp; Young, to advise on the €440 billion bank guarantee scheme in January 2009, despite the fact that serious questions have been asked about why Ernst &amp; Young did not spot the massive loans that former chief executive Seán FitzPatrick concealed from his shareholders for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/01/18/story38836.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914154355/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/01/18/story38836.asp |archivedate=14 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consultants [[Mazars]], which reviewed their operations said "that regulatory expertise was lacking in some areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/top-watchdog-job-to-be-split-three-ways-in-regulatory-overhaul-1793401.html|work=Irish Independent|first=Joe|last=Brennan|title=Top watchdog job to be split three ways in regulatory overhaul|date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish Nationwide===
On the evening of 17 February 2009, the Chairman of the building society [[Irish Nationwide]], Dr Michael Walsh, resigned his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/irishnationwide.html|title=Irish Nationwide Chairman resigns|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=17 February 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219161741/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/irishnationwide.html|archivedate=19 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dublin Airport Authority===
On the evening of 24 February 2009, the chairman of the [[Dublin Airport Authority]] (DAA), [[Gary McGann]], announced his decision to step down from the board, stating that his decision had been influenced by his former non-executive directorship of Anglo Irish Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0224/breaking76.htm|title=McGann steps down as chairman of DAA|date=24 February 2009|accessdate=24 February 2009|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome and nationalisation==
Anglo Irish Bank has said it would review its policy on directors' loans following FitzPatrick's resignation. The [[Financial Regulator]] announced he would be examining the loans issued by Anglo Irish Bank to all its directors, claiming he became aware of the existence of the loans "following an inspection earlier this year". Ultimately he became a victim of the controversy and subsequently announced his retirement.

The [[Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board]] (CARB) undertook an investigation into the "circumstances around the issue of inappropriate directors' loans at Anglo Irish"and into the performance of Ernst and Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carb.ie/uploads/John%20Purcell%20Appointment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317220157/http://www.carb.ie/uploads/John%20Purcell%20Appointment.pdf |archivedate=17 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Association of Investment Managers]] expressed how it was "surprised and disappointed" at the controversy and announced it would be writing to Anglo's new chairman to describe its worries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1219/breaking13.html?via=mr|title=Drumm resigns as chief executive of Anglo Irish|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish State subsequently announced it was to become the majority shareholder in Anglo Irish Bank by injecting €3 billion into the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1220/1229728408863.html?via=rel|title=State plans €3bn capital injection into Anglo Irish Bank|date=20 December 2008|accessdate=20 December 2008|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition party [[Fine Gael]] opposed this move and stated on 14 January 2009 that the bank should be shut down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0114/banks.html|title=FG to oppose Anglo Irish recapitalisation|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=16 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115144251/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0114/banks.html|archivedate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the following evening the Irish government announced that recapitalisation was no longer a serious option and nationalised the bank instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0115/banks.html|title=Govt to take control of Anglo Irish Bank|date=15 January 2009|accessdate=16 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090116112513/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0115/banks.html|archivedate=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0116/1232059654021.html?via=rel Government nationalises 'fragile' Anglo Irish Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; Lenihan stated that "clear blue water" had been inserted between the old and new versions of Anglo and defended the nationalisation by saying that if the government were to let the bank fail it would be saying to Ireland and other economies that the country was "closed for business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0116/anglo2-business.html|title=Lenihan defends Anglo takeover move|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-01-16|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an Emergency General Meeting held at the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]], [[Dublin]] on 16 January 2009, the bank's shareholders angrily voiced their opinions on FitzPatrick's involvement in the bank's downfall and their lack of confidence in the banking sector.

===Legislation===
{{further|Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009}}
Emergency legislation to nationalise the bank, titled the [[Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009]], was voted through [[Dáil Éireann]], being approved by 79 &amp;ndash; 67 before passing in [[Seanad Éireann]] without a vote on 20 January 2009. During the Seanad's debate on the bill, Senator [[Shane Ross]] claimed that "no-one was being told the truth about Anglo Irish Bank" and called the EGM of the previous Friday "a disgrace show[ing] corporate Ireland at its worst, as there were no answers to any questions". Senator [[Joe O'Toole]] advocated the chasing of those responsible for the bank's nationalisation "even into the courts", saying that a person could be imprisoned for failure to pay a household bill, yet those who caused the loss of jobs and pensions might not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0120/angloirish.html|title=Dáil votes to nationalise Anglo Irish|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203113936/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0120/angloirish.html|archivedate=3 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Mary McAleese then signed the Anglo Irish Bank Bill at Áras an Uachtaráin the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0121/angloirish.html|title=McAleese signs Anglo Irish Bank Bill|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090124000047/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0121/angloirish.html|archivedate=24 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discussion ===
The bank's internal auditors appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs on 3 February 2009 to discuss the nationalisation of [[Anglo Irish Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0129/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo Irish auditors to be questioned|date=2009-01-29|accessdate=2009-02-05|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank's head of internal audit, Walter Tyrrell, told the Oireachtas committee that the movement of loans by Seán FitzPatrick into the bank and back out again could only have been known by FitzPatrick himself and the executive of his account, claiming that loans were tested by means of random sampling and that FitzPatrick's loans had not once been selected - however one loan he held with a partner was chosen. Fine Gael's [[Kieran O'Donnell]] expressed his amazement that each of the directors' loans were not tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0203/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo director loans 'tested randomly'|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-02-05|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2009, Lenihan revealed plans under which €3.5 billion ($4.5 billion, £3.1 billion) each would be provided by the government's purchase of [[Option (finance)#Long call|options]] intended to re-capitalise Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7884925.stm|title=Rescue plan for Ireland's banks|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2009-02-12|publisher=[[BBC]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090213134314/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7884925.stm| archivedate= 13 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

=== Review ===
The Financial Regulator, on the recommendation of the Irish Finance Minister, ordered an "urgent review" of directors' loans at Anglo Irish Bank, saying it has a "very serious view" of the issue. It claimed the loans were "first brought to its attention on December 17th 2008" and that a committee had been established to investigate the matter. Irish [[Minister for Social Protection|Minister for Social and Family Affairs]] [[Mary Hanafin]] said the Financial Regulator had "serious questions" to answer over its supposed lack of knowledge of the loans and the Irish [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] [[John Gormley]] asked the Financial Regulator to explain what he termed "extraordinary complacency" in relation to the situation at Anglo Irish Bank. The opposition party [[Fine Gael]]'s deputy leader and finance representative [[Richard Bruton]] quizzed the Minister for Finance on his announcement that he would provide the necessary capital to Anglo Irish Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1220/breaking24.htm|title=IFSRA board orders urgent review into Anglo loans|date=2008-12-20|accessdate=2008-12-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further Hidden Loans (Deposits) Controversy Involving Irish Life &amp; Permanent ===
On 12 February 2009, details of a further controversial transaction which had the effect of misrepresenting the end-of-year accounts of Anglo-Irish Bank came into the public domain. Anglo-Irish Bank lent €4bn to Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P) for 1 day by way of inter-bank loan, and a subsidiary of Irish Life placed a deposit of a similar amount with Anglo, which was recorded as a customer deposit.

'''''Brown v. Mississippi''''', 297 U.S. 278 (1936), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that ruled that a defendant's involuntary [[confession (legal)|confession]] that is extracted by police violence cannot be entered as evidence and violates the [[Due process#Due process in the United States|Due Process Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment.

==Facts of the case==
Raymond Stuart, a white planter, was murdered in [[Kemper County, Mississippi]] on March 30, 1934. Arthur Ellington, Ed Brown, and Henry Shields, three black [[tenant farmers]], were arrested for his murder. At the trial, the prosecution's principal evidence was the defendants' confessions to police officers. During the trial, however, prosecution witnesses freely admitted that the defendants confessed only after being subjected to brutal whippings by the officers.  

One defendant had also been subjected to being strung up by his neck from a tree in addition to the whippings. The confessions were nevertheless admitted into evidence, and were the only evidence used in the subsequent one-day trial. The defendants were convicted by a jury and sentenced to be hanged. The convictions were affirmed by the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] on appeal.
.

==Judgment==
In a unanimous decision, the Court reversed the convictions of the [[defendant]]s. The opinion was delivered by Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes|Hughes]] who wrote that "the transcript reads more like pages torn from some medieval account than a record made within the confines of a modern civilization." It held that a defendant's [[confession (legal)|confession]] that was extracted by police violence cannot be entered as evidence and violates the [[Due process#Due process in the United States|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment.]]

==Aftermath==
Upon remand from the United States Supreme Court, the three defendants pleaded [[nolo contendere]] to manslaughter rather than risk a retrial. They were however sentenced to six months, two and one-half years, and seven and one-half years in prison, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Neil R. McMillen, Dark Journey: Black Mississippians in the Age of Jim Crow, at 200 (University of Illinois Press 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutor at the trial level, [[John Stennis]], later served forty-two years as a United States senator. He ran for office in Mississippi thirteen times and never lost.

'''Compassion &amp; Choices''' is a [[nonprofit]] organization in the United States working to improve patient rights and individual choice at the end of life, including access to [[medical aid in dying]]. Its primary function is advocating for and ensuring access to end-of-life options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Role of non-governmental organisations in physician assisted suicide |first1=Stephen J |last1=Ziegler |first2=Georg |last2=Bosshard |work=[[British Medical Journal]] |date=10 February 2007 |volume=334 |issue=7588 |page=295 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39100.417072.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;the organization has worked for recognition of a difference between the terms "assisted suicide" and "legal physician aid in dying" in the criminal code. For example, Oregon law draws a distinction between "suicide" and "aid in dying" for criminal purposes.

Compassion &amp; Choices is the successor to the [[Hemlock Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compassionandchoices.org/learn/timeline?searched=Hemlock&amp;highlight=ajaxSearch_highlight+ajaxSearch_highlight1|title=End of Life Planning and Paliative Care - Compassion &amp; Choices|work=compassionandchoices.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Compassion In Dying Federation; the organizations merged in 2007. The organization maintains staff in New York, the District of Columbia, California, Washington State (they dismissed WA state staff in 2016; the local org is independent and unaffiliated) Oregon, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, Colorado, Vermont and New Jersey.

==End-of-life consultation program==
Compassion &amp; Choices provides end-of-life consultation for dying patients and their families at no cost. Professional consultants and trained volunteers work by phone or in person to offer assistance in completing [[advance directives]], make referrals to local services including [[hospice]] and illness-specific support groups, advice on adequate pain and symptom management, and information on safe, effective and legal methods for aid in dying.

The organization's work is highlighted in the documentary film ''[[How to Die in Oregon]]'' which won the 2011 Grand Jury Prize&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/philly-nurse-exonerated-assisted-death-father/story?id=22495434 |title=Philly Nurse Exonerated in Assisted Death of Her Terminally Ill Father |first1=Susan Donaldson |last1=James |date=February 13, 2014 |publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

==Access campaigns==
Compassion &amp; Choices integrates medical aid in dying into healthcare by implementing and normalizing them into the standard of care after laws are passed in individual states.

==Legal advocacy==
Compassion &amp; Choices litigates patient cases related to ensuring adequate end-of-life care and choice. Through litigation, Compassion &amp; Choices protects terminally ill patients' rights to receive pain and symptom management, to voluntarily stop life-sustaining treatments, to request and receive [[palliative sedation]], and to choose [[aid in dying]] under state and federal constitutional protections.

===Vacco v. Quill===
In 1997, [[Vacco v. Quill]] legitimized palliative sedation as a recognized medical practice.

===Washington v. Glucksberg===
In 1997, [[Washington v. Glucksberg]] emphasized that it was up to states to legalize aid in dying.

===Sampson v. Alaska===

===Gonzales v. Oregon===
C&amp;C represented 16 terminally ill patient-plaintiffs at the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Gonzales v. Oregon]]'', defeating the Bush administration's challenge to [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act|Oregon's Death with Dignity Act]] in January 2006.

===Baxter v. Montana===
[[Baxter v. Montana]] authorized medical aid in dying in Montana.

===Morris v. New Mexico===

'''Diligence''' in [[Scots Law]] is a process; an execution.

The term has several usages in legal proceedings involving creditors and debtors:
*'''''Diligence Against the Heritage''''' - A [[writ of execution]] by which the creditor proceeds against the [[real estate]] of the debtor.
*'''''Diligence Incident''''' - a writ ordering witnesses and others having information to provide testimony and answer questions.
*'''''Diligence to Examine Havers''''' - A process to obtain information from those who have it (hence, "havers"), and who must bring records, etc. with them to be examined.
*'''''Diligence Against the Person''''' - A [[writ of execution]], by which the creditor proceeds against the person of the debtor.
*'''''Second Diligence''''' - Second letters issued where the first have been disregarded (similar to a [[contempt of court]] citation).
*'''''Summary Diligence''''' - Diligence issued in a summary manner, like an execution of a [[Power of attorney|warrant of attorney]].
*'''''Diligence Against Witnesses''''' - Process to compel the attendance of witnesses.

The definition was taken from the source.

'''Eco-communalism''' (shorthand for "ecological [[communalism]]") is an environmental philosophy based on ideals of [[simple living]], [[self-sufficiency]], [[sustainability]], and [[local economy|local economies]]. Eco-communalists envision a future in which the economic system of [[capitalism]] is replaced with a global web of economically interdependent and interconnected small local [[commune]]s. Decentralized government, a focus on [[agriculture]], [[biodiversity]], and [[green economics]] are all tenets of eco-communalism.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==History==
Eco-communalism finds its roots in a diverse set of ideologies. These include the "pastoral reaction to industrialization of [[William Morris]] and the nineteenth-century social utopians (Thompson, 1993); the [[Small Is Beautiful]]  twentieth century philosophy of [[E.F. Schumacher]] (1972); and the traditionalism of [[Gandhi]] (1993)"&lt;ref name='GT'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gtinitiative.org/resources/gtessay.html |title=Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead. |publisher=Gtinitiative.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720190655/http://www.gtinitiative.org/resources/gtessay.html |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|18}}

The term eco-communalism was first coined by the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), which was convened in 1995 by [[Paul Raskin]], president of the [[Tellus Institute]]. The GSG set out to describe and analyze scenarios for the future of the earth as it entered a [[Planetary Phase of Civilization]]. The GSG's [[scenario analysis]] resulted in a series of reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsg.org/gsgpub.html |title=Global Scenario Group: Publications and reports on alternative visions of globalization |publisher=Gsg.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-communalism took shape in 2002 as one of six possible future scenarios put forth in the GSG's 99-page essay entitled "Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead." This founding document describes eco-communalism as a "vision of a better life" which turns to "non-material dimensions of fulfillment – the quality of life, the quality of human solidarity and the quality of the earth".&lt;ref name='GT'/&gt;{{Rp|42}}

==Alternative scenarios==
The eco-communalist vision is only part of [[Global Scenario Group|GSG]]'s scenario analysis in the Great Transition essay which is organized into three categories. The first, Conventional Worlds, sees [[capitalist]] values maintained and only market forces and incremental policy reform trying to curb environmental degradation. The second, Barbarization, is one in which environmental collapse leads to an overall [[societal collapse]]. The third, [[Great Transition]], is a pathway that includes the "social revolution of eco-communalism" (October 2005 Monthly Review John Bellamy Foster) which finds humanity changing its relationship with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greattransition.org|title=Great Transition Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-communalists would be actors in a broader [[global citizens movement]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Real-world application==
Eco-communalism has taken root all over the globe on different levels. Towns such as [[Auroville]], [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]], and the [[Federation of Damanhur]] attempt to provide an environmentally low impact way of life. Larger groups such as the [[Findhorn Foundation]] provide education to help new communes form. In addition, all of these groups and more are collaborators in the [[Global Ecovillage Network]]; which strives to support eco-communalism worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Fractional ownership''' is a method in which several unrelated parties can share in, and mitigate the risk of, [[ownership]] of a high-value tangible asset, usually a jet, yacht or piece of resort real estate. It can be done for strictly monetary reasons, but typically there is some amount of personal access involved. One of the main motivators for a fractional purchase is the ability to share the costs of maintaining an asset that will not be used full-time by one owner.

Every fractional endeavour requires some sort of management, to administer the rules and regulations (which are agreed upon before the fraction is purchased) and maintain the asset to the degree laid out in the ownership documents. Generally, management will oversee the daily operation of more than one property, although it is not necessary. A single fractional asset may be managed by a single entity.
Each owner is guaranteed a prescribed amount of access to the asset, which typically can be used or offered to the public as rental or charter, the income is usually split between the management company and the fractional owner, unless the owner finds the renter himself.
Additionally, each owner pays a portion of the annual management fees and maintenance, relative to the percent of ownership.

While Richard Santuilli is generally credited with launching the concept for business jets, individuals have been setting up LLCs to buy boats or planes or "a little cabin in the woods" for decades. Michael Aumock was instrumental in setting up fractional devices in the yachting and superyacht industry.

In [[business]], '''fractional ownership''' is a percentage [[Share (finance)|share]] of an expensive [[asset]]. Shares are sold to individual owners. Typically, a company manages the asset on behalf of the owners, who pay monthly/annual fees for the management plus variable (e.g., per-hour, per-day) use fees. For rapidly depreciating assets, the management company may sell the asset and distribute the proceeds back to the owners, who can then claim a [[capital loss]] and optionally purchase a fraction of a new asset.

Whether fractional ownership provides a financial advantage over renting is an ongoing debate, and some countries and regions have tax laws that provide additional benefits for owners, such as capital-loss allowances, while others might penalize ownership over renting.

==Aviation==
Fractional ownership offers an individual or company the option to purchase a share of an aircraft. Shares from as little as 1/16 of an aircraft, which offers approximately 50 hours of flight time per year, to 1/2 of an aircraft can be purchased, depending on the needs of the operator.  The most common amounts purchased usually range from about 1/8 to 1/4 (approximately 200 flight hours per year) of an aircraft.&lt;ref name=aopa_frax&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = Fractional Ownership
 | journal = AOPA Pilot Magazine
 | date = 2005-02-17| url = http://www.aopa.org/members/files/topics/fractional_overview.html
 | accessdate = 2010-12-09}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the owner takes title of the portion of their investment, they are not assigned to a dedicated aircraft for usage.  Instead, they are given access to a pool of similar aircraft, and therefore, theoretically, an owner may never actually fly on their titled jet.

Co-owners (referred to as ‘owners’) of a fractional program's aircraft are required to pay a percentage of the aircraft’s purchase price that is proportionate to the number of hours they wish to fly per year, for the duration of their contract – typically 5 years.  In addition to the price, there are fees charged for all occupied flight hours (that fluctuate with changes in fuel prices), as well as monthly fixed-management fees that cover maintenance and administration of the program.  In return, the customer receives a predetermined number of hours in the aircraft of their choice, based on the owner’s needs and the amount they are willing to pay.  Fractional owners are guaranteed that this aircraft, or another aircraft of the same model or comparable aircraft type, will be available 24 hours a day, 365 days per year, with as little as four hours notice.&lt;ref name=aopa_frax/&gt;  In addition, the management company provides all scheduling, flight planning, staffing, catering, maintenance, communications, and insurance services.  A fractional owner simply picks up the phone, calls a dispatcher, requests a flight, and drives to the airport.

===History===
The term fractional ownership originally became popular for [[business jet]]s. Richard Santulli of [[NetJets]] pioneered the concept of allowing businesses to purchase shares in a jet to reduce costs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  With a [[Fractional Jets|fractional jet]] plan, members will typically fly in any jet available, not necessarily the one in which they own shares.  The management company will reposition jets as necessary and provide flight crews.  Companies with greater needs purchase larger shares to get access to more time.

The fractional ownership concept has since been extended to smaller aircraft and now has become common for single-engine piston aircraft like the [[Cirrus SR22]], which are beyond the financial means of many private pilots. The same concepts apply, except that the management company may not provide flight crews nor reposition the aircraft.

Many pilots get together to buy light aircraft in a privately bought and managed fractional ownership, this is often known as group flying.

Fractional ownership has played a significant role in revitalizing the [[general aviation]] manufacturing industry since the late 1990s, and most manufacturers actively support fractional ownership programs.

==Fractional property ownership==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}
Fractional [[ownership]] simply means the division of any [[asset]] into [[portions or shares]]. If the “asset” is a property, the title or [[deed]] can be legally divided into shares. In certain instances this is done by creating a "mezzanine structure", i.e., creating a company which owns the property then allowing multiple owners or investors to own shares in the company. Those shares can then be purchased and owned by more than one individual. The reasons for a "mezzanine structure" can vary.  Two common reasons are to allow transfer of shares without the need to reflect changes on the title or deed to the property, and for tax benefits.

Another type of fractional ownership, not part of a securitized business plan is Tenancy in Common, which is grounded in the real property laws of most, if not all states. The main difference is there is no right of survivorship to the sponsor or other owners if one or more of owners were to pass away. Where there are similarities with the equal sharing of operational expenses, rental income and access, the striking difference is free transferability of the owner's interest in the property without regard to the other owners in the property. 

Shared ownership of the property and its deed will also entitle shareholders to certain usage rights, usually in the form of weeks. Conceptually, fractional ownership is ''not'' the same as [[timeshare]]. Fractional ownership affords much of the freedom and usage benefits offered in timeshare, however, the fundamental difference with fractional ownership is that the purchaser owns ''part of the title'' (as opposed to units of "time"). Therefore, if the property appreciates in value, then so do the shares. As with whole ownership, fractional owners can sell whenever they deem necessary or prudent, releasing the capital growth from their "[[bricks &amp; mortar]]" [[investment]].

==Real property ==
The practice of joining together with family and friends to share ownership of vacation property has been around for many years. But the fractional property industry started in the U.S. in the [[Rocky Mountains]] ski resorts in the early 1990s. These first fractional developments recognized that people did not want to buy whole homes, which they would use only for a few weeks a year in the mountains. According to research firm Ragatz Associates, there were over 312 fractional developments in North America in 2017.&lt;ref name="ragatz"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58cf1f5cd2b85767b5727402/t/5aaabaad88251b5a1678dfa9/1521138349403/2018RagatzExecSumm.pdf |title=Executive Summary: The Shared Ownership Resort Real Estate Industry in North America 2018 |publisher=Ragatz Associates |format=PDF |access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Mountain region has the majority of active fractional property available, with the U.S. Pacific region next. The prevalent leisure activity for owners of fractional property in the U.S. Mountain region is skiing. In 2018, the most common fractional size available for purchase in North America is a one-fourth ownership, giving owners three months of total annual visit usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://luxuryfractionalguide.com/fractional-ownership-availability-u-s-2018-analysis/ |title=Fractional Ownership Availability In The U.S., 2018 Analysis |author=Ragatz Associates | publisher=Luxury Fractional Guide |access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the USA a non-commercial form of fractional ownership has been in existence for several decades. In this form, otherwise unconnected individuals (rather than family or friends) form private syndicates to purchase, for example, vacation property or boats. These syndicates operate as private member groups with small numbers on a non-profit basis, generally just sharing expenses and usage. These groups can involve assets ranging from modest apartments or condominium-type properties to multimillion-euro / dollar properties, and leverage their ability to make collective purchases of additional assets such as boats or vehicles as additional facilities while retaining control entirely within the membership of the group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The popularity of the term ''fractional ownership'' has caused extensive [[rebranding]] in other industries where similar concepts, such as real estate [[timeshare]]s, were already well established. The main distinction between timeshare and fractional ownership is that with a timeshare you buy the right to use a property, but with fractional ownership, you are buying real estate. You get a deeded piece of real estate, just not for the entire parcel.&lt;ref name="OrsiDoskow2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Janelle Orsi|author2=Emily Doskow|title=The Sharing Solution: How to Save Money, Simplify Your Life &amp; Build Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6utl5IWTV6QC&amp;pg=PA168|accessdate=5 November 2011|date=24 May 2009|publisher=Nolo|isbn=978-1-4133-1021-4|pages=168–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractional ownership divides a property into more affordable segments for individuals and also matches an individual's ownership time to their actual usage time. A fractional share gives the owners certain privileges, such as a number of days or weeks when they can use the property. Occasionally, the property is sold after a predetermined time, distributing the relative proceeds back to the owners. A few private owner-groups have developed highly sophisticated usage allocation schemes and other features based on the principle of attempting to get as close as possible to the flexibility of individual ownership, and only compromising this to the minimum extent necessary to accommodate multiple owners. In such schemes, the basic agreement is between the members themselves, whereas in most commercial fractional ownership schemes, the owner's principal relationship is with the property developer and/or promoter of the scheme.

=== Private residence clubs ===
Private residence clubs are the luxury, high end of the fractional property market. The research firm Ragatz Associates defines a private residence club as a fractional property that sells at a price of USD 1,000 per square foot or higher.&lt;ref name="ragatz" /&gt; Private residence clubs provide the services and amenities of five-star hotels, and some of the luxury hotel groups run their own clubs. Occasionally, membership in a private residence club grants to its member only the right to usage of the club properties and services, without ownership rights in the properties themselves. Note that a private residence club is different from a [[destination club]], although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

In addition to luxury private residence clubs, single "stand-alone" vacation homes and condos can be converted to fractional ownership. This fractional home conversion process can be accomplished by any knowledgeable seller or through a fractional consulting company. The benefit of fractional home conversion includes the ability of the homeowner to keep a portion of the ownership for themselves, pay off debt and reduce expenses.

A key aspect for any fractional owner is to understand their usage rights and the reservation plans. These vary from property to property. Some offer fixed occupancy periods in which an owner uses the same time each year. Some offer "floating" periods, in which the occupancy times rotate throughout the year, and some offer a mixture of these, with some time fixed and some floating.

Another variation in the business model is what are called "destination resorts".  These are typically properties, whether hotel rooms, suites, or freestanding villas, located on property owned and managed by a hotel developer, and which provide amenities typically expected of a high-class hotel or resort. Some hotels are also developed as a [[condo-hotel]], in which individual rooms are sold off to individual owners.&lt;ref name="IndMillion"&gt;{{cite web

==Sports cars==
Individuals may now purchase fractional shares of high-end sports cars, including some of the world's most exclusive exotic car brands such as [[Bugatti]], [[Maybach]], [[Porsche]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Maserati]], [[Ferrari]], [[Aston Martin]], and [[Koenigsegg]]. Such expensive automobiles, when owned by individuals, typically spend the majority of their time in storage, with high annual ownership costs.  Fractional shares distributes these annual costs across several owners, who pay for and benefit from the asset.

==Other areas==
Fractional ownership is also beginning to appear for luxury items such as small [[yacht]]s and [[Luxury yacht|megayachts]], jet aircraft (especially [[business jet]]s) and high-end motor homes.

Fractional yacht / boat ownership provides marine enthusiasts with ownership of shares in yachts of all sizes and uses. Some programs sell actual equity in the watercraft and others sell "membership," where the members' dues provide access to the boats, but no ownership. Fractional yacht companies sell shares/membership in small motor boats, sailboats, mid-range yachts all the way to the megayachts for day-use, multi-year contracts, or charter-like arrangements.&lt;ref name="IndMillion" /&gt;

The '''[[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) number''' is a unique reference for ships, registered ship owners and management companies. IMO numbers were introduced to improve maritime safety and security and to reduce maritime fraud. They consist of the three letters "IMO" followed by unique seven-digit numbers, assigned under the [[SOLAS Convention|International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS).&lt;ref name="IMO circular 1886"&gt;{{cite web |title=IMO identification number scheme |url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/MSAS/Pages/IMO-identification-number-scheme.aspx |publisher=International Maritime Organization |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="circ1886.6"&gt;{{cite letter |url=http://www.iuuwatch.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FINAL-Circular-Letter-No.-No.1886-Rev.6-Implementation-Of-Resolution-A.107828-IMO-Ship-Identification-Number-Scheme-Secretariat.pdf |subject=Implementation of resolution A.1078(28) - IMO ship identification number scheme |publisher=International Maritime Organization |recipient=All IMO Member States |date=8 August 2016 |id=Circular Letter No.1886/Rev.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[History]]==
=== IMO resolution (2018) ===
In 1987 the IMO adopted resolution A.600(15), aimed at the "enhancement of maritime safety and pollution prevention and the prevention of maritime fraud" by assigning to each ship a permanent identification number.&lt;ref name="IMO1988"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=w74-3TbkCAkC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17 |chapter=Resolution A.600(15): IMO Ship Identification Number Scheme |title=Resolutions and Other Decisions (Resolutions 596 - 635): Assembly, Fifteenth Session, 9-20 November 1987 |publisher=International Maritime Organization |pages=17-20 |year=1988 |isbn=92-801-1234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMO number remains linked to the hull for its lifetime, regardless of changes of names, flags, or owners. The IMO adopted the existing unique 7-digit numbers applied to ships by [[Lloyd's Register]] since 1969, which were modified from 6-digit numbers introduced in 1963.&lt;ref name="LR-IMO2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.lr.org/l/12702/2016-07-08/32s57r/12702/146368/45_IMO_nos.pdf |title=Infosheet No. 45: Lloyd's Register/International Maritime Organisation Numbers |publisher=Lloyd's Register |date=11 July 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SOLAS regulation (1994) ===
SOLAS regulation XI/3, which was adopted in 1994 and came into force on 1 January 1996, made IMO numbers mandatory. It was applied to cargo vessels that are at least 300 [[Gross tonnage|gross tons]] (gt) and passenger vessels of at least 100 gt.&lt;ref name="IMO circular 1886" /&gt;

In the SOLAS Convention, "cargo ships" means "ships which are not passenger ships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classnk.or.jp/hp/tech_info/tech_img/T505e.pdf |title=Amendments to SOLAS Conventions |publisher=Class NK |accessdate=20 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140726022753/http://www.classnk.or.jp/hp/tech_info/tech_img/T505e.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMO scheme does not however apply to:&lt;ref name="IMO circular 1886" /&gt;
* Vessels solely engaged in fishing
* Ships without mechanical means of propulsion
* Pleasure yachts
* Ships engaged on special service (e.g. [[lightvessel|lightships]], [[Search and rescue|SAR]] vessels)
* [[Hopper barge]]s
* [[Hydrofoil]]s, [[Hovercraft|air cushion vehicles]]
* [[Floating dry dock|Floating docks]] and structures classified in a similar manner
* Ships of war and troopships
* Wooden ships

=== Security Enhancements 2002 ===
In December 2002, the [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code|Diplomatic Conference on Maritime Security]] adopted a number of measures aimed at enhancing security of ships and port facilities. This included a modification to SOLAS Regulation XI-1/3 to require ships' identification numbers to be permanently marked in a visible place either on the ship's hull or superstructure as well as internally and on the ship's certificates. Passenger ships should also carry the marking on a horizontal surface visible from the air.&lt;ref name="IMO circular 1886" /&gt;

=== Company and Registered Owner Regulation 2005 ===
In May 2005, IMO adopted a new SOLAS regulation XI-1/3-1 on the mandatory company and registered owner identification number scheme, with entry into force on 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IMO International Convention Calendar |url=http://www.classnk.or.jp/hp/en/imo_conv_schedule/conv_schedule_list.aspx?List_Category=2.%20SECURITY |publisher=Class NK |accessdate=20 March 2013 |date=25 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303220739/http://www.classnk.or.jp/hp/en/imo_conv_schedule/conv_schedule_list.aspx?List_Category=2.%20SECURITY |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation provides that every ship owner and management company shall have a unique identification number. Other amendments require these numbers to be added to the relevant certificates and documents in the [[International Safety Management Code]] (ISM) and the [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code]] (ISPS).&lt;ref name="IMO circular 1886" /&gt; Like the IMO ship identification number, the company identification number is a seven-digit number with the prefix IMO. For example, for the ship [[Atlantic Star (cruise ship)|''Atlantic Star'']] ({{IMO Number|8024026}}), IMO 5304986 referred to the former ship manager [[Pullmantur Cruises]] Ship Management Ltd and IMO 5364264 to her former owner, Pullmantur Cruises Empress Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{csr|register=E|id=8024026|shipname=Atlantic Star|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assignment ==
IMO identification numbers for ships, companies and registered owners are assigned by [[IHS Markit]] (previously [[Fairplay_(magazine)#Internet_Age|Lloyd's Register-Fairplay]]&lt;ref name="IMO circular 1886" /&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imonumbers.lrfairplay.com/Home/About |title=IMO Identification Numbers for Ships, Companies and Registered Owners / About |publisher=IHS Markit |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For new vessels, the IMO number is assigned to a hull during construction, generally upon keel laying.  Many vessels which fall outside the mandatory requirements of SOLAS have numbers allocated by Lloyd's Register or IHS Markit in the same numerical series, including fishing vessels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/18021/en |title=Unique Vessel Identifier (UVI) - Global Record |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial yachts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihsfairplay.com/about/imo_standards/imo_standards.html |title=Setting Industry Standards |publisher=IHS Fairplay |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
An IMO number is made of the three letters "IMO" followed by a seven-digit number. This consists of a six-digit sequential unique number followed by a [[check digit]]. The integrity of an IMO number can be verified using its check digit. This is done by multiplying each of the first six digits by a factor of ''2'' to ''7'' corresponding to their position from right to left. The rightmost digit of this sum is the check digit. For example, for IMO 907472'''9''': (9&amp;times;''7'') + (0&amp;times;''6'') + (7&amp;times;''5'') + (4&amp;times;''4'') + (7&amp;times;''3'') + (2&amp;times;''2'') = 13'''9'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tarkistusmerkit.teppovuori.fi/coden.htm |title=How to compute check characters for Coden and IMO Number |work=Teppovuori.fi |first=Teppo |last=Vuori |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lrit.emsa.europa.eu/lritdb/UserManual/index.html?errormessagestable.htm |title=Error messages table |work=LRIT DB User Manual |publisher=European Maritime Safety Agency |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement''' (IRSSA) is an agreement between the [[Government of Canada]] and approximately 86,000 [[Native Canadian]]s who at some point were enrolled as children in the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]], a system which was in place between 1879 and 1996.&lt;ref name="AFN_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.afn.ca/uploads/files/residential_schools/personal_credits_presentation.pdf |format=PDF |title=Personal Credits for Personal or Group Education Services |accessdate=4 June 2015 |year=2014 |work=Assembly of First Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} The IRSSA recognized the damage inflicted by the residential schools and established a $2 billion compensation package for all former IRS students and, in particular, those who had been abused or otherwise harmed.&lt;ref name="CBC_News_2008a"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/a-timeline-of-residential-schools-the-truth-and-reconciliation-commission-1.724434 |title=A timeline of residential schools, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission |work=CBC News |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=4 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="residentialschoolsettlement" /&gt; The agreement, announced in 2006, was the largest class action settlement in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="AFN_2014" /&gt;{{rp|1}} As of December 2012 a total of $1.62 billion has been paid to 78,750 former students.&lt;ref name=valcourt&gt;{{citation |title=Bernard Valcourt at the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Committee |url=https://openparliament.ca/committees/aboriginal-affairs/41-1/63/bernard-valcourt-21/ |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=4 June 2015 |first=Bernard |last=Valcourt |work=Open Parliament }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the IRSSA==
In November 1996 the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] (RCAP) issued its final 4,000-page report with 440 recommendations. Indian residential schools were the topic of one chapter.&lt;ref name="CBC_News_2008a" /&gt; In 1998 in response to the RCAP the [[Canadian federal government]] unveiled ''Gathering Strength: Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan'',&lt;ref name="diand_1997"&gt;{{citation |last=DIAND|location=Ottawa, Ontario |year= 1997 |title=Gathering Strength-Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan |isbn= 0-662-26427-4 |publisher=Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development/Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} a "long-term, broad-based policy approach in response to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples which included the "Statement of Reconciliation: Learning from the Past," in which the "Government of Canada recognizes and apologizes to those who experienced physical and sexual abuse at Indian residential schools and acknowledges its role in the development and administration of residential schools."&lt;ref name="aadnc_1998"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015725/1100100015726 |title=the Honourable Jane Stewart Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on the occasion of the unveiling of Gathering Strength — Canada’s Aboriginal Action Plan |work=Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) |location=Ottawa, Ontario |date=7 January 1998 |accessdate=4 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the federal Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada was created to manage and resolve the large number of abuse claims filed by former students against the federal government.   In 2004, an Assembly of First Nations Report on Canada’s Dispute Resolution Plan to Compensate for Abuses in Indian Residential Schools led to discussions to develop a holistic, fair and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian Residential Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/pdfs/Backgrounder_E.pdf|title=Backgrounder|last=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|first=|date=n.d.|website=|publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|access-date=July 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 2005 the Canadian federal government announced the IRSSA compensation package.&lt;ref name="CBC_News_2008a" /&gt; It represents the largest class-action lawsuit in Canadian history. On 11 June 2008, Prime Minister Harper "apologized on behalf of the Government of Canada, and all Canadians, for the forcible removal of Aboriginal children from their homes and communities to attend Indian residential schools. In this historic Apology, the Prime Minister recognized that there is no room in Canada for the attitudes that created the residential school system to prevail."&lt;ref name="GC_2015"&gt;{{citation |title=Statement made in the House of Commons by the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development |url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=982529&amp;tp=980 |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=4 June 2015 |work=Government of Canada |location=Ottawa, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of the IRSSA==

The agreement was announced by the Canadian federal government on 8 May 2006 with implementation in September 2007. The five main components of the IRSSA are the Common Experience Payment (CEP), Independent Assessment Process (IAP), the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), Commemoration, and Health and Healing Services.&lt;ref name="residentialschoolsettlement"&gt;{{citation |title=The Indian residential schools settlement has been approved |url=http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/detailed_notice.pdf |format=PDF |work=Residential School Settlement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common Experience Payment (CEP) ===
The IRSSA offered former students blanket compensation through the Common Experience Payment (CEP) with an average lump-sum payment of $28,000. The CEP, a component of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, totaling $1.9 billion, was "part of an overall holistic and comprehensive response to the Indian residential school legacy." Payments were higher for more serious cases of abuse.&lt;ref name="AFN_2014" /&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="CBC_2015"&gt;{{citation | title=GG relaunches Truth and Reconciliation Commission |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/gg-relaunches-truth-and-reconciliation-commission-1.805247 |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=4 June 2015 |work=CBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEP recognized "the experience of living at an Indian Residential School(s) and its impacts. All former students who resided at a recognized Indian Residential School(s) and were alive on May 30, 2005 were eligible for the CEP. This include[d] First Nations, Métis, and Inuit former students."&lt;ref name="residentialschoolsettlement" /&gt; This initial payment for each person who attended a residential school amounted to $10,000 per person plus $3,000 per year.&lt;ref name="CBC_News_2008a" /&gt; The application deadline for CEP was 19 September 2011 with some exceptions made until September 19, 2012. By 31 December 2012, "a total of 105,540 applications were received under the common experience payment. $1.62 billion was paid to "78,750 recipients, representing 98% of the 80,000 estimated eligible former students."&lt;ref name=valcourt /&gt;

===Independent Assessment Process===
The IRSSA allotted $960 million to the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), "a settlement fund for claims of sexual abuses, serious physical abuse and other wrongful acts" at IRS which "provides money to those who experienced serious physical and/or sexual abuse at an Indian Residential School...The maximum payment is $275,000, but an additional $250,000 may be awarded for claims of actual income loss."&lt;ref name="Fed_sask"&gt;{{citation |title=Independent Assessment Process (IAP) |url=http://www.fsin.com/index.php/independent-assessment-process-iap |date=nd |work=Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 31 December 2012, over $1.7 billion in total was issued through the IAP. around three times more applications were received than expected, and the IAP is forecast to continue hearings until around 2017. By 2011 there were already 29,000 claims, double the 12,500 originally estimated by the IRSSA and this number was expected to rise even more. Violent abuse was "rampant, not isolated." According to Dan Ish, Indian Residential School Adjudication Secretariat chief adjudicator for the IAP, estimated in 2012 that IAP claims would be somewhere between two and three billion dollars more than anticipated.&lt;ref name=Curry&gt;{{citation |title=Cost to redress native residential school abuse set to pass $5-billion |first=Bill |last=Curry |location=Ottawa, Ontario |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2015 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/cost-to-redress-native-residential-school-abuse-set-to-pass-5-billion/article4251765/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission===
{{main|Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission}}
IRSSA allocated $60 million for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to document and preserve the experiences of survivors. The Commission was launched  2 June 2008.&lt;ref name=rss&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/summary_notice.pdf |title=The Indian residential schools settlement has been approved. The healing continues|work=Residential School Settlement |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 2008, [[Harry LaForme|Justice Harry LaForme]], Commission chair resigned, claiming "the commission was on the verge of paralysis and doomed to failure. He cited an "incurable problem" with the other two commissioners — Claudette Dumont-Smith and Jane Brewin Morley — who he said refused to accept his authority as chairman and were disrespectful."&lt;ref name="CBC_2015" /&gt; On 15 October 2009 the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission was relaunched by then-Governor General [[Michaëlle Jean]] with [[Murray Sinclair|Justice Murray Sinclair]], an [[Ojibway]]-Canadian judge, [[First Nations]] lawyer, as the chair.&lt;ref name="CBC_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uwinnipeg"&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/hd-sinclair | title = Justice Murray Sinclair |date=nd |accessdate = 4 June 2015 | work = University of Winnipeg}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2012, the federal government had released over 941,000 documents to the TRC related to residential schools.

===Health and Healing Services===
On 31 March 1998 in response to the RCAP and as part of Gathering Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan, the federal government established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, "Aboriginal-managed, national, Ottawa-based, not-for-profit private corporation", with a $350 million-dollar grant and an eleven-year mandate from March 1998 to March 2009.&lt;ref name=AHF&gt;{{citation |work=AHF |date=nd |accessdate=4 June 2015 |url=http://www.ahf.ca/faqs |title=Aboriginal Healing Foundation Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role was "to encourage and support, through research and funding contributions, community-based Aboriginal directed healing initiatives which address the legacy of physical and sexual abuse suffered in Canada’s Indian Residential School System, including inter-generational impacts."&lt;ref name=AHF /&gt; In 2007 Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF) received $125 million from the IRSSA to extend the AHF's lifespan to 30 September 2014.&lt;ref name="residentialschoolsettlement" /&gt;

IRSSA also supported the Resolution Health Support Worker (RHSW) Program.

===Commemoration Fund===
The IRSSA allocated $20 million for the Commemoration Fund for national and community commemorative projects.

==Legal representation==
Crawford Class Action was the court-appointed administrator.&lt;ref name="AFN_2014" /&gt;{{rp|1}} $100-million was allocated by IRSSA for the payment of plaintiffs’ legal fees.&lt;ref name=Curry /&gt;

===Controversy===
Dan Ish, upon his retirement from his position as chief adjudicator of IAP, described challenges with private lawyers who allegedly illegally profited from IRSSA benefits. They investigated Winnipeg lawyer Howard Tennenhouse, Calgary lawyer David Blott and Vancouver lawyer Stephen Bronstein and numerous other lawyers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18638">The '''Joint Contracts Tribunal''', also known as the '''JCT''', produces [[standard forms of contract]] for [[Construction law|construction]], guidance notes and other standard documentation for use in the construction industry. From its establishment in 1931, JCT has expanded the number of contributing organisations. Following recommendations in the 1994 [[Latham Report]], the current operational structure comprises seven members who approve and authorise publications. In 1998 the JCT became a limited company.

==Members==
The members were listed by the JCT in 2014 as:
# the [[British Property Federation]],
# the Contractors Legal Group, comprising:
#* the [[National Federation of Builders]],
#*  the [[UK Contractors Group]],
#*  the [[National Access and Scaffolding Confederation]] and
#*  the [[Scottish Building Federation]];
# the [[Local Government Association]],
# the [[National Specialist Contractors Council]],
# the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]],
# the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] and
# the Scottish Building Contract Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.jctltd.co.uk/about-us/ JCT website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The '''Joint Contracts Tribunal''' was established in the 1930s by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the National Federation of Building Trades Employers (NFBTE), to consider future proposals for amending the Form of Contract which had been published in 1931. Its first chairman, to 1956, was Sydney Tatchell,&lt;ref&gt;architect for Niblett Hall, Inner Temple,[http://www.innertemplelibrary.org.uk/_archive/old%20site/temple-history-old/inner-temple-history-the-buildings-littleton-building.htm] and Ironmongers’ Hall, London [http://blog.quintinlake.com/2010/10/24/ironmongers-hall-london-by-sydney-tatchell-1925/]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Sir [[Percy Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and McKendrick, ''Product Liability in the Construction Industry'', Lloyd's of London Press, 1993 [http://www.mandibooks.com/ProductDetail.asp?PID=5691]&lt;/ref&gt; The RIBA ''Guide to its Archive and History'' (1986) recorded that the tribunal had been established jointly in October 1932 by the councils of the RIBA and NFBTE to consider suggestions for the amendment of the 1931 Form of Contract, and that each of those two bodies appointed one of the two Joint Secretaries. The Secretary RIBA had acted as the RIBA Joint Secretary until the early 1960s (Macalister&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/sir-ian-macalister-216407 Sir Ian MacAlister]&lt;/ref&gt; to 1942, Spragg&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw211924/Cyril-Douglas-Spragg?LinkID=mp129519&amp;role=sit&amp;rNo=0 NPG: Cyril Douglas Spragg (1894-1986), Secretary, RIBA]&lt;/ref&gt; to 1959), when this appointment was performed by the Practice Secretary and then by the Legal Adviser. The archived documents are listed in the Guide as the ''RIBA Joint Secretary's Papers, 1932-1944, 1952-1971'', including copies of minutes and reports and papers concerning revision of the Form of Contract 1955-1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Royal Institute of British Architects: a guide to its archive and history | author1=Angela Mace | author2=Robert Thorne | publisher=Mansell Pub. | year=1986 | isbn=0-7201-1773-9 }} The RIBA Archive is currently held at the [[V&amp;A]].

Important new editions of the form were published in 1939, 1963 and 1980, and after the JCT had become a limited company further revised editions were published in 1998, 2005 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JCT History|url=http://www.jctltd.co.uk/jct-history.aspx|work=JCT|accessdate=3 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302015210/http://www.jctltd.co.uk/jct-history.aspx|archivedate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; JCT Contracts are currently published by Sweet and Maxwell Thomson Reuters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jctcontracts.com/index.html JCT publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the publication was announced of ''JCT Contracts discovery: the education and learning module from the Joint Contracts Tribunal''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jctcontracts.com/news_flash.html Newsflash]&lt;/ref&gt; This was described as an education and learning module for education and training providers, in-house training teams and independent tutors, providing materials for a comprehensive understanding of JCT contracts and JCT contractual procedures and looking at the roles of contractors, employers, sub-contractors and contract administrators and how JCT provisions deal with matters such as payment, control of the works and control of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://riba.sirsidynix.net.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=yKce99lN8i/MAIN_CAT/242560019/9 RIBA Library catalogue online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suite of Standard Forms ==
'''Suite of Standard Forms''' means a group of all the mutually consistent documents necessary to operate a particular method of [[procurement]] and produced to enable them to be used together, including the following where applicable:

*consultant agreements
*a main [[contract]] between the [[employer]] and the [[main contractor]]; 
*sub-contracts between the [[main contractor]] and its [[subcontractor]]s (both for sub-contractors selected by the employer and for other sub-contractors); 
*a standard form of sub-sub-contract between a [[subcontractor]] and such sub-contractor's sub-sub-contractors; 
*a design agreement between an employer and a specialist designer; 
*forms of [[Call for bids|tender]] for issue by an [[employer]] to prospective [[main contractor]]s and for issue by a [[main contractor]] to prospective [[subcontractor]]s and for issue by a [[subcontractor]] to prospective [[sub-sub-contractors]]; 
*a form of [[contract]] for the supply of goods;
*forms of [[Surety bond|bond]] (including performance bonds) and [[collateral warranties]].
*the [http://www.jctltd.co.uk/assets/JCT_CIMAR%2005.pdf Construction Industry Model Arbitration Rules], adapted from those of the [[Society of Construction Arbitrators]]

JCT publish [https://web.archive.org/web/20110809110714/http://www.jctltd.co.uk/assets/Guide%20to%20selecting%20the%20appropriate%20JCT%20main%20contract%20August%202009.pdf guidance] on which contract to select.

== Main forms ==
JCT substantially revises and rewrites the family of forms every decade. The most recent suite, replacing the 1998 version, is the 2005 suite, as is commonly referred to as JCT 05. There are now, however, 2009 amendments published. The 2011 versions replaced 2009 amendments for all contracts signed after October 1, 2011. They are considered to be the most popular construction contracts in use in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinsentmasons.com/default.aspx?page=889 Pinsent Masons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221081103/http://pinsentmasons.com/Default.aspx?page=889 |date=2010-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main contracts ===

# Major Project Form (MP11)
# Standard Form of Building Contract (SBC11)
# Intermediate Form of Building Contract (IC11)
# Minor Works Agreement (MW11)
# Management Contract (MC11)
# Design and Build Contract (DB11)
# Construction Management Documentation

In 2007 JCT published the Constructing Excellence Contract (JCT/CE), a contract designed to support collaborative working, as advocated by the Latham Report, and can trace its roots back to the "collaborative contract" published in 2003 by BE, a joint venture between the Reading Construction Forum and the Design and Build Foundation (and now part of [[Constructing Excellence]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenbs.com/topics/ContractsLaw/articles/jctConstructingExcellence.asp NBS Contract Law article April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smaller project contracts===
Traditional JCT contracts were seen as too detailed and difficult to use in smaller domestic projects so JCT launched a consumer friendly range of contracts called the "Building Contract for the Home Owner".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homebuilding.co.uk/feature/building-contracts-advice Homebuilding &amp; Renovating February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Building Contract for Home Owner/Occupier (where client deals directly with the builder) (HOB)
*Building Contract for Home Owner/Occupier (who has appointed a consultant) (HOC)
*Contract for Home Repairs and Maintenance (HO/RMI)

==Key features==
The JCT contracts avoid up-front payments from payers to payees. Instead, the payee invoices the payer once work has been certified as completed by an independent third party, the contract administrator (often an architect or surveyor). Often interim certificates are issued where itemised components of the work have been completed, or a verifiable percentage is complete. In the 2009 amendments, the payer or payee can issue the certificate if the contractor administrator fails to do so.

The JCT encourages [[retainage|retention]] of an agreed percentage of the contract sum until practical completion and then a percentage for a period after final completion. This avoids payment in advance for such things as minor defects or snagging which need to addressed at the end of the project or come to light after the project is complete. So the invoice at each point is a percentage of the value of the work certified complete. The payer can deduct an amount; however, under the 2009 amendments, the method for calculating the new amount must be stated.

The JCT encourages up-front agreement of [[liquidated damages|liquidated and ascertained damages]] (LAD) as an estimate of the payer's weekly losses if the payee fails to reach practical completion by the contractual completion Date. If delays are for reasons beyond the contractor's control, the contractor can request an extension of time: if the contract administrator allows this, it in effect extends the period before which the contractor is liable to pay the LAD.

The JCT introduced the concept of determination, whereby the contract can be terminated for suspension of works, failure to proceed regularly and diligently, failure to remove defective works, failure to execute works in accordance with the contract, or bankruptcy of the contractor. If one party has ceased to perform the contract (e.g. the contractor has gone past the contractual completion date and has no plan to complete the contract), determination enables the other party to end their obligations (e.g. to pay the contractor to finish the project).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atkinson-law.com/library/article.php?id=138 Atkinson's Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212073704/http://atkinson-law.com/library/article.php?id=138 |date=2010-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in addition to the common law remedy of [[anticipatory repudiation|repudiation]].

Reference is made to [[adjudication]] as a quick way of resolving disputes which the parties cannot resolve between them. [[Arbitration]] or [[lawsuit|litigation]], depending on the preferences of the parties, is also available for the settlement of disputes, but these are never appeals against the decision of an adjudicator; they are the consideration of the dispute or difference as if no decision had been made by an adjudicator.&lt;ref&gt;''cf'' Footnote 65 to the 2011 Edition of the JCT Standard Building Contract.&lt;/ref&gt; If arbitration is chosen, then the reference is conducted under JCT the amended version of the Construction Industry Model Arbitration Rules published by the [[Society of Construction Arbitrators]].&lt;ref&gt;''cf'' Clause 9.3 of the 2011 edition of the JCT STandard Building Contract.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms/alternatives ==
Lawbuild&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawbuild.co.uk/ Lawbuild]&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed a number of amendments to the JCT contract to protect the client further, with the top four being: to ensure the contractor posts a 10% bond to cover the costs of finding a replacement contractor if the contractor goes into liquidation, to ensure the contractor obtains building regulations certificates before practical completion, to ensure the contractor must accept design changes, and to ensure the employer can control the identities of the contractor's designers.

One of the most common disputes around building contracts is with regard to the interpretation of failure to proceed regularly and diligently, and whether the contractor is able to make a claim for loss of profits after determination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.utm.my/5504/ Arbitration analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast in the US, building contracts can normally be terminated for convenience of the client, only paying for the work already done.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fullertonlaw.com/construction-law-survival-manual/default-and-termination.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The JCT makes no distinction between work completed by subcontractors and work completed by the contractor. So the client can end up paying the contractor for work certified and yet the contractor may not pay the subcontractor, for example through insolvency. It may then be hard to work with that subcontractor to complete the work. In contrast in some US states, monies due to subcontractors must be held in trust by the contractor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fullertonlaw.com/construction-law-survival-manual/trust-fund-laws-and-agreements.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Institution of Civil Engineers|ICE]] Conditions, [[NEC Engineering and Construction Contract|New Engineering Contract]], [[FIDIC]], GC/Works/I, Model Form, and [[Institution of Chemical Engineers|IChemE]] Form are alternative formats for building contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicarchitecture.co.uk/knowledge-base/publications/standard_forms%5B1%5D.pdf Standard Contracts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131140111/http://www.publicarchitecture.co.uk/knowledge-base/publications/standard_forms%5B1%5D.pdf |date=2012-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication of product liability report==
The Joint Contracts Tribunal in 1989 commissioned a report examining the legal distribution of liability for defective products in the construction industry. Published in 1993 as a book with the title ''Product liability in the construction industry'' (Palmer and McKendrick), it included an account of the tribunal's ''Origin and growth'' and a list of the seven chairman from 1931 to 1993, including Sydney Tatchell (1931-1956) and Sir [[Percy Thomas]] (1956-1960).&lt;ref&gt;Norman Palmer [http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/ironbridge/events/2012/Professor-Norman-Palmer-QC-Hon-CBE-FSA.aspx] and [[Ewan McKendrick]], ''Product Liability in the Construction Industry'', [[Lloyd's of London Press]] Ltd, 1993 [http://www.mandibooks.com/ProductDetail.asp?PID=5691] and listing the other five chairmen as A.B.Waters[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=203264] 1960-1973, P.H.P.Bennett 1973-1978, Norman Royce 1978-1983, Patrick H. Barry 1984-1988, Roger M. Squire 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

It listed the constituent bodies of the tribunal at that time as the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Building Employers Confederation (formerly NFBTE, later Construction Confederation),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/new-construction-confederation-launched-156161945.html New Confederation announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Association of Consulting Engineers, the British Property Federation, and the Scottish Building Contract Committee, together with two organisations of subcontractors – the Confederation of Associations of Specialist Engineering Contractors and the Federation of Specialists and Sub-Contractors (later superseded by the National Specialist Contractors Council and the Specialist Engineering Contractors) – and three local authority associations - of [[county council]]s, of metropolitan authorities and of district councils.

==Annual lecture==

The JCT Povey Lecture is an annual event at which an eminent person is invited to speak on significant matters that are relevant to the construction and property industry. The purpose of the lecture is to encourage ways of continuing to improve the quality and value of construction output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jctltd.co.uk/povey-lecture.aspx JCT Povey Lecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Povey Lecture was inaugurated in 2003 to honour Philip John Povey, who had served the JCT for some fifty years. A barrister by profession, from 1951 Povey was a legal adviser to the NFBTE (later the Construction Confederation) and at the same time began to assist the Joint Secretaries of the JCT, later succeeding Howard Close&lt;ref&gt;Howard A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">The '''Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Act''' (AB 846), also known as the '''Lanterman Act''', is a [[California]] law, initially proposed by Assembly member [[Frank D. Lanterman]] in 1973 and passed in 1977, that gives people with [[developmental disabilities (California)|developmental disabilities]] the right to services and supports that enable them to live a more independent and normal life.  The legislation significantly expanded upon its landmark predecessor, the '''Lanterman Mental Retardation Services Act''' (AB 225), initially proposed in 1969.  The original act extended the state's existing regional center network of services for the developmentally disabled, while mandating provision of services and supports that meet both the needs and the choices of each individual.  

The Lanterman Act declares that persons with developmental disabilities have the same legal rights and responsibilities guaranteed all other persons by federal and state constitutions and laws, and charges the regional center with [[advocacy]] for, and protection of, these rights.

In addition to persons with intellectual disability, the regional centers are now mandated to serve persons with [[cerebral palsy]], [[epilepsy]], [[autism]], conditions similar to intellectual disability, or conditions that require treatment similar to the treatment required for individuals with intellectual disability.  To be eligible for services under the Lanterman Act a Person must also have a "substantial disability."

In 1976, the Lanterman Act was amended to establish the right to treatment and habilitation services for persons with developmental disabilities.

The Lanterman Act was amended in 1998, which called for an advocacy coordinator to be employed at each of the 21 regional centers of California, therefore, making it become a law that those employed through the regional center, would be prohibited from serving on a regional center board of directors, in order to avoid a conflict of interest.

In 2003 the definition of "substantial disability" was prospectively amended to require the existence of significant functional limitations in "three or more of [..] areas of major life activity..",.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/asm/ab_1751-1800/ab_1762_bill_20030811_chaptered.html Assembly Bill No. 1762 WIC 4512(l)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, to have a "substantial disability" only required the existence of a significant functional limitation in one of the seven areas of major life activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.documents.dgs.ca.gov/oah/DDS_Decisions/L2004010559.084.doc OAH No. L 2004010559] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628163749/http://www.documents.dgs.ca.gov/oah/DDS_Decisions/L2004010559.084.doc |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights of the Disabled under the Act==

The Lanterman Act protects the rights of people with developmental disabilities by mandating rights including:
* Services that protect [[liberty]], provided in the least restrictive (most integrated) way
* Dignity, privacy and humane care
* Treatment, services and supports in natural community settings, to the greatest extent possible
* Participation in an appropriate program of publicly supported education regardless of the degree of disability
* Prompt medical care and treatment
* Freedom of [[religion]] and conscience, and freedom to practice religion
* Social interaction and participation in community activities
* Physical exercise and recreation
* Freedom from harm, including unnecessary physical restraints, isolation, excessive [[medication]], abuse or neglect
* Freedom from hazardous procedures
* Choices in one's own life, including where and with whom one chooses to live, relationships with people in the community, how to spend time (including education, employment and leisure), the pursuit of one's chosen personal future, and the planning and implementation of a plan that fits the needs and desires of the individual
* The opportunity to make decisions and to have information understand to help make informed choices

==Key mandates==

Section 4501:  "The State of California accepts a responsibility for persons with developmental disabilities and an obligation to them which it must discharge.  Affecting hundreds of thousands of children and adults directly, and having an important impact on the lives of their families, neighbors and whole communities, developmental disabilities present [[social]], [[medical]], [[economic]] and [[legal]] problems of extreme importance."

Section 4620:  "In order for the state to carry out many of its responsibilities as established in this division, the state shall contract with appropriate agencies to provide fixed points of contact in the community for persons with developmental disabilities and their families, to the end that such persons may have access to the facilities and services best suited to them throughout their lifetime.  It is the intent of this division that the network of regional centers for persons with developmental disabilities and their families be accessible to every family in need of regional center services.  The Legislature finds that the services provided to individuals and their families by regional centers is of such a special and unique nature that is cannot be satisfactorily provided by state agencies.  Therefore, private [[nonprofit]] community agencies shall be utilized by the state for the purpose of operating regional centers."

A '''laser lamp''' is a light bulb that uses mirrors to direct a [[laser]] on to a [[phosphor]] that then emits a light. Laser lamps use half as much power as [[LED lamp]]s. They were first developed by [[Audi]] for use as [[headlight]]s in Le Mans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Virginia Herndon |url=https://www.audiusa.com/newsroom/news/press-releases/2014/01/laser-light-assists-audi-drivers-le-mans |title=Laser light assists Audi drivers at Le Mans |website=Audiusa.com |date=2014-01-20 |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5871">The '''legislative veto''' was a feature of dozens of statutes enacted by the United States federal government between approximately 1930 and 1980, until held unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983.

It has also been widely used by state governments.

==Federal government==
The [[legislative veto]] was first developed in context of the delegation to the president to reorganize governmental agencies and was first authorized by the [[Legislative Appropriations Act]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curry|first1=James A.|last2=Riley|first2=Richard B.|last3=Battistoni|first3=Richard M. |title=Constitutional Government: The American Experience|year=1989|publisher=West Publishing|pages=185|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qWR3pvfyI1sC&amp;pg=PA185|isbn=9780787298708}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was furthered by the necessities of providing for national security and foreign affairs immediately prior to and during [[World War II]].

The legislative veto provision found in federal legislation took several forms. Some laws established a veto procedure that required a [[simple resolution]] passed by a majority vote of one chamber of Congress. Other laws required a [[concurrent resolution]] passed by both the House and the Senate. Some statutes made the veto process more difficult by requiring not just a majority vote of one or both houses, but a majority of the membership of the legislative body, present or not. Some designated neither the House nor the Senate, but authorized one or more Congressional committees to exercise the veto on behalf of Congress.

The proliferation of legislative veto provisions in legislation raised a series of constitutional questions. [[Congress_of_the_United_States|Congress]] until relatively recently had applied the veto provisions to some action taken by the [[President_of_the_United_States|President]] or another executive officer—such as a reorganization of an agency, the lowering or raising of tariff rates, the disposal of federal property—then began expanding the device to give itself a veto over regulations issued by executive branch agencies, and proposals were made to give Congress a veto over all regulations issued by executive branch independent agencies.

===''INS v. Chadha''===
{{Wikisource-multi|Constitution of the United States of America#Section 1|t1=Article I, Section 1|Constitution of the United States of America#Section 7|t2=Article I, Section 7}}
In ''[[Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha]]'', 462 U.S. 919 (1983), the [[United_States_Supreme_Court|Supreme Court]] held a legislative veto on the part of one chamber of the legislature unconstitutional as violating both the principle of [[bicameralism]] embodied in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], Section 1 and Section 7, and the [[Presentment Clause|presentment]] provisions of Clauses 2 and 3 of Section 7. The Court's analysis of the presentment issue made clear, that a provision for a two-chamber veto, though complying with bicameralism, and a provision for veto by a Congressional committee suffer the same constitutional infirmity. In the words of dissenting Justice White, the Court in ''Chadha'' "sound[ed] the death knell for nearly 200 other statutory provisions in which Congress has reserved a 'legislative veto.'"

==Constitutional Convention==
Delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] that drafted the U.S. Constitution considered and rejected proposals for a ''legislative veto'' designed to reconcile the states to the federal union. [[Edmund Randolph]] proposed that: "The National Legislature ought to be impowered [sic] . . . to negative all laws passed by the several States contravening in the opinion of the National Legislature the articles of Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Padula|first=Guy|title=Madison V. Marshall: Popular Sovereignty, Natural Law, and the United States Constitution|year=2001|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=43–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KPtTByCIlbkC&amp;pg=PA43|isbn=9780739103630}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision became part of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s proposal for a new government based on national consolidation, all but eliminating state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Kermit|title=A Nation of States: Federalism at the Bar of the Supreme Court|year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=NY|pages=182 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o4p9EqLXrkIC&amp;pg=PA183|isbn=9780815334293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==States==
As of 1975, 10 states' constitutions allowed the governor to reorganize state government departments subject to a legislative veto: Alaska, California, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Vermont. Three states had statutes authorizing this procedure: Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations: [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1116/m1/3/ SCIR State Legislative Program (November 1975), 28]. Retrieved January 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of Pennsylvania, however, the State Supreme Court has invalidated the legislative veto.&lt;ref&gt;Com. v. Sessoms, 516 Pa. 365 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional Law Enforcement Agencies==
In various television and film media, producers may decide to utilise fictitious law enforcement agencies for the purpose of artistic license or copyright reasons.

===Local===
*'''Little Big Bear Police Service''' - police service in the [[Sky Atlantic]] series ''[[Tin Star (TV series)|Tin Star]]'', covering the fictional town of Little Big Bear, [[Alberta]]. 
*'''Metropolitan Law Enforcement''' - police service in the [[Global Television Network|Global]] series ''[[Rookie Blue]]''. The former is printed on the police force logo, however it is often referred to as the "Metropolitan Police" in show.

'''Sir Lyman Poore Duff''', {{postnominals|country=CAN|GCMG|PC|sep=,|size=100}} (7 January 1865 &amp;ndash; 26 April 1955) was the eighth [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].

== Early life and career ==
Born in [[Meaford, Ontario|Meaford]], [[Canada West]] (now [[Ontario]]) to a [[Congregationalist]] minister, Duff received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[mathematics]] and [[metaphysics]] from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1887. After graduation, he taught at [[Barrie Central Collegiate Institute|Barrie Collegiate Institute]] while studying for the bar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Duff later took courses at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] and was called to the [[Law Society of Upper Canada|Ontario Bar]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Duff practiced as a [[lawyer]] in [[Fergus, Ontario]] after being called to the bar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1895, Duff moved to [[Victoria, British Columbia]] and continued his career there. In 1895, he was made a [[Queen's Counsel]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1903, he took part, as junior counsel for Canada, in the [[Alaska boundary dispute#Arbitration|Alaska Boundary arbitration]].
In 1923 [[Mount Duff (Yakutat)]], also known as ''Boundary Peak 174'' was named after him.&lt;ref name="gnis"&gt;{{cite gnis |id=1420648 |name=Mount Duff |accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial and other appointments==
[[Image:Lyman Duff.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Bust of the Rt. Hon. Sir Lyman Duff in the Supreme Court of Canada building.]]
In 1904, he was appointed a puisne judge of the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]]. In 1906 was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. On January 14, 1914, he was appointed to [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Appointment notice at {{London Gazette |issue=31427  |date=1 July 1919 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duff was the first and only Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada to be appointed to the Imperial Privy Council. In 1924 he was elected honorary [[bencher]] of [[Gray's Inn]], at the recommendation of [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1931, he served as [[Administrator of the Government]] of Canada between the departure of [[Vere Brabazon Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough|Lord Bessborough]] for England and the arrival of [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duff took on the position, as the Chief Justice was unavailable. As Administrator, Duff opened Parliament and read the [[Speech from the throne|Speech from the Throne]] on 12 March 1931, becoming the first Canadian-born person to do so.

In 1933, Duff was appointed [[Chief Justice of Canada]], succeeding to [[Francis Alexander Anglin|Chief Justice Anglin]]. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of St. Michael and St. George]] the following year&lt;ref&gt;Appointment notice at {{London Gazette |issue=34010 |date=29 December 1933 |page=5 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of Prime Minister [[R. B. Bennett|Richard Bennett]]'s temporary suspension of the [[Nickle Resolution]].

When [[Governor General]] Lord Tweedsmuir died in office on February 11, 1940, Chief Justice Duff became the [[Administrator of the Government]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He held the office for nearly four months, until [[King George VI]] appointed [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone]] as Governor General on June 21, 1940.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Duff was the first Canadian to hold the position, even in the [[interim]]. A Canadian-born Governor General was not appointed until [[Vincent Massey]] in 1952.

Duff also heard more than eighty appeals on the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], mostly Canadian appeals; however, he never heard Privy Council appeals from the Supreme Court of Canada while he served on the latter. The last Privy Council appeal heard by Duff was the 1946 [[Reference Re Persons of Japanese Race]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id = 32920|title = Duff, Sir Lyman Poore (1865–1955), judge in Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Duff served as the sole member of a [[Royal Commission]] constituted to examine the Liberal government's conduct in relation to the [[Battle of Hong Kong|defence of Hong Kong]]. The resulting report, which completely exonerated the government, proved to be controversial, and was seen by many as a whitewash.

Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age for judges in 1939, his term of office was extended by three years by special Act of Parliament; in 1943, his term of office was extended for another year by Parliament.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He retired as Chief Justice in 1944.

==Impact==

Ilsley]], [[James Chalmers McRuer|J.C. McRuer]], Sir Lyman Duff, John T. Hackett, K.C., [[W.L. Mackenzie King]], [[Thibaudeau Rinfret]].]]
Duff employed a conservative form of [[statutory interpretation]]. In a 1935 Supreme Court judgment, he detailed how judges should interpret statutes:

{{quote|
The judicial function in considering and applying statutes is one of interpretation and interpretation alone. The duty of the court in every case is loyally to endeavour to ascertain the intention of the legislature; and to ascertain that intention by reading and interpreting the language which the legislature itself has selected for the purpose of expressing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=The King v. Dubois|link=|year=1935|source=CanLII|num=1|pinpoint=381|parallelcite=[1935] SCR 378|date=1935-05-13|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Duff has been called a "master of trenchant and incisive English," who "wrote his opinions in a style which bears comparison with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Holmes]] or [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Birkenhead]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= W.H. McConnell|year= 1968|title= The Judicial Review of Prime Minister Bennett's 'New Deal|journal= [[Osgoode Hall Law Journal]]|volume= 6|issue= |pages= 39|publisher= [[Osgoode Hall Law School]]|doi= |pmid= |pmc= }} at 51&lt;/ref&gt; A former assistant of Duff, Kenneth Campbell, argued that Duff was "frequently ranked as the equal of Justices Holmes and [[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]],"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1974, at 243&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gerald Le Dain]] asserted that Duff "is generally considered to have been one of Canada's greatest judges."&lt;ref&gt;Le Dain 1974, at 261&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers have taken a less favourable view, instead arguing that Duff's reputation is largely unearned; his biographer concluded that he was not an original thinker, but essentially a "talent student and exponent of the law rather than a creator of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent commentary has focused on Duff's [[legal formalism]] and its effect on Canadian federalism. [[Bora Laskin]] attacked Duff's decisions, arguing that Duff used [[circular reasoning]] and hid his policy-laden decisions behind the doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Bora Laskin]]|year= 1947|title= 'Peace, Order and Good Government' Re-Examined|journal= Canadian Bar Review|volume= 25|issue= |pages= 1054|publisher= [[Canadian Bar Association]]|doi= |pmid= |pmc= }}, at 1069-70.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Lionel Schipper noted that, in reviewing Duff's judgments, it was:

{{quote|
apparent that he has given certain factors very little consideration in formulating his decisions. ... In constitutional cases, not only are the actual facts of the case significant but the surrounding social, economic and political facts are equally significant. A shift in these latter factors is as important in deciding a case as any other change in the facts. It is this consideration that Chief Justice Duff ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper 1956, at 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ship's mission began on May 11, leaving from Greece, and was to deliver construction materials necessary to restore the sewage system. The ship broke the blockade and was within 400 metres of the Gaza shore&lt;ref name=MS&gt;[http://english.pnn.ps/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10170&amp;Itemid=63 "Malaysian Ship to Gaza Passengers and Crew Return to Malaysia"], Palestine News Network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6848">'''Misuse of private information''' is a new [[common law]] [[tort]] that [[English courts]] recognised in ''[[Campbell v MGN Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Campbell v MGN Ltd|link=Campbell v MGN Ltd|court=UKHL|year=2004|num=22|parallelcite= [2004] 2 AC 457|date=6 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arising as a branch of the law relating to [[breach of confidence]], it has been reinforced by [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], supplemented by s. 6 of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which obliges public institutions (including the courts) not to act inconsistently with Convention rights.

==Scope==
''Campbell'' was the watershed moment where the tort of "misuse of private information" became distinguished in scope from that relating to [[breach of confidence]], as the former does not require "an initial confidential relationship."&lt;ref&gt;''Campbell'', par. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, actions for misuse of private information can readily attract [[tort|tortious damages]], while those for breach of confidence may receive damages only as an [[equitable remedy]] within the discretion of the presiding judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allenovery.com/publications/en-gb/Pages/Misuse-of-Private-Information.aspx|title= Misuse of Private Information is a Tort Distinct from Breach of Confidence |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 12 March 2014|publisher=[[Allen &amp; Overy]]}}, discussing {{cite BAILII|litigants=Vidal-Hall v Google Inc|link=|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=2014|num=13|parallelcite=|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it will be obvious what may constitute public (as opposed to private) information in most cases, there will be times where it will need to be assessed as to whether disclosure of information would give substantial offence to an ordinary individual, as noted in Australia by [[Murray Gleeson|Gleeson CJ]] in 2001:

{{cquote|
An activity is not private simply because it is not done in public. It does not suffice to make an act private that, because it occurs on private property, it has such measure of protection from the public gaze as the characteristics of the property, the nature of the activity, the locality, and the disposition of the property owner combine to afford. Certain kinds of information about a person, such as information relating to health, personal relationships, or finances, may be easy to identify as private, as may certain kinds of activity which a reasonable person, applying contemporary standards of morals and behaviour, would understand to be meant to be unobserved. The requirement that disclosure or observation of information or conduct would be highly offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities is in many circumstances a useful practical test of what is private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=ABC v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd|link=|court=HCA|num=63|year=2001|pinpoint=par. 42|parallelcite=208 CLR 199|date=15 November 2001}}, quoted at ''Campbell'', par. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

As originally recognized in ''Campbell'', a cause of action was restricted to disclosures of information or activities in which the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of privacy.{{sfn|Hunt|2012|p=662}} It has been subsequently expanded to include bare intrusions into privacy, such as where certain photographs are taken in a public place.{{sfn|Hunt|2012|p=662}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Wood v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis|link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2009|num=414|para=34|date=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an injunction against the ''[[Wolverhampton Express and Star]]'' was obtained in 2005 by an owner of several homes for troubled children to restrain it from disclosing plans for further homes, even though information was publicly available from searches of [[HM Land Registry]] records and unredacted minutes of [[local authority]] proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Casement|first1= David|last2= Diaz-Rainey|first2= Julian|title= Private matters|url= http://www.thelawyer.com/private-matters/119177.article|newspaper= The Lawyer |date= 13 March 2006 }}, discussing {{cite BAILII|litigants= Green Corns Ltd v Claverley Group Ltd|link=|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=2005|num=958|para=|parallelcite=|date=18 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his judgment, [[Michael Tugendhat|Tugendhat J]] explained why, in this case, rights under Article 8 overrode competing obligations under [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] relating to [[freedom of expression]]:

{{cquote|
... The information as to the addresses linked with information as to the business of the applicant and thus to the likely disabilities and other characteristics of the occupants of the addresses brings together matters which together amount to new information which was previously accessible to the public only in a limited and theoretical sense. Publication or republication risks causing serious harm to the children and carers who occupy, or are to occupy, the addresses concerned. The extent to which the material has or is about to become available to the public is not, on the evidence of this case, a reason for withholding the injunction sought....&lt;ref&gt;''Green Corns'', par. 81&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}

==Other Commonwealth jurisprudence==
In addition to the Australian case law drawn upon by ''Campbell'', there has been other jurisprudence arising in [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NZLII|litigants=Hosking v Runting|link=|court=NZCA|year=2004|num=34|parallelcite=[2005] 1 NZLR 1|date=25 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Jones v Tsige|link=|year=2012|court=onca|num=32|parallelcite=108 OR (3d) 241|date=2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the House of Lords followed the model previously adopted by the [[High Court of Australia]], the other two jurisdictions based their approach  on the US ''[[Restatement of Torts, Second|Restatement of Torts (Second)]]''.{{sfn|Hunt|2012|pp=661{{en dash}}662}} It has been noted in Canada that the more principled approach adopted by the English courts post-''Campbell'' may be a better one to follow.{{sfn|Hunt|2012|p=663}}

In [[criminal law]], a '''mitigating factor''', also known as '''extenuating circumstances''', is any information or [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented to the court regarding the defendant or the circumstances of the crime that might result in reduced charges or a lesser sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.lectlaw.com/def2/m036.htm
|title=Mitigating Factors, Mitigation
|publisher=Lectric Law Library
|accessdate=2007-10-12
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a [[Defense (legal)|legal defense]], it cannot lead to the acquittal of the defendant. The opposite of a mitigating factor is an [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating factor]].

==Examples==
The [[Sentencing Council]] of England and Wales lists the following as possible mitigating factors:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/explanatory-material/item/aggravating-and-mitigating-factors/ Sentencing Council]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Admitting the offense, such as through a [[Plea|guilty plea]]
*Mental illness
*[[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]]
*Young age
*Showing remorse
[[Self-defense]] is a [[Defense (legal)|legal defense]] rather than a mitigating factor, as an act done in justified self-defense is not deemed to be a crime. If the offender was provoked but cannot be considered to have acted in self-defense, then the provocation can be used as a mitigating factor but not as a legal defense.

==By legal system==
===England and Wales===
According to English and Welsh procedure, the jury has no power to determine the punishment to be awarded for an offense. The sentence, with certain exceptions in capital cases, is within the sole discretion of the [[judge]], subject to the statutory prescriptions as to the kind and maximum of punishment. It is common practice for juries to add to their verdict, [[guilt (law)|guilty]] or [[Acquittal|not guilty]], a rider recommending the accused to mercy on the ground of grave provocation received, or other circumstances which in their view should mitigate the penalty.

===India===
According to the Indian procedure the provision of Section 235(2) of Criminal Procedure Code calls upon the Court that the convicted accused must be given an opportunity of being heard on the question of sentence. This provides the accused an opportunity to place his antecedents, social and economic background and mitigating and extenuating circumstances before the court.

Besides the statutory provisions, the Constitution of India also empowers the President and the Governor of the State to grant pardon to the condemned offenders in appropriate cases. These powers are, however, co-extensive with the legislative powers. The power to cut short a sentence by an act of executive in India and elsewhere. It is significant to note that the controversy raised in this regard in Nanavati's case has been settled by the Supreme Court once for all in the case of SARAT CHANDRA V/S. KHAGENDRA NATH which affirmed the principle that sentencing power of judiciary and executive are readily distinguishable.

Quite independently of any recommendation by the [[jury]], the judge is entitled to take into account matters proved during the trial, or laid before him/her after verdict, as a guide to determining the quantum of punishment.

===France===
Under French law (''Code d'instruction criminelle'', art. 345), it is the sole right and the duty of a jury in a criminal case to pronounce whether or not the perpetration of the offense was attended by extenuating circumstances (''circonstances atténuantes''). They are not bound to say anything about the matter, but the whole or the majority may qualify the verdict by finding [[wiktionary:extenuation|extenuation]], and if they do, the powers of the court to impose the maximum punishment are taken away and the sentence to be pronounced is reduced in accordance with the scale laid down in art. 463 of the Code penal. The most important result of this rule in earlier times was to enable a jury to prevent the infliction of [[capital punishment]] for murder (now abolished).

===United States===
In the U.S., most mitigating factors are presented in ways that are best described by clinical evaluations of the defendant and the circumstances, thus involving psychological or psychiatric analysis in the presentation to the court. Approximately one half of [[U.S. state]]s allow evidence that the defendant was under extreme mental or emotional [[Stress (medicine)|distress]] as a mitigating factor, if it is accompanied by an evaluation that the defendant's ability to appreciate the criminal aspect of his offense (''[[mens rea]]''), or his ability to control his behavior to meet the requirements of the law, was impaired.&lt;ref name="melton1997"/&gt;

There is empirical evidence that expert testimony on future dangerousness has less effect on jury decisions than does expert testimony on the defendant's mental functioning. However, there is no evidence so far that expert testimony does influence the jury on sentencing outcomes in death penalty cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Death penalty====
In the United States, the issue of mitigating factors is most important in [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] cases. In a series of decisions since 1972, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has attempted to make the sentence of death in the United States less arbitrary by emphasizing that the judge or [[jury]] must be given the opportunity to consider all mitigating evidence before determining the sentence. Thus the Court has stressed that because of the constitutional requirement of the fundamental respect for human dignity set out by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], information must be provided on the character and previous history of the defendant, as well as the circumstances surrounding the particular offense.&lt;ref name="melton1997"&gt;{{cite book

The Supreme Court in ''[[Penry v. Lynaugh]]'', and subsequently the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in ''[[Bigby v. Dretke]]'', remanded cases in which the [[jury instructions]] in death penalty cases did not ask the jury to consider as mitigating factors the defendant's [[mental health]], saying that the jury be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions.&lt;ref name="jaapl"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/34/1/110?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=10&amp;minscore=5000&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT

|accessdate=2007-10-12
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court's rulings have broadened the definition of mitigating evidence in the United States and systematically removed the procedural barriers to jury consideration and weight of that evidence.

The effect of these decisions is to broaden the definition of mitigating factors related to mental illness within the U.S. justice system, and to be more consistent with standard psychiatric and psychological findings that correlate specific behaviors to identifiable mental disorders. As a result of these decisions, even in the absence of a direct connection between the illness and the illegal action (as is required in the guilt phase of the insanity defense), the court acknowledges that the effects of a severe mental illness have pervasive effect on a person's behavior and can therefore be a relevant consideration in death penalty considerations.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt; If all relevant mitigating factors are not considered in a death penalty case, the punishment can be considered "cruel and unusual", the Supreme Court ruled in ''Tennard v. Dretke'', a case in which the prosecution sought to exclude evidence of a low IQ in the penalty phase of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Contrary use of mental illness as aggravating factor====
However, a contrary opinion was rendered in ''People v. Smith'' where the [[Supreme Court of California]] upheld the prosecution's use of evidence of the defendant's mental illness presented by a [[psychologist]], [[Chris Hatcher (psychologist)|Dr. Chris Hatcher]], who presented [[criminal profiler|"profile evidence"]] as an ''aggravating factor'' in the sentencing phase of a [[capital punishment|capital crime]] (in this case the murder of a child) after the defendant pleaded guilty. This opinion was rendered, even though California has a clear statutory bar to this application. The defendant had argued that this use of psychological evidence violated a California statute prohibiting the use of serious mental illness as an aggravating factor. However, the court ruled that the psychologist's diagnosis, "sadistic pedophilia", obtained by [[offender profiling|profiling]] and not through any contact with the defendant, assisted the jury in understanding the motivation and circumstances of the crime and therefore aided in the proper sentencing of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/california/supreme-court/s026223.pdf?ts=1396114559 |title=The People v. Gregory Scott Smith |date=March 10, 2005 |website=Justia.com |accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to sexual disorders, [[psychopathy]] is sometimes used directly and indirectly (to negate expressions of remorse) as aggravation, including in capital cases (this is not to say that it is not sometimes regarded contrarily as mitigation). It remains controversial whether a psychiatric test should be such a determinant.

====Limits on mitigating factors in the United States====
The Supreme Court held in ''Lockett v. Ohio'' that a defendant facing the death penalty is entitled to present any aspect of character or record, and any circumstance of the offense that might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death. The court may limit evidence not pertaining to these issues as "irrelevant". Although it has been argued that the defendant should be able to offer evidence questioning the morality of the death penalty or descriptions of the execution process, no court has allowed such testimony.&lt;ref name="crimlaw"&gt;{{cite book

'''''Pecunia non olet''''' ("money does not stink") is a Latin saying. The phrase is ascribed to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] emperor [[Vespasian]] (ruled AD 69–79).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Robert Penn|title=All The King's Men|year=1946|publisher=Bantam|location=New York|isbn=0-553-20454-8|pages=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vespasienne Montréal.jpg|thumb|"[[urinal (restroom)|Vespasienne]]" in Montreal, Canada, 1930]]

[[Vespasian]] imposed a Urine Tax ({{lang-la|vectigal urinae}}) on the distribution of [[urine]] from public urinals in Rome's [[Cloaca Maxima]] (great sewer) system. (The Roman lower classes urinated into pots which were emptied into [[cesspool]]s.) The urine collected from public urinals was sold as an ingredient for several chemical processes. It was used in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], and also by [[laundry|launderers]] as a source of [[ammonia]] to clean and whiten [[wool]]len [[toga]]s. The buyers of the urine paid the tax.

The Roman historian [[Suetonius]] [[The Twelve Caesars|reports]] that when Vespasian's son [[Titus]] complained about the disgusting nature of the tax, his father held up a gold coin and asked whether he felt offended by its smell (''sciscitans num odore offenderetur''). When Titus said "No", Vespasian replied, "Yet it comes from urine" (''Atqui ex lotio est'').&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vespasian'' 23. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#23 English], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#23 Latin]. Cf. [[Dio Cassius]], ''Roman History'', bk. 65, ch. 14.5 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#14 English], [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/Dion/livre66.htm Greek/French (66, 14)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phrase ''Pecunia non olet'' is still used today to say that the value of money is not tainted by its origins. Vespasian's name still attaches to public [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]] in France (''vespasienne'') and Italy (''vespasiano'').

==In literature==
In his description of money and the circulation of commodities generally, Karl Marx refers to this phrase when he observes "since every commodity disappears when it becomes money it is impossible to tell from the money itself how it got into the hands of its possessor, or what article has been changed into it. 'Non olet', from whatever source it may come."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1990) "Capital Volume 1", Penguin Books, London, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;
"Vespasian's axiom" is also referred to in passing in the [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] short story ''[[Sarrasine]]'' in connection with the mysterious origins of the wealth of a [[Paris]]ian family. The proverb receives some attention in [[Roland Barthes]]'s detailed analysis of the Balzac story in his critical study ''[[S/Z]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland (trans. Richard Miller) (1974) ''S/Z''  New York: Hill and Wang—Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pp. 39–40; see lexia number 26&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] alludes to Vespasian's jest in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' with the phrase "non-olfactory money".&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, F. Scott (1925) ''The Great Gatsby'' Scribner, New York. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], the Warden of Bracton College is given the nickname "Non-Olet" for having written "a monumental report on National Sanitation. The subject had, if anything, rather recommended him to the Progressive Element. They regarded it as a slap in the face for the dilettanti and Die-hards, who replied by christening their new Warden Non-Olet."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbVTcgOyCRoC&amp;pg=PA32 ''That Hideous Strength'', p. 32 (paperback p. 34)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel ''[[All The King's Men]]'', by Robert Penn Warren (1946), protagonist Jack Burden muses that perhaps Vespasian had been right. At the time, Jack is beset with doubts about the source of his inheritance.

In ''[[London Fields (novel)|London Fields]]'' by [[Martin Amis]], while smelling a wad of used £50 notes, foil Guy Clinch observes, "Pecunia non olet was dead wrong. Pecunia olet."

In ''[[The Surgeon's Mate]]'' by [[Patrick O'Brian]], when Admiral Saumarez is speaking of "glory to be picked up in the Baltic [...] and in any case, who cares about filthy lucre?", one of the assembled captains murmurs "Non olet".

{{Politics of Guernsey}}
[[Guernsey]] operates a system of government by committees and consensus.  There are no [[political parties]] - members of the parliament, which is known as the States of Deliberation, are elected as independents.  The States of Deliberation is both parliament and executive, but it delegates some of its executive functions to policy-specific committees, which are known as States Departments, each of which is run by five political members, all of whom have equal voting power.    

Despite having explicitly rejected a proposal to adopt an executive/ministerial system of government in 2002, the heads of each department were known as ministers.  They were, in effect, presidents or chairmen of their committees.

The Policy Council consisted of the ministers/presidents of each of the ten departments plus the chief minister, who chairs Policy Council and speaks for the island externally in political matters.  The Policy Council's main functions were policy co-ordination and responsibility for external relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/policycouncil |title=Policy Council |publisher=States of Guernsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chief minister and all department heads are elected by all members of the States of Deliberation.  There also existed the post of Deputy Chief Minister, which was held by one of the department heads and was also elected by all members of the States of Deliberation.

On 1 May 2016 the Policy Council of Guernsey ceased to exist and a new committee, the [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] was created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8369">In [[History of England|English history]], '''''praemunire''''' or '''''praemunire facias''''' refers to a 14th-century law that prohibited the assertion or maintenance of [[Temporal jurisdiction (papacy)|papal jurisdiction]], or any other foreign jurisdiction or claim of supremacy in [[England]], against the supremacy of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]]. This law was enforced by the ''writ of praemunire facias'', a [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ of summons]] from which the law takes its name.

The name ''praemunire'' may denote the statute, the writ, or the offence.

''Praemunire'' in classical Latin means ''to fortify''. In medieval Latin, ''praemunire'' was confused with and used for ''praemonere'', to forewarn, as the writ commanded that the sheriff do (''facias'') warn (''praemunire'') the summoned person to appear before the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. praemunire. Second edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The [[Statute of Praemunire]] (16 Ric. 2, c. 5) was passed by the [[Parliament of England]] during the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], who purchased various loans from foreign creditors and rulers as well as bulls from [[Rome]] in 1392. It was only one of numerous stringent measures passed for the purpose of restraining the [[Holy See]] and all forms of papal authority in England and of eliminating in general the influence of foreign powers especially creditors and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  Because the Papacy had long claimed a form of temporal supremacy over England and Ireland, from the beginning of the 14th century, [[Pope|papal]] intervention had been particularly active, more especially in two forms. The one, the disposal of ecclesiastical benefices, before the same became vacant, to men of the pope’s own choosing; the other, the encouragement of resort to himself and his curia, rather than to the courts of the country, for legal justice.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Praemunire|volume=22|pages=242–243|first=Thomas Allan |last=Ingram|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Statute of Provisors (1306), passed in the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], was, according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], the foundation of all subsequent statutes of ''praemunire''. This statute enacted "that no tax imposed by any religious persons should be sent out of the country whether under the name of a rent, [[tallage]], tribute or any kind of imposition". A much greater check on the freedom of action of the popes was imposed by the [[Statute of Provisors]] (1351) and the Statute of ''Praemunire'' passed in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The former of these, after premising "that the Pope of Rome, accroaching to him the seignories of possession and benefices of the holy Church of the realm of England doth give and grant the same benefices to aliens which did never dwell in England, and to cardinals, which might not dwell here, and to others as well aliens as denizens, as if he had been patron or advowee of the said dignities and benefices, as he was not of right by the laws of England", ordained the free election of all dignities and benefices elective in the manner as they were granted by the king’s progenitors.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Later developments==
The Statute of Praemunire (the first statute so called) (1353), though especially levelled at the pretensions of the [[Roman Curia]], was also levelled against the pretensions of any foreign power and therefore was created to maintain the independence of the crown against all pretensions against it. By it, the king "at the grievous and clamorous complaints of the great men and commons of the realm of England"  enacts "that all the people of the king’s ligeance of what condition that they be, which shall draw any out of the realm in plea" or any matter of which the cognizance properly belongs to the king’s court shall be allowed two months in which to answer for their contempt of the king’s rights in transferring their pleas abroad. The penalties which were attached to the offence under this statute involved the loss of all civil rights, forfeiture of lands, goods and chattels, and imprisonment during the royal pleasure.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, C. ''Outlines of Criminal Law'' (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 15th edition, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other statutes followed that of 1353, but that which was passed in the sixteenth year of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]'s reign is, as mentioned before, usually referred to as the Statute of Praemunire. This statute, after first stating "that the right of recovering the presentments to churches, [[prebendary|prebends]], and other benefices … belongeth only to the king’s court of the old right of his crown, used and approved in the time of all his progenitors kings of England," proceeds to condemn the practice of papal translation, and after rehearsing the promise of the three estates of the realm to stand with the king in all cases touching his crown and his regality, enacts "that if any purchase or pursue, or cause to be purchased or pursued in the court of Rome, or elsewhere, any such translations, processes, and sentences of excommunications, bulls, instruments or any other things whatsoever ... he and his notaries, abettors and counsellors" shall be put out of the king's protection, and their lands [[escheat]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Praemunire declined in importance, but experienced a resurgence under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] as the [[Protestant Reformation]] unfolded. First individuals were indicted for ''praemunire'', then groups of clergy, and lastly the entire English clergy was accused of being agents of a foreign power (the Pope). In time, Henry asserted himself as "[[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|of the Church of England in Earth under Jesus Christ Supreme Head]]", and the clergy of the [[Church of England]] no longer answered to a foreign power.

During the 19th century the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]] of the time would on occasion communicate the death of a Pope to the British monarch (along with other rulers), and made occasional other communications. There was some discussion as to whether the Statute of Praemunire meant that no response could be made: the compromises reached included conveying messages on a 'private' rather than 'official' level, or going via the Hanoverian minister at London (responding as [[King of Hanover]]). Eventually it was decided that there was no legal obstacle to establishing formal diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;FO 95/736, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition in 1870 of forfeiture as a penalty for treason and felony did not apply to ''praemunire'' because it was a misdemeanour.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, C. ''Outlines of Criminal Law'' (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 15th edition, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] coming into effect, praemunire facias is no longer an offence in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.

At the 2018 Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, the former Foreign Secretary, [[Boris Johnson]], suggested that the government might be in breach of this defunct law in regard to its proposed departure settlement with the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://order-order.com/2018/10/02/read-full-boris-speech-text/ |title=Boris speech |date=2 October 2018 |publisher=Guido Fawkes |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Ms Yasmin Prest claimed under [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] sections 23 and 24 for [[ancillary relief]] against the offshore companies solely owned by Mr Michael Prest. Mrs Prest said they held legal title to properties that he beneficially owned, including a £4m house at 16 [[Warwick Avenue, London]]. They had married in 1993 and divorced in 2008. He did not comply with orders for full and frank disclosure of his financial position, and the companies did not file a defence. The [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] section 24 required that for a court to be able to order a transfer a property, Mr Prest had to be ‘entitled’ to the properties held by his companies.&lt;ref&gt;See [[MCA 1973]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18/section/24 s 24]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Prest contended that he was not entitled to the properties.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Todd QC and Stephen Trowell (later joined by Daniel Lightman) acted for Mrs Prest throughout. Mr Prest was represented by Martin Pointer QC, Kate Davidson QC and Simon Webster. The companies were represented by Tim Amos QC, Christopher Wagstaffe QC, Oliver Wise and Ben Shaw.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
===High Court===
[[Andrew Moylan|Moylan J]], in the [[Family Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], held that Mr Prest had the ability to transfer the properties in practice, so he was “entitled” to them under MCA 1973 s 24(1)(a). The court therefore had jurisdiction to make a transfer order. He ordered Mr Prest to transfer to the wife six properties and an interest in a seventh which were held in the name of two of the husband’s companies. He rejected the husband had done anything improper relating to the companies to allow piercing the corporate veil. But under MCA 1973 s 24(1)(a) ancillary relief was wider. Because Mr Prest’s properties were worth £37.5 million, Mrs Prest’s fair award was valued at £17.5m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=YP v MP|link=|court=EWHC|division=Fam|year=2011|num=2956|para=|eucase=|parallelcite=|date=4 October 2011|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the law as it relates to [[piercing the corporate veil]], he noted the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Hashem v Shayif &amp; Anor |link=|court=EWHC|division=Fam|year=2008|num=2380|para=159{{endash}}164|eucase=|parallelcite= [2009] 1 FLR 115, [2008] Fam Law 1179 |date=22 September 2008|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Ownership and control were not in themselves sufficient to pierce the corporate veil.
:* Even where there was no unconnected third party interest the veil could not be pierced only because it is necessary in the interests of justice.
:* The veil can only be pierced if there is impropriety.
:* The impropriety must be linked to the use of the company structure to avoid or conceal liability.
:* In order to pierce the veil, both control by the wrongdoer and impropriety must be demonstrated.
:* A company may be a façade even though originally incorporated without deceptive intent.

In that regard, he found that piercing was justified, not under the general principles,&lt;ref&gt;''YP v MP'' (Fam), par. 218{{endash}}219&lt;/ref&gt; but by virtue of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;''YP v MP'' (Fam), par. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The husband's properties were worth approximately £37.5 million, and therefore the wife's fair award was valued at £17.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;''YP v MP'' (Fam), par. 215{{endash}}216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Appeal===
The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], with [[Rimer LJ]] and [[Nicholas Patten|Patten LJ]] in the majority, allowed an appeal by the companies. The Family Division’s practice of treating the assets of companies substantially owned by one party to the marriage as available for distribution under [[MCA 1973]] section 24(1)(a) was beyond the jurisdiction of the court unless the corporate personality of the company was being abused. The corporate form needed to be used for an improper purpose, or it had to be shown that the companies held the properties on trust for Mr Prest. Because Munby J had rejected these possibilities in ''[[Ben Hashem v Al Shayif]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2009] 1 FLR 115&lt;/ref&gt; his order must have been incorrect. In the majority's view, this conflicted with ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]'', as affirmed in ''[[Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional Council]]'' and ''[[Adams v Cape Industries plc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2012] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1395.html EWCA Civ 1395], [155]-[156]&lt;/ref&gt; Patten LJ commented on other Family Division cases leading to similar results.

{{quotation|161. [...] They have led judges of the Family Division to adopt and develop an approach to company owned assets in ancillary relief applications which amounts almost to a separate system of legal rules unaffected by the relevant principles of English property and company law. That must now cease.}}

[[Mathew Thorpe|Thorpe LJ]] (a former judge of the Family Division) dissented, and said the following. 

{{quotation|64. In this case the reality is plain. So long as the marriage lasted, the husband's companies were milked to provide him and his family with an extravagant lifestyle. That was only possible because the companies were wholly owned and controlled by the husband and there were no third party interests. Of course in so operating them husband ignored all company law requirements and checks.

65. Once the marriage broke down, the husband resorted to an array of strategies, of varying degrees of ingenuity and dishonesty, in order to deprive his wife of her accustomed affluence. Amongst them is his invocation of company law measures in an endeavour to achieve his irresponsible and selfish ends. If the law permits him so to do it defeats the Family Division judge's overriding duty to achieve a fair result.}}

===Supreme Court===
The Supreme Court unanimously overturned the Court of Appeal and held that Mr Prest beneficially owned the assets of the Petrodel Resources Ltd companies under a [[English trust law|resulting trust]] because he contributed to their purchase price. There was no need to pierce the corporate veil, which could only be done in limited situations. However, because Mr Prest had been "entitled" to the assets of his companies under a resulting trust, under the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] section 24 the court had jurisdiction to transfer half the value of the properties to Mrs Prest.

[[Lord Sumption]] gave the first judgment. He said there was only a limited power to pierce the corporate veil, namely when people were under an existing legal obligation which is deliberately evaded. Fraud cuts through everything. A veil could be pierced only for the purpose of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage they would otherwise obtain from the company’s separate legal personality. There had been no evidence that Mr Prest had set up the companies to avoid any obligations in these divorce proceedings, so there was no ground for piercing the corporate veil.&lt;ref&gt;As in ''Gilford, Jones, Gencor, Trustor'' considered&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true under the [[MCA 1973]] s 24. This did invoke property concepts with established meanings, and did not mean something different in matrimonial proceedings. If someone did try to frustrate a claim, the [[MCA 1973]] section 37 made provision for setting aside certain dispositions. The jurisdiction that Munby J purported to recognise would, however, cut across the statutory schemes of company and insolvency law that protected people dealing with a company. So, [[MCA 1973]] section 24 did not give judges power to order Mr Prest to transfer property that he was not entitled to in law. However, on the facts, the Petrodel Resources Ltd companies could be ordered to transfer the properties under [[MCA 1973]] section 24 because they belonged to him beneficially: under a resulting trust. The evidence was obscure, but this was because of Mr Prest’s obstruction and mendacity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[British Railways Board v Herrington]]'' [1972] AC 877, and ''[[R v Inland Revenue Comrs, Ex p Coombs (TC) &amp; Co]]'' [1991] 2 AC 283, considered.&lt;/ref&gt; He said the following.

{{quotation|''Piercing the corporate veil''

16. I should first of all draw attention to the limited sense in which this issue arises at all. "[[Piercing the corporate veil]]" is an expression rather indiscriminately used to describe a number of different things. Properly speaking, it means disregarding the separate personality of the company. There is a range of situations in which the law attributes the acts or property of a company to those who control it, without disregarding its [[separate legal personality]]. The controller may be personally liable, generally in addition to the company, for something that he has done as its [[Law of agency|agent]] or as a [[joint actor]]. Property legally vested in a company may belong beneficially to the controller, if the arrangements in relation to the property are such as to make the company its controller's nominee or trustee for that purpose. For specific statutory purposes, a company's legal responsibility may be engaged by the acts or business of an associated company. Examples are the provisions of the Companies Acts governing group accounts or the rules governing infringements of [[competition law]] by "firms", which may include groups of companies conducting the relevant business as an economic unit. Equitable remedies, such as an [[injunction]] or [[specific performance]] may be available to compel the controller whose personal legal responsibility is engaged to exercise his control in a particular way. But when we speak of piercing the corporate veil, we are not (or should not be) speaking of any of these situations, but only of those cases which are true exceptions to the rule in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1897] AC 22&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. where a person who owns and controls a company is said in certain circumstances to be identified with it in law by virtue of that [[ownership and control]]. 

17. Most advanced legal systems recognise corporate legal personality while acknowledging some limits to its logical implications. In civil law jurisdictions, the juridical basis of the exceptions is generally the concept of abuse of rights, to which the International Court of Justice was referring in ''[[In re Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1970] ICJ 3&lt;/ref&gt; when it derived from municipal law a limited principle permitting the piercing of the corporate veil in cases of misuse, fraud, malfeasance or evasion of legal obligations. These examples illustrate the breadth, at least as a matter of legal theory, of the concept of abuse of rights, which extends not just to the illegal and improper invocation of a right but to its use for some purpose collateral to that for which it exists.

18. English law has no general doctrine of this kind. But it has a variety of specific principles which achieve the same result in some cases. One of these principles is that the law defines the incidents of most legal relationships between persons (natural or artificial) on the fundamental assumption that their dealings are honest. The same legal incidents will not necessarily apply if they are not. The principle was stated in its most absolute form by [[Denning LJ]] in a famous dictum in ''[[Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[1956] 1 QB 702, 712&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"No court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which he has obtained by fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything. The court is careful not to find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved; but once it is proved, it vitiates judgments, contracts and all transactions whatsoever…"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principle is mainly familiar in the context of contracts and other consensual arrangements, in which the effect of fraud is to vitiate consent so that the transaction becomes voidable ab initio. But it has been applied altogether more generally, in cases which can be rationalised only on grounds of public policy, for example to justify setting aside a public act such as a judgment, which is in no sense consensual, a jurisdiction which has existed since at least 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Duchess of Kingston's Case|link=Duchess of Kingston's Case|reporter=ER|year=1776|num=16|volume=168|firstpage=175|parallelcite=1 Leach 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or to abrogate a right derived from a legal status, such as marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Puttick]]'' [1981] QB 767&lt;/ref&gt; Or to disapply a statutory time bar which on the face of the statute applies.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]]'' [2011] 2 AC 304&lt;/ref&gt; These decisions (and there are others) illustrate a broader principle governing cases in which the benefit of some apparently absolute legal principle has been obtained by dishonesty. The authorities show that there are limited circumstances in which the law treats the use of a company as a means of evading the law as dishonest for this purpose.

[...]

34. These considerations reflect the broader principle that the corporate veil may be pierced only to prevent the abuse of corporate legal personality. It may be an abuse of the separate legal personality of a company to use it to evade the law or to frustrate its enforcement. It is not an abuse to cause a legal liability to be incurred by the company in the first place. It is not an abuse to rely upon the fact (if it is a fact) that a liability is not the controller's because it is the company's. On the contrary, that is what incorporation is all about....

35. I conclude that there is a limited principle of English law which applies when a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his control. The court may then pierce the corporate veil for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage that they would otherwise have obtained by the company's separate legal personality. The principle is properly described as a limited one, because in almost every case where the test is satisfied, the facts will in practice disclose a legal relationship between the company and its controller which will make it unnecessary to pierce the corporate veil.

[...]

52. Whether assets legally vested in a company are beneficially owned by its controller is a highly fact-specific issue. It is not possible to give general guidance going beyond the ordinary principles and presumptions of equity, especially those relating to gifts and [[resulting trusts]]. But I venture to suggest, however tentatively, that in the case of the matrimonial home, the facts are quite likely to justify the inference that the property was held on trust for a spouse who owned and controlled the company. In many, perhaps most cases, the occupation of the company's property as the matrimonial home of its controller will not be easily justified in the company's interest, especially if it is gratuitous. The intention will normally be that the spouse in control of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial home which is not consistent with the company's beneficial ownership. Of course, structures can be devised which give a different impression, and some of them will be entirely genuine. But where, say, the terms of acquisition and occupation of the matrimonial home are arranged between the husband in his personal capacity and the husband in his capacity as the sole effective agent of the company (or someone else acting at his direction), judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to be sceptical about whether the terms of occupation are really what they are said to be, or are simply a sham to conceal the reality of the husband's beneficial ownership.}}

Lord Neuberger emphasised that piercing the corporate veil should be the last resort. He noted that in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries there was also little consensus.&lt;ref&gt;[2013] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/34.html UKSC 34], [75]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australian corporate law|Australia]], "there is no common, unifying principle, which underlies the occasional decision of courts to pierce the corporate veil", and that "there is no principled approach to be derived from the authorities".&lt;ref&gt;''Briggs v James Hardie &amp; Co Pty Ltd'', (1989) 16 NSWLR 549, 567&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canadian corporate law|Canada]], "[t]he law on when a court may … '[lift] the corporate veil' … follows no consistent principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Kosmopoulos v.

{{quotation|83. It is only right to acknowledge that this limited doctrine may not, on analysis, be limited to piercing the corporate veil. However, there are three points to be made about that formulation. In so far as it is based on "fraud unravels everything", as discussed by Lord Sumption in para 18, the formulation simply involves the invocation of a well-established principle, which exists independently of the doctrine. In any event, the formulation is not, on analysis, a statement about piercing the corporate veil at all. Thus, it would presumably apply equally to a person who transfers assets to a spouse or civil partner, rather than to a company. Further, at least in some cases where it may be relied on, it could probably be analysed as being based on agency or trusteeship especially in the light of the words "under his control". However, if either or both those points were correct, it would not undermine Lord Sumption's characterisation of the doctrine: it would, if anything, serve to confirm the existence of the doctrine, albeit as an aspect of a more conventional principle. And if the formulation is intended to go wider than the application of "fraud unravels everything", it seems to me questionable whether it would be right for the court to take the course of arrogating to itself the right to step in and undo transactions, save where there is a well-established and principled ground for doing so. Such a course is, I would have thought, at least normally, a matter for the legislature....}}

[[Lady Hale]] gave a judgment concurring in the result, with which [[Nicholas Wilson, Lord Wilson of Culworth|Lord Wilson]] agreed, though added a qualification to Lord Sumption's decision.

{{quotation|92. I am not sure whether it is possible to classify all of the cases in which the courts have been or should be prepared to disregard the separate legal personality of a company neatly into cases of either concealment or evasion. They may simply be examples of the principle that the individuals who operate limited companies should not be allowed to take unconscionable advantage of the people with whom they do business. But what the cases do have in common is that the separate legal personality is being disregarded in order to obtain a remedy against someone other than the company in respect of a liability which would otherwise be that of the company alone (if it existed at all). In the converse case, where it is sought to convert the personal liability of the owner or controller into a liability of the company, it is usually more appropriate to rely upon the concepts of agency and of the "directing mind".

93. What we have in this case is a desire to disregard the separate legal personality of the companies in order to impose upon the companies a liability which can only be that of the husband personally. This is not a liability under the general law, for example for breach of contract. It is a very specific statutory power to order one spouse to transfer property to which he is legally entitled to the other spouse. The argument is that that is a power which can, because the husband owns and controls these companies, be exercised against the companies themselves. I find it difficult to understand how that can be done unless the company is a mere nominee holding the property on trust for the husband, as we have found to be the case with the properties in issue here. I would be surprised if that were not often the case.}}

[[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Lord Mance]] emphasised that future possible situations where the veil could be pierced should not be foreclosed.

[[Anthony Clarke, Baron Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony|Lord Clarke]] concurred. He agreed that Munby J in ''[[Ben Hashem v Al Shayif]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2009] 1 FLR 115, para 164&lt;/ref&gt; was correct that the veil could only be pierced where all other possibilities were exhausted. Also as he said in ''[[VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corp]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2013] 2 WLR 398&lt;/ref&gt; it is wrong to foreclose all future possibilities of piercing the veil.

[[Lord Walker]] said he welcomed "the full discussion in the judgments of Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale, Lord Mance and Lord Sumption" and concluded with the following.

{{quotation|106. ... for my part I consider that ‘piercing the corporate veil’ is not a doctrine at all... It is simply a label... to describe the disparate occasions on which some rule of law produces apparent exceptions to the principle of the separate juristic personality of a body corporate... These may result from a statutory provision, or from [[Chandler v Cape plc|joint liability in tort]], or from the law of [[English unjust enrichment law|unjust enrichment]], or from principles of equity and the [[English trust law|law of trusts]]...}}

==Significance==
The significance of ''Prest'' was that it suggested that piercing the veil was usually a last resort, and that remedies outside of "piercing" the veil, particularly in equity, or the law of tort, could achieve appropriate results on the facts of each case. The metaphor of piercing was thought to be unhelpful by most of the judges in the Supreme Court.

In [[parliamentary system]]s and [[presidential system]]s of [[government]], '''primary legislation''' and '''secondary legislation''', the latter also called '''delegated legislation''' or '''subordinate legislation''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is subordinate legislation?|url=https://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/publications/categories/policies-and-codes/handbooks/legislation-handbook/subord-legislation/what-is.aspx|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two forms of [[law]], created respectively by the [[legislature|legislative]] and [[executive (government)|executive]] branches of government. Primary legislation generally consists of statutes, also known as "acts", that set out broad outlines and principles, but delegate specific authority to an executive branch to make more specific laws under the aegis of the principal act. The executive branch can then issue secondary legislation (mainly via its [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]]), creating legally-enforceable regulations and the procedures for implementing them. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reference.com/government-politics/secondary-legislation-53465d499475a589 What is secondary legislation?]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary legislation ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, primary legislation can take a number of different forms:
* An [[Act of Parliament]].
* An [[Order in Council]] made under the [[Royal Prerogative]]
* [[Church of England Measures]] – the instruments by which changes are made to legislation relating to the administration and organisation of the Church (UK only).

=== Secondary legislation ===
{{main|Delegated legislation in the United Kingdom}}
In the United Kingdom, secondary legislation (also referred to as ''delegated legislation'' or ''subordinate legislation'') is law made by an executive authority under powers delegated from by an enactment of primary legislation, which grants the executive agency power to implement and administer the requirements of that primary legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delegated Legislation|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/english-legal-system/resources/delegated-legislation.php|work=lawteacher.net|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==

=== Primary legislation ===
In the United States, primary legislation is, at the federal level, an [[Act of Congress]], and the statute that delegates authority is called an ''authorizing statute'' or ''delegation of rule making authority''.

=== Regulatory law ===
{{main|Regulatory law}}
A law promulgated by the executive branch agency of the United States Government as the result of primary legislation is called a ''regulatory law'', as ''legislation'' is used only to refer to acts of the legislative branch, never the executive or the judicial branches. The body of law that governs the agency's exercise of rule making and adjudication powers is called "[[United States administrative law|administrative law]]," primarily the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]].

In a 2013 majority opinion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], Associate Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] stated that

{{quote|[Legislative power] is vested exclusively in Congress [and judicial power] in the “one supreme Court” and “such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish”.... Agencies make rules... and conduct adjudications... and have done so since the beginning of the Republic. These activities take “legislative” and “judicial” forms, but they are exercises of—indeed, under our constitutional structure they ''must be'' exercises of—the “executive Power.”&lt;ref&gt;''City of Arlington v. FCC'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8614546201508695232 569 U.S. __, __, n.4] (2013) (slip op. at 13) (emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Civil law jurisdictions==
[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law systems]] are almost universal in Europe, with the exceptions of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and in Central and South America, much of Africa and Asia.

In all cases a parliament will issue primary legislation, with lesser bodies granted powers to issue delegated legislation. A judicial review may be provided by a [[constitutional court]].{{efn|In 2015, Italy's Constitutional Court for the first time involved itself in the core of parliamentary procedure, issuing a judgment (n. 32/2014) protecting the balance of power from the combined effects of maxi-amendments and confidence being asked of it by the government.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title=Negoziazione politica e Parlamento… Non solo risate|journal=Avanti Online|date=2015|language=it|url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89427406}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== European Union ==
Each member state of the [[European Union]] (EU) has its own laws, and there is also overall EU law. The founding treaty, the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]], and all subsequent treaties, such as the [[Maastricht Treaty]], [[Nice Treaty]], and [[Lisbon Treaty]], are the main primary legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Sources of European Union law |publisher=[[Europa (Web portal)]]| date = 28 August 2010| url = http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/decisionmaking_process/l14534_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty of Rome gives powers to make secondary legislation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Member states must surrender some national jurisdiction powers to the European Union; these delegated powers are exercised by the [[European Commission|Commission]], [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and [[European Parliament]] acting in concert, having consulted the [[European Economic and Social Committee]] and the [[European Committee of the Regions]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The powers are exercised via binding Regulations, Directives, Decisions, and non-binding Recommendations and Opinions.

* A '''Regulation'''&lt;ref name="Article 288"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E288|title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, PART SIX - INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL PROVISIONS, TITLE I - INSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS, Chapter 2 - Legal acts of the Union, adoption procedures and other provisions, Section 1 - The legal acts of the Union, Article 288|publisher=[[EUR-Lex]]|author=[[European Union]]|date=26 October 2012|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a law which is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States without needing national implementation. EU citizens may have [[Standing (law)|standing]] to pursue breaches of regulations and treaties, as in [[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]].
* A '''Directive'''&lt;ref name="Article 288" /&gt; is an order to Member States to pass legislation. It is "binding as to the result to be achieved", but Member States can choose their own form of implementation. EU citizens may have standing to pursue failures to implement, as in [[Francovich v Italy]].
* A '''Decision'''&lt;ref name="Article 288" /&gt; is a law that addresses a specific issue. Addressees may challenge a decision via Judicial Review.

The Commission may take executive action in pursuance of policy, and may even act quasi-judicially in matters of EU competition law, a power defined in [[Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Article 101]] and [[Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]. Privileged parties, such as Member States, EU Institutions, and those with specific standing, may initiate litigation. For example, the Commission may sue Member States for breaches of EU obligations, and Member States may sue Institutions or other Member States for breach of EU law.

A '''prosecutor''' is a legal representative of the prosecution in countries with either the [[common law]] [[adversarial system]], or the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[inquisitorial system]]. The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case in a [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[jury trial|trial]] against an individual accused of breaking the law. Typically, the prosecutor represents the government in the case brought against the accused person.

== Common law jurisdictions ==
Prosecutors are typically lawyers who possess a [[law degree]], and are recognized as legal professionals by the court in which they intend to represent society (that is, they have been [[Admission to the bar|admitted to the bar]]).

They usually only become involved in a criminal case once a suspect has been identified and [[Indictment|charges]] need to be filed. They are typically employed by an office of the government, with safeguards in place to ensure such an office can successfully pursue the prosecution of government officials.  Often, multiple offices exist in a single country, especially in those countries with federal governments where sovereignty has been bifurcated or devolved in some way.

Since prosecutors are backed by the power of the state, they are usually subject to special [[professional responsibility]] rules in addition to those binding all lawyers. For example, in the [[United States]], Rule 3.8 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] requires prosecutors to "make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense." Not all U.S. states adopt the model rules; however, U.S. Supreme Court cases and other appellate cases have ruled that such disclosure is required. Typical sources of ethical requirements imposed on prosecutors come from appellate court opinions, state or federal court rules, and state or federal statutes (codified laws).

===Directors of Public Prosecutions===
In [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]], [[Kenya]], and [[South Africa]], the head of the prosecuting authority is typically known as the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], and is appointed, not elected. A DPP may be subject to varying degrees of control by the [[Attorney General]], usually by a formal written directive which must be published.

In Australia, the Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions institute prosecutions for indictable offences on behalf of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Director of Public Prosecutions Act'' 1983 (Cth).&lt;/ref&gt; At least in the case of very serious matters, the DPP will be asked by the police, during the course of the investigation, to advise them on sufficiency of evidence, and may well be asked, if he or she thinks it proper, to prepare an application to the relevant court for search, listening device or telecommunications interception warrants.

More recent constitutions, such as [[Constitution of South Africa|South Africa's]], tend to guarantee the independence and impartiality of the DPP.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], public [[prosecutors]] in most [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]] are called [[Crown Attorney]] or Crown Counsel. They are generally appointed by the provincial [[Attorney-General]].

===Scotland===
Though [[Scots law]] is a mixed system, its civil law jurisdiction indicates its [[civil law system|civil law]] heritage. Here, all prosecutions are carried out by [[Procurator Fiscal|Procurators Fiscal]] and [[Advocate Depute|Advocates Depute]] on behalf of the [[Lord Advocate]], and, in theory, they can direct investigations by the [[Police in Scotland|police]]. In very serious cases, a Procurator Fiscal, Advocate Depute or even the Lord Advocate, may take charge of a police investigation. It is at the discretion of the Procurator Fiscal, Advocate Depute, or Lord Advocate to take a prosecution to court, and to decide on whether or not to prosecute it under [[solemn procedure]] or [[summary offence|summary procedure]]. Other remedies are open to a prosecutor in Scotland, including [[fiscal fine]]s and non-court based interventions, such as [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] and [[social work]]. All prosecutions are handled within the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]]. Procurators fiscal will usually refer cases involving minors to [[Children's Hearings]], which are not courts of law, but a panel of lay members empowered to act in the interests of the child.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the director of a prosecution office may be known by any of several names depending on the jurisdiction, most commonly '''[[District attorney|District Attorney]]'''.

The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case against an individual or a corporation suspected of breaking the law, initiating and directing further criminal investigations, guiding and recommending the sentencing of offenders, and are the only attorneys allowed to participate in grand jury proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/criminal_justice_section_archive/crimjust_standards_pinvestigate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219015946/https://www.americanbar.org/publications/criminal_justice_section_archive/crimjust_standards_pinvestigate.html |archivedate=2017-12-19 |df= }} Standards on Prosecutorial Investigations&lt;/ref&gt;

The titles of prosecutors in [[State court (United States)|state courts]] vary from state to state and level of government (i.e. city, county, and state) and include the terms '''[[District attorney|District Attorney]]''' in  [[New York (state)|New York]], [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[Massachusetts]], [[North Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Oregon]], and [[Oklahoma]]&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[:Category:District attorneys]].&lt;/ref&gt;;  '''City Attorney''' in [[California]] cities (typically prosecute only minor and misdemeanor offenses) '''[[Commonwealth's attorney|Commonwealth's Attorney]]''' in Kentucky and Virginia; '''County Attorney''' in [[Minnesota]] and [[Arizona]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maricopacountyattorney.org |title=Maricopa County Attorney’s Office • Phoenix, Arizona |publisher=Maricopacountyattorney.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005024100/http://www.maricopacountyattorney.org/ |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;; '''County Prosecutor''' in [[New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President's Message|date=November 5, 2010|publisher=Prosecutor’s Office Management Association ("POMA") of New Jersey|url=http://www.njpoma.org/|accessdate=2011-12-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904133621/http://www.njpoma.org/|archivedate=September 4, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ohio]], and [[Indiana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office|url=https://www.stjoepros.org|accessdate=2016-12-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028030157/https://stjoepros.org/|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; '''District Attorney General''' in Tennessee; '''Prosecuting Attorney''' in [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Ark.

'''[[United States Attorney]]s''' are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. They represent the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] in [[United States federal courts|federal court]] in both civil and criminal cases. [[Private attorney general|Private attorneys general]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; can bring criminal cases on behalf of private parties in some states.

Prosecutors are required by state and federal laws to follow certain rules. For example, the government must disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Brady v. Maryland|source=w|casename=Brady v. Maryland|volume=373|page=83|year=1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; must disclose matters affecting the credibility of prosecution witnesses, such as an agreement to dismiss the witness's own charges in exchange for her testimony;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Giglio v. United States|405|150|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; must not destroy potentially useful evidence in bad faith;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Arizona v. Youngblood|488|51|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and must not use false testimony to secure a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Napue v. Illinois|360|264|1959}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to follow these rules may result in a finding of [[prosecutorial misconduct]], although a 2013 investigation found that actual discipline for prosecutorial misconduct was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.propublica.org/article/who-polices-prosecutors-who-abuse-their-authority-usually-nobody Who Polices Prosecutors Who Abuse Their Authority?

ProPublica.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors are also tasked with seeking justice in their prosecutions. "The United States Attorney," explained the U.S. Supreme Court, &lt;blockquote&gt;is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all, and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the two-fold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor—indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Berger v. United States|source=w|casename=Berger v. United States (295 U.S. 78)|volume=295|page=78|pin=88|year=1935}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Prosecutors in some jurisdictions have the discretion to not pursue criminal charges, even when there is [[probable cause]], if they determine that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite court |litigants=State v. Gomez |vol=127 |reporter=P.3d |opinion=873 |pinpoint=877 |court=Ariz. |date=2006 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9043197580032161970 |quote=Indictments can be dismissed for various reasons, including a prosecutor's determination that the person charged did not in fact commit the crime or—as this case illustrates—that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors may dismiss charges in this situation by seeking a [[voluntary dismissal]] or [[nolle prosequi]]. 

In [[Kentucky]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]], criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]].  In [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the People.  In the remaining states, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the State.

== Civil law jurisdictions ==
Prosecutors are typically [[civil servant]]s who possess a [[academic degree|university degree]] in law and additional training in the administration of justice. In some countries, such as [[France]] and [[Italy]], they belong to the same ''corps'' of civil servants as the judges.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the Senior Crown prosecutor (''Procureur du Roi/Procureur des Konings'' in trial courts and ''Procureur Général/Procureur-Generaal'' in appellate courts) is supported by subordinate Crown prosecutors (''substituts/substituten''). They open preliminary investigations and can hold a suspect in custody for up to 24 hours. When necessary, a Crown prosecutor will request an examining judge (''juge d'instruction''/''onderzoeksrechter'') be appointed to lead a judicial inquest. With a judge investigating, Crown prosecutors do not conduct the interrogatories, but simply lay out the scope of the crimes which the judge and law enforcement forces investigate (''la saisine''). Like defense counsel, Crown prosecutors can request or suggest further investigation be carried out. 
The Crown prosecutor is in charge of policy decisions and may prioritize cases and procedures as need be.

During a criminal trial, prosecutors must introduce and explain the case to the trier of fact, i.e., judges or jury. They generally suggest a reasonable sentence which the court is not obligated to follow; the court may decide on a tougher or softer sentence. 

Crown prosecutors also have a number of administrative duties.  They may advise the court during civil actions.

Under Belgian law, judges and prosecutors are judicial officers with equal rank and pay.

The Minister of Justice can order a criminal investigation but cannot prevent one (''droit d'injonction positive''/''positief injunctierecht'').

=== Brazil ===
{{main article|Ministério Público (Brazil)}}

In [[Brazil]], the public prosecutors form a body of autonomous civil servants—the Public Ministry ('''Ministério Público''')—working both at the federal and state level. 

Federal prosecutors (''procuradores da República'') are divided in three ranks, according to the jurisdiction of the courts before which they officiate. ''Procuradores da República'' officiate before single judges and lower courts, ''procuradores regionais da República'' before federal appellate courts, and ''subprocuradores gerais da República'' before the superior federal courts. The ''Procurador Geral da República'' heads the federal body, and tries cases before the ''Supremo Tribunal Federal.''

At the state level, the career is usually divided in ''promotores de Justiça'' who practice before the lower courts and ''procuradores de Justiça'' who practice before the state courts of appeals. There are also military prosecutors whose career, although linked to the federal prosecutors, is divided in a manner similar to state prosecutors.

In Brazil the prosecutors' main job is to promote justice, as such they have the duty of not only trying criminal cases, but, if during the trial, they become convinced of a defendant's innocence,  requesting the judge to acquit him. The prosecutor's office has always the last word on whether criminal offenses will or will not be charged, with the exception of those rare cases in which Brazilian law allows for private prosecution. In such cases, the prosecutor will officiate as ''custos legis'', being responsible to ensure that justice is indeed carried out.

Although empowered by law to do so, prosecutors conduct criminal investigations only in major cases, usually involving police or public officials' wrongdoings. Also, they are in charge of external control over police activity and requesting the initiation of a police investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Article 129, preamble paragraphs VII and VIII of the {{cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicaocompilado.htm |title=Constitution of Brazil |accessdate=2016-05-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505161928/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/ConstituicaoCompilado.htm |archivedate=2016-05-05 |df= }}("São funções institucionais do Ministério Público: . . .

The power of individual prosecutors to hold criminal investigations is still controversial and, although massively supported by judges, prosecutors and the general population, it is being contested before the Supremo Tribunal Federal.

According to a 2012 law, the chief of police (''delegado de polícia''), as the police authority, is responsible for conducting the criminal investigation in Brazil by means of a police investigation (''inquérito policial'') or other procedure provided by law that has the purpose of ascertaining the circumstances, materiality, and authorship of criminal offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2013/lei/l12830.htm |title=Law 12.830/2013 |accessdate=2016-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114152545/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2013/lei/l12830.htm |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar provisions are found in the Code of Criminal Procedure&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 of the  {{cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del3689.htm |title=Brazilian Code of Criminal Procedure |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722232718/http://www.planalto.gov.br/CCIVIL_03/Decreto-Lei/Del3689.htm |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }} ("A polícia judiciária será exercida pelas autoridades policiais no território de suas respectivas circunscrições e terá por fim a apuração das infrações penais e da sua autoria.").&lt;/ref&gt; and in article 144 of the federal constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite constitution

}} ("Às polícias civis, dirigidas por delegados de polícia de carreira, incumbem, ressalvada a competência da União, as funções de polícia judiciária e a apuração de infrações penais, exceto as militares.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside their criminal duties, Brazilian prosecutors are among those authorized by the Brazilian constitution to bring action against private individuals, commercial enterprises, and the federal, state and municipal governments, in the defense of minorities, the environment, consumers, and the civil society in general.

=== France ===
{{main article |Ministère public (France)}}
{{See also|Parquet (legal)}}

In [[France]], the Office of the Prosecutor includes a Chief Prosecutor (''Procureur de la République'' in trial courts and ''procureur général'' in [[appellate court]]s or the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Supreme Court]]) and his deputies and assistants (''avocats généraux'' and ''substituts''). The Chief Prosecutor generally initiates [[preliminary enquiry|preliminary investigations]] and, if necessary, asks that an examining judge (''[[inquisitorial system#France|juge d'instruction]]'') be assigned to lead a formal judicial investigation. When an investigation is led by a judge, the prosecutor plays a supervisory role, defining the scope of the crimes being examined by the judge and law enforcement forces. Like defense counsel, the chief prosecutor may petition or move for further investigation. During criminal proceedings, prosecutors are responsible for presenting the case at trial to either the bench or the [[jury]]. Prosecutors generally suggest advisory sentencing guidelines, but the sentence remains at the court's discretion to decide, to increase or reduce as it sees fit. In addition, prosecutors have several administrative duties.

Prosecutors are considered magistrates under French law, as in most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries. While the defense and the plaintiff are both represented by common lawyers, who sit (on chairs) on the courtroom floor, the prosecutor sits on a platform as the judge does, although he doesn't participate in deliberation. Judges and prosecutors are trained at the same school, and regard one other as colleagues.

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], the ''[[Staatsanwaltschaft|Staatsanwalt]]'' ("state attorney") is a life-tenured public official in the senior judicial service belonging to the same [[corps]] as [[judge]]s. The Staatsanwalt heads pre-trial criminal investigations, decides whether to press a charge or drop it, and represents the government in criminal courts. He not only has the "professional responsibility" not to withhold exculpatory information, but is also required by law to actively determine such circumstances and to make them available to the defendant or his/her defense attorney. If he is not convinced of the defendant's guilt, the state attorney is required to plead against or in favor of the defendant according to the prosecutor's own assessment.&lt;ref&gt; RiStBV, No. 138/139).&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecution is [[compulsory prosecution|compulsory]] if the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to convict.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=41|publisher=U.

=== Italy ===
In [[Italy]], a Prosecutor's Office is composed of a Chief Prosecutor (''procuratore capo'') assisted by deputies (''procuratori aggiunti'') and assistants (''sostituti procuratori''). Prosecutors in Italy are judicial officers just like judges and are ceremonially referred to as ''Pubblico Ministero'' ("Public Ministry" or P.M.).

Italian Prosecutors officiate as ''[[custos legis]]'', being responsible to ensure that justice is indeed carried out. They are obligated under the Constitution to initiate preliminary investigations once they are informed or take personal notice of a criminal act—''[[notitia criminis]]''—or receive a bill of complaint. They can direct investigations or conduct them through orders and directives given to (judicial) police detectives, who can make their own parallel investigations in coordination with the Prosecutor. If enough evidence has been gathered in order to proceed, the prosecution is compulsory and it must move from preliminary investigations to initiate trial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a787785358&amp;db=all|title=The Judiciary in the Italian Political Crisis|author=Carlo Guarnieri|doi=10.1080/01402389708425179|publisher=West European Politics|volume=20|issue=1|date=January 1997|pages=157–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; At trial, the prosecuting attorney has to handle the prosecution but is prohibited from withholding exculpatory evidence, for they have to promote justice, which means that they have the duty of not only trying criminal cases, but, to request the judge to acquit him if, during the trial, they become convinced of a defendant's innocence, or agree that there is no evidence, beyond any reasonable doubt, of his guiltiness.

In appellate courts, the Office of the Prosecutor is called ''Procura Generale'' and the Chief Prosecutor the ''Procuratore Generale'' (PG). The ''Procuratore Generale presso la Corte di Cassazione'' is the Chief General Prosecutor before the [[Corte di Cassazione]], the Supreme Court of Italy.

Prosecutors are allowed during their career to act in the other's stead, but a recent ruling by the Italian [[Corte Costituzionale|Constitutional Court]] stated that prosecutors, who wish to become judges, must relocate to another region and are prohibited to sit or hear trials that they themselves initiated.

=== Japan ===
In [[Japan]], public prosecutors {{nihongo||検察官|kensatsu-kan}} are professional officials who have considerable powers of investigation, prosecution, superintendence of criminal execution and so on. Prosecutors can direct police for investigation purposes, and sometimes investigate directly. Only prosecutors can prosecute criminals in principle, and prosecutors can decide whether to prosecute or not. High-ranking officials of the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] are largely prosecutors.

===Poland===
The highest ranking prosecutor office of the [[Prokuratura]] in [[Poland]] is the [[Public Prosecutor General (Poland)|Prokurator Generalny]] ([[General Prosecutor]])—chief of the [[Public Prosecutor General (Poland)|Prokuratura Generalna]] ([[General Prosecutor Office]]). The GP has 5 deputies. Structure of Public Prosecutor in Poland is 4-level: 
General Prosecutor Office --&gt; Appellation Prosecutor Offices (11) --&gt; District Prosecutor Offices (46) --&gt; Regional Prosecutor Offices (326).

=== South Korea ===
Prosecutors are the public officials who are members of the Ministry of Justice.

Prosecutors can conduct crime investigations directly or indirectly. They are responsible for the entire process of investigations and court prosecutions. Since Korean modern law was designed after continental system, the role of Korean prosecutors is similar or identical to that of European equivalents in commanding investigations, determining indictable cases and prosecuting process. Korean prosecutors take pride in successful prosecutions of former presidents(1995) and sons of the incumbent presidents(1997 and 2002).  Besides, they have made important contributions to convicting many corrupt high-ranking officials and business leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spo.go.kr/eng |title=spo |publisher=spo |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006143826/http://www.spo.go.kr/eng/ |archivedate=2013-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prosecutor has the power to prohibit a defendant or an accused individual from departing the Republic of Korea via an  "international hold".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thekoreanlawblog.com/2015/05/fleeing-korea-while-under.html|title=Fleeing Korea while under Police/Prosecutor Investigation: International Hold in Korea|access-date=2016-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707201249/http://www.thekoreanlawblog.com/2015/05/fleeing-korea-while-under.html|archivedate=2016-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In Sweden, public prosecutors are lawyers who work out of the Swedish Office of Public Prosecutions (''Åklagarmyndigheten'') and direct police investigations of serious crimes. For all criminal cases, public prosecutors decide arrests and charges on behalf of the public and are the only public officers who can make such decisions.  Plaintiffs also have the option of hiring their own special prosecutor (''enskilt åtal''). The exception is cases concerning crimes against the freedom of the press for which the Attorney General acts as the prosecuting attorney. In court, the prosecutor is not necessarily in an adversarial relationship to the defendant, but is under an obligation to investigate and present information which may incriminate or exhonerate the defendant. The prosecutor is not a judicial officer, nor do they participate in the private deliberations of the court.

Public prosecutors are the only public officers who can decide to appeal cases to appellate courts (''hovrätter''). Otherwise, appeals are initiated by defense counsel, the plaintiff, their representatives, and other parties to the case (''målsäganden''). When a case has been decided by an appellate court, the right to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] passes from the case's prosecutor to the Director of Public Prosecutions (''Riksåklagaren'').

== Socialist law jurisdictions ==
{{main article|Public Procurator}}
A [[Public Procurator]] is an office used in [[Socialist law|Socialist judicial systems]] which, in some ways, corresponds to that of a public prosecutor in other legal systems, but with more far-reaching responsibilities, such as handling investigations otherwise performed by branches of the [[police]]. Conversely, the policing systems in socialist countries, such as the [[Militsiya]] of the [[Soviet Union]], were not aimed at fulfilling the same roles as police forces in Democratic countries.

=== People's Republic of China ===
{{main article|Supreme People's Procuratorate}}

A [[Public Procurator]] is a position in the [[People's Republic of China]], analogous to both [[detective]] and public prosecutor. Legally, they are bound by '''Public Procurators' Law of the People's Republic of China'''. According to Article 6, the functions and duties of public procurators are as follows:

#Supervise the enforcement of laws according to law.
#Public prosecution on behalf of the State.
#Investigate criminal cases directly accepted by the People's Procuratorates as provided by law.
#Other functions and duties as provided by law.

===Vietnam===
{{main article|Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam}}

The [[Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam|Supreme People's Procuracy]] is the highest office of public procurators in [[Vietnam]].

== Institutional independence ==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2010}}
In many countries, the prosecutor's administration is directly subordinate to the executive branch (e.g., the US Attorney General is a member of the President's cabinet). In some other countries, such as [[Italy]] or [[Brazil]], the prosecutors are judicial civil servants, so they have the same liberties and independence which that judges traditionally enjoy.

In other countries, a form of private prosecution is available, meaning persons or private entities can directly petition the courts to hold trial against someone they feel is guilty of a crime, should the prosecutor refuse to indict.

==Private prosecution==
{{main article|Private prosecution}}

In the early history of England, victims of a crime and their family had the right to hire a private attorney to prosecute criminal charges against the person alleged to have injured the victim.&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;{{citation|volume=13|publisher=Cap.

However, privately funded prosecutors constituted a significant element of the state criminal justice system throughout the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Privately Funded Prosecution of Crime in the Nineteenth-Century United States|author=Robert M. Ireland|journal=The American Journal of Legal History|volume=39|number=1|date=Jan 1995|pages=43–58|publisher=Temple University|jstor=845749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a private prosecutor was incorporated into the [[common law]] of [[Virginia]], but is no longer permitted there.&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt; Private prosecutors were also used in [[North Carolina]] as late as 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=25|publisher=Am. U. L. Rev.|page=754|date=1975–1976|title=Outmoded Concept of Private Prosecution, The|author=Sidman, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private prosecution has been used in [[Nigeria]], but the practice is being phased out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Private Prosecution in Nigeria: Recent Developments and Some Proposals|author=Isabella Okagbue|journal=[[Journal of African Law]]|volume=34|number=1|date=Spring 1990|pages=53–66|publisher=Cambridge University Press on behalf of the School of Oriental and African Studies|jstor=745600|doi=10.1017/s0021855300008196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce L. Benson]]'s ''[[To Serve and Protect (book)|To Serve and Protect]]'' lauds the role of private prosecutors, often employed by [[prosecution association]]s, in serving the needs of crime victims in England. Radical [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] theory holds that public prosecutors should not exist, but that crimes should instead be treated as civil [[tort]]s. [[Murray Rothbard]] writes, "In a libertarian world, there would be no crimes against an ill-defined 'society,' and therefore no such person as a 'district attorney' who decides on a charge and then presses those charges against an alleged criminal."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Ethics of Liberty|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/thirteen.asp|chapter=Punishment and Proportionality|author=Rothbard, Murray|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117215622/http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/thirteen.asp|archivedate=2014-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Registration of Political Parties Act 1998''' (c. 48), is an [[Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which made legal provision to set up a register of [[political parties]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Previously there had been no such register, and political parties were not specially recognised. There were 468 political parties registered in the UK on 8 October 2016.

The legislation was introduced for a variety of reasons. It was planned to introduce some elements of list-based [[proportional representation]] in elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]] and also to introduce full list-based proportional representation in [[European elections|European Parliament elections]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and for that, political parties needed to have a stronger legal recognition. Additionally, various pieces of legislation needed to refer to parties and so were using ''ad hoc'' definitions, which might have been incompatible.

Another motivation was the use of the names ''Literal Democrats'', ''Conversative Party'', and ''Labor Party'' by people in elections in the 1990s; these names were criticised as potentially confusing with the names of the three major parties in the UK (the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], respectively). In the [[European Parliament election, 1994 (UK)|1994 European Elections]], [[Richard Huggett]] stood as a Literal Democrat candidate for the [[Devon and East Plymouth (European Parliament constituency)|Devon and East Plymouth]] seat, taking more votes than the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] margin over the Liberal Democrats, leading to a legal challenge by the Liberal Democrat candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110524223731/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/politics/Challenger-could-spell-ballot-paper.2603467.jp "Challenger could spell ballot paper trouble for Tories' Davis"]. ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 21 February 2005. Archived from [http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=172702005 the original] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110142235/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=172702005 |date=10 January 2006 }} on 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Rewind: A Literal Democrat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27056001|accessdate=24 January 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=13 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation therefore introduced a register of political parties; and included provisions to prohibit "confusion" with already-existing parties, names that were "more than six words", or were "obscene or offensive".

As the act also permitted [[logo]]s on ballot papers, the act also introduced a similar register for emblems, which had the result that the [[Communist Party of Britain]] is the only party in the United Kingdom permitted to use the [[hammer and sickle]] as its ballot-paper logo, although they usually use the [[hammer and dove]] variant. Parties may register more than one emblem, or none at all; most have two or three.

The act was amended by the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] (2000 c. 41) to change the registration authority to the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] from "the registrar or other officer who performs the duty of registration of companies in England and Wales under the [[Companies Act 1985]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8366">'''Reverse domain name hijacking''' (also known as '''reverse cybersquatting''' or commonly abbreviated as 'RDNH'), occurs where a rightful [[trademark]] owner attempts to secure a domain name by making [[cybersquatting]] claims against a [[domain name]]’s "cybersquatter" owner.&lt;ref&gt;Sallen v. Corinthians Licenciamentos Ltda., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19976 (D. Mass. Dec. 19, 2000), rev’d, 273 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 2001) [hereinafter Sallen].&lt;/ref&gt;   This often intimidates domain name owners into transferring ownership of their domain names to trademark owners to avoid legal action, particularly when the domain names belong to smaller organizations or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Warren B. Chik, Lord of Your Domain, But Master of None: The Need to Harmonize and Recalibrate the Domain Name Regime of Ownership and Control, 16 INT’L J.L. &amp; INFO. TECH. 8, 60 (2008) [hereinafter Chik].&lt;/ref&gt;   Reverse domain name hijacking is most commonly enacted by larger corporations and famous individuals, in defense of their rightful trademark or to prevent libel or slander.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse domain name "hijacking" is a legal remedy to counter the practice of [[domain squatting]], wherein individuals hold many registered domain names containing famous third party trademarks with the intent of profiting by selling the domain names back to trademark owners.&lt;ref&gt;Sallen, supra note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;   Trademark owners initially responded by filing cybersquatting lawsuits against registrants to enforce their trademark rights.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, as the number of cybersquatting incidents grew, trademark owners noticed that registrants would often settle their cases rather than litigate.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;   Cybersquatting lawsuits are a defensive strategy to combat cybersquatting, however such lawsuits may also be used as a way of strongarming innocent domain name registrants into giving up domain names that the trademark owner is not, in fact, entitled to.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidheiny v. Weber, 164 F.Supp.2d 484, 487 (E.D. Pa. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fridman|first1=David|title=Domain Hijacking and the Risks it Poses to your Brand|url=https://www.brandshield.com/blog/?p=48|publisher=BrandShield|accessdate=22 October 2014|quote=The smaller rightful domain owners are often intimidated by legal action and much of the time give up the rights to that domain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UDRP restrictions on reverse domain name hijacking ==

Paragraph 15(e) of the [[UDRP]] Rules defines reverse domain name hijacking as the filing of a complaint in bad faith, resulting in the abuse of the UDRP administrative process.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;   It becomes difficult to objectively quantify what constitutes subjective “[[bad faith]],” resulting in panels often viewing parties’ factual discrepancies as indeterminable or immaterial at best.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;   Therefore, despite its express recognition in the UDRP, reverse domain name hijacking findings are rare and based heavily on the factual circumstances surrounding each case.&lt;ref&gt;Int'l Driver Training, Inc. v. Web Integrations, LLC and Comedy Driving Inc., D2009-0129 (WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center, Apr. 9, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstances which have been cited by [[WIPO]] panels as justification for a finding of reverse domain name hijacking includes:
* When the registration of the domain predates any trademark rights of the Complainant.
* When the complaint has provided no evidence of bad faith registration or use directed towards the Complainant.
* Where the Complainant has used the UDRP as a Plan "B" option to attempt to secure the domain after commercial negotiations have broken off.
* Where the Complainant has attempted to deceive the domain owner or makes misrepresentations or fails to disclose material information to the panel.

Examples of such findings include the following WIPO cases: ''Ron Paul vs. RonPaul.org''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=D2013-0371&lt;/ref&gt; (2013), ''Webpass, Inc. v. Paul Breitenbach''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2010/d2010-1796.html%20&lt;/ref&gt; (2010), ''[[Urban Logic, Inc. v. Urban Logic, Peter Holland]]'' (2009), ''[[David Robinson v. Brendan]]'' (2008), ''[[Decal v. Gregory Ricks]]'' (2008), ''Hero v. The Heroic Sandwich''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2008/d2008-0779.html&lt;/ref&gt; (2008), ''[[Poker Host Inc. v. Russ “Dutch” Boyd]]'' (2008), ''[[FCC Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas v “FCC.COM”]]'' (2007), ''[[Liquid Nutrition v. liquidnutrition.com]]'' (2007), ''[[Rohl, LLC v. ROHL SA]]'' (2006), ''Her Majesty the Queen ([[Elizabeth II]]) v. Virtual Countries, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand v. Virtual Countries, Inc|url=https://www.esqwire.com/Cases.asp?intCaseID=185|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Deutsche Welle v. DiamondWare]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2000/d2000-1202.html&lt;/ref&gt; (2000). A list of over one hundred reverse domain name hijacking decisions is available at rdnh.com.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rdnh.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Although UDRP panelists currently have no tools by which to punish abuses such as Reverse Domain Name Hijacking, such a finding might be used in a local jurisdiction where such abuses might constitute a tort such as [[Tortious interference|tortious interference with contract]] or an [[unfair business practice]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== ACPA restrictions on reverse domain name hijacking ==

The [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] does not expressly recognize reverse domain name hijacking and often only limits defendants’ recovery to retention or transference of the domain name.&lt;ref&gt;Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1125(d)(2) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   It also fails to provide any remedies for victims of attempted reverse cybersquatting.&lt;ref&gt;Frayne v. Chicago 2016, 2009 WL 65236 *2 (N.D. Ill. 2009); General Media Comm., Inc. v. Crazy Troll, LLC, 2007 WL 102988 (S.D.N.Y. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;   However, the statute permits some monetary relief where bad faith, reckless disregard or the willful violation of a court order are involved.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1125(d)(2)(ii).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a 1975 amendment to the Lanham Act gives courts discretion in awarding reasonable attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party in “exceptional” circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher P. Bussert, Interpreting the “Exceptional Cases” Provision of Section 117(a) of the Lanham Act: When an Award of Attorney’s Fees is Appropriate, 92 TRADEMARK REP. 1118, 1118-19 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;   In attempting to define “exceptional,” Circuit courts are split as to what objectively constitutes malicious, fraudulent, or deliberate misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;S. Rep. No. 93-1440, at 5 (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7132, 7136.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some courts award such fees where bad faith or baseless litigation is involved while other courts look for economic coercion or failure to reference controlling law.&lt;ref&gt;Anne M. Mellen, Awarding Attorneys’ Fees Under the Lanham Act: Egregious Litigation Conduct in the “Exceptional” Case, 74 U. CIN. L. REV. 1111, 1117 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   Nevertheless, due to the inherent animosity arising from being sued, courts generally hold prevailing defendants to a higher level of scrutiny, requiring vexatious or harassing conduct to shift attorney’s fees in their favor.

== Implications ==

Neither the UDRP nor the ACPA provides much deterrent to curb trademark owners’ abuse of their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Brett|title=Reverse Domain Hijacking: Extreme Makeover|url=http://www.dnjournal.com/legal/extreme-makeover.htm|publisher=DNJournal|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To abate reverse domain name hijacking practices, some legal professionals believe Congress should enact laws that are specifically designed to facilitate litigation against reverse cybersquatters.&lt;ref&gt;Chik, supra note 2 at 60.&lt;/ref&gt;   Similarly, some advocates argue for stronger penalties to deter the unlawful deprivation of validly registered domain names,&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; such as fines and precluding offending trademark owners from filing cybersquatting claims for a designated period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1221">The '''Seneschal of the Saintonge''' was an officer carrying out and managing the domestic affairs of the lord of the district of the [[Saintonge]].  During the course of the twelfth century, the [[seneschal]]ship, also became an office of military command.

The seneschal managed the household, coordinating between the receivers of various landholdings and the chamber, treasury, and the chancellory or chapel.  The seneschals of the Saintonge, like those appointed in [[Seneschal of Normandy|Normandy]], [[Seneschal of Poitou|Poitou]], and [[Seneschal of Anjou|Anjou]] had custody of demesne fortresses, the regional treasuries, and presidency of the highest court of regional custom.

The '''Single African Air Transport Market''' ('''SAATM''') is a project of the [[African Union]] to create a single market for air transport in Africa. Once completely in force, the single market is supposed to allow significant freedom of air transport in Africa, advancing the AU's {{em|Agenda 2063}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uneca.org/stories/single-african-air-transport-market-launched|title=The Single African Air Transport Market is launched|publisher=[[UN Economic Commission for Africa]]|date=2 May 2018|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily, the goal of the SAATM is to fully implement the 1999 [[Yamoussoukro Decision]]. This means that all participants agree to lift [[market access]] restrictions for airlines, remove [[foreign ownership|restrictions on ownership]], grant each other extended [[Freedoms of the air|air traffic rights]] (first through fifth freedoms, not affecting [[cabotage]] rights), and liberalise flight frequency and capacity limits. Both passenger and [[air cargo|cargo aviation]] are included.&lt;ref name="lexology"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=44fb879c-7a37-4060-8db2-399146747ec0|title=Liberalising aviation in Africa: overview of single air transport market|last=Azinge|first=Craig|publisher=Lexology|date=11 April 2018|url-access=registration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410233809/https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=44fb879c-7a37-4060-8db2-399146747ec0|archive-date=11 April 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also seeks to harmonise safety and security regulations in aviation, based on [[ICAO]] requirements.&lt;ref name="schlumberger" /&gt; Oversight over the SAATM is exercised by the African Union, its [[Regional Economic Communities]] and dedicated sub-institutions for supervision and dispute settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=http://www.nepad.org/resource/single-african-air-transport-market|title= The Single African Air Transport Market|format=PDF|publisher=[[NEPAD]]|date=January 2018|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The benefit of liberalising air traffic, particularly the [[Freedoms of the air#Fifth freedom|fifth freedom]], was first acknowledged in the Yamoussoukro Declaration of 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=http://repository.uneca.org/handle/10855/13773|title=Declaration of Yamoussoukro on a new African Air Transport Policy|publisher=UN Economic Commission for Africa|format=PDF|date=October 1988|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration was reaffirmed in 1999, when the African Union passed the [[Yamoussoukro Decision]].&lt;ref name="schlumberger"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/849021434746549856/Air-Transport-OpenSkiesForAfrica.pdf|title=Open Skies for Africa – Implementing the Yamoussoukro Decision|last=Schlumberger|first=Charles E.|publisher=[[The World Bank]]|location=Washington, D.C.|date=2010|isbn=978-0-8213-8205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the implementation of the decision faced obstacles, as regulatory bodies did not become operational as stipulated in the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.internationallawoffice.com/Newsletters/Aviation/International/George-Etomi-Partners/Liberalising-aviation-in-Africa-the-Yamoussoukro-Decision|title=Liberalising aviation in Africa: the Yamoussoukro Decision|last=Momoh|first=Oshokha Michael|publisher=International Law Office|url-access=registration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220023421/https://www.internationallawoffice.com/Newsletters/Aviation/International/George-Etomi-Partners/Liberalising-aviation-in-Africa-the-Yamoussoukro-Decision|archive-date=20 February 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of countries, in an effort of protectionism, refused to grant fifth freedom rights to foreign airlines.&lt;ref name="schlumberger" /&gt;

In 2015, the {{em|Declaration for the Establishment of a Single African Air Transport Market}} laid the framework for a single market implementing the Yamoussoukro Decision to be established by 2017.&lt;ref name="lexology" /&gt; This deadline was later extended with plans to launch the single market during the 30th African Union Summit in [[Addis Ababa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.tralac.org/news/article/12254-establishment-of-a-single-african-air-transport-market-ministerial-working-group-experts-meeting.html|title=Establishment of a Single African Air Transport Market: Ministerial Working Group Experts’ meeting|website=tralac.org|date=12 October 2017|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the launch of the SAATM was then made official on 28 January 2018 by Rwandan President [[Paul Kagame]], as new [[Chairperson of the African Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/31/africa/african-union-single-air-airline/index.html|title=Sky's the limit as Africa makes major move towards aviation single market|last=Giles|first=Chris|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4e672998-03f0-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5|title=Twenty-three African states launch single aviation market|last=Aglionby|first=John|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|location=Addis Ababa|url-access=limited|date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==

Some African governments and airlines have criticised the project. Especially smaller airlines, as well as the Ugandan government, allege that the agreement would lead to few big airlines dominating the market, thus stifling competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2018-01-30/africans-still-divided-single-air-transport-market|title=Africans Still Divided on Single Air Transport Market|last=Bekele|first=Kaleyesus|publisher=[[Aviation International News]]|date=30 January 2018|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Development Bank]], among other analysts, predicted that the SAATM would lead to cheaper flights, greater passenger volumes and economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/news/2018/04/development-bank-prepares-aviation-plan-africa|title=Development bank prepares aviation plan for Africa|last=Smulian|first=Mark|publisher=PublicFinance International|date=11 April 2018|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schlumberger" /&gt;

The [[International Air Transport Association]] commended the African Union for launching the single market, but warned that more work would be required to effectively implement the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2018-01-28-01.aspx|title=IATA Welcomes Single African Air Transport Market but Says Effective Implementation is Key|publisher=[[International Air Transport Association]]|date=28 January 2018|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79132">'''Insurance in South Africa''' describes a mechanism in that country for the reduction or minimisation of loss, owing to the constant exposure of people and assets to risks (be they natural or financial or personal). The kinds of loss which arise if such risks eventuate may be either patrimonial or non-patrimonial.

A general definition of [[insurance]] is supplied in the case of ''[[Lake v Reinsurance Corporation Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1967 (3) SA 124 (W).&lt;/ref&gt; which describes it as a contract between an insurer and an insured, in terms of which the insurer undertakes to render to the insured a sum of [[money]], or its equivalent, on the occurrence of a specified uncertain event in which the insured has some interest, in return for the payment of a [[Risk premium|premium]].

According to ''LAWSA'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Insurance is the result of man’s efforts to create financial security in the face of dangers to his life, person and [[Estate (law)|estate]]. A typical desire of a man is to form and develop his estate [....] The object of forming and developing an estate may, however, be thwarted by dangers to which his present and future position is exposed: if these materialise they may bring about undesirable consequences which may affect his estate immediately or in the future. Even while a danger is still remote it creates an element of uncertainty, whether in relation to its actual occurrence, the exact time of its occurrence, or the extent of its undesirable consequences. This element of uncertainty creates insecurity. Accordingly, it may be said that man’s need for security arises from the tension between his desire to form and develop his estate, on the one hand, and the dangers threatening to thwart that desire, on the other. The most effective and obvious way of achieving security is to take direct precautionary measures against imminent or potential harm [....] One of the most satisfactory general methods of creating [[Economic security|financial security]] against [[risk]]s therefore seems to be that of spreading the risk among a number of persons all exposed to the same risk and all prepared to make a relatively negligible contribution towards neutralising the detrimental effects of this risk which may materialise for any one or more of their number. This is known as insurance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[law]] of insurance in [[South Africa]] consists of

* rules peculiar to insurance (like the rules on [[insurable interest]], [[subrogation]] and [[double insurance]]);
* rules applicable to all [[contract]]s (like the rules on [[Ask price|offer]] and [[acceptance]], and contracts in favour of third parties); and
* general contractual rules that have undergone changes in the insurance context (like the rules on [[insurance warranties]]).

Broadly speaking, the law of insurance in South Africa is concerned with

* the conclusion and consequences of insurance contracts;
* general aspects of [[law of damages]];
* the rules on insurance intermediaries;
* insurance [[tax law]]; and
* insurance [[company]] or [[supervision law]].

== History ==
Early [[Roman-Dutch law]] dealt mainly with [[marine insurance]].

In 1879, the [[Cape Colony]] passed the General Law Amendment Act, introducing [[English law]] to govern “every suit, action and cause having reference to fire, life and marine insurance” in the Cape. In the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], English law was not incorporated by legislation; Roman-Dutch law remained applicable in principle, and was never officially displaced, but the influence of English law was felt also in these regions.

In 1977, the [[Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act]] repealed the Cape General Law Amendment Act. This repeal was interpreted by the Appellate Division, in the leading case on the sources of South African insurance law, ''[[Mutual &amp; Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality]]'', to mean that the Roman-Dutch law of insurance was restored.

South African insurance law is governed mainly by Roman-Dutch law as its [[common law]]. Nevertheless, the courts have consistently regarded English law as having strong persuasive authority whenever Roman-Dutch authority is lacking or insufficient. In respect of contracts concluded after the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act took effect, English law no longer has any binding authority in any part of South Africa, but it has been argued that, "judging from trade usages prevailing in the South African insurance industry, it may be assumed that the principles of English insurance law are still being adhered to."&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke ''General Principles'' para 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative Framework ==
The following [[legislation]] is of especial importance to South African insurance law:

* the [[Long-term Insurance Act]];&lt;ref&gt;Act 52 of 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Short-term Insurance Act]];&lt;ref&gt;Act 53 of 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Insurance Laws Amendment Act]];&lt;ref&gt;Act 27 of 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Financial Services Board Act]];&lt;ref&gt;Act 97 of 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* the [[Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Act 37 of 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of insurance ==
Classification is often merely a matter of convenience, but there may be compelling reasons for it; it may even reflect a difference in underlying legal principles. Various criteria may be applied in classifying contracts of insurance. The most important are

* the nature of the interest insured;
* the nature of the event insured against;
* the way in which the amount recoverable under the contract is determined; and
* the way in which any [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s of the insurer are dealt with.

It is possible, and often desirable, for one and the same insurance contract to combine different classes of insurance.

=== Indemnity ''versus'' capital insurance ===
The most fundamental distinction between various insurance contracts is that between [[indemnity insurance]] and what is usually called [[non-indemnity insurance]], but which is here referred to as "capital insurance."

==== Indemnity insurance ====
In the case of indemnity insurance, the contract between the parties provides that the insurer must indemnify the insured for [[patrimonial loss]] suffered as the proximate result of the occurrence of the event insured against. It is uncertain whether the event insured against (like [[fire]] or [[theft]], for example) will actually occur, but it obviously must before loss can be quantified.

In the context of indemnity insurance, examples of insurable interests include

* [[real right]]s;
* [[personal right]]s;
* [[legal liability]]; and
* the factual expectation of damage.

The purpose of the contract of indemnity insurance is to restore the insured to his position ''quo ante''. Nothing more than patrimonial indemnity may be recovered, as is illustrated by the rules on over-insurance and double insurance. The insured is not entitled to make a profit out of his loss. It is accordingly said that the [[principle of indemnity]] governs indemnity insurance.

==== Capital insurance ====
In the case of capital or non-indemnity insurance, the insurer undertakes to pay to the insured a specified amount, or periodical amounts, upon the happening of the event insured against: for example, R5,000 if the insured dies or loses a limb. This is generally [[non-patrimonial loss]]. On the face of it, the contract does not purport to indemnify the insured against patrimonial loss.

According to traditional perceptions, the interests amenable to capital insurance are limited in number. The best examples of insurable interests are the unlimited interest a person has

* in his own life;
* in his health of mind; and
* in his health of body and limbs.

A person may also have a moral or emotional interest in the life, health and body of his spouse.

Capital insurance, then, depends on an event that invariably relates to the person of the insured or a third party.

The types of events which are open to capital insurance are likewise limited in number. Typical events are

* death, including the death of an unborn child;
* the continuation of life;
* birth; and
* accidents causing bodily injury.

Insurance against other events must therefore take the form of indemnity insurance. A contract operating on the person of the insured or third party is not necessarily a contract of capital insurance, however, because it could have been the intention of the parties to conclude a pure contract of indemnity insurance.

In the case of capital insurance, there is certainty that event insured against will occur (whereas in the case of indemnity insurance there is no such certainty), but the timing is uncertain. The amount is determined at time of the issuing of the policy, and is not related to loss suffered.

==== Differences and similarities ====
The difference between indemnity and capital insurance must be taken to lie in the nature of the interest that is the object of the insurance:

* In indemnity insurance, the interest must of necessity be of a patrimonial nature; otherwise no financial loss or damage can be caused through its impairment.
* By contrast, the interest that serves as the object of a capital-insurance contract must be regarded as non-patrimonial in substance.

The law determines which interests may be insured in terms of an indemnity-insurance contract. The same holds good for capital insurance.

Important consequences are attached to the distinction between indemnity and capital insurance. Capital insurers, for example, are not entitled to claim a proportionate contribution by other insurers, or to demand subrogation of the insured's rights in respect of the loss. By the same token, the doctrine of imputation of benefits does not apply to capital insurance.

=== Short- and long-term insurance ===
A distinction between short-term and long-term insurance is embodied in the definitions under the Insurance Acts.

Long-term insurance business means the business of providing policy benefits under defined long-term policies. In terms of section 1 of the Long-term Insurance Act, “long-term policy” means an [[assistance policy]], a [[disability policy]], a [[fund policy]], a [[health policy]], a [[life policy]] or a [[sinking fund policy]], or a contract comprising a combination of any of those policies. It also includes a contract whereby any such contract is varied. (See also the definition of “Health Policy” to distinguish from short-term insurance.)

Short-term insurance business refers to the business of providing policy benefits under defined short-term policies. Under the terms of section 1 of the Short-term Insurance Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 53 of 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; “short-term policy” means an [[engineering policy]], a [[guarantee policy]], a [[liability policy]], a [[miscellaneous policy]], a [[motor policy]], an [[accident and health policy]], a [[property policy]] or a [[transportation policy]], or a contract comprising a combination of any of those policies. The definition also includes a contract whereby any such contract is renewed or varied.

The division of insurance business into short- and long-term insurance business is for administrative purposes. Most short-term insurance is indemnity insurance, but short-term insurance is not restricted to indemnity insurance, since an "accident and health policy" belongs to the class of capital insurance. Long-term insurance, by the same token, is not confined to capital insurance, because "fund insurance" appears to be a case of indemnity insurance.

"In the final analysis," writes Reinecke, "the real difference between long-term and short-term insurance is not clear."&lt;ref&gt;''General Principles'' 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of the insurance contract ==
The basis of contractual liability, where the parties to a contract do not misunderstand each other, is ''consensus ad idem animo contrahendi''. In those exceptional cases in which the parties misunderstand each other and only apparent consent exists, liability appears to rest on the reasonable reliance by the contracting party on the existence of consensus. This is known in contract law as the reliance theory. Such consent may be termed “constructive consent.” Of course, there is always room also for the application of the doctrine of [[estoppel]], if a litigant can satisfy its more stringent requirements, and if he wishes to avail himself of this remedy in order to hold a party bound to the appearance of consensus he has created. For a contract as such to exist, however, actual or constructive consent must be achieved. This is brought about by offer and acceptance.

These general principles of the [[law of contract in South Africa]] also hold good for contracts of insurance, and must be applied to such contracts.

It is sometimes maintained that a contract of insurance comes into existence as soon as the parties have agreed upon every material term of the contract they wish to make, such as

* the person or property to be insured;
* the event insured against;
* the period of insurance; and
* the amount of the premium.

This suggests that the parties need not agree on terms other than material terms. For their contract to qualify as one of insurance, the parties must agree on the essentials of insurance. If they do not reach specific agreement, there can be no contract of insurance (although another type of contract may come into existence).

For the contract to be valid, however, the parties must in fact agree on every term each of them regards as being a non-severable part of the proposed contract. This requirement is subject only to the ordinary rules creating contractual liability despite the absence of consensus. As a rule, the parties to a contract of insurance do not apply their minds to each specific term; they contract on the basis of the insurer's usual terms for the particular type of risk to be insured against.

The contract of insurance comes into being only when consensus is reached. Until then, the anticipated contract does not provide cover, although the eventual contract may operate retrospectively. Pending the conclusion of their negotiations, the parties often conclude interim insurance to cover the proposer during the period prior to the final decision on the main contract. Interim-insurance cover is provided by means of a contract, and therefore also rests on consensus.

Many facets of insurance business, including the conclusion of contracts, are transacted through insurance agents representing the respective parties. If, during the conclusion of the contract, a party is represented by an agent with authority to enter into the contract on behalf of his principal, the intention and acts of the agent must be taken into consideration in deciding whether a contract has come into existence.

=== Essential elements of an insurance contract ===
In ''[[British Oak Insurance v Atmore]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1939 TPD 9.&lt;/ref&gt; the locus classicus, the ''essentialia'' of a contract of insurance were enumerated as follows:

* the person or property insured;
* the risk insured against;
* the amount payable by the insurer on the occurrence of the event insured against;
* the premium; and
* the period of the insurance cover.

No specific formalities are required, but the regulations to the Short Term Insurance Act contain certain requirements for the purposes of issuing a policy.

The policy document normally contains the contract.

== Concepts in insurance law ==

=== Proposal ===
In general, insurers do not make binding offers to insure; rather, they invite the public (by invoking the aid of intermediaries or otherwise) to apply for insurance. The actual offer to contract is accordingly made by the proposed insured, almost invariably on a printed form issued by the insurer and completed or signed by the proposer.

As formulated by insurers, this proposal form does not usually leave much room for [[bargaining]] between the parties. What bargaining there is usually is confined to matters which cannot be settled in advance, such as the amount of the insurance, the period of insurance and special circumstances relating to the risk. Occasionally the proposed insured may request a deletion or addition: for example, by way of endorsements, to be effected in respect of the insurer's standard form of contract.

The premium is not normally recorded in the proposal form. Most other terms of the proposed contract are also not expressly stated, the intention being to contract on the usual terms of the insurer. In determining the usual terms of the insurer, evidence of other policies issued by the insurer is admissible. Once a reference to the usual terms is included in the contract, the insured actually agrees to them; he cannot afterwards be heard to say that he did not have the opportunity to ascertain the exact content of the terms.

The proposal form invariably contains a series of questions put by the insurer which must be answered to obtain information necessary for calculating the risk. Apart from being a formal offer, the proposal form is therefore also a written record of representations made by the proposer. Generally, the proposer is required

* to warrant the truth of his answers; and
* to accept them as the basis of the proposed contract.

There is a duty of disclosure, in other words.

The proposal is normally incorporated into the formal insurance contract by reference.

Although the above procedure represents the general position, consent may be achieved in any way the parties choose. For example,

* an offer to take out insurance may be made by tendering a premium; or
* an insured may offer to renew an existing contract by paying a premium without completing a fresh proposal form.

If a proposal form submitted to the insurer has not been authorised by the prospective insured, it may not serve as an offer by him. A policy issued by the insurer in response to such an unauthorised offer may, however, itself constitute an offer to be accepted by the proposed insured.

It is also possible that the proposal by the prospective insured is not acceptable to the insurer as it stands, but that the insurer is willing to contract on other terms. In such a case, a counteroffer may be made by the insurer. It may also happen that the insurer makes the offer from the outset, as in the case of coupon insurance or interim insurance.

=== Acceptance ===
Acceptance of an offer is an express or tacit statement of intention in which the offeree signifies his unconditional assent to the offer. In principle, the offeror must be notified of the offeree's decision to accept the offer. The insurer, as offeree, usually accepts the offer by sending to the proposer a policy accompanied by a covering letter which explains that the proposal has been accepted.

Dispatching the policy is in itself sufficient to communicate acceptance. A demand for the premium by the insurer, and, in exceptional circumstances, receipt of the premium, may also operate as an acceptance. A firm acceptance of a proposal may even be contained in an interim cover note, although such a note is generally an acceptance of a proposal for temporary cover only.

=== Policy ===
Contracts of insurance need not be in writing to be valid, but the standard practice is to reduce them to writing. A document expressing the terms of a contract of insurance is called a "policy."

=== Premium ===
A “premium” is primarily a sum of money. According to one Roman-Dutch authority, a premium may also consist in something other than money. If this were indeed the position, "it is rather strange that there was no discussion of the contingency that the premium may be defective."&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke ''General Principles'' para 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested, for modern law, that the definition of "premium" should be widened so as to encompass something other than money: "Although there is no objection in principle to the enforceability of such contracts, it is doubtful whether there is any need to bring a contract involving a non-monetary 'premium' under the umbrella of insurance."&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke ''General Principles'' para 124.&lt;/ref&gt; No judicial preference has as yet been expressed. The term “premium” is defined in insurance legislation, but the definition there does not shed any light on the nature of a premium.

=== Interim insurance ===
It sometimes takes a considerable time to finalise the preliminaries for the conclusion of a contract of insurance. In order to protect the proposed insured during the interval before the issue of a final policy, the parties frequently resort to temporary or [[interim insurance]] to cover the proposer immediately but for a limited period of time. This is common practice in the case of short-term insurance contracts, but it may be invoked in all other forms of insurance.

Although limited in duration, interim insurance is nothing less than a fully-fledged contract of insurance. This being so, the proposed insured must observe the usual duty of [[good faith]] towards his insurer. Similarly, the contract must comply with all the requirements for the validity of insurance contracts in general.

The contract of interim insurance is separate from and independent of the final contract of insurance following on the conclusion of an interim contract, although it may share some or most of the terms of the final contract. If a claim arises during the currency of the interim contract, it must be considered in terms of the interim contract itself, not in terms of the final contract. This may be of importance where only the final contract, not the interim contract, is voidable because of a misrepresentation or other unlawful conduct, and also where the terms of the two contracts differ.

Granting insurance cover by way of interim insurance does not oblige the insurer to provide permanent cover. By the same token, the person enjoying interim cover is not compelled to accept permanent cover from the insurer merely because he has accepted interim cover.

==== Cover notes ====
The interim insurance contract is usually embodied in a document which is commonly known as a “[[cover note]],” but other expressions--“protection note,” “interim policy,” “temporary policy” and, inappropriately, “interim receipt”—occur as well.

Temporary insurance is sometimes granted in terms of a reminder to renew an existing insurance contract, and can be encountered in various other types of documents. Whether a document recording the terms of an interim contract of insurance may be regarded as the exclusive memorial of such a contract depends on the intention of the parties.

A cover note may not normally be regarded as a “policy” in the ordinary sense of the word. Nonetheless, the definitions of the various “policies” in the Long-term Insurance Act, and in the Short-term Insurance Act, are wide enough to include cover notes and all other like documents recording insurance cover.

== Insurable interest ==
The insured must prove that an [[insurable interest]] existed in order to prove loss. The test is whether the insured will incur financial loss, or will fail to derive an anticipated financial benefit, if the event insured against occurs. In principle, the object of insurance must be in existence at the time of the occurrence of the peril insured against. If the insured has no interest at the time of the occurrence of the event insured against, he cannot suffer any loss or damage. Since the function of insurable interest is to determine whether the insured has suffered a loss, the insured's interest, by virtue of the terms of the contract, must exist at the time of the materialisation of the peril insured against. If the insured does not possess an interest at that crucial time, there is no object secured by the insurance. Consequently, the insured can bring no claim under the contract for loss suffered.

If the insured does not have an insurable interest in the object, the contract will be void and unenforceable, and regarded essentially as a gamble or wager.  The purpose of the requirement of insurable interest is to distinguish insurance from wagering. The basic principle of insurance is to protect against loss; it is not concerned with the creation of opportunities for speculative gain. In the formative days of insurance law, things were quite different; insurance was in fact often indistinguishable from gambling. Excesses led in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries to the outright banning of life insurance, for example, in France, the Dutch Republic and Sweden. The more reasonable course, requiring an insurable interest as a prerequisite for the purchase of insurance, was pioneered in England,  making insurance more than a mere game of chance, improving the repute of the insurance industry (formerly frowned upon as an aleatory contract),  and gaining wider acceptance for it. As we have seen, South Africa formally imported the doctrine of insurable interest from England, but in 1977 the legislature repealed the colonial ordinances which had achieved this. The Appellate Division, in ''[[Mutual and Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality]]'',  took their repeal to mean that the Roman-Dutch law of insurance is now the common law for insurance.

It should be noted that “there is no South African statute which lays down the need for a so-called insurable interest,”  and that Roman-Dutch law had no discrete doctrine of insurable interest. It could be said to be implied, however, by the fact that Roman-Dutch law defined a contract of insurance as one which transfers a risk threatening the patrimony of the insured. Roman law also banned wagers.

Whether or not an indirect economic interest is enough to constitute an insurable interest, as opposed to a mere wager, will depend on the facts of each case.

In ''[[Littlejohn v Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society]]'', a husband had taken out fire insurance in his own name over the contents of a shop owned by his wife. (They were married out of [[community of property]].) The court found that he had an insurable interest, because he would obviously be in a worse position, in patrimonial terms, after his wife's property was burnt.

In ''[[Phillips v General Accident Insurance]]'', the court held that a husband had an insurable interest in his wife's [[jewellery]], even though he was under no obligation to replace it.

In ''[[Refrigerated Trucking v Zive NO]]'', the owner of a vehicle was found to have an insurable interest in sustaining insurance for liability incurred by persons who drove his vehicles with his consent.

In ''[[Lorcom Thirteen v Zurich Insurance]]'', the bases for Lorcom's insurable interest in the “Buccaneer” fishing vessel were as follows:

* Lorcom was the sole [[shareholder]] of the owner of the vessel.
* In terms of a purchase agreement, Lorcom would become the owner on “effective date:” that is, upon full payment.
* Lorcom had the right of use of the vessel.
* Lorcom held the [[fishing permit]].

Below are some further examples of insurable interest:

# An owner of [[property]] has an insurable interest to the full value of that property.
# A person who has a right to performance has an insurable interest in that claim (to insure against the risk of non-performance).
# A person who does not own property, but who possesses it in good faith (believing that he is the owner of that property), has an insurable interest to the full value of that property.
# A person has an insurable interest in restricting increases in liabilities. For example, [[directors of a company]] may take out indemnity insurance in respect of the negligent decisions they may make.
# A person has an unlimited interest in his own life and [[bodily integrity]].
# An insurer may take out insurance on the life of a [[spouse]] for an unlimited amount.
# Parents and children are allowed to take out insurance on each other's lives, subject to some limitations: no more than R10,000 if the child is under six years old, and no more than R30,000 for children under fourteen.
# Shareholders, directors and partners are allowed to take out “key-man” insurance on the lives of their co-shareholders or partners, as the case may be.

== Duration of insurance contracts ==
Insurance contracts may endure for a definite or indefinite period. Usually the duration is stipulated in the insurance contract or policy document. The contract may terminate or be cancelled, as the case may be,

* by giving the requisite [[notice]] for [[cancellation (insurance)|cancellation]];
* upon payment (as in the case of an [[Endowment policy|endowment]] policy or life insurance);
* in the event of total destruction of property, for which the insurer has paid;
* if the insured exercises an election to renew a contract, thus giving rise to a new contract; and
* if premiums are not paid timeously, in which case the policy will lapse.

== Duty to disclose material facts ==
The doctrine of disclosure is based on the general doctrine of good faith. Usually there is a “declaration” at the end of the proposal form that the answers to the questions in the proposal form are the basis of the policy. The proposer is usually required to warrant the truth of the answers. The proposal is incorporated by reference into the formal policy.

The insurer has a right to avoid liability on the contract if the proposer misrepresents a material fact, or if he fails to disclose a material fact. In other words, a breach of the duty of good faith renders the contract [[voidable]] at the instance of the insurer, after he has been notified of the non-disclosure.

Both positive and negative [[misrepresentation]] are recognised as grounds for avoiding the insurance contract.

=== Positive misrepresentation ===
To be [[Crime|unlawful]] or [[wrongful]], the statement which constitutes a positive misrepresentation must be wholly false, or at least inaccurate. Whether a statement is false or inaccurate will, in the final analysis, have to be judged according to the [[convictions of the community]]. This is the general criterion for establishing wrongfulness.

If the statement is wholly false and thus completely untrue, the issue is relatively simple. If, for example, a proposer for motor-vehicle insurance states in answer to a question in a proposal form that he has not been involved in an accident during the past three years, whereas in fact he has, the statement is obviously wholly false. The same may be said of a statement in a proposal for fire insurance that the premises to be insured are occupied by a particular person, whereas they are not; or that no proposal for similar insurance has been declined in the past, whereas in fact it has.

The position is not always so straightforward. A statement may, for instance, be inaccurate because it is incomplete and so mislead the other party to the contract by the suppression of a part of the true facts. Thus, in answer to the question of whether or not a proposal or insurance has ever been declined or cancelled, a proposer may state that no proposal has ever been declined, thereby telling the truth, but omitting to say that a contract has been cancelled. This is a substantially inaccurate statement, in spite of the fact that it is literally and completely true as far as the declining of a proposal is concerned.

If, in answer to the question of whether or not proposals have been made to other insurers, a proposer answers, “Yes, to the XYZ Company,” while he has also submitted proposals to a number of other insurance companies, the answer may be said to be partially true but substantially inaccurate. Likewise, a simple and unqualified request for particulars of previous losses, claims or insurance contracts means in principle that all such particulars are to be furnished. A proposer is expected to answer questions not only accurately, but as completely as is reasonable according to the convictions of the community.

=== Negative misrepresentation ===
A negative misrepresentation, or a misrepresentation ''per omissionem'', is a wrongful failure by one of the parties to a contract of insurance to disclose, during the course of the negotiations preceding the contract, certain facts within his knowledge. As a result, the other party is induced to enter into the contract, or to agree to specific terms thereof, whereas he would not have done so had those facts been disclosed. The failure may be accompanied by fault; it may even be completely innocent.

It is the nature of the act or conduct involved which distinguishes this type of misrepresentation from positive misrepresentation. Although it may also by typified as a statement of fact, the act creating the wrong impression is not a positive one; it is negative, in that it fails to remove an existing wrong impression by not disclosing facts which would remove that impression. The failure or omission may take the form of active concealment—that is, it may be intention—or inadvertent non-disclosure, which means that it may be negligent or even innocent.

=== Difference ===
The distinction between a positive misstatement and a negative non-disclosure is not always clearcut. In many instances, the same conduct may qualify as both. A failure to state all the material facts in answer to a question may amount to both a negative and a positive misrepresentation, inasmuch as the incomplete answer may create the impression that all the facts have been furnished.

=== Utmost good faith ===
In modern case law and literature, insurance contracts have been classified as contracts “of the utmost good faith” (contracts ''uberrimae fidei''). In general, contracts of this type have been said to impose a duty on the contracting parties to display the utmost good faith towards one another

* during the course of their negotiations preceding the contract; and also (albeit exceptionally, and in circumstances less clearly defined)
* during the existence of the contract itself.

The duty of utmost good faith (or its companion, an exceptionally high degree of good faith) appears in the case law and literature in connection with contracts which are typified by a relationship of close trust between the contracting parties.

The notion of utmost good faith, and the view that the insurance contract, or for that matter any other contract, may be a contract of the utmost good faith, was rejected in ''[[Mutual and Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;1985 (1) SA 419 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging that the origin of the phrase “''uberrima fides''” was doubtful, but noting that it apparently made its appearance in English law in 1850, the court was “unable to find any Roman-Dutch authority in support of the proposition that a contract of marine insurance is a contract ''uberrima fidei''”. The court rejected the expression as “alien, vague [and] useless [... and] without any particular meaning in law,” explaining

* that “there is no magic in the expression;”
* that “there are no degrees of good faith;”
* that “it is entirely inconceivable that there could be a little, more or most (utmost) good faith;” and
* that “there is no room for uberrima fides as a third category of faith in our law.”

Despite these remarks, and despite the fact that the [[House of Lords]] has subsequently, with reference to them, noted that “the concept of ''uberrima fides'' does not appear to have derived from [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [that] it has been regarded as unnecessary in civilian systems,” Reinecke observes that "old habits die slowly," and that insurance contracts are still occasionally referred to as "contracts of the utmost good faith." This usage, he urges, "must be deprecated," at least insofar as it suggests that the distinction between utmost good faith and good faith involves a difference of principle rather than merely one of degree.

=== Good faith ===
Contracts of insurance, like all other types of contract, are therefore contracts of good faith. The feature of good faith is not an essential or distinguishing feature of the insurance contract.

Despite rejecting the notion of utmost good faith, the court in ''M&amp;F v Oudtshoorn'' did not set out the content of the requirement of good faith as it pertains to insurance contracts. Accordingly, past authority which dealt with the content of the notion of utmost good faith must still be consulted for guidance, while bearing in mind that, in principle, any duty concerned is not a duty of exceptional good faith, but simply one of good faith.

The facts of ''M&amp;F v Oudtshoorn'' were these: A light aircraft collided with pole carrying electric power lines just outside the boundary of the [[Oudtshoorn]] [[aerodrome]]. The owner of the aircraft successfully sued the Municipality for the value of the aircraft. The Municipality tried to recover the amount from its insurers ([[Mutual and Federal]]), but the insurers successfully resisted the claim: When the policy had been negotiated, the Municipality had failed to disclose the close proximity of the aerodrome to pole and power lines, which constituted a hazard to aircraft using the aerodrome at night.

The court held that there is a duty on the insured and the insurer to disclose to each other, prior to the conclusion of the contract of insurance, every fact relative and material to the risk or to the assessment of the premium. The duty of disclosure relates to material facts, of which parties had actual or constructive knowledge prior to the conclusion of the contract of insurance. Breach of the duty of disclosure amounts to ''[[mala fides]]'' or fraud, and the aggrieved party may avoid contract.

=== Materiality test ===
A representation relating to material facts cannot be wrongful. The test for materiality is, in principle, an objective test. In ''M&amp;F v Oudtshoorn'', the Appellate Division formulated it thusly: whether or not, having regard to the circumstances, the undisclosed information is reasonably relevant to the risk, or to the assessment of the premium. In other words, are the facts of such a nature that knowledge of them would, objectively seen, probably influence a represent in deciding whether or not to conclude the contract, and on what terms to do so? The question, then, is a question of the effect of the non-disclosure: Would disclosure influence

* the decision of an insurer to accept a risk;
* the terms of risk acceptance; and
* the amount of the premium?

If the answer is in the affirmative, the undisclosed information or facts are material. The court applies a version of the reasonable-person test: that is, whether a reasonable person would have regarded the particular facts as relevant to the decision of an insurer concerning the assessment and underwriting of the risk. Some decisions use the standard of the reasonable insurer, others the reasonable proposer. Reinecke argues that the two are not incompatible: "A single combined test for materiality would be whether, according to the opinion of a reasonable person in the position of the particular proposer for instance, the facts in point are likely to influence the decision of a reasonable insurer when it comes to assessing the risk."

According to ''M&amp;F v Oudtshoorn'', the "reasonable man test" is applied to determine whether or not, from the point of view of the reasonable man, or of the average prudent person, the undisclosed facts or information is reasonably relative to the risk or the assessment of the premium. The test, then, refers to those facts which are objectively and reasonably related to an insurer's decision when all the circumstances of the case are taken into account.

In terms of section 59(1)(b) of the Long-Term Insurance Act, and section 53(1)(b) of the Short-Term Insurance Act,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The representation or non-disclosure shall be regarded as material if a reasonable, prudent person would consider that the particular information constituting the representation or which was not disclosed, as the case may be, should have been correctly disclosed to the insurer so that the insurer could form its own view as to the effect of such information on the assessment of the relevant risk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is, according to the Appellate Division in ''[[President Versekeringsmaatskappy v Trust Bank]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1989 (1) SA 208 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; a matter of perspective. The question is not whether a reasonable person would regard the information as affecting the risk, but whether a reasonable person would have considered that the information should be disclosed so that the insurer could take it into account and come to its own decision concerning the risk.

=== Content of the duty ===
The contract is voidable at the instance of the insurer if the insurer can prove

* that the non-disclosed fact was material;
* that it was within the knowledge of the insured; and
* that it was not communicated to the insurer.

The duty to disclose includes

* answering all questions on the proposal form correctly; and
* disclosing all material facts.

=== Knowledge ===
It has been said that the duty in question "is a duty to disclose, and you cannot disclose what you do not know," and that the "obligation to disclose, therefore, necessarily depends on the knowledge you possess." This implies that the duty imposed is merely to disclose facts already within that party's knowledge; apparently, on this dictum, it does not include an obligation to collect information so as to become able to disclose it.

South African law, however, long appeared to favour the view that only material facts within one's actual or personal knowledge were included in the duty of disclosure. In ''M&amp;F v Oudtshoorn'', however, the court stated in passing that constructive knowledge—that is to say, knowledge which is imputed or presumed—is also included in the duty of disclosure.

Knowledge is constructive, and is imputed to an insured,

* if he ought to have had that knowledge—that is, if he ought to have known of it—in the ordinary course of business;
* if he would have ascertained or acquired that knowledge if he had made such inquiries as a reasonable business person would make; and
* if his employee acquired actual knowledge of facts in the course of his employment, and was under a duty to communicate this knowledge to the insured.

Reinecke considers that "this broad view of the duty of disclosure may arguably extend it unjustifiably and impose an unreasonable burden on the insured."

In ''[[Anderson Shipping v Guardian National Insurance]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1987 (3) SA 506 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; a vehicle owned by [[Anderson Shipping]] was involved in an accident with another vehicle, whose owners claimed damages from Anderson Shipping. The driver of Anderson Shipping's vehicle had previously been found guilty of [[driving under the influence of alcohol]]. [[Guardian National Insurance]] denied liability on the basis that Anderson Shipping had failed to disclose that its procedure for employing drivers did not require applicants to produce their [[drivers’ licenses]] for inspection.

The question to be answered was whether Anderson Shipping had constructive knowledge of the undisclosed fact. It was argued

* that Anderson Shipping could have ascertained the fact if it had made such enquiries as reasonable business prudence required it to make; and
* that the knowledge of Anderson Shipping's operations manager, who had hired Anderson Shipping's drivers, had to be imputed to Anderson Shipping.

The court rejected both arguments and held

* that ordinary business prudence merely required Anderson Shipping to ascertain whether its system of hiring drivers was working satisfactorily, and that it was not incumbent on Anderson Shipping to carry out a detailed investigation as to the manner in which the system operated; and
* that, although Anderson Shipping's operations manager knew that his system of employing drivers did not require the production of a driver's license in every case, he was merely an agent to employ drivers, and was therefore under no duty to communicate this knowledge to Anderson Shipping.

Although, then, the Appellate Division in ''Anderson Shipping v General National Insurance'' refrained from deciding the point, it assumed that an insured (at least, a corporate insured like Anderson Shipping) should be deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to be known by it.

=== Material facts ===
Information that could affect the insurer's decision—whether or not to enter into the contract of insurance, or to charge a higher premium—may include the following:

* that the subject matter is exposed to a higher degree of danger than normal;
* that the liability of the insurer is greater than normal;
* that the insured may cause harm to occur through his own conduct;
* that the value of the insurer's rights of subrogation would be reduced; and
* that the insured is in financial difficulty and may have trouble paying the insurance premiums.

The insurance record of the proposer may also be salient.

=== Non-material facts ===
Non-material facts include

* any circumstance that reduces the risk;
* any circumstance that is known, or presumed to be known, by the insurer;
* any circumstance that is not necessary to disclose as a result of an express or implied warranty; and
* any circumstances regarding which the insurer has waived its right to disclosure.

In ''[[Qilingele v South African Mutual Life]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1993 (1) SA 69 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; an applicant for life insurance did not want to undergo a medical examination. To avoid it, he applied for three separate life-insurance policies with three insurance companies for small amounts which, when added together, would otherwise have required him to undergo a medical examination. Asked in a proposal form whether any other insurance company was considering offering him life cover, he falsely answered, “No.” The applicant also signed a warranty that he had not made any other application to any other insurer.

The court considered whether the falsehood of the misrepresentation was such that it probably would have affected the assessment of the risk undertaken by the particular insurer. This was done by comparing an assessment of the risk on the basis of facts distorted by the misrepresentation with what the assessment would have been on the facts had they been truly stated. The court found that the disparity would be significant if the insurer, had it known the truth,

* probably would have outright declined to undertake the particular risk; or
* probably would have undertaken the risk on different terms.

In ''[[Fine v General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1915 AD 213.&lt;/ref&gt; one question on the proposal form was this: “Has the insurance now proposed been declined in any other office?” The proposer answered, “No”—even though a fire policy over the same property had been issued, and subsequently cancelled, by another insurance company. The statement that the proposed insurance was literally correct, but the insurance company repudiated the claim based on a breach of the duty to disclose material facts. The court held that the cancellation of a previous policy is indeed a material fact that the insured should disclose, since it might well influence the insurer in deciding whether or not it will take the insurance risk, and at what premium.

In ''[[Commercial Union v Lotter]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1999 (2) SA 147 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt; the buyer of a luxury motor vehicle did not disclose to the insurer that the vehicle had been stolen from another country. When the vehicle was stolen again, the insurance company repudiated the claim. The court upheld the company's repudiation on the basis that material facts had not been disclosed. The insurance company argued that its right of subrogation was diminished by the fact that the vehicle in question was a stolen vehicle when the insurance policy was taken out: The insured had no title to the vehicle, so the insurance company could not sue a negligent third party, in terms of its right of subrogation, for the full costs of repairing any damage to the vehicle.

In ''[[Santam v Van Schalkwyk]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2002 (4) SA (1) 93 (O).&lt;/ref&gt; a father in [[Kroonstad]] lent his son in [[Florida]] the deposit for a motor vehicle. The father took out an insurance policy, the car was subsequently stolen, and the insurer repudiated due to father's failure to disclose

* that the vehicle had been bought by the son;
* that the vehicle was used exclusively by the son; and
* that the vehicle was kept in Florida, not in Kroonstad.

The court held that a proposer has a legal duty to disclose to his insurer all facts within his knowledge which a reasonable person would consider material to the assessment of the risk or the premium. On the facts, and in the opinion of a reasonable person, the undisclosed information would have impacted the risk assessment. Expert evidence was led to show that the risk of theft was much greater in Florida than in Kroonstad.

In ''[[Mutual &amp; Federal v Da Costa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2008 (3) SA 439 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt; an insured vehicle was described as a “1991 model [[Mercedes Benz]] 230E,” when in fact it was a built-up vehicle consisting of a combination of a 1998 model Mercedes Benz 200 and a 1990 model Mercedes Benz 230. Da Costa claimed indemnification under his insurance policy, but [[Mutual &amp; Federal]] argued that it was liable under the policy only for a car that matched the description contained in the policy; the mismatch, according to the insurance company, amounted to a material misrepresentation or non-disclosure.

The SCA found that, without any evidence on materiality, a court could assume that a misstatement of the year of manufacture of a motor vehicle is ''per se'' a material misstatement. The SCA did allow for an exception, however: A misstated fact will be taken as a material fact, without any evidence having been led on the point, if the “facts speak for themselves.” The court held that the present dispute was not such a case, and therefore found for Da Costa.

In ''[[AA Mutual Life v Singh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1991 (3) SA 514 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; the policy in question was a ten-year endowment policy, coupled with life cover. AA [[advertised]] the policy as including “free life cover [...] available free of medical evidence [...] no medical questions whatsoever.” AA instructed its brokers to market the policy on this basis, and to sell it to applicants who were actively engaged in their usual occupations and fit enough to lead normal lives. AA's broker told Singh, the insured ''in casu'', that she did not have to disclose anything about her health, and that the proposal form which she signed did not require her to provide medical details. AA subsequently sought to avoid liability on the ground that the insured had failed to disclose that she was suffering from [[cervical cancer]]. The court held that AA had [[waived]] any right which it had to have the insured's state of health disclosed.

== Warranties ==
Insurance warranties are strict contractual undertakings by the insured

* that, in the case of affirmative warranties, certain representations are accurate; or Chicken feet
* that, in the case of promissory warranties, certain duties will be performed.

No particular formal or technical wording is required to establish a warranty. There are, however, a few general requirements. In order to establish that a term in an insurance contract is an insurance warranty, it must be proved

* that the term was intended to form part of the contract (in other words, that it was not a “mere representation”); and
* that the term is in the nature of a strict undertaking, with the debtor agreeing to be bound, come what may.

Both these requirements for an insurance warranty may be reconciled with the requirements laid down by the law of contract for other, non-insurance warranties.

According to English insurance law, a term will qualify as an insurance warranty only if it is a "vital term," entailing a right to cancel. English law in this respect is at variance with the South African law of contract, according to which non-vital terms may also qualify as warranties. Nevertheless, it is the English view that has been received in the South African case law on insurance.

A term may be "vital," first and foremost, because of the importance of its subject matter. If the subject matter of a term in an insurance contract is material to the assessment of the risk, it will be regarded as a vital term, and may, therefore, qualify as a warranty. Breach of a vital term will amount to a serious form of positive malperformance, justifying cancellation of the contract.

=== Affirmative Warranties ===
In the case of affirmative warranties, the insured warrants the truth of a representation relating to the present or the past. Affirmative warranties may be sub-divided into

* warranties of fact;
* warranties of knowledge; and
* warranties of opinion.

Warranties of fact have the effect of warranting that a state of affairs either does or does not exist, irrespective of insured's knowledge thereof.

A warranty of knowledge is a guarantee that, to the insured's knowledge, a state of affairs does or does not exist. Forgetfulness would not necessary excuse the insured; he must apply his mind.

Warranties of opinion should be distinguished from warranties of fact and knowledge. In the case of warranties of opinion, the insured provides estimates or other information typical of an opinion. Where a proposer for insurance in respect of a stack of hay stated that the stack was estimated to yield a certain quantity of wheat and chaff, and warranted his answers, the court held that he did not warrant that the stack would in fact yield the quantities stated, and that the insured did not commit a breach of warranty if his estimate was fair and reasonable. The insured, in other words, did not warrant the existence of certain facts, or his knowledge concerning such facts; he gave a warranty only in respect of his opinion.

It is not always easy to determine whether a warranty relates to a state of affairs (and thus to a fact), or to the insured's opinion about certain matters. Ultimately, it depends on how the question is construed. A tendency identified on the part of English courts has been to treat questions apparently eliciting the insured's opinion as demanding statements of fact; the same appears true of local decisions.

=== Promissory warranties ===
Promissory warranties are also known (more correctly, since all warranties are promissory, involving as they do a promise or obligation to perform) as “continuing warranties.” They are undertakings by the insured pertaining to his future conduct during the period of the insurance policy. In ''[[Cole v Bloom]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1961 (3) SA 422 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; the insurer avoided liability in respect of a policy containing a promissory warranty that all doors, windows and roofs of a salesman's vehicle (used to convey samples) would be closed and locked when the vehicle was left unattended.the courts apply the strict approach when it comes to promissory warranties as they are not governed by the statute of Insurance Act.

=== Breach of warranties ===
Breach of a warranty amounts to breach of contract. The burden of proof lies with the insurer. Breach of warranty is irreversible; it cannot be undone by subsequent conduct. It is important to distinguish between relative and absolute warranties. This amounts to an issue of interpretation.

=== Relative warranties ===
Relative warranties are general in their content; they are not specific statements of what is required of the insured. The “reasonable person” is used as a yardstick to measure the insured's conduct in relation to an alleged breach of warranty. An example of a general warranty is the "iron-safe clause," which is frequently included in fire-insurance policies. In terms of an iron-safe clause, the insured warrants that he will keep a complete set of books, showing a true and accurate record of all business transactions and stock-in-hand, and that the books will be locked in a fire-proof safe or removed to another building at night and at all times when the premises are not open for business. In ''[[Kliptown Clothing v Marine &amp; Trade Insurance]]''&lt;ref&gt;1961 (1) SA 103 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; the plaintiff, a retail general dealer, obtained a burglary policy from the defendant. Subsequently, the plaintiff suffered burglaries. In an action claiming a declaration that the defendant was obliged to make good the loss, Marine &amp; Trade Insurance pleaded breach by the plaintiff of a warranty

&lt;blockquote&gt;that the insured keeps, and during the whole of the currency of the policy shall keep, a complete set of books, accounts and stock sheets or stock books, showing a true and accurate record of all business transactions and stock in hand, and that such books, accounts and stock sheets or stock books shall be locked in a fire-proof safe or removed to another building at night and at all times when the premises are not actually open for business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marine &amp; Trade Insurance alleged

* that there was no (or alternatively no complete or accurate) record of the articles or goods sold by the plaintiff, or of the cost thereof;
* that the plaintiff had failed to keep stock sheets or stock books showing a true and accurate record of stock in hand; and
* that the plaintiff had failed to keep a true or accurate record of all business transactions.

The Appellate Division held that the warranty meant

* that the insured had guaranteed that his practice was, and would continue to be, to keep a complete set of books, annual accounts and annual stock sheets or stock books;
* that he was not obliged, because of the insurance, to bring into existence such books, etc., at any earlier date or in any different form, whether in respect of contemporaneity or in respect of the details recorded, than was required by proper accountancy practice; and
* that he was not obliged to keep, in a safe or at all, any records other than those expressly mentioned in the warranty.

As the defendant had failed to prove either a general breach of the warranty arising out of what the plaintiff had failed to keep in a safe, or a particular breach based on the recording in the books of the purchase of certain articles, the court found for the plaintiff.

=== Absolute warranties ===
Absolute warranties provide a specific or express indication of what is required of the insured, who must comply exactly; if he does not, breach of the warranty will occur. “Substantial performance” is not enough; there must be exact performance. In ''[[Jordan v New Zealand Insurance]]'', for example, the plaintiff had stated, in  the proposal form for the insurance of a motor car, his age at his next birthday as twenty-two, when in fact it would be twenty-three. The court held that there was no room for the contention that the incorrectness of the answer was not material; nor was there any room for the application of the doctrine of "substantial performance" in considering the truthfulness or otherwise of the answers.

=== Insured’s defences against breach of warranty ===
The insured may have the following defences against a claim that he has breached a warranty:

* The insurer may have waived compliance with the warranty.
* The insurer may be estopped from relying on breach of warranty.
* There may have been a change in circumstances that has the effect that the warranty is no longer relevant or applicable.
* The warranty may not be lawful.

=== Remedies for breach of warranty ===
In principle, the same remedies exist for breach of warranty as exist for breach of any contract. One must, however, distinguish the effects of breach of warranty from those of breach of contract through misrepresentation:

* Cancellation of the contract on the basis of a breach of warranty does not render the entire contract a nullity. Depending on divisibility, cancellation merely extinguishes a vested claim of the insured, or even the insurer's basic obligation to indemnify the insured. Accordingly, the insurer may still rely on terms unaffected by the cancellation: an arbitration clause, for example.
* In the case of a reliance on misrepresentation, on the other hand, the insurer avoids entire contract, and accordingly cannot rely on any of its terms.

=== Problems ===
The strict common-law approach, which requires exact performance of an undertaking that has not necessarily been established as a “material” aspect of the contract (and risk assessment), and entitles the insurer to cancel a contract on the basis of a breach of warranty despite the fact that the representation complained of concerns an immaterial inaccuracy, or a matter with no bearing at all on the risk insured against, has led to absurd results in some cases. ''Jordan v New Zealand'', discussed above, is one such example: Jordan stated that his age at his next birthday would be twenty-two, whereas in fact it would be twenty-three. Since this statement was warranted, the insurer was entitled to repudiate liability, in spite of what most would regard as the immateriality of the inaccuracy, and where, in fact, it "was actually to the advantage of the insurer."&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke ''General Principles'' para 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statutory Curtailment ===
As a result of such absurd results, and the potential for more, statutory reform introduced certain curtailments regarding remedies for breach of warranties. Section 63 of the Insurance Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 27 of 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; (the governing legislation at the time) was amended in 1969. The effect of the amendment was that the insurer was not permitted to set aside a contract on the grounds of breach of an affirmative warranty unless the insurer could prove that the correctness of the statement (or representation or warranty) was material to the assessment of the risk at the time the policy was issued or renewed. The purpose of the amendment was to protect the insured against repudiations by insurers based on inconsequential inaccuracies or trivial misstatements in insurance proposal forms, even if they were warranted to be true.

In 1989, the Insurance Act of 1943 was repealed. Its section 63(3) was re-enacted, without any amendment as to substance, in section 59(1)(a) of the Long-term Insurance Act and section 53(1)(a) of the Short-term Insurance Act, which provided

* that the policy shall not be invalidated;
* that the obligation of the long-term insurer shall not be excluded or limited; and
* that the obligations of the policyholder shall not be increased,

on account of any representation or failure to disclose information made to the insurer which is not true, whether or not the representation or disclosure has been warranted to be true and correct, unless that representation or non-disclosure is such as to be likely to have materially affected the assessment of the risk under the policy concerned at the time of its issue or at the time of any renewal or variation thereof.

==== Intention of the legislature ====
The Act tries to prevent insurers from exploiting warranties made by the insured in order to avoid paying out on claims. The Act is intended to ensure that an insurer will have no remedy on account of an immaterial incorrect representation, whether that representation was warranted or not.

==== Effect of the statutory reform ====
The insurer is now still liable to pay out on a claim if the breach of warranty relates only to inconsequential inaccuracies. The insurer is not liable, however, if the breach of warranty relates to facts that are material to the risk. The test for misrepresentation will apply:

* For misrepresentation by omission, the assessment of the risk is based on the objective standard of the "reasonable person."
* For misrepresentation by commission, or positive misrepresentation, the assessment of the risk is based on the subjective standard of the particular insurer.

==== Scope of the amendments ====
Instead of “warranties,” the Acts use the expressions “representations,” “non-disclosure” and “failure to disclose.” The meaning of these words is important:

* A “representation” is a statement, made to the insurer, before the contract is entered into. It is not a term of the contract; it does not become part of the contract.
* “Non-disclosure” or “failure to disclose” is also a pre-contractual omission to provide information.

If, then, the warranty is not based on a “representation,” or “failure to disclose” or “non-disclosure,” the insurer will still be able to avoid liability under the contract.

As a general rule, the words “representation,” “failure to disclose” and “non-disclosure” refer to existing facts as well as to future events.

The controversy of granting damages for misrepresentation of a future event has generally been removed by statutory reform. The question of materiality is of assistance here.&lt;ref&gt;See Reinecke para 369 for clarification.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subrogation ==
Subrogation is the right of the insurer, having indemnified the insured in terms of the policy, to receive the benefit of all the rights of the insured against third parties. The insurer may take charge of litigation against third parties liable for loss to the insured. The proceedings are in the name of the insured, with the insurer as ''dominus litis''. Subrogation, then, is essentially a right of recourse without transfer of rights.

The objectives of subrogation are as follows:

* to prevent the insured from receiving double satisfaction (that is, from recovering both from the insurance company and from a third party in respect of the same loss); and
* to enable the insurance company to recoup what was paid out to the insured. By affording the insurer a right of redress, the cost of insurance to the public is kept down, since the insurer may recoup its loss from a source other than premium income. This, indeed, is the main purpose of subrogation.
*to make sure the 3rd negligent party does not go scott-free.

=== Requirements ===
The following are the requirements of subrogation:

* A valid insurance contract must be in existence.
* The insurer must have indemnified the insured.
* The loss of the insured must have been fully compensated by the insurer.
* The right must be capable of being subrogated.

=== Rights of the insurer ===
The insurer has a '''right of recourse''' against a third party for loss where the insurer has paid the insured the cover for such loss. The insurer may institute a claim against the third party on behalf of the insured as ''dominus litis''.

The insurer also has a '''right to information and assistance''' from the insured, together with a '''right to preservation of the claim''', which usually takes the form of a clause in insurance contracts which requires the insured to take the necessary steps to protect the insurer's right to subrogation (even if the requirements for subrogation have not yet been met in full).

In ''[[Commercial Union v Lotter]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1999 (2) SA 147 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt; the court held that the fact that the insured vehicle was a stolen vehicle compromised the appellant's right of subrogation. Having satisfied the claim of the insured, the insurer was entitled to be placed in the insured's position in respect of all rights and remedies against other parties which were vested in the insured in relation to the subject-matter of the insurance. In a case such as the present, however, where the insured vehicle was a stolen one, an action instituted by Commercial Union (against a negligent third party who had damaged the vehicle) could be successfully resisted on the basis that Lotter (and thus Commercial Union under its right of subrogation) had no title in the vehicle.

=== Difference between subrogation and cession ===
Subrogation allows the insured to retain his personal right. This is not the case with cession, which involves a transfer of the right in terms of an actual agreement.

The effect of this difference or distinction is that, if the insured waives his right to claim against a third-party wrongdoer, the insurer would not be able to claim against the wrongdoer, as the latter is absolved of duty to pay. With cession, in contrast, the insurer acquires all of the rights of the insured to proceed against the third party, and has to sue in its own name.

== Reinstatement ==
If a reinstatement clause exists, and if loss occurs, the insurer has the option either

* of indemnifying the insured in money; or
* of replacing or repairing the damaged property. This is what is known as "reinstatement."

This election lies entirely with the insurer; the insured has no say in the matter. If the insurer elects reinstatement, it has the further option either

* of replacement of the object with a similar object; or
* of restoration of the object to its condition before accident or risk occurred. If the insurer elects to restore an object, it would appear also to have the right to choose who will undertake the restoration or repairs.

When the insurer decides to reinstate, it must notify the insured, after which the election is binding; the insurer may not thereafter change its mind. Notice is to be given within the time allowed by the contract, or within a reasonable time:

* If notice is not given in terms of the contract, or within a reasonable time, the insurer must indemnify the insured with money.
* If notice is given, but the insurer is in ''[[wikt:mora|mora]]'' (i.e. has delayed), the insurer is in breach of its duty to reinstate, and therefore in breach of contract (as debtor). The usual contractual remedies apply.

The insured has a duty to cooperate with the insurer in order to effect the reinstatement. Failure to cooperate would amount to breach of contract (as creditor).

Reinstatement may therefore be described as "direct compensation", because the purpose of reinstatement is to put the insured in the same or similar position as before the loss occurred.

== Reinsurance ==
One insurance company may purchase insurance from another insurance company for the purposes of risk management. [[Reinsurance]] has the effect of transferring the risk—that is to say, the "insured risk"—from the insurer to the reinsurer. This allows the insurer to increase its policy limits, taking on a higher risk, since the risk is partly carried by the reinsurer.

The two main categories of reinsurance arrangements are

# facultative reinsurance; and
# treaty reinsurance.

Within these two categories, furthermore, there are two main kinds of coverage:

# proportional reinsurance; and
# non-proportional reinsurance.

Both facultative and treaty reinsurance can be written on a proportional or non-proportional basis. Both these bases occur in a variety of often highly involved permutations.

=== Facultative reinsurance ===
Facultative reinsurance is the reinsurance of a particular risk under a single policy (for a single or specific risk). It is facultative in the sense that the reinsurer has the choice to accept or reject the particular risk in question. This type of reinsurance arrangement is "cumbersome," writes Reinecke,&lt;ref&gt;''General Principles'' para 526.&lt;/ref&gt; because a separate negotiation is required for each separate risk which an insurer wishes to pass on to a reinsurer.

=== Treaty reinsurance ===
Treaty reinsurance is an arrangement between the insurer and the reinsurer in terms of which the latter agrees to take over all or part of the former's risk of a particular class or description for a specified period of time.

=== Proportional reinsurance ===
Proportional reinsurance, which may arise in both facultative and treaty reinsurance, refers to a ''pro rata'' sharing of risks and losses, and premiums and income, between the primary insurer and the reinsurer.

=== Non-proportional reinsurance ===
In the case of non-proportional reinsurance (or "excess" reinsurance), the reinsurer bears that part of insurer's loss which exceeds an agreed threshold, while the insurer retains the risk or loss below the threshold, or else reinsures this with a different reinsurer.

=== Terms and benefit details ===
In respect of the terms and benefit details contained in the reinsurance agreement, the same principles apply as for ordinary insurance contracts.

=== Retrocession ===
Reinsurance companies may also themselves purchase reinsurance. This is known as "retrocession." The "retrocessionair" grants reinsurance to the "retrocedent."

== Under-insurance ==
Under-insurance occurs where the sum insured is less than the amount of the loss that the insured would suffer if the risk should materialise. For example, a house is insured for R100,000, but its market value is R150,000. A person in such circumstances may only recover loss

* that is actually suffered; and
* up to the sum that is insured.

== Over-insurance ==
Over-insurance occurs when the sum insured is greater than the loss that the insured would suffer if the risk materialises. For example, a house is insured for R200,000, but its market value is R150,000. Even here, the insured may not recover more than the loss he actually suffers.

== Double Insurance ==
It is possible to insure the same interest against the same risk with two or more insurers. Double insurance does not amount to over-insurance, unless the total of all the insurances is more than the total value of the interest.

If loss occurs, the insured may choose to recover his entire loss from one insurer, or a proportionate share from each insurer, as long as the total amount claimed is not greater than the loss actually suffered.

=== Contribution ===
Most policies have a “contribution clause,” which means that, if an insurer pays more than its proportionate share to the insured, the insurer has a right to reclaim a contribution from the other insurers. This is because the insurer has the right to pay only its proportionate share of the loss.

Insurance contracts often contain clauses to the effect that the insured must disclose other existing or subsequent policies. In the absence of such a clause, the insured is under no obligation to disclose policies that he may have with other insurance companies.

==== Requirements ====
The following are the requirements for the insurer's right to contribution:

* The insurer claiming contribution must have discharged its liability to the insured.
* The insurer claiming contribution must have paid more than its proportionate share of the loss. This applies both to total and to partial loss.
* Payment by the insurer claiming contribution must have been in respect of an interest which was the object of double-insurance at the time of the loss.

==== Determining proportionate loss ====
Where the insurance contracts in a situation of double insurance are virtually identical in all material respects (including the amount insured), loss is to be apportioned equally between the insurers.

Where the contracts differ only as to the amounts insured, all the amounts must be added up and compared with the amount of the loss. Each insurer is then liable for such a proportion of the loss as the amount underwritten by it bears to the aggregate amount insured by all the contracts.

Where the contracts differ substantially, there may be complications. One contract may, for example, insure the common object amongst other objects, without apportioning to it a specific amount. Average clauses may also be present.&lt;ref&gt;Average clauses seek to avoid the disadvantage to insurers of the insured's claiming up to the limit of the sum insured, irrespective of whether his loss is total or partial, by encouraging prospective insured persons to insure up to the full value of their interest in the object of the risk.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law is silent on the rules governing the apportionment of loss. In practice, negotiation between the parties is necessary.

== Prescription of Claims ==
In general, civil claims prescribe after three years from when the debt arose.

Most policies contain time-bar clauses, requiring the insured to claim within a fixed period of time after the loss insured against has occurred. If an insurer repudiates liability for a claim, the insured has a specific time period within which to issue summons against the insurer, failing which the insurer will be released from liability: that is to say, the claim against the insurer will prescribe.

The purpose of time-bar clauses is to provide legal certainty for the insurer. An insurer has an interest in knowing, within a reasonable time after repudiating a claim, whether it will face litigation or not.

In ''[[Barkhuizen v Napier]]'', a short-term insurance policy contained a time-bar clause to the effect that the insurer would not be liable under a claim unless summons was served within ninety days of repudiation of the claim. Summons was served two years after the claim was rejected by the insurer. The [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] upheld the time-bar clause, but opened the door for these clauses to be scrutinised in future on the basis that they could unfairly discriminate against the insured's right of access to the courts.&lt;ref&gt;s 34 of the Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;

“Fairness, justice and reasonableness” is the yardstick by which to determine whether or not a contractual term (including a time-bar clause) should be upheld if such term infringes a constitutional right. In ''[[Bredenkamp v Standard Bank]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2010 (4) SA 468 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Supreme Court of Appeal was confronted with a clause in a contract between banker and client entitling the banker unilaterally to cancel the contract for no cause at all, and without hearing the client. The banker subsequently cancelled the contract on the ground that the client posed a risk to the bank's reputation. The court found, relying on ''Barkhuizen'', that the question of the fairness of exercising contractual rights does not arise when it involves no public-policy considerations or constitutional values. The cancellation was therefore not unfair, and the clause was enforceable.

Furthermore, the court in ''Barkhuizen'' held that consideration must be given to those special circumstances when a time-bar clause cannot be complied with by the insured.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40650">{{distinguish|text=the doctrine of [[state immunity]] whereby a state or sovereign may not be amenable before foreign courts}}

'''Sovereign immunity''', or '''crown immunity''', is a [[legal doctrine]] by which the [[monarch|sovereign]] or [[State (polity)|state]] cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from [[lawsuit|civil suit]] or [[criminal law|criminal prosecution]], strictly speaking in modern texts in its own courts. A similar, stronger rule as regards foreign courts is named [[state immunity]].  

In its older sense, sovereign immunity is the original forebear of state immunity based on the classical concept of sovereignty in the sense that a sovereign could not be subjected without his or her approval to the [[jurisdiction]] of another. 

There are two forms of sovereign immunity:

* immunity from suit (also known as immunity from jurisdiction or [[adjudication]])
* immunity from enforcement.

Immunity from suit means neither the sovereign/head of state in person nor any ''[[in absentia]]'' or representative form of him (nor to a lesser extent the state) can be a defendant or subject of court proceedings, nor in most equivalent forums such as under arbitration awards and tribunal awards/damages. Immunity from enforcement means that even if a person succeeds in any way against their sovereign or state, they and the judgment may find itself without means of enforcement. [[Separation of powers]] or [[natural justice]] coupled with a political status other than a [[totalitarian]] state dictates there be broad exceptions to immunity such as statutes which expressly bind the state (a prime example being [[constitutional law]]s) and [[judicial review]].

Furthermore, sovereign immunity of a state entity may be waived. A state entity may waive its immunity by:

* prior written agreement 
* instituting proceedings without claiming immunity
* submitting to jurisdiction as a defendant in a suit
* intervening in or taking any steps in any suit (other than for the purpose of claiming immunity).

In [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] the sovereign is the historical origin of the authority which creates the courts. Thus the courts had no power to compel the sovereign to be bound by them as they were created by the sovereign for the protection of his or her subjects.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} This rule was commonly expressed by the popular [[legal maxim]] ''rex non potest peccare'', meaning "the king can do no wrong".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ag4yAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=herbert+broom+legal+maxims&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pE3xVIeOEKzgsASJ9oGADw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Herbert Broom, ''A Collection of Legal Maxims, Classified and Illustrated'', 23 (London, A. Maxwell and Son 1845).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Australia===
There is no automatic Crown immunity in Australia and the Australian Constitution does not establish a state of unfettered immunity of the Crown in respect of the States and the Commonwealth. The [[Constitution of Australia]] establishes items which the States and the Commonwealth legislate on independently of each other, in practice resulting in the States legislating on some things and the Commonwealth legislating on others. In some circumstances this can create ambiguity as to the applicability of legislation where there is no clearly established Crown immunity. The Australian Constitution does however, in [[Section 109 of the Constitution of Australia|s. 109]], declare that, "When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid." Based on this, depending on the context of application and whether a particular statute infringes on the executive powers of the State or the Commonwealth the Crown may or may not be immune from any particular statute.

Many Acts passed in Australia, both at the State or the Federal level, contain a section declaring whether the Act binds the Crown, and, if so, in what respect:

* Commonwealth Acts may contain wording similar to: "This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities", or specify a more restricted application.
* State Acts may contain wording similar to: "This Act binds the Crown in right of [the State] and, in so far as the legislative power of the Parliament of [the State] permits, the Crown in all its other capacities."

Whilst there is no ambiguity surrounding the first aspect of this declaration with respect to binding the Crown with respect to the State in question, there have been several cases in respect of the interpretation of the second aspect extending it to the Crown in its other capacities. Rulings by the [[High Court of Australia]] on specific matters of conflict between the application of States laws on Commonwealth agencies have provided the interpretation that the Crown in all of its other capacities includes the Commonwealth, therefore if a State Act contains this text then the act may bind the Commonwealth subject to the s. 109 test of inconsistency.

A landmark case which set a precedent for challenging broad Crown immunity and established tests for the applicability of State laws on the Commonwealth was ''[[Henderson v Defence Housing Authority]]'' in 1997.&lt;ref name="ags.gov.au"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Henderson v Defence Housing Authority|link=Henderson v Defence Housing Authority|court=HCA|num=36|year=1997|parallelcite=190 CLR 410}}, discussed in {{cite web |url= http://www.ags.gov.au/publications/legal-briefing/br36.htm|title= The Commonwealth's Implied Constitutional Immunity From State Law - Legal Briefing Number 36|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 30 August 1997|website= |publisher= [[Australian Government Solicitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case involved the arbitration of a dispute between Mr. Henderson and the Defence Housing Authority (DHA). Mr. Henderson owned a house which the DHA had leased to provide housing to members of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF). Under the NSW ''Residential Tenancies Act 1997'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|repealed_act|rta1987207|Residential Tenancies Act 1987}}, since replaced by the {{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|rta2010207|Residential Tenancies Act 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Henderson sought orders from the [[Residential Tribunal of New South Wales|Residential Tenancies Tribunal]] to enter the premises for the purposes of conducting inspections. In response, DHA claimed that as a Commonwealth agency the legislation of NSW did not apply to it&lt;ref name="ags.gov.au"/&gt; and further sought writs of prohibition attempting to restrain Mr. Henderson from pursuing the matter further. Up until this point the Commonwealth and its agencies claimed an unfettered immunity from State legislation and had used s. 109 to justify this position, specifically that the NSW Act was in conflict with the Act which created the DHA and s. 109 of the Constitution applied. Mr. Henderson took the case to the High Court and a panel of 7 justices to arbitrate the matter. By a majority decision of 6:1 the court ruled that the DHA was bound by the NSW Act on the basis that the NSW Act did not limit, deny or restrict the activities of the DHA but sought to regulate them, an important distinction which was further explained in the rulings of several of the justices. It was ruled that the NSW Act was one of general application and therefore the Crown (in respect of the Commonwealth) could not be immune from it, citing other cases in which the same ruling had been made and that it was contrary to the rule of law. As a result of this case, the Commonwealth cannot claim a broad constitutional immunity from State legislation.

In practice, three tests have been developed to determine whether a State law applies to the Commonwealth (and vice versa):

#does the law seek to merely regulate the activities of the Commonwealth as opposed to deny, restrict or limit them,
#is the State law constructed such that the Act binds the Crown in respect of all of its capacities, and
#is there no inconsistency between a State law and a Commonwealth law on the same matter.

If these three tests are satisfied then the Act binds the Crown in respect of the Commonwealth. It is important to note that in Australia there is no clear automatic Crown immunity or lack of it, as such there is a rebuttable presumption that the Crown is not bound by a statute, as noted in ''[[Bropho v State of Western Australia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Bropho v State of Western Australia|link=Bropho v State of Western Australia|court=HCA|num=24|year=1990|parallelcite=(1990) 171 CLR 1|date=20 June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown's immunity may also apply to other parties in certain circumstances, as held in ''[[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited|link=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare|court=HCA|num=38|year=2007|parallelcite=|date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
Article 88 of the [[Constitution of Belgium]] states: "The King’s person is [[Monarchy of Belgium#Inviolability|inviolable]]; his ministers are accountable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/pdf_sections/publications/constitution/grondwetEN.pdf|title=The Belgian Constitution|author=Legal Department of the House of Representatives, with the collaboration of Mr A. MacLean|date=January 2009|accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhutan===
According to the constitution of Bhutan, the monarch is not answerable in a court of law for
his or her actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution Bhutan|url=http://www.bhutanaudit.gov.bt/About%20Us/Mandates/Constitution%20of%20Bhutan%202008.pdf|accessdate=18 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905083724/http://www.bhutanaudit.gov.bt/About%20Us/Mandates/Constitution%20of%20Bhutan%202008.pdf|archivedate=5 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canada inherited common law version of Crown immunity from British law.  However, over time the scope of Crown immunity has been steadily reduced by statute law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ag.gov.bc.ca/ajo/down/statutory_immunity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1994, section 14 of the ''Alberta [[Interpretation Act]]'' stated, "No enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her Majesty or Her Majesty's rights or prerogatives in any manner, unless the enactment expressly states that it binds Her Majesty."&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Law Reform Institute. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130722211401/http://www.law.ualberta.ca/alri/docs/fr071.pdf The Presumption of Crown Immunity]". Report No. 71, July 1994. {{ISBN|0-8886-4193-1}}. Archived from [http://www.law.ualberta.ca/alri/docs/fr071.pdf the original] on 22 July 2013. Accessed 1 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in more recent times "All Canadian provinces ... and the federal government (the [[Crown Liability Act]]) have now rectified this anomaly by passing legislation which leaves the "Crown" liable in tort as a normal person would be. Thus, the tort liability of the government is a relatively new development in Canada, statute-based, and is not a fruit of common law."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duhaime.org/LegalResources/TortPersonalInjury/LawArticle-77/Government-Liability.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1918, it has been held that provincial legislatures cannot bind the federal Crown, as [[Charles Fitzpatrick|Fitzpatrick CJ]] noted in ''Gauthier v The King'':

{{quote|
Provincial legislation cannot ''proprio vigore'' [i.e., of its own force] take away or abridge any privilege of the Crown in right of the Dominion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Gauthier v The King|link=|year=1918|court=scc|num=85|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 194|parallelcite=[1918] 56 SCR 176|date=1918-03-05|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has also been a constitutional convention that the [[Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Crown in right of each province]] is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts in other provinces. However this is now in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Walker|first= Janet|date= |title= Interprovincial Sovereign Immunity Revisited|url= http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1608&amp;context=ohlj|journal= [[Osgoode Hall Law Journal]]|volume= 35|issue= 2|pages= 379{{en dash}}397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]] do not enjoy the same immunity as the Sovereign in matters not relating to the powers of the office. In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] refused to hear the request of former Lieutenant Governor of Quebec [[Lise Thibault]] to have charges against her dropped. She was being prosecuted by the [[Ministry of Justice (Quebec)|Attorney General of Quebec]] for misappropriation of public funds but invoked royal immunity on the basis that "the Queen can do no wrong". As per convention, the court did not disclosed its reasons for not considering the matter. Thibault later petitioned the [[Court of Quebec]] for the same motives. Judge St-Cyr again rejected her demand, noting that constitutional law does not grant a lieutenant-governor the same benefits as the Queen and that in her case, royal immunity would only apply to actions involving official state functions, not personal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/lise-thibault-ex-quebec-lieutenant-governor-testifies-at-her-fraud-trial-1.2720523 |title= Lise Thibault, ex-Quebec lieutenant-governor, testifies at her fraud trial|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2014 |website=CBC News |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was eventually declared guilty and sentenced to 18 months in jail but was granted conditional release after serving six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/lise-thibault-conditional-release-1.3723189 |title=Lise Thibault granted conditional release after serving 6 months|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=August 16, 2016 |website=CBC news |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
China has consistently claimed that a basic principle of international law is for states and their property to have absolute sovereign immunity. China objects to restrictive sovereign immunity. It is held that a state can waive its immunity by voluntarily stating so, but that should a government intervene in a suit (e.g. to make protests), it should not be viewed as waiver of immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://article.chinalawinfo.com/ArticleFullText.aspx?ArticleId=94477|title=主权豁免的中国立场|last=何|first=志鹏|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese state-owned companies considered instrumental to the state have claimed sovereign immunity in lawsuits brought against them in foreign courts before. China's view is that sovereign immunity is a lawful right and interest that their enterprises are entitled to protect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1362394.shtml|title=Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang’s Regular Press Conference on May 11, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Chinese state-owned companies that have claimed sovereign immunity in foreign lawsuits are the [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China|Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC)]] and [[China National Building Material]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-12/chinese-state-owned-firms-claim-sovereign-immunity-in-us-court/7408514|title=Chinese state-owned firms clain 'sovereign immunity' in US courts with foreign ministry's backing|last=|first=|date=12 May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
Article 13 of the [[Constitution of Denmark]] states: "The King shall not be answerable for his actions; his person shall be sacrosanct. The Ministers shall be responsible for the conduct of the government; their responsibility shall be determined by Statute."&lt;ref name=DK-constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.dk/Dokumenter/Publikationer/Engelsk/~/media/PDF/publikationer/English/The_constitutional_act_of_denmark_2013.pdf.ashx|title=Unofficial translation of the Constitutional Act of Denmark|author=Folketinget|date=2009-08-06|authorlink=Folketinget}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the [[Monarchy of Denmark|monarch]] cannot be sued in his or her personal capacity. On the other hand, this immunity from lawsuits does not extend to the state as such and article 63 explicitly authorises the courts to judge the executive authority: "The courts of justice shall be empowered to decide any question relating to the scope of the executive's authority; though any person wishing to question such authority shall not, by taking the case to the courts of justice, avoid temporary compliance with orders given by the executive authority."&lt;ref name=DK-constitution /&gt;

===Holy See===
{{main|Pope#International position}}
The [[Holy See]], of which the current [[pope]] is head (often referred to incorrectly as the [[Vatican City State|Vatican or Vatican City State]], a distinct entity) claims sovereign immunity for the pope, supported by many international agreements.

=== Hong Kong ===
In 2011, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled that absolute sovereign immunity applies in Hong Kong, as the Court found that Hong Kong, as a [[Special Administrative Region]] of China, could not have policies on state immunity that was inconsistent with China. The ruling was an outcome of the ''Democratic Republic of the Congo v FG Hemisphere Associates'' case in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legalbusinessonline.com/news-analysis/case-analysis-democratic-republic-congo-and-ors-v-fg-hemisphere-associates-llc/64049|title=Case analysis: Democratic Republic of Congo and Ors v FG Hemisphere Associates LLC|last=Crossley|first=Kathryn|date=17 June 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Democratic Republic of the Congo v FG Hemisphere Associates'' (2011) ====
The Democratic Republic of the Congo and its state-owned electricity company [[Société nationale d'électricité]] (SNEL) defaulted on payments of a debt owed to an energy company, Energoinvest. During arbitration, Energoinvest was awarded damages against the Congo government and SNEL. This was reassigned by Energoinvest to FG Hemisphere Associates LLC.

FG Hemisphere subsequently learned that the Congo government entered into a separate joint venture with Chinese companies later, in which the Congo government would be paid US$221 million in mining entry fees. As a result, FG Hemisphere applied to collect these fees in order to enforce the earlier arbital award. The Congo government asserted sovereign immunity in the legal proceedings. This was eventually brought to the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, when the Congo government fought to overturn an earlier Court of Appeal decision which had ruled that:
* as restrictive sovereign immunity applied in Hong Kong, the Congo government had no immunity in commercial proceedings. 
* if absolute sovereign immunity had applied in Hong Kong, the Congo government had waived their sovereign immunity rights in this case.

===== Judgment by Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal =====
The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled 3:2 that the Congo government had not waived its immunity in the Hong Kong courts, and that as a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong could not have policies on state immunity that was inconsistent with China's. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied in Hong Kong should be absolute, and may be invoked when jurisdiction is sought in the foreign court in relation to an application to enforce a foreign judgment or arbitral award, or when execution is sought against assets in the foreign state. This means that sovereign states are absolutely immune to the jurisdiction in Hong Kong courts, including in commercial claims, unless the state waives its immunity. In order to waive immunity, there must be express, unequivocal submission to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts "in the face of the court". Claimants should establish that the state party has waived their entitlement to immunity at the relevant stage, before proceedings can occur in court.

===Iceland===
According to article 11 of the [[Constitution of Iceland]] the president can only be held accountable and be prosecuted with the consent of parliament.

===India===
According to Article 361 [[Constitution of India]] no legal action in the court of law can be taken against [[President of India]] and  [[Governors of states of India]] as long as that person is holding either office. However, he/she can be impeached and then sued for his/her actions.

===Ireland===
In ''Byrne v Ireland'', the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Irish Supreme Court]] declared that sovereign immunity had not survived the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, and that accordingly the state could be sued for and held vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of its servants and agents.&lt;ref&gt;[1972] 1 IR 241&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
According to the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]], the [[President of Italy|President]] of the [[Italian Republic]] is not accountable, and he is not responsible for any act of his office, unless he has committed [[high treason]] or attempted to subvert the Constitution, as stated in Article 90:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The President of the Republic is not responsible for the actions performed in the exercise of presidential duties, except in the case of high treason or violation of the Constitution. In such cases, the President may be impeached by Parliament in joint session, with an absolute majority of its members.}}

The Italian [[Penal Code]] makes it a [[criminal offence]] to insult the [[honor]] and [[Reputation|prestige]] of the President (Art. 278), and until 2006 it was an offence to publicly give the President responsibility for actions of the [[Cabinet of Italy|Government]] (Art. 279 – [[Repeal|abrogated]]).

The Italian Constitutional Court has declared the partial incompatibility with the Italian Constitution of a law that forced courts to delay all trials against the Italian Prime Minister while he is in office.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The revised version says that the trial hearings have to be scheduled in agreement between the Judge and the Government.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], an [[1993 amendments to the Constitution of Malaysia|amendment to the constitution]] in 1993 made it possible to bring proceedings against the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|king]] or any ruler of a component state in the Special Court. Prior to 1993, rulers, in their personal capacity, were immune from any proceedings brought against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawyerment.com.my/library/doc/laws/const/1000000-3.shtml Lawyerment - Document Library - Laws of Malaysia - Constitution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
Section 308 of the Nigerian constitution of 1999 provides immunity from court proceedings, i.e., proceedings that will compel their attendance in favour of elected executive officers, namely the President and his vice and the Governors of the states and the deputies. This immunity extends to acts done in their official capacities so that they are not responsible for acts done on behalf of the state. However, this immunity does not extend to acts done in abuse of the powers of their office of which they are liable upon the expiration of their tenure. It is important to note that the judiciary has absolute immunity for actions decisions taken in their official capacity.

===Norway===
Article 5 of the [[Constitution of Norway]] states: "The King's person is sacred; he cannot be censured or accused. The responsibility
rests with his Council." &lt;ref name="const"&gt;[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Norway_2014.pdf/ The Constitution of Norway in English]&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, the [[Monarchy of Norway|monarch]] cannot be prosecuted or sued in his or her personal capacity, but this immunity does not extend to the state as such. Neither does immunity extend to the monarch in his capacity as an owner or stakeholder in real property, or as an employer, provided that the suit does not allege personal responsibility for the monarch&lt;ref&gt;Fliflet: Grunnloven - kommentarutgave, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Philippines===
Article XVI, Section 3 of the [[Philippines Constitution]] states: "The State may not be sued without its consent."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawphil.net/consti/cons1987.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
The [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarch]] is personally immune from prosecution for acts committed by government ministers in the King's name, according to Title II, Section 56, Subsection 3 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]].&lt;ref name="Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78"&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_04 Título II.

At the time of the June 2014 abdication of [[King Juan Carlos]] the Spanish constitution did not state whether an abdicated monarch retains his legal immunity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellakuría|first1=Iñaki|title=El Rey perderá su inviolabilidad tras la abdicación pero puede pasar a ser aforado [The King will lose his immunity after abdicating but could keep it]|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20140603/54408625245/rey-inmunidad-abdicacion-aforado.html|accessdate=5 June 2014|work=[[La Vanguardia]]|date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the government was planning to make changes to allow this.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|title=Spain will have two kings and two queens|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/10898873/Spain-will-have-two-kings-and-two-queens.html|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation has been passed, although unlike his previous immunity, the new legislation does not completely shield the former sovereign. Juan Carlos must answer to the supreme court, in a similar type of protection afforded to many high-ranking civil servants and politicians in Spain. The legislation stipulates that all outstanding legal matters relating to the former king be suspended and passed "immediately" to the supreme court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/spain-supreme-court-king-juan-carlos-paternity|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
By the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka]], the [[President of Sri Lanka]] has sovereign immunity (till the period of office).

===Sweden===
Chapter 5, Article 8 of the [[Constitution of Sweden|Swedish Constitution]] states: "The [[Monarchy of Sweden|King]] or Queen 
who is Head of State cannot be prosecuted for his or her actions. Nor can a Regent be prosecuted for his or her actions as Head of State." This only concerns the King as a private person, since he does not appoint the government, nor do any public officials act in his name. It does not concern other members of the Royal Family, except in such cases as they are exercising the office of Regent when the King is unable to serve. It is a disputed matter among Swedish constitutional lawyers whether the article also implies that the King is immune against lawsuits in civil cases, which do not involve prosecution.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, state immunities are codified in the [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A1be1a8f7-0968-4fcc-ac26-39d3a51b7b70%20Depth%3A0%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0 State Immunity Act of 1979], which closely resembles the United Kingdom's State Immunity Act 1978. Singapore's State Immunity Act has phrases identical to that of Section 9 of United Kingdom's State Immunity Act, and does not allow a foreign state, which has agreed to submit a dispute to arbitration, to claim jurisdictional immunity in judicial proceedings relating to the agreed arbitration, i.e. "where a State has agreed in writing to submit a dispute which has arisen, or may arise, to arbitration, the state is not immune as respects proceedings in the courts in Singapore which relate to the arbitration".

The [[President of Singapore]] does to a certain extent have sovereign immunity subjected to clause 22k(4).[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-CONST&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part] (See Part V under government regarding the President of Singapore)

===United Kingdom===

====Immunity in proceedings====
Historically, the general rule in the United Kingdom has been that [[the Crown]] has never been able to be prosecuted or proceeded against in either criminal or civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|12(1)|Crown Proceedings and Crown Practice|101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only means by which civil proceedings could be brought were:
*by way of [[petition of right]], which was dependent on the grant of the royal [[Wikt:fiat|fiat]] (i.e. permission);
*by suits against the [[Attorney General]]{{which|reason=There are three Attorneys General, one for each legal system in the UK. If this means "whichever AG is appropriate", please link to [[Attorney General of the United Kingdom (disambiguation)]].|date=January 2018}} for a declaration; or
*by actions against ministers or government departments where an Act of Parliament had specifically provided that immunity be waived.

The position was drastically altered by the [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] which made the Crown (when acting as the government) liable as of right in proceedings where it was previously only liable by virtue of a grant of a fiat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Halsbury|8(1)|Constitutional Law and Human Rights|382}}&lt;/ref&gt; With limited exceptions, this had the effect of allowing proceedings for [[tort]] and [[contract]] to be brought against the Crown.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Proceedings to bring writs of [[mandamus]] and [[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]] were always available against [[minister (government)|ministers]], because their actions derive from the [[Royal Prerogative (United Kingdom)|royal prerogative]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Criminal proceedings are still prohibited from being brought against [[Her Majesty's Government]] unless expressly permitted by the Crown Proceedings Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sunkin|first=Maurice|title=Crown immunity from criminal liability in English law|journal=[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]]|year=2003|issue=Winter 2003|pages=716–729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Crown Proceedings Act only affected the law in respect of acts carried on by or on behalf of the British government, the monarch remains personally immune from criminal and civil actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|12(1)|Crown and Royal Family|47}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, civil proceedings can, in theory, still be brought using the two original mechanisms outlined above – by petition of right or by suit against the Attorney General for a declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|12(1)|Crown and Royal Family|56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other immunities====
The monarch is immune from arrest in all cases; members of the [[royal household]] are immune from arrest in civil proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|12(1)|Crown and Royal Family|52}}&lt;/ref&gt; No arrest can be made "in the monarch's presence", or within the "verges" of a royal palace. When a royal palace is used as a residence (regardless of whether the monarch is actually living there at the time), judicial processes cannot be executed within that palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|12(1)|Crown and Royal Family|53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch's goods cannot be taken under a [[writ of execution]], nor can [[distraint|distress]] be levied on land in their possession. [[Personal property|Chattels]] owned by the Crown, but present on another's land, cannot be taken in execution or for distress. The Crown is not subject to [[foreclosure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|12(1)|Crown and Royal Family|54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Supreme Court of the United States]] --&gt;
{{Main|Sovereign immunity in the United States}}
In United States law, state, federal and tribal governments generally enjoy immunity from lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sovereign immunity|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments typically enjoy immunity from some forms of suit, particularly in [[tort]].

U.S. sovereign immunity falls into two categories:&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Governmental Immunity and Auto Accidents|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/car-accidents/governmental-immunity.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Absolute immunity''':&lt;ref&gt;Absolute immunity applies to acts that, if subject to challenge, would significantly affect the operation of government. See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Shenkman|first1=Michael|title=Talking About Speech or Debate: Revisiting Legislative Immunit|journal=Yale Law &amp; Policy Review|date=2013|volume=32|issue=2|page=351|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1666&amp;context=ylpr|accessdate=1 October 2017}}, {{cite journal|last1=Block|first1=J.

*'''Qualified immunity''': pursuant to which a government actor is shielded from liability only if specific conditions are met, as specified in statute or case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualified immunity|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some situations, sovereign immunity may have been waived by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bishop|first1=William W.|title=New United States Policy Limiting Sovereign Immunity|journal=The American Journal of International Law|date=January 1953|volume=47|issue=1|pages=93–106|jstor=2194154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal sovereign immunity====
The [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] has sovereign immunity and may not be sued in the United States unless it has waived its immunity or consented to suit. The United States has waived sovereign immunity to a limited extent, mainly through the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]], which waives the immunity if a [[tort]]ious act of a federal employee causes damage, and the [[Tucker Act]], which waives the immunity over claims arising out of contracts to which the federal government is a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zoldan|first1=Evan|title=The King is Dead, Long Live the King!: Sovereign Immunity and the Curious Case of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities|journal=Conn. L. Rev.|date=2006|volume=38|pages=459–60|ssrn=1634687}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States as a sovereign is immune from suit unless it unequivocally consents to being sued.&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court in ''Price v. United States'' observed: "It is an axiom of our jurisprudence. The government is not liable to suit unless it consents thereto, and its liability in suit cannot be extended beyond the plain language of the statute authorizing it." ''Price v. United States'', 174 U.S. 373, 375-76 (1899).

====State sovereign immunity====
In ''[[Hans v. Louisiana]]'' (1890), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] (1795) re-affirms that states possess sovereign immunity and are therefore generally immune from being sued in federal court without their consent. In later cases, the Supreme Court has strengthened state sovereign immunity considerably. In ''[[Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak]]'' (1991), the court explained that

{{quote|we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure which it confirms: that the States entered the federal system with their sovereignty intact; that the judicial authority in Article III is limited by this sovereignty, and that a State will therefore not be subject to suit in federal court unless it has consented to suit, either expressly or in the "plan of the convention". [Citations omitted.]}}

In ''[[Alden v. Maine]]'' (1999), the Court explained that while it has 
{{quote|sometimes referred to the States’ immunity from suit as "Eleventh Amendment immunity"[,] [that] phrase is [a] convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, [because] the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment. Rather, as the Constitution's structure, its history, and the authoritative interpretations by this Court make clear, the States' immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today (either literally or by virtue of their admission into the Union upon an equal footing with the other States) except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.}}

Writing for the Court in ''Alden'', Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] argued that in view of this, and given the limited nature of congressional power delegated by the original unamended Constitution, the court could not "conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause or otherwise, the incidental authority to subject the States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers".

However, a "consequence of [the] Court's recognition of preratification sovereignty as the source of immunity from suit is that ''only'' States and ''arms of the State'' possess immunity from suits authorized by federal law". ''[[Northern Insurance Company of New York v. Chatham County]]'' (2006, emphasis added). Thus, cities and municipalities lack sovereign immunity, ''[[Jinks v. Richland County]]'' (2003), and counties are not generally considered to have sovereign immunity, even when they "exercise a 'slice of state power{{'"}}. ''[[Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]]'' (1979). Nor are school districts, per ''[[Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle]]'' (1977).

Additionally, Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity when it acts pursuant to powers delegated to it by any amendments ratified after the Eleventh Amendment. The [[abrogation doctrine]], established by the Supreme Court in ''[[Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer]]'' (1976), is most often implicated in cases that involve Section 5 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which explicitly allows Congress to enforce its guarantees on the states.

The '''speaker''' of a [[deliberative assembly]], especially a [[Legislature|legislative body]], is its [[Chairman|presiding officer]], or the chair. The title was first used in 1377 in [[England]].

==Usage==
[[File:Selia Kuvendit.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament of Albania]]]]

The speaker's official role is to moderate debate, make rulings on procedure, announce the results of votes, and the like. The speaker decides who may speak and has the powers to discipline members who break the procedures of the [[debate chamber|chamber or house]].&lt;ref&gt;As in case of disorders in the floor: Italian traditions knew cases of extreme contestation, not much different from tumults stigmatized in Ukrainian parliaments, Taiwanese and South Korean: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = I tre giorni della supercazzola|journal= L’Ago e il filo edizione online|date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89409125}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker often also represents the body in person, as the voice of the body in ceremonial and some other situations. The title was first recorded in 1377 to describe the role of [[Thomas de Hungerford]] in the [[Parliament of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=43659&amp;strquery=thomas%20hungerford ''Journal of the House of Commons: January 1559'']; 1559; accessed August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee-257-8&gt;Lee Vol 28, pp. 257,258.&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, speakers are normally addressed in Parliament as 'Mister Speaker', if a man, or 'Madam Speaker', if a woman. In other cultures other styles are used, mainly being equivalents of English "chairman" or "[[president]]".  Many bodies also have a speaker ''[[pro tempore]]'' (or deputy speaker), designated to fill in when the speaker is not available.

===Australia===
The [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] is the presiding officer of the [[Australian House of Representatives]], the lower house of the [[Parliament of Australia]]. The [[President of the Senate (Australia)|President of the Senate]] is the presiding officer of the [[Australian Senate]], the upper house of the Parliament.

=== Italy ===
Parliamentarism in [[Italy]] is centered on the Presidents of the two Houses, vested in defense of the members and of the assembly as a whole;&lt;ref&gt;Mancini and Galeotti believed that "in the enclosure of the House the exercise of presidential power should not be limits or obstacles whatsoever" (Mancini-Galeotti, ''Norme ed usi del Parlamento italiano'', Roma, 1887, pag. 97).&lt;/ref&gt; so "the Speaker invites the representative of the Government not to deviate from the rules of parliamentary behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [https://www.academia.edu/2420612/Sanzioni_disciplinari_nellordinamento_parlamentare {{lang|it|Sanciones disciplinarias y policía interna en el ordenamiento parlamentario italiano}} ‘’AA.VV., Derecho parlamentario sancionador’’, Eusko Legebiltazarra, Parlamento Vasco ed., 2005p. 236-271]&lt;/ref&gt; Now constitutional community highlights changes also in this role.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bilancia, ''L’imparzialità perduta (a proposito dei Presidenti di Assemblea parlamentare)'', in Aa.Vv., ''Studi in onore di Gianni Ferrara'', vol. I, Giappichelli, Torino 2005, pp. 311 ss..&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker of the House of Commons]] is the individual elected to preside over the House of Commons, the elected [[lower house]]. The speaker is a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) and is elected at the beginning of each new parliament by fellow MPs. The Speaker's role in presiding over Canada's House of Commons is similar to that of speakers elsewhere in other countries that use the [[Westminster system]].  The Speaker does not vote except in the case of a tie.  By convention, if required to vote, the Speaker will vote in favour of continuing debate on a matter, but will not ultimately vote for a measure to be approved.

The [[Speaker of the Senate of Canada]] is the presiding officer of the [[Senate of Canada]], the appointed [[upper house]]. The Speaker represents the Senate at official functions, rules on questions of parliamentary procedure and parliamentary privilege, and presides over debates and voting in the "Red Chamber". The Speaker of the Senate is appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada]] from amongst sitting senators upon the advice of the Prime Minister. The Speaker has a vote on all matters. In the event of a tie, the matter fails.

At the provincial level, the presiding officer of the provincial legidslatures is called the "Speaker" in all provinces except [[Quebec]], where the term "President" is used.  The presiding officer fulfills the same role as the Speaker of the House of Commons.

===Singapore===
In [[Singapore]], the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore]] is the [[Chairman|head officer]] of the [[Parliament of Singapore|country's legislature]].  By recent tradition, the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] nominates a person, who may or may not be an elected [[List of Singapore MPs|Member of Parliament]] (MP), for the role. The person's name is then proposed and seconded by the MPs, before being elected as Speaker.&lt;ref name="ST20160108"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Min Kok|title=Halimah Yacob to be renominated as Speaker of Parliament: 7 things you may not know about the post|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/halimah-yacob-to-be-renominated-as-speaker-of-parliament-7-things-you-may-not-know-about|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=The Straits Times|date=8 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807172539/http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/halimah-yacob-to-be-renominated-as-speaker-of-parliament-7-things-you-may-not-know-about|archivedate=7 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] states that Parliament has the freedom to decide how to elect its Speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, Art. 40(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Speaker does not have to be an elected MP, they must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP as provided for in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="ParlSpeaker"&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaker of Parliament|url=https://www.parliament.gov.sg/about-us/structure/speaker-of-parliament|website=Parliament of Singapore|accessdate=7 August 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170807171756/https://www.parliament.gov.sg/about-us/structure/speaker-of-parliament|archivedate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Speaker also cannot be a Cabinet Minister or Parliamentary Secretary,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, Art. 40(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and must resign from those positions prior to being elected as Speaker.

The Speaker is one of the few public sector roles which allow its office-holder to automatically qualify as a candidate in the [[Presidential elections in Singapore|Singapore presidential elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, Art. 19(3)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] is the individual elected to preside over the elected [[House of Commons]]. The speaker is a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) and is elected at the beginning of each new parliament by fellow MPs.

The [[Lord Speaker]] is the presiding officer of the [[House of Lords]].  The commonly used "Speaker of the House of Lords" is not correct. The presiding officer of the House of Lords was until recently the [[Lord Chancellor]], who was also a member of the government (a cabinet member) and the head of the judicial branch. The Lord Chancellor did not have the same authority to discipline members of the Lords that the speaker of the Commons has in that house. The Lord Speaker is elected by the [[members of the House of Lords]] and is expected to be politically impartial.

===United States===

====Federal====
Both chambers of the [[United States Congress]] have a presiding officer defined by the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] presides over the lower house of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], while the [[Vice President of the United States]] formally presides over the upper house, the [[United States Senate | Senate]]. In practise, the [[Vice President of the United States | Vice President]] does not have a day presence in Congress given their responsibilities in the Executive branch, and in their absence, the role is delegated to the most [[Seniority in the United States Senate | Senior]] member of the majority party, the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]].

====States====
In the forty-nine [[U.S. state|states]] that have a [[bicameral]] legislature, the highest position in the [[lower house]] is usually called the "speaker". In Nebraska—the only state with a [[unicameral]] legislature—the senators elect one senator to serve as "[[Nebraska Legislature#Speaker|Speaker of the Nebraska Legislature]]". In Tennessee, the senators elect a "Speaker of the Senate" who presides over the [[Tennessee Senate#Senate Speaker Duties|Tennessee Senate]] and serves as lieutenant governor.

==Similar posts==
[[File:Croatian parliament.jpg|thumb|220px|Palace of the [[Croatian parliament]]]]

The presiding officer for an [[upper house]] of a bicameral legislature usually has a different title, although substantially the same duties.

When the upper house is called a [[senate]], the equivalent title is often [[President of the Senate]]. [[Australia]], [[Chile]], the [[United States]] and many other countries have upper houses with presiding officers titled "president". In several American republics, the vice president of the country serves as the president of the upper house.

This pattern is not universal, however. Some upper houses, including those of [[Speaker of the Senate of Canada|Canada]], have a speaker.

The [[Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales]], [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament]], and [[Presiding Officer of the Northern Ireland Assembly]] fulfill the same role as the speaker.

'''Swiss citizenship''' is the status of being a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of [[Switzerland]] and it can be obtained by [[jus sanguinis|birth]] or [[naturalisation]].

The Swiss Citizenship Law is based on the following principles:
* Triple citizenship level ([[Swiss Confederation]], [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]], and [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]])
* Acquisition of citizenship through descent (''[[jus sanguinis]]'')
* Prevention of [[statelessness]]

[[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] nationals are citizens of their municipality of origin, their canton of origin, and the Confederation, in that order: a Swiss citizen is defined as someone who has the bourgeoisie of a Swiss municipality (article 37 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]]). They are entered in the family register of their [[place of origin]]. The manner by which a Swiss citizen acquires their place of origin differs depending on whether they acquired Swiss citizenship by filiation (jus sanguinis), ordinary naturalisation, or facilitated naturalisation. Marriage has in and of itself no effect on the places of origin of the spouses &lt;ref&gt;Art. 161 CC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition of Swiss citizenship==

===Acquisition by filiation===
A child is Swiss at birth if:
*They are the child of a married couple of whom at least one parent is Swiss.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1  al. 1 let. a LN 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
*They are the child of a Swiss mother not married to the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 al. 1 let. b LN 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
A child of a Swiss father not married to the mother is considered Swiss by birth when a link of paternity is declared; any children of that child also acquire Swiss citizenship by filiation.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 al. 2 and 3 LN 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The child of two Swiss citizens who are married at the time of the child's birth acquires the places of origin of the parent whose surname the child acquires.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 271 CC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundlings===
A foundling acquires Swiss citizenship and the citizenship of the canton in which they are found. The canton decides which place of origin the child receives. Once paternity is determined, the child loses Swiss citizenship, unless this would leave him or her stateless.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 3 LN&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption===
A child adopted by a Swiss parent acquires the place of origin of the Swiss parent, thereby acquiring Swiss nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 4 LN&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturalisation===
====Ordinary naturalisation====
Ordinary naturalisation in Switzerland is a cantonal competency but regulated by federal legislation. 
On 20 June 2014, the two Chambers of the Swiss Parliament passed the Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality (''Révision totale de la loi sur l'acquisition et la perte de la nationalité suisse''). The Law, first introduced in 2011 by the Swiss federal government, aimed to lower, among other requirements, the residency requirement from 12 years to 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parlament.ch/f/suche/pages/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20110022&lt;/ref&gt; During the parliamentary debates and the ensuing disagreements between the more conservative National Council (lower house) and the more liberal Council of States (upper house), the residency requirement was increased to 10 years. The time spent in Switzerland between the ages of 8 and 18 is doubled when counted for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must have spent at least 6 years in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;art. 9 LN&lt;/ref&gt; The law also requires cantons to set a minimum residency requirement of between 2 and 5 years, as well as requiring applicants to have a permanent residency permit (Autorisation d'établissement), which is commonly referred as a C permit.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 18 LN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art. 9 al. 2 let. a&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, time spent in Switzerland with temporary admission (''Permis d'admission provisoire'') is halved counting the years spent in Switzerland for the purposes of naturalisation.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 33 al. 1 let. b LN&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality entered into force on 1 January 2018.
Applications for naturalisation submitted prior to the entry into force of the new nationality law will continue to be processed under the 1952 law.&lt;ref&gt;art. 50 al. 2 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
The federal nationality law of 2014 imposes two formal conditions which an applicant for naturalisation must satisfy:
*Ten years of lawful residence in Switzerland including three of the five years immediately preceding the application.&lt;ref&gt;art. 9 al. 1 let. b LN&lt;/ref&gt; The time spent in Switzerland between the ages of 8 and 18 is doubled when counted for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must have spent at least six years in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;art. 9 LN&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is made for registered partners of Swiss citizens where the registered partnership has lasted at least three years and the Swiss citizen was already a Swiss citizen at the moment of the conclusion of the partnership: the foreign registered partner must have lived a total of five years in Switzerland, including the year immediately preceding the application.&lt;ref&gt;art. 10 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
*Be a permanent resident.&lt;ref&gt;art. 9 al. 1 let. a LN&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the aforementioned formal conditions, the federal nationality law of 2014 also imposes material conditions which an applicant for naturalisation must meet:&lt;ref&gt;arts. 11 and 12 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
*The applicant must be well integrated,
*The applicant must be familiar with life in Switzerland,
*The applicant must not endanger Switzerland's interior or exterior security,
*The applicant must show respect for public order and security,
*The applicant must respect the values of the federal constitution,
*The applicant must be able to communicate in a national language, both orally and in writing,
*The applicant must participate in the economy or be in education,
*The applicant must, if married, in a registered partnership, or a parent, encourage and support the integration of his spouse and minor children

Cantons can impose further requirements which are complementary to the federal requirements.

====Simplified naturalisation====

=====Confederation=====

Foreigners in the following categories may apply for simplified naturalisation:

* The spouse of a Swiss citizen&lt;ref&gt;art. 21 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
* A person who was mistakenly treated as a Swiss citizen and believed himself to be a Swiss citizen&lt;ref&gt;art. 22 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women who lost Swiss citizenship through marriage to a non-Swiss citizen, or through the loss of Swiss citizenship by their husband, before 23 March 1992
* The child of a naturalised person&lt;ref&gt;art. 24 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third-generation immigrants&lt;ref&gt;art. 38 Cst.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children born to Swiss mothers who lost their citizenship due to marriage to a foreigner before 23 March 1992 but who later reacquired their former Swiss nationality
* Children born to Swiss mothers who had acquired Swiss citizenship themselves on the basis of a previous marriage to a Swiss husband
* Persons born before 1 July 1985 whose mothers had acquired Swiss citizenship by descent, adoption, or naturalisation

====== Simplified naturalisation by virtue of marriage ======
A person married to a Swiss citizen may apply for Swiss citizenship by facilitated naturalisation after living in Switzerland for five years and having been married for at least three years. No language test is required, but one must show the following:

*integration into the Swiss way of life;  
*compliance with the Swiss rule of law;  
*no danger to Switzerland's internal or external security.

Children from the person's previous relationships (but not same-sex couples) are given citizenship along with the partner.

It is also possible for the spouse of a Swiss citizen to apply for facilitated naturalisation while residing overseas after the following:

* Six years of marriage to a Swiss citizen.
* Close ties to Switzerland, i.e. travelling regularly to Switzerland, being an active member of a Swiss club abroad, and/or having close relations to the family of their Swiss spouse.

Spouses acquiring Swiss citizenship by facilitated naturalisation will acquire the citizenship of the place and canton of origin of their Swiss spouse.

====== Simplified naturalisation for third generation immigrants ======
The federal constitution declares that the Confederation will facilitate the naturalisation of third generation immigrants (Art. 38 §3 part a). Legislation has yet to be introduced describing the precise requirements for an application for facilitated naturalisation under article 38 §3 part a.

=====Canton of Vaud=====
The Canton of Vaud legislated in 2004 to allow for second-generation foreigners to acquire Swiss nationality more easily under the following conditions:&lt;ref&gt;''Loi sur le droit de cité vaudois de 2004'' Art. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
* The applicant must meet the requirements set by federal law.
* Aged between 14 and 25 years.
* Has completed at least five years of obligatory education in Switzerland.
* Has at least two years' residence in Vaud.
* Has not lived abroad since the end of his or her obligatory education, with the exception of temporary stays abroad for purposes of education.
* One of the applicant's parents must currently be lawfully resident in Switzerland or have been so in the past.
* Integration and command of the [[French Language]].
* Lawful behaviour.
* The applicant must not represent a danger for Swiss national security.

The 2004 law also facilitates the naturalisation of foreigners of the 3rd generation under the following conditions:&lt;ref&gt;''Loi sur le droit de cité vaudois'' Art. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* The applicant must meet the requirements set by federal law.
* At least two years' residence in Vaud.
* The applicant must have not resided outside Switzerland since his birth, with the exception of temporary stays abroad for purposes of education.
* Integration and command of the [[French Language]].
* The applicant must not represent a danger for Swiss national security.

The yearly rate of naturalisation has quintupled over the 1990s and 2000s, from roughly 9,000 to 45,000 naturalisations per year.

Relative to the population of resident foreigners, this amounts to an increase from 8% in 1990 to 27% in 2007, or relative to the number of Swiss citizens from 0.16% in 1990 to 0.73% in 2007.

====Reacquisition of Swiss nationality====
Foreigners in the following category can apply to have their nationality restored:
* Children whose mothers had acquired Swiss citizenship by virtue of marriage to a Swiss husband (before 31 December 1991).
* Children of Swiss parents born abroad who were not registered at a Swiss representation abroad before their 22nd birthday can reacquire their nationality within a period of ten years immediately following their 22nd birthday.
* Children for whom the ten year limit has expired can nevertheless still apply to recover their former Swiss nationality if they can prove a "close relationship with Switzerland."
* Former Swiss nationals whose Swiss citizenship ceased due to an application for release under articles 37-41 of the nationality law.

Formal conditions:&lt;ref&gt;art. 26 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
* Residence in Switzerland or close links to Switzerland if resident abroad.
* The applicant must respect Swiss public order and security.
* The applicant must respect the values of the constitution.
* The applicant must not endanger Switzerland's interior or exterior security.
* Applicants having ceased to be Swiss nationals due to expiry, release, or loss must apply within ten years of ceasing to be Swiss nationals. This rule does not apply to former nationals currently residing in Switzerland for at least three years.&lt;ref&gt;art. 27 LN&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loss of Swiss citizenship ==
===Loss due to cessation of paternity===
A child whose Swiss citizenship depends on paternal links loses citizenship when those are cut.&lt;ref&gt;LN 2014 Art. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss due to adoption===
A Swiss child adopted by foreign parents is considered to have lost Swiss citizenship; if the adoption is subsequently annulled, the loss of nationality is retroactively invalidated.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 6 LN&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss due to birth abroad===
A Swiss citizen born abroad to at least one Swiss parent and holding at least one other nationality loses Swiss citizenship at age 22 if:

*They have never been announced to the Swiss authorities, or &lt;ref&gt;Art. 7 al. 1 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
*They have never written to the Swiss authorities expressing their desire to retain Swiss citizenship, or &lt;ref&gt;Art. 7 al. 1 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
*They (or their guardians) have never sought to procure Swiss identity documents for them, i.e. a passport or an identity card.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 7 al. 3 LN&lt;/ref&gt;

Equally, the child of a person who loses Swiss nationality in this manner also loses Swiss nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 7 al. 2 LN&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptionally, a person who has been prevented, against their will, from taking the necessary actions to retain Swiss citizenship may undertake the required actions within a delay of 1 year following the cessation of such hindrances.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 7 al. 4 LN&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triple citizenship level within Swiss citizenship==
Each municipality in Switzerland maintains its own registry of citizens, which is separate from the registry of people living in the municipality. Many Swiss citizens do not live in their [[place of origin]]; therefore, they are often required by the municipality in which they live to get a certificate of citizenship (''acte d'origine/Heimatschein/atto d'origine'') from their place of origin. The constitution forbids discrimination based on one's place of origin, with the exception of bourgeoisies.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 37 al. 2 Cst.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual nationality==
According to the Federal Office for Migration,  there has been no restriction on [[multiple citizenship]] in Switzerland since 1 January 1992. Thus, foreigners who acquire Swiss citizenship and Swiss citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship keep their previous citizenship (subject to the laws of the other country), as was the case before this date. An estimated 60% of Swiss nationals living abroad in 1998 were multiple citizens.

Since many [[nationality law]]s now allow both parents to transmit their nationality to their common child (and not only the father, as used to be often the case), many children automatically acquire multiple citizenship at birth. This is especially frequent in Switzerland, since a relatively high proportion of the population holds a foreign passport (up to 54% in [[Geneva]] and 20% nationally). However, the Federal Office for Migration specially notes that this has not resulted in any practical problems worth mentioning.  Military service, the most likely problem to arise, is usually done in the country where the applicant resides at the time of conscription.

Even though Swiss nationality law permits multiple citizenship, a Swiss national who also holds another country's citizenship may be required to renounce the foreign citizenship, under the foreign country's nationality law.

After two referendums rejected laws to facilitate naturalisation in September 2004, some opponents (notably the [[Swiss People's Party]]) attempted to return to the pre-1992 situation, in which multiple citizenship was forbidden.

== Political discussions and referendums about Swiss citizenship in Switzerland in recent years==
Swiss citizenship laws have been widely debated over recent years. In comparison to other [[nationality law]]s, access to Swiss citizenship is relatively narrow and restricted, and several modifications to widen access to Swiss citizenship via constitutional initiatives and referendums have been proposed. The referendums on the matter – held in 1983, 1994, and 2004 – were all rejected by Swiss voters. In particular, during the referendum held in September 2004, Swiss voters rejected proposals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3673736.stm | work=BBC News | title=Long road to Swiss citizenship | date=20 September 2004 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to give some long-resident Swiss-born persons aged between 14 and 24 the right to apply for ''facilitated'' naturalisation (which bypasses cantonal and municipal requirements) and grant automatic Swiss citizenship to persons born in Switzerland with a parent also born in Switzerland.

While minimal requirements for obtaining Swiss citizenship by naturalisation are set at the federal level, Swiss cantons and municipalities are free to introduce more stringent requirements. Some municipalities had previously had no procedure for allowing naturalisations, effectively rendering it impossible, such as in La Chaux in the Canton of Vaud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/actu/naturalisation-ne-devient-suisse-facon-2011-03-22 |title=Naturalisation: on ne devient pas Suisse partout de la même façon &amp;#124; 24 heures |publisher=Archives.24heures.ch |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2013-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628063825/http://archives.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/actu/naturalisation-ne-devient-suisse-facon-2011-03-22 |archivedate=2013-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the municipality of [[Emmen, Switzerland|Emmen]] and the canton of [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] began using referendums to decide the outcome of naturalisation requests. The practice was ruled unconstitutional by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Supreme Court]] in July 2003. A [[Swiss referendum, June 2008|referendum]] directed at legalizing this practice was rejected on 1 June 2008.

== Rights and obligations of Swiss citizens ==
[[File:Swiss Pass 2006.jpg|thumbnail|[[Swiss passport]]]]
Swiss citizens are entitled to
*vote in federal elections and referendums upon reaching the age of 18;
*run for federal political office: the Federal Assembly, the Federal Council, and the Federal Court;
*start and sign a popular initiative or a request for a facultative [[referendum]];
*obtain a [[Swiss passport]] or a [[Swiss identity card]].
*return to Switzerland at any time;
*avoid deportation from Switzerland;
*be able to live, work, study, buy property, and open up a business anywhere in the EU (through the bilateral agreement between Switzerland and the EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway;

Male Swiss citizens, including dual citizens, can be required to perform [[Military of Switzerland#Conscription|military service]] or [[Swiss Civilian Service|civilian service]] (women can do it voluntarily). Male citizens who do not complete their military service or who do not do civilian service must pay a supplementary tax. Swiss citizens are not allowed to work for a foreign (non-Swiss) military, unless they are a citizen of - and are resident in - the country in question. The Swiss Guards of the Vatican State are regarded as a house policy, not as an army.

===Travel freedom of Swiss citizens===
{{main|Visa requirements for Swiss citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Swiss citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Swiss citizens]]]]
Visa requirements for Swiss citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Switzerland]]. In May 2018, Swiss citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries and territories, ranking the Swiss passport 5th in the world according to the [[Travel visa#Visa restrictions|Visa Restrictions Index]].

The Swiss nationality is ranked ninth, together with Ireland, in [[The Quality of Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">[[T. H. Marshall]]'s '''Social Citizenship''' is a political concept first highlighted in his essay, “Citizenship and the Social Class” in 1949. 

== Overview ==
Marshall's concept defines the social responsibilities the state has to its citizens or, as Marshall puts it, “from [granting] the right to a modicum of [[economic welfare]] and security to the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the standards prevailing in the society”.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, T H. Citizenship and Social Class: And Other Essays. Cambridge [Eng.: University Press, 1950. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key points made by Marshall is his belief in an evolution of rights in [[England]] acquired via [[citizenship]], from “[[civil rights]] in the eighteenth [century], political in the nineteenth, and social in the twentieth”.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;  This evolution however, has been criticized by many for only being from the perspective of the white working man. Marshall concludes his essay with three major factors for the evolution of [[social rights]] and for their further evolution, listed below: 
# The lessening of the [[income gap]]
# “The great extension of the area of common culture and common experience”&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;
# An enlargement of citizenship and more rights granted to these citizens. 
Many of the social responsibilities of a state have since become a major part of many state’s policies (see [[United States Social Security]]). However, these have also become controversial issues as there is a debate over whether a citizen truly has the [[right to education]] and even more so, to [[social welfare]].

==Criticism==
=== From the Neo-Liberals===
“[[Neo-liberal|Neo-Liberal]] (Free-Market) ideology [asserts] that state abstention from economic protection is the foundation of a good society”,&lt;ref name="McCluskey"&gt;McCluskey, Martha. "Efficiency and Social Citizenship: Challenging the Neoliberal Attack on the Welfare State †." Indiana Law Journal 78:783 (2002): n. pag. Indiana Law Journal . Web. 26 Nov. 2011.3.&lt;/ref&gt; thus they are diametrically opposed to the social rights proposed by Marshall. Neo-liberals instead suggest that welfare programs (some of the [[Social responsibility|social responsibilities]] discussed by Marshall to help the poor “effectively utilize their civil and political rights”&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;), have “promoted [[passivity (behavior)|passivity]] among the poor, without actually improving their chances, and created a culture of dependency”.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka"&gt;Kymlicka, Will, and Wayne Norman. "Return of the Citizen: A Survey of Recent Work on Citizenship Theory."Ethics 104 (1994): 352-376. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They instead suggest (and have implemented) welfare requiring fulfillment of obligations.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka" /&gt;

Proponents of [[social citizenship]] are very critical of the Neo-Liberal ideology, suggesting that it is an “assault on the very principle of citizenship”,&lt;ref name="McCluskey" /&gt; and that the Neo-Liberal institution of fulfillment of obligations as requirement for citizenship, because they suggest that citizenship is inherent and that “that is only appropriate to demand fulfillment of the responsibilities after the right to participate is achieved”.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka" /&gt;

===From the Feminists===
Some [[feminist]] scholars argue that Marshall’s essay only reflects the perspective of working class white males. His assertion that in England all people were free and had civil rights is false, as only men had any “legal freedom” or ability to exercise [[Political rights|political]] or civil rights. Thus, they argue that Marshall fails to discuss the issue of [[second-class citizen]]s and that “he takes for granted the gender and racial hierarchies” &lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;Fraser, Nancy, and Linda Gordon. 1992. “Contract versus Charity: Why Is There No Social Citizenship in the United States?” Socialist Review 22: 45–65&lt;/ref&gt; within society is a fundamental flaw in his work. 

However, while Marshall did not discuss the problems associated with having second-class citizenry, he did acknowledge that “citizenship itself [has] functioned as an architect of [[social inequality]]”.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; Additionally, many feminists see the expansion of social rights as an inherently good thing, especially as today; women in many countries have the same civil and political rights as men. And, feminists see social rights as giving an opportunity to many women to utilize their civil and political rights (just as Marshall suggests white men in England in the 1940s are able to do).&lt;ref&gt;Side, Katherine. "Contract, Charity, And Honorable Entitlement: Social Citizenship And The 1967 Abortion Act In Northern Ireland After The Good Friday Agreement." Social Politics: International Studies In Gender, State &amp; Society 13.1 (2006): 89-116.Political Science Complete. Web. 27 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially as current free-market solutions “[embrace’] a racialized, genderized, and class-biased  vision  of  social  equity  and community solidarity that  favors the interests of the most privileged members  of society”.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka" /&gt; Without resources, traditional hierarchies, with white men at the top, are unable to be combated.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka" /&gt;

==The Contract-Charity Dichotomy ==
[[Nancy Fraser]] and [[Linda Gordon]] in the essay “Contract versus Charity: Why is there no Social Citizenship in the United States?” expanded on T. H. Marshall's original proposition to look at how [[gender inequality]] has led to a dismissal of social citizenship within the [[United States]]. They argue that, because men were more powerful in [[civil society]], within the “male sphere”  “contractual relations dominated”,&lt;ref name="Fraser" /&gt; especially in regards to work with wage contracts.  Gradually, the male sphere began to dominate more and more of human relations, and thus contractual relations encroached on more and more areas. Because of “the hegemony of contract… a specifically modern conception of ‘charity’” &lt;ref name="Fraser" /&gt; was generated as a “complementary other.” Thus, welfare and helping the unfortunate became seen as a form of charity, rather than as an obligation. Because of this viewpoint, the receivers of charity were stigmatized for not “earning” the charity. 
	
Fraser and Gordon also offer a solution to allowing social citizenship to gain popularity within the United States. They suggest that concentrating the focus of civil citizenship from “property-centered to a more solidaristic form” would allow citizens to reestablish ties with their community, something they believe is essential for citizens to have in order to believe in welfare and social citizenship as a whole.

==Conclusion==
T.H. Marshall published his essay in 1949 and it has had a huge impact on many of the citizen debates which have followed it.&lt;ref&gt;Torres, Carlos. "Democracy, Education and Multiculturalism: Dilemmas of Citizenship in a Global World." Citizenship, Democracy, and Multiculturalism: The Theoretical Problem. UCLA, 20 Mar. 1998. Web. 26 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.international.ucla.edu/lac/cat&lt;/ref&gt; Though the original essay fails to view perspectives other than that of a working class white male, social citizenship not only can be but has been applied to myriad peoples. The United States has become disillusioned by the idea of social citizenship, but many industrialized states view social citizenship as their responsibility, even providing welfare outside of their own borders. Marshall’s articulation of the idea of social citizenship was vital to the idea’s proliferation.

The organization responsible for tax policy in Ukraine is the State Fiscal Service, operating under the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. Taxation is legally regulated by the Taxation Code of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax Code of Ukraine|url=http://www.visnuk.com.ua/uploads/pdf/tax_code.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar year serves as a fiscal year in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 3 of Budgetary code of Ukraine|url=http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2456-17|work=Budgetary code of Ukraine|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important sources of tax revenue in Ukraine are unified social security contributions, value added tax, individual income tax. In 2017 taxes collected formed 23% of GDP at 969,654  million UAH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Revenue in Ukraine|url=http://cost.ua/en/budget/revenue/|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of taxes==

===Individual Income tax===
Individual Income Tax is derived from income of Ukraine citizens and other individuals living in the country. Liability to personal income tax is mainly determined by criterion of residency. A person who is tax resident in Ukraine is required to pay personal income tax from his worldwide income, which is also called unlimited liability. Tax residency is determined by several factors, if an individual carries out one of them, they are considered tax resident. The conditions are following: residency in Ukraine, permanent residency in Ukraine in case of living in another country, location of centre of vital interest in case of having permanent residency in more than one country and location, where individual resides at least 183 days in a year, in case none of the above is applicable.  A person who is not considered resident, have only limited liability, so they have to pay taxes only from their incomes in Ukraine. Individual income tax in Ukraine is proportional tax. It can be 0%, 5%, 9%, 18% and it depends on type of income. For example tax rate for employment income is 18%. In some cases rate of the tax depends on status of the taxpayer. For instance income from selling real estate, is taxed at a rate of 5% for residents and 18% for non-residents.  In addition, on every individual’s income, which is taxable by Individual Income Tax, there is also imposed military tax, whose tax rate is 1.5%.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual Income Tax in Ukraine|url=https://www.contactukraine.com/taxation/individual-tax-in-ukraine|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inheritance and Gift Tax===
The rates of inheritance and gift tax in Ukraine depends on tax residency status of testate/giver and inheritor/recipient. In the case of gift tax, there are 4 options. If the recipient is a resident of Ukraine and first civil degree relative of giver, who is also resident of the country, the tax rate is 0%. If the recipient is resident and giver is resident and anyone but first civil degree relative, the tax rate is 5%. If the recipient is resident and giver is non-resident, the tax rate is 18%. If recipient is non-resident and receives some possession in Ukraine, the tax rate is also 18%. In every case recipient also have to pay military tax, which is at 1.5%, as on every other taxable income.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Corporate Income Tax===
In case of Corporate Income Tax, taxation again depends on residency status. To be considered resident, legal entity must be registered in Ukraine and it must operate under Ukrainian laws. If these conditions are met, the legal entity is considered resident and their tax base for Corporate Income Tax is their worldwide income. Non-residents pay the tax only from income with origin in Ukraine, but not every kind of income is subject to the tax. Permanent establishment of non-residents are considered separate entity.
Tax rate differs between these categories. For residents the tax rate is 18% with few exceptions. For example, insurance companies have to pay 0 to 3% of their income as a special corporate tax, that lowers taxable profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Income Tax in Ukraine|url=https://www.contactukraine.com/taxation/corporate-tax|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value added tax===
[[Value added]] tax is levied on production and import of goods and services and the exports. There are 3 rates, at which the tax is paid. The tax rate of most common of them, standard rate, is 20%. There are also two special rates. First of them is 7 % and is levied on pharmaceutics and other healthcare products. The second one is 0% and it is levied on exports and auxiliary services.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxation and Investment in Ukraine 2017|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-ukraineguide-2017.pdf|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excise duty===
Excise duty in Ukraine is mainly imposed on alcohol, tobacco products, motor vehicles and different types of fuels and electricity. For some goods the tax is counted as a percentage of price, in other cases as a price per unit. Sometimes both options can be combined.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Withholding taxes===
There also several withholding taxes in Ukraine. The tax rate for dividends, royalties and dividends paid to non-residents, both companies and individuals, is 15%.  The unified social security contribution that are companies obliged to pay for their employees is equal to 22% of employee’s salary.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Real Estate Tax===
Real Estate Tax is composed of 3 parts: land fee, immovable property tax and transport tax. Land fee can be further divided into land tax and land rent. Taxpayers of land tax are owners or users of land, both companies and individuals. Taxpayers of land rent, are renters of the land from state or communities. Land tax rate ranges between 1% and 5% of value of the land. Land rent can be at most 12% of the normative monetary value. Immovable property tax is levied on real estate, both commercial and residential, and it is paid by both companies and individuals. The land is excluded from the tax. The tax rate can be set at most at 1.5% of minimum wage for every square meter of the property.
Owners of the cars, the value of which is more than 1.2 million UAH and which are used less than 5 years, are required to pay transport tax. The cost is 25 000 UAH for one car.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Other Taxes===
Other taxes collected in Ukraine include customs taxes, different types of rental duty and environmental tax. Customs taxes are mainly levied on imports and the rates mainly vary between 0% and 10%, although in some cases they can be higher. Rental duty taxes natural resources. Within its scope falls for instance extraction of mineral resources or using of radio sequences. Environmental tax taxes pollutants leaked into water and air and disposal of waste. The rates differ, depending on many different factors.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The '''Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity''' is a bi-partisan initiative by leading figures in politics, tech, media and business from Europe and the US with the aim of addressing the question of [[Foreign electoral intervention|foreign interference in elections]].

==Foundation==

On the sidelines of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on June 21st 2018, [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], founder of [[Alliance of Democracies]] and [[Michael Chertoff]], a former secretary of homeland security in America, launched the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, which has [[Joe Biden]], [[Nick Clegg]], [[Toomas Ilves]], and [[Felipe Calderón]] among its members. The Commission is tasked with bolstering the defences of Western democracies against outside interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/international/2018/08/04/countries-team-up-to-save-the-liberal-order-from-donald-trump|title=Countries team up to save the liberal order from Donald Trump|last=|first=|date=2018-08-02|website=economist.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity is Transatlantic and bipartisan in nature. It seeks to share lessons learned between decision-makers and institutions in Europe and the US, raise public awareness about the risks of interference while working to develop new models and technologies to empower civil society and governments to defend democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allianceofdemocracies.org/initiatives/the-campaign/press_release_tcei/|title=Press release - Transatlantic, bi-partisan Commission launched to prevent election meddling|last=|first=|date=2018-05-11|website=allianceofdemocracies.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stated goals==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
The Commission aims that over the next 20 elections to be held across EU and NATO countries between 2018 and the next American presidential contest in November 2020, they would advance a more collective approach to tackling election interference. 

The Commission attempts to bridge three critical gaps it has identified as having thus far prevented the West from effectively addressing the challenge: a transatlantic gap; a partisan gap; and the gap between the tech community and the rest of society.

'''Translating for legal equivalence''' is the production of [[translation]]s that are acceptable by a legal [[jurisdiction]].

==Legal requirements==
For legal and official purposes, [[evidence (law)|evidentiary documents]] and other official [[documentation]] are usually required in the [[official language]](s) of a [[jurisdiction]].

In some [[countries]], it is a requirement for translations of such documents that a [[translator]] swear an [[oath]] to attest that it is the legal equivalent of the [[source text]]. Often, only translators of a special class are authorized to swear such oaths. In some cases, the translation is only accepted as a legal equivalent if it is accompanied by the original or a sworn or certified [[copying|copy]] of it.

Even if a [[translator]] specializes in legal translation or is a [[lawyer]] in their country, this does not necessarily make them a sworn translator. The procedure for translating to legal equivalence differs from country to country.

===Argentina===
In compliance with Law #20,305, all public documents (including personal papers and some commercial contracts) have to be translated and signed by a certified "public translator" (''traductor público''), whose seal and signature have to be legalized on each document by the Translators' professional body of their jurisdiction. All private persons, companies, the judiciary and other government departments are subject to this law regarding documents or depositions in a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traductores.org.ar/nuevo_org/home/ley/?id_ruta=1&amp;nivel2=8&amp;nivel3=9 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001142704/http://www.traductores.org.ar/nuevo_org/home/ley/?id_ruta=1&amp;nivel2=8&amp;nivel3=9 |archivedate=October 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be certified as a public translator for a major European language, candidates have to attend university courses leading to the professional degree of ''traductor público''.

===Belgium===
"''Sworn Translators''" (singular [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: beëdigd vertaler, [[French language|French]]: traducteur assermenté) or "''Sworn Interpreter''" (singular [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: beëdigd tolk, [[French language|French]]: interprète assermenté) swear an oath before the President of the [[Court of First Instance (Belgium)|Court of First Instance]] of the [[Arrondissements of Belgium|judicial district]] in which they have their place of residence. In the past translators and interpreters in all judicial districts aspiring to "sworn" status were screened for suitability by the [[Prosecutor|Crown Prosecutor]]. The candidate has to state the language combinations for he or she wishes to be sworn. A diploma of translator/interpreter is usually regarded as adequate proof of competence. There is no limitation on the language combinations which can be recognized. 

However, following a scandal involving an illegal immigrant who obtained sworn translator status, The President of the Court of First Instance at [[Antwerp]], launched an experimental scheme whereby aspiring sworn translators and interpreters have to undergo training organized by the [[Ministry of Justice]] and submit to examination. The same President, based on his interpretation of the [[Language legislation in Belgium|language laws]], also ruled that the only language combinations that could be recognized for sworn translator/interpreter status were those in which Dutch was either the original language or the target language. This view has not yet been adopted by other judicial districts in Belgium.

===Brazil===
Official documents can only be translated by Public Sworn Translators and Interpreters, who are certified and accredited by the registry of commerce of each state. The applicants must pass highly demanding oral and written examinations for specific language pairs. They undergo background checks before receiving a registration number, which must be informed in the heading of every translation. 
''Ad hoc'' (temporary) translators can also be appointed by the Registry of Commerce to do a single translation job, when there is no Public Translator registered for that specific language pair.
The registry of commerce of each state also sets the translation fees. 

Although the public sworn translator/interpreter must reside in the state of registration, his translations are valid in the entire country. Institutions and government agencies in cities and states different from those of residence of the public sworn translator may require the notarial verification of the translator's signature. 

Foreign documents must be verified by a Brazilian consulate or embassy in the country they were issued before translation. Official documents translated into a foreign language need to have the public sworn translator's signature verified by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs if the institution or government agency of the foreign country so requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buscar tradutor por cidade|url=http://atpmg.com.br/informacoes.php|publisher=www.atpmg.com.br|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Official translation of documents can be produced in one of two ways. Certified translations are those completed by a certified translator and accompanied by the translator's declaration, signature and seal. The title of "certified translator" is a protected title in Canada, and only those individuals who are members in good standing of a provincial translators' association and have passed a certification exam can use this title and produce certified translations. An alternative method for producing official translations in Canada is by attaching a sworn affidavit signed by the translator in the presence of a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits to the translation.

===Germany===
German regional courts (''Landgerichte'') have the power to appoint "sworn translators". The specific title and the appointment procedure are different in each [[States of Germany|state]]. In most cases, the candidates are required to pass an examination.

===Hungary===
There are five qualification types for translators and interpreters in Hungary: technical translator, technical translator-proofreader, interpreter, technical interpreter and conference interpreter. These qualifications can be acquired in BA and MA programmes, postgraduate courses and in institutions accredited by the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.

Anyone regardless of age and qualification may apply for a qualifying examination in interpretation. Qualifications for technical translation, technical translation proofreading, technical interpretation and conference interpretation can be obtained in the following fields: social science, natural science, technology and economics. Anyone with a degree in one of the above fields may apply for a qualifying examination in technical translation and technical interpretation in the given field. Qualified technical interpreters and technical translators may be further qualified for conference interpretation and technical translation proofreading, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Szakfordító és tolmácsképesítések|url=http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/getdoc2.cgi?dbnum=1&amp;docid=98600007.MM|publisher=net.jogtar.hu|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Office for Translation and Attestation (''Országos Fordító és Fordításhitelesítő Iroda'', OFFI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFFI|url=http://www.offi.hu/company|publisher=www.offi.hu|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a company in Hungary that has the exclusive right to certify translations both from and to Hungarian created by the office itself or a third party, and to make certified copies of documents written in a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=a szakfordításról és tolmácsolásról|url=http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/getdoc2.cgi?dbnum=1&amp;docid=98600024.MT|publisher=net.jogtar.hu|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation in courts of Budapest is provided by OFFI.

If the Office cannot provide an interpreter, and for courts outside Budapest, an interpreter registered by the local authorities will be appointed. If no official interpreter is available, a suitable person with a good command of the required language will be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=a szakfordításról és a tolmácsolásról szóló 24/1986.

===India===
There is less documentation and sources known. A sworn-in Interpreter or Translator as per Maharashtra Courts Civil Law Chapter 26 of OATHS AND AFFIDAVITS prescribed under section 6 of the Oaths Act, 1969 (point 515) may with help of Form No.3 make an affidavit that he shall well and truly interpret evidences given by witnesses and translate correctly and accurately all documents given to him or her for translation.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, sworn translators are persons having attended and passed legal translation examination organized by the School of Linguistics and Cultural Sciences, University of Indonesia (FIB, UI). After passing the exam, they will be sworn in by the Governor of DKI Jakarta, provided that they have a Jakarta ID card. For other regions, each has to write to their respective Governor to take oath by their governor, thus obtain the status 'sworn'.

Alternatively, the Association of Indonesian Translators or HPI also have exams for members who wants to have a certification as a competent, professional translator or interpreter. Upon passing, the certification will expire in 5 years.&lt;ref name="Sertifikasi"&gt;[http://www.hpi.or.id/sertifikasi Sertifikasi HPI], Information available in Indonesian.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
Both Italian courts and consulates have the power to appoint as "official translators" (''traduttori giurati'' or ''ufficiali'') candidates who pass an examination or show proof of language proficiency (usually a university degree).

===Mexico===
There are, in [[Mexico]], two certifications for sworn translators: the local certification granted by the Superior Court of Justice corresponding to each of the 32 states and the one of the Superior Court of Justice corresponding to the federation. Both institutions establish that a [[written examination|written]] and [[speech communication|oral]] [[Test (assessment)|examination]] shall be passed for a translator to be recognized as an expert or "sworn" (certified) translator (''perito traductor''); this type of translator does not swear before the court to be authorized. Although the local certification is officially valid for only one of the 32 states, a translator from any of the states may work for a client from any of the states, provided that the client accepts the translator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsjdf.gob.mx/iej/peritos.html peritos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622093444/http://www.tsjdf.gob.mx/iej/peritos.html |date=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Bureau for Sworn Interpreters and Translators, a department of the Dutch Legal Aid Council that has been entrusted by the Ministry of Justice with various implementation tasks in respect of the Sworn Interpreters and Translators Act. They have two levels of accreditation however only the highest level has legal validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bureaubtv.nl/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215134200/http://www.bureaubtv.nl/en/ |archivedate=2015-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Candidates are certified by the Association of Government Authorized Translators,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statsaut-translator.no/website.aspx?objectid=1&amp;displayid=1205] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115221618/http://www.statsaut-translator.no/website.aspx?objectid=1&amp;displayid=1205 |date=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after they pass a very demanding examination. Successful candidates are then authorized by the Norwegian government to sign their translations, after the phrase "True Translation Certified." The Association was founded in 1913.

===Poland===
The standards of translation in Poland are regulated by a relevant department of the Ministry of Justice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ms.gov.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; and every translator wishing to provide such services must pass a state examination. Afterwards such a person is entered on an official list, issued with a stamp and recognized as a sworn translator. However, for ordinary translations (business, administration, correspondence) it is enough to have an independent expert in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polwords.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]], the translator must be authorized by the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]], and must use an original (or a sworn copy of an original) in his physical presence as his source text. The translator may only swear by his own translation. There is no requirement for an additional witness (such as a [[Notary public|notary]]) to attest to the [[authentication|authenticity]] of the translation.

===Spain===
Only sworn translators can do a sworn translation in Spain. To become a sworn translator in Spain for a combination of [[Castilian language|Castilian]] and another language, the candidate has to be certified by the Spanish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation]] as a "sworn translator and interpreter" (''traductor-intérprete jurado''). Then, the translator is required to register their stamp and signature with the Ministry, who includes the translator's data in a public list of sworn interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maec.es/es/MenuPpal/Ministerio/Tablondeanuncios/InterpretesJurados/Documents/IIJJ20090429.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521005233/http://www.maec.es/es/MenuPpal/Ministerio/Tablondeanuncios/InterpretesJurados/Documents/IIJJ20090429.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligibility can be achieved either through a state exam or by completing the degree studies of Translation and Interpretation in a Spanish University, provided that the translator has passed certain law-related subjects.

Sworn translators for combinations including the other three co-official languages of Spain ([[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) are certified by regional authorities following a similar procedure as the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

===Sweden===
The [[Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency]] is an official agency that authorizes interpreters and translators, who must pass a stringent examination arranged by the organization. Authorized translators hold a protected professional title, and their translations are considered legal and binding for all legal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kammarkollegiet.se/kammarkollegiet |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703053352/http://www.kammarkollegiet.se/kammarkollegiet |archivedate=2014-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
There is no such thing as a "sworn translator" in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iti.org.uk/about-industry/certification-sworn&lt;/ref&gt; However, individual translations may be certified, by a solicitor (or a notary in Scotland), not to guarantee the quality of the translation, but so that the translator can be identified and held accountable.

===United States of America===
The [[U.S. Department of Labor]], Bureau of Labor Statistics states: "''There is currently no universal form of certification required of interpreters and translators in the [[United States]], but there are a variety of different tests that workers can take to demonstrate proficiency.''" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos175.htm Interpreters and Translators&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011005403/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos175.htm |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Japan China Peace Treaty 17 April 1895.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Japanese version of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, 17 April 1895.]]
The {{nihongo|'''Treaty of Shimonoseki'''|下関条約|Shimonoseki Jōyaku|lead=yes}} was a treaty signed at the [[Shunpanrō]] hotel, [[Shimonoseki]], Japan on 17 April 1895, between the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing Empire]], ending the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. The peace conference took place from March 20 to 17 April 1895. This treaty followed and superseded the [[Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty]] of 1871.

==Treaty terms==
{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Treaty of Shimonoseki.png|thumb|The Shunpanrō hall where the Treaty of [[Shimonoseki]] was signed]]
*Article 1: China recognizes definitively the full and complete [[independence]] and autonomy of [[Korea]], and, in consequence, the payment of [[tribute]] and the performance of ceremonies and formalities by Korea to China, that are in [[derogation]] of such independence and autonomy, shall wholly cease for the future.
*Articles 2 &amp; 3: China [[cede]]s to Japan in perpetuity and full sovereignty of the [[Penghu|Pescadores]] group, [[Formosa]] (Taiwan) and the eastern portion of the bay of [[Liaodong Peninsula]] together with all fortifications, arsenals and public property.
*Article 4: China agrees to pay to Japan as a war indemnity the sum of 200,000,000 Kuping [[tael]]s ( 7,500,000 [[kilogram]]s/16,534,500 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s of silver ).
*Article 5: China opens [[Shashi District|Shashih]], [[Chongqing|Chungking]], [[Suzhou|Soochow]] and [[Hangzhou|Hangchow]] to Japan. Moreover, China is to grant Japan [[most favoured nation]] status for foreign trade. (which is equal to, not above, the trade relations granted to UK, US and France in 1843-44 and Russia in 1858)

The treaty ended the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894&amp;ndash;1895 as a clear victory for Japan. In this [[treaty]], China recognized the independence of Korea and renounced any claims to that country. It also ceded the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (then known to the Western press as ''Liaotung'', now southern part of modern [[Liaoning]] [[Provinces of China|province]]), and the islands of [[Formosa]] (Taiwan) and [[Penghu]] (also known as the Pescadores) to Japan. China also paid Japan a war indemnity of 200 million [[tael|Kuping taels]], payable over seven years, and the signing of a commercial treaty similar to ones previously signed by China with various western powers in the aftermath of the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s. This commercial treaty confirmed the opening of various ports and rivers to Japanese trade. As a result of the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895), China recognized the "full and complete independence and autonomy" of [[Joseon]]. In the next year [[Yeongeunmun]] was demolished leaving its two stone pillars.

===Value of the indemnity===
Qing China's indemnity to Japan of 200 million silver kuping taels, or about {{convert|240,000,000|ozt|t}}. After the [[Triple intervention]], they paid another 30 million taels for a total of over {{convert|276,000,000|ozt|t}} silver, worth about $5 billion US Dollars in 2015.{{efn|Assuming $18/oz, in 2015.}}

===The Treaty of Shimonoseki and Taiwan===
During the summit between Japanese and Qing representatives in March and April 1895, Prime Minister [[Hirobumi Ito]] and Foreign Minister [[Munemitsu Mutsu]] were serious about reducing the power of Qing Dynasty on not only the Korean Peninsula but also the Taiwan islands. Moreover, Mutsu had already noticed its importance in order to expand Japanese military power towards South China and Southeast Asia. It was also the age of imperialism, so Japan wished to mimic what the Western nations were doing. Imperial Japan was seeking colonies and resources in the Korean Peninsula and Mainland China to compete with the presence of Western powers at that time. This was the way the Japanese leadership chose to illustrate how fast Imperial Japan had advanced compared to the West since the 1867 Meiji Restoration, and the extent it wanted to amend the [[unequal treaties]] that were held in the [[Far East]] by the Western powers.

At the peace conference between Imperial Japan and Qing Dynasty, [[Li Hongzhang]] and [[Li Jingfang]], the ambassadors at the negotiation desk of Qing Dynasty, originally did not plan to cede Taiwan because they also realised Taiwan's great location for trading with the West. Therefore, even though the Qing had lost wars against Britain and France in the 19th century, the Qing Emperor was serious about keeping Taiwan under its rule, which began in 1683. On 20 March 1895, at Shunpanrō ({{lang|ja|春帆楼}}) in Shimonoseki in Japan, a one month long peace conference began.

At the first half of the conference, Ito and Li talked mainly about a cease-fire agreement, and during the second half of the conference, the contents of the peace treaty were discussed. Ito and Mutsu claimed that yielding the full sovereignty of Taiwan was an absolute condition and requested Li to hand over full sovereignty of [[Penghu Islands]] and the eastern portion of the bay of [[Liaodong Peninsula]]. Li Hongzhang refused on the grounds that Taiwan had never been a battlefield during the first Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895. By the final stage of the conference, while Li Hongzhang agreed to the transfer of full sovereignty of the Penghu islands and the eastern portion of the bay of Liaodong Peninsula to Imperial Japan, he still refused to hand over Taiwan. As Taiwan had been a province since 1885, Li stated, "Taiwan is [[Taiwan Province (Qing)|already a province]], and therefore not to be given away ({{lang|zh|臺灣已立一行省，不能送給他國}})."
 
However, Imperial Japan was too strong for the Qing Dynasty to cope with, and eventually Li gave Taiwan up. On 17 April 1895, the peace treaty between Imperial Japan and the Qing Dynasty had been signed and was followed by the successful [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|Japanese invasion of Taiwan]]. This had a huge impact on Taiwan, the turning over of the island to Imperial Japan marking the end of 200 years of [[Taiwan under Qing Dynasty rule|Qing rule]] despite an [[Republic of Formosa|attempt by Qing loyalists to prevent the annexation]].

==Signatories and diplomats==
[[File:《马关条约》签字时的情景.jpg|thumb|left|Signing of Treaty of Shimonoseki]]
The treaty was drafted with [[John W. Foster]], former American Secretary of State, advising the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing Empire]]. It was signed by Count [[Itō Hirobumi]] and Viscount [[Mutsu Munemitsu]] for the [[Emperor of Japan]] and [[Li Hongzhang]] and [[Li Jingfang]] on behalf of the [[Emperor of China]]. Before the treaty was signed, [[Li Hongzhang]] was attacked by a right-wing Japanese extremist on March&amp;nbsp;24: he was fired at and wounded on his way back to his lodgings at Injoji temple. The public outcry aroused by the assassination attempt caused the Japanese to temper their demands and agree to a temporary armistice. The conference was temporarily adjourned and resumed on April&amp;nbsp;10.

==Aftermath==

===Entry of the Western powers===
The conditions imposed by Japan on China led to the [[Triple Intervention]] of Russia, France, and Germany, western powers all active in China, with established enclaves and ports, just six days after its signing. They demanded that Japan withdraw its claim on the [[Liaodong peninsula]], concerned that [[Lüshun]], then called Port Arthur by Westerners, would fall under Japanese control. [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] (a [[de jure]] ally of France) and his imperial advisors, including his cousin-advisor-friend-rival [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II of Germany]], had designs on Port Arthur, which could serve as Russia's long sought-after 'ice-free' port.

[[File:Convention of retrocession of the Liatung Peninsula 8 November 1895.jpg|thumb|left|Convention of retrocession of the [[Liaotung peninsula]], 8 November 1895]]
Under threat of war from three Western [[political power]]s, in November 1895, Japan &amp;mdash; a weaker emerging nation not yet perceived as even a regional power &amp;mdash; returned control of the territory and withdrew its ''de jure'' claim on the [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaotung peninsula]] in return for an increased war indemnity from China of 30 million [[Taels]]. At that time, the European powers were not concerned with any of the other conditions, or the free hand Japan had been granted in Korea under the other terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. This would prove to be a mistake, as Japan would end up occupying Korea by 1905 and expand into Russia's sphere of influence with the [[Russo-Japanese war]], and then encroach upon Germany's port in [[Shandong]] during World War I.

Within months after Japan re-ceded the Liaodong peninsula, Russia started construction on the peninsula and a railway to Harbin from [[Lushun|Port Arthur]], despite a protesting [[Qing Dynasty|China]]. Eventually, Russia agreed to offer a diplomatic solution (See [[Kwantung Leased Territory]]) to the Chinese Empire, and agreed to a token lease of the region to save face, instead of annexing [[Manchuria]] outright, its [[de facto]] effect. Within two years, Germany, France, and Great Britain had similarly taken advantage of the economic and political opportunities in the weak Chinese Empire, each taking control of significant local regions. Japan also took note of how the international community allowed the great powers to treat weaker nation states, and continued its remarkable measures to bootstrap itself into a modern industrial state and military power, with great success as it would demonstrate in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] less than a decade later.

In Taiwan, pro-Qing officials and elements of the local gentry declared a [[Republic of Formosa]] in 1895, but failed to win international recognition.

In China, the Treaty was considered a national humiliation by the bureaucracy and greatly weakened support for the Qing dynasty.  The previous decades of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] were considered to be a failure, and support grew for more radical changes in China's political and social systems which led to [[Hundred Days' Reform]] in 1898. When the latter movement failed due to resistance from the Manchu nobility, a series of uprisings culminated in the fall of the Qing dynasty itself in 1911.

The [[Triple Intervention]] is regarded by many Japanese historians as being a crucial historic turning point in Japanese foreign affairs &amp;ndash; from this point on, the nationalist, expansionist, and militant elements began to join ranks and steer Japan from a foreign policy based mainly on economic hegemony toward outright imperialism &amp;mdash; a case of ''the coerced'' turning increasingly ''to coercion''.

Both the [[Republic of China]], now controlling Taiwan, and the [[China|People's Republic of China]], now controlling mainland China consider that the provisions of the treaty transferring Taiwan to Japan to have been reversed by the [[Instrument of Surrender of Japan]]. Additionally, it is alleged that on 28 April 1952 the contents of the Treaty of Shimonoseki treaty were formally nullified through what is commonly known as the [[Treaty of Taipei]] with the Republic of China. However, {{harvp|Ng|1972}} argues that only those provisions of the 1895 treaty which had not yet been fulfilled in their entirety could be subject to nullification. The cession provision which had already been carried out was no longer existent and, therefore, could no longer be subjected to nullification. In support of this reasoning, Ng points to the reparations provision of Article IV of the 1895 treaty, as well as additional reparations provisions from earlier Sino-Japanese agreements &amp; treaties. These were all regarded as "fulfilled provisions" and not subject to later nullification or cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.taiwanbasic.com/lawjrn/historical-legal2c.htm |title=Historical and Legal Aspects of the International Status of Taiwan (Formosa) |last=Ng |first=Yuzin Chiautong  |authorlink=Ng Chiau-tong |publisher=World United Formosans for Independence |place=Tokyo |year=1972 |edition=2nd |lccn=74165355 |accessdate=2010-02-25 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Republic of China does not recognize the Treaty of Taipei.

===Prelude to war===
Russia wasted little time after the Triple Intervention to move men and materials down into the Liaodong to start building a railroad from both ends &amp;mdash; Port Arthur and Harbin, as it already had railway construction in progress across northern Inner Manchuria to shorten the rail route to Russia's principal Pacific Ocean naval base at [[Vladivostok]], a port closed by ice four months of each year. Russia also improved the port facilities at Port Arthur and founded a commercial town nearby at Dalniy (modern-day [[Dalian]], which now encompasses Port Arthur in its jurisdiction), before inking the [[Kwantung Leased Territory|lease of the territory]].

When the de facto governance of Port Arthur and the Liaodong peninsula was granted de jure to Russia by China along with an increase in other rights she had obtained in Manchuria (especially those in [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] provinces) the construction of the 550 mile Southern spurline of the [[Manchurian Railway]] was redoubled. Russia finally seemed to have gotten what the [[Russian Empire]] had been wanting in its quest to become a global power since the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. This ice-free natural harbor of Port Arthur/Lüshun would serve to make Russia a great [[Sea power|sea]] as well as the largest land power. Russia needed this [[ice-free port]] to achieve world power status as it was tired of being blocked by the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] politics in Europe (The Ottoman Empire and its allies had repeatedly frustrated Russian power fruition).

However, the omission of the geopolitical reality in ignoring the free hand Japan had been granted by the Treaty (of Shimonoseki) with respect to Korea and Taiwan was short-sighted of Russia with respect to its strategic goals; to get to and maintain a strong point in Port Arthur Russia would have to dominate and control many additional hundreds of miles of Eastern Manchuria (the [[Fengtian province]] of Imperial China, modern [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]]) up to [[Harbin]]. Japan had long considered the lands paralleling the whole Korean border as part of its strategic [[Sphere of Influence]]. By leasing ''Liaodong'' and railway concessions, Russia crashed its Sphere of Influence squarely into Japan's.

This acted as a further goad to emerging Japanese anger at their disrespectful treatment by all the West. In the immediate fallout of the ''Triple Intervention'', Japanese popular resentment at Russia's deviousness and the perceived weakness of its own government caving in to foreign pressure led to riots in Tokyo. The disturbance almost brought down the government, as well as a strengthening of imperial and expansionist factions within Japan. The Russian spear into the sphere also brought about the ensuing struggle with Russia for dominance in Korea and Manchuria. These events eventually led to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904&amp;ndash;1905 by a renewed and modernized Japanese military, which led to a major defeat for Russia that marked the beginning of the end for the Romanov dynasty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">'''Treaty of Wuchale''' (or, '''Treaty of Ucciale'''; in Italian, '''Trattato di Uccialli''') was a treaty signed by King [[Menelik&amp;nbsp;II]] of [[Shewa]], later the Emperor of [[Ethiopia]] with Count [[Pietro Antonelli]] of [[Italy]] in the town of [[Wuchale]], Ethiopia, on 2 May 1889. The treaty stated that the regions of [[Bogos]], [[Hamasien]], [[Akkele Guzay]], and [[Serae]] were part of the Italian colony of Eritrea and is the origin of the Italian colony and modern state of [[Eritrea]]. Per the Treaty, Italy promised financial assistance and military supplies.

The contents of Article 3 of the treaty state the following: &lt;ref&gt;
                 TREATY OF WUCHALE
                      UMBERTO I
          BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE WILL OF THE COUNTRY
                    KING OF ITALY&lt;/ref&gt;

Art. 3. To remove any ambiguity about the limits of the territories over which the two Contracting
Parties shall exercise the rights of sovereignty, a special committee composed of two Italian delegates
and two Ethiopians will trace on the ground with appropriate signs a permanent boundary line
whose benchmarks are established as follows:&lt;br /&gt;

a) The line of the plateau will mark the Italian-Ethiopian border;&lt;br /&gt;

b) Starting from the region Arafali, Halai, Saganeiti and Asmara are villages in the Italian border;&lt;br /&gt;

c) Adi Adi Nefas and Joannes will be on the side of Bogos in the Italian border;&lt;br /&gt;

d) From Adi Joannes a straight line extended from east to west will mark the border between Italy and Ethiopia.

Disputes over Article 17 regarding the conduct of foreign affairs led to the [[First Italo–Ethiopian War]]. The [[Italian language|Italian]] version stated that Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities, in effect making Ethiopia an Italian [[protectorate]], while the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] version gave Ethiopia considerable autonomy, with the option of communicating with third powers through the Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Discussions include Chris Prouty, ''Empress Taytu and Menilek&amp;nbsp;II'' (Trenton, NJ: The Red Sea Press, 1986), pp. 70-99; Marcus G. Harold, ''The Life and Times of Menelik&amp;nbsp;II: Ethiopia 1844-1913'' (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1995), pp. 111–134; and Hatem Elliesie, ''Amharisch als diplomatische Sprache im Völkervertragsrecht'', ''Aethiopica (International Journal of Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies)'', 11, (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2008), pp. 235-244.&lt;/ref&gt; The misunderstanding, according to the Italians, was due to the mistranslation of a [[verb]], which formed a permissive [[clause]] in [[Amharic language|Amharic]] and a mandatory one in [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Languages of Diplomacy: Towards a Fairer Distribution|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy|newspaper=The Economist|date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[War crime|war crimes]] trial''' is the trial of persons charged with criminal violation of the [[laws and customs of war]] and related principles of [[international law]] committed during [[armed conflict]].

==History==
{{Generalize|section|date=July 2010}}
The trial of [[Peter von Hagenbach]] by an [[ad hoc]] tribunal of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1474, was the first “international” war crimes trials and also of [[command responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.ch/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQ2X The evolution of individual criminal responsibility under international law] By Edoardo Greppi, Associate Professor of International Law at the [[University of Turin]], [[Italy]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] No. 835, p. 531-553, October 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/alumni/bulletin/2006/spring/gallery.php|title=Alumni - Harvard Law School|first=Harvard Law|last=School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbach was put on trial for atrocities committed during the occupation of [[Breisach]], found guilty, and beheaded.&lt;ref name="Schabas"&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/81258/excerpt/9780521881258_excerpt.pdf An Introduction to the International Criminal Court] William A. Schabas, [[Cambridge University Press]], Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Since he was convicted for crimes, "he as a knight was deemed to have a duty to prevent", although Hagenbach defended himself by arguing that he was [[superior orders|only following orders]] from the [[Duke of Burgundy]], [[Charles the Bold]], to whom the Holy Roman Empire had given Breisach.

In 1865, [[Henry Wirz]], a Confederate officer, was held accountable and hanged for appalling conditions at [[Andersonville Prison]] where many Union soldiers died during the [[American Civil War]].

After [[World War I]], a small number of German personnel were tried by a German court in the [[Leipzig War Crimes Trials]] for crimes allegedly committed during that war.

Article 227 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the peace treaty between [[Germany]] and the Allied Powers after the [[First World War]], “publicly arraign[ed] [[Kaiser Wilhelm II|William II of Hohenzollern]], formerly German Emperor, for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/versa/versa6.html|title=Peace Treaty of Versailles, Articles 227-230,   Penalties|website=net.lib.byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Kaiser had escaped to the Netherlands, however, and despite demands for his extradition having been made, the Dutch refused to surrender him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ww1ieper1917.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/netherlands-refuses-to-extradite-kaiser-wilhelm-to-the-allies-23rd-jan-1920/|title=The Netherlands refuses to extradite Kaiser Wilhelm to the Allies 23rd Jan 1920.|first=|last=ww1ieper1917|date=23 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was not brought to trial. Germany, as a signatory to the treaty, thus was placed on notice as to what might occur in the event of a subsequent war.{{cn|date=October 2018}}
 
After [[World War II]], the phrase referred usually to the trials of [[Germany|German]] and [[Japan]]ese leaders in [[court]]s established by the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] nations.

The most important of these trials were held in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]], under the authority of two legal instruments. One, the [[London Charter]] was signed by representatives of the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and the [[USSR]] in [[London]] on August 8, 1945; the other, [[Law No. 10]], was promulgated by the [[Allied Control Council]] in [[Berlin]] on December 20, 1945.

The London Charter provided for the establishment of the [[International Military Tribunal]], composed of one [[judge]] and one alternate judge from each of the signatory nations, to try [[war criminals]]. Under the London Charter, the [[crimes]] charged against [[defendants]] fell into three categories: [[crimes against peace]], that is, crimes involving the planning, initiating, and [[War of aggression|waging a war of aggression]]; [[war crimes]], that is, violations of the laws and customs of war as embodied in the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] and generally recognized by [[military]] forces of civilized nations; and [[crimes against humanity]], such as the [[genocide|extermination]] of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[ethnic]], and [[religious]] groups and other such atrocities against [[civilians]].

On October 8, 1945, [[Anton Dostler]] was the first [[General (Germany)|German general]] to be tried for war crimes by a U.S. [[military tribunal]] at the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]] in [[Caserta]]. He was accused of ordering the killing of 15 captured U.S. soldiers of [[Operations Ginny I and II|Operation Ginny II]] in Italy in March 1944. He admitted into ordering the execution but said that he cannot be held responsible because he was just [[Superior orders|following orders]] from his superiors. The execution of 15 U.S. [[prisoners of war]] in Italy ordered by Dostler was an implementation of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Commando Order]] of 1942 which required the immediate execution of all [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[commandos]], whether in proper uniforms or not, without trial if apprehended by German forces. The tribunal rejected the defense of Superior Orders and found Dostler guilty of war crimes. He was sentenced to death and [[Execution by firing squad|executed by a firing squad]] on December 1, 1945, in [[Aversa]].

The Dostler case became precedent for the [[Nuremberg war crime trials|Nuremberg trials]] of German generals, officials, and Nazi leaders beginning in November 1945 that using Superior orders as a defense does not relieve officers from responsibility of carrying out illegal orders and liable to be punished in court. This principle was codified in [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Principle IV]] of the [[Nuremberg Principles]] and similar principle were found in sections of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

===Nuremberg trials===
{{main|Nuremberg trials}}
[[Image:nurembergdefendants.jpg|frame|right|The defendants at the Nuremberg War Crime Trial in Nuremberg, Germany]]On October 18, 1945, the chief [[prosecutors]] lodged an [[indictment]] with the [[tribunal]] charging 24 individuals with a variety of crimes and atrocities, including the deliberate instigation of aggressive wars, extermination of racial and religious groups, [[murder]] and [[mistreatment]] of [[prisoners of war]], and the [[murder]], [[mistreatment]], and [[deportation]] of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of [[countries]] occupied by Germany during the war.

Among the accused were the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nationalist Socialist]] leaders [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Rudolf Hess]], the [[diplomat]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the [[arms industry|munitions maker]] [[Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach]], [[Field Marshal|Marshal]] [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Grand [[Admiral]] [[Erich Raeder]] and 18 other [[military leaders]] and civilian [[officials]]. Seven organizations that formed part of the basic structure of the [[Nazi]] [[government]] were also charged as [[criminal]]. These organizations included the SS ([[Schutzstaffel]], ''Defense Corps''), the [[Gestapo]] ([[Geheime Staatspolizei]], ''Secret State Police''), and the SA ([[Sturmabteilung]], ''Storm Troops''), as well as the [[General Staff]] and High Command of the German [[armed forces]].

The trial began on November 20, 1945. Much of the [[evidence]] submitted by the [[prosecution]] consisted of original military, [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], and other government documents that fell into the hands of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] after the collapse of the German government.

The judgment of the International Military Tribunal was handed down on September 30-October 1, 1946. Among notable features of the decision was the conclusion, in accordance with the London Agreement, that to plan or instigate an aggressive war is a crime under the principles of international law. The tribunal rejected the contention of the [[Defense (legal)|defense]] that such acts had not previously been defined as crimes under international law and that therefore the condemnation of the [[defendants]] would violate the principle of [[justice]] prohibiting [[ex post facto]] [[punishments]]. As with the Dostler case, it also rejected the contention of a number of the defendants that they were not legally responsible for their acts because they performed the acts under the orders of superior authority, stating that "''the true test . . . is not the existence of the order but whether moral choice (in executing it) was in fact possible''."

With respect to war crimes and crimes against humanity, the tribunal found overwhelming evidence of a systematic rule of [[violence]], brutality, and [[terrorism]] by the German government in the [[Territory (administrative division)|territories]] occupied by its forces. Millions of persons were murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]], many of which were equipped with [[gas chambers]] for the extermination of [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]], and members of other ethnic or religious groups. Under the [[slave-labor]] [[policy]] of the German government, at least 5 million persons had been forcibly deported from their homes to Germany. Many of them died because of [[inhumane]] treatment. The tribunal also found that atrocities had been committed on a large scale and as a matter of official policy.

Of the seven indicted organizations, the tribunal declared criminal the [[Leadership Corps]] of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist Party]], the SS, the SD ([[Sicherheitsdienst]], ''Security Service''), and the Gestapo.

==Ad hoc tribunals==

In May 1993, during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] following the massive war crimes, and acts of "ethnic cleansing" in the former Yugoslavia by Bosnian-Serb forces, the United Nations established the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]], to try war criminals of all nationalities. The crimes indicted included grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]], [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[genocide]]. It was the first international tribunal since the Nuremberg Trials to do so. In 1994, the UN opened the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] following the April–June genocide in that country of Hutu nationals. In the ICTY nearly 161 individuals were indicted: 68% of Serb ethnicity. Croatian-Serb, Bosnian-Serb, Serbian, and Bosnian-Croat officials were convicted of crimes against humanity, and Bosnian-Serb leaders of genocide. It was the first tribunal in which [[sexual assault]] was prosecuted as a war crime. The tribunals, while effective in prosecution of individuals, proved to be a costly venture, and exposed the need for a permanent tribunal, which was eventually known as the [[International Criminal Court]].
