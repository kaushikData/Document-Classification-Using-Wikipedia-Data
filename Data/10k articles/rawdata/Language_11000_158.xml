      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1280">'''Aodh mac Diarmada Mac an Bhaird''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]], {{floruit}} {{circa}} 1200–1600.

Aodh was a member of the [[Mac an Bhaird]] bardic family of [[County Galway]] and [[County Donegal]].

Only one extant poem ''Le héanmhnaoi cuirthear clú ban'', has been safely attributed to Aodh. It begins:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;font-style:italic"&gt;
Le héanmhnaoi cuirthear clú ban
a clú ó choimmeas ga cur;
ní ríomh do-chóidh ar a crodh;
i ndíol sgol is dóigh a dhul.
&lt;/poem&gt;

It mentions the MacMahon of [[Airgialla]] which may indicate personal knowledge of the clan and kingdom.

'''BORSCHT''' is an [[acronym]] for the set of functions performed by a subscriber line interface circuit (SLIC) in the [[line card]] of a [[telecommunication]] system. The letters represent the following functions:
battery feed (B), over-voltage protection (O), [[Ringing (telephony)|ringing]] (R), [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]] (S), coding (C), hybrid (H), and test (T).&lt;ref&gt;Whitham R. Reeve (1995) ''Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook—Digital'',  IEEE Press, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier or alternate version of the acronym is '''BORSHT''', lacking the letter ''C'' for the coding function.&lt;ref&gt;John C. McDonald (ed.) ''Fundamentals of Digital Switching'', Plenum Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-306-41224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
;Battery feed: The central office provides a DC voltage level of nominally 48 V between the [[tip and ring]] conductors for talk and signaling current. The available DC current may range from 15 mA to 80 mA&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, J &amp; Miller, G (2008) ''Modern Electronic Communications'',  9th Edition ''PG 499'' {{ISBN|978-0-13-225113-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.
;Over-voltage protection: Aerial lines may be struck by lightning or falling power lines, consequently arrestors such as gas tubes and carbon blocks are used in the central office to reduce the voltage. However the line card must typically be able to withstand 1000 volt spikes.
;Ringing: The ringing voltage is typically 86 V (RMS) at a frequency of 20 Hz, 2 seconds ON, 4 seconds OFF. Some selective frequency systems used frequencies as low as 16 Hz and as high as 66 Hz for station selection.
;Signaling: Signaling is often referred to as ''supervision''. The circuit detects the on-hook and off-hook conditions by monitoring the loop current. In rotary dial systems, it decodes dial pulses. It includes decoding of [[dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF) dialing, hook flash, and other signals.
;Coding: Coding includes [[%CE%9C-law_algorithm|µ-Law coding]] in North America and [[A-law_algorithm|A-Law coding]] in Europe. This includes the [[Analog-to-digital_converter|A/D and D/A conversion]], [[companding]] and framing for [[time-division multiplexing]].
;Hybrid: The hybrid function involves two-wire to four-wire circuit conversions. This was originally performed by a hybrid transformer (induction coil) but has largely been superseded by DSP devices.
;Test: External tests allow the local loop and handset to be directly connected to test equipment in the central office. Loop-in tests could measure the input return loss (IRL). Loop-around tests measure the hybrid and codec performance.

'''Bilingual education''' involves teaching academic content in two languages, in a native and secondary language with varying amounts of each language used in accordance with the program model.Bilingual education refers to the utilization of two languages as means of instruction for students and considered part of or the entire school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum_handbook/413/chapters/Bilingual_Education@_Effective_Programming_for_Language-Minority_Students.aspx|title=Bilingual Education: Effective Programming for Language-Minority Students|last=ASCD|website=ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual education program models==
The following are several different types of bilingual education program models:
*[[Transitional bilingual education|Transitional Bilingual Education]]. This involves education in a child's native language, typically for no more than three years, to ensure that students do not fall behind in content areas like mathematics, science, and social studies while they are learning English. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. The goal is to help students transition to mainstream, English-only classrooms as quickly as possible, and the linguistic goal of such programs is English acquisition only. In a transitional bilingual program, the student's primary language is used as a vehicle to develop literacy skills and acquire academic knowledge. It is used to develop literacy and academic skills in the primary language
* '''Two-Way''' or '''Dual Language Immersion''' Bilingual Education. Dual Language or Two-Way Immersion education refers to programs that provide grade-level content and literacy instruction to all students through two languages, English and a partner language. These programs are designed to help native and non-native English speakers become bilingual and biliterate. There are four main types of dual language programs, these programs refer to how a student would best learn with Dual Language Immersion based on their previous language skills.
**'''Developmental, or maintenance bilingual programs.''' These programs enroll students who are native speakers of the partner language to learn English.
**'''Bilingual immersion programs.''' This program enrolls both native English speaker and native speakers of the partner language.
**'''Foreign language Immersion.''' This program primarily enrolls students who speak English as their native language.
**'''Heritage language programs.''' These programs enroll students who primarily dominant in english, but a close relative (parents, grandparents) speak the partner language.
**There are two basic models for Dual Language Immersion The first model is '''90/10 model'''. The two-way bilingual immersion program has 90% of the instructions in grade K-1 in minority language which is less supported by the broader society and 10% in the majority language . This proportion gradually changes in the majority language until the curriculum is equally divided in both languages by 5th grade.  The two-way bilingual immersion program is based on the principle of clear curriculum separation of the two languages of instruction. Teachers do not repeat or translate the subject matter in second language but strengthen concepts taught in one language across the two languages in a spiral curriculum in order to provide cognitive challenge(Thomas &amp; Collier. 1997). The languages of instructions are alternated by theme or content area.  This type of immersion is required to develop the dual language proficiency, as social language can be mastered in couple of years, but a higher level of competency is required to read social studies texts or solve mathematics word problems, roughly around 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987). The goal of gradually increasing the majority of the language is for instruction to become 50% of English and 50% of the partner language. The second model is the '''50/50 model'''. In the 50/50 model English and the partner language are used equally throughout the program.

The United States Congress introduced the Bilingual Act in 1968 defining bilingual education’s term program. This program of instruction is intended for children who are not fully proficient in the English language. Instructions are given so pupils can achieve the necessary competence in English as well as their native languages taking into consideration the children’s cultural heritage. This could be integrated into the subjects or courses of study enabling the students to grow effectively throughout the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.uslegal.com/bilingualism/landmark-legislation/bilingual-education-act-1968/|title=Bilingual Education Act (1968) – Education|last=Inc.|first=US Legal|website=education.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1968) was another meaningful measure for bilingual education. Title VII (Bilingual Education Act) created federal guidelines for bilingual education. The decree recognized the “''Special educational needs of the large numbers children of limited English-speaking ability in the United States''.” Said Enactment specified the federal government’s obligation to provide subsidy for creative bilingual programs. Title VII was amended many times since its introduction. The decree became part of the America Schools Act in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/transitional-bilingual-education-programs-pros-cons.html|title=Transitional Bilingual Education Programs: Pros &amp; Cons {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual Immersion classrooms encourage students but with the permission it may be enthusiastic &amp;' native language development, making an important contribution to heritage language maintenance and allows language minority students to remain in classrooms with their native English-speaking peers, resulting in linguistic and socio-cultural advantages (Christian, 1996b). As of May 2005, there were 317 dual immersion programs operating in elementary schools in the United States in 10 different languages(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005).

Dual Language programs are less common in US schools, although research indicates they are extremely effective in helping students learn English well and aiding the long-term performance of English learners in school. Native English speakers benefit by learning a second language. English language learners (ELLs) are not segregated from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005; Thomas &amp; Collier, 1997; Lindholm-Leary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; These students are taught in their mother tongue yet still in the typical 'American' classroom they need to be in, for both cognitive and social benefits. 
* Another form of Bilingual Education is a type of '''Dual Language''' program that has students study in two different ways: 1) A variety of academic subjects are taught in the students' second language, with specially trained bilingual teachers who can understand students when they ask questions in their native language, but always answer in the second language; and 2) Native language literacy classes improve students' writing and higher-order language skills in their first language. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. In this type of program, the native language classes do not teach academic subjects. The second-language classes are content-based, rather than grammar-based, so students learn all of their academic subjects in the second language.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlenm.org/what-is-dual-language-education.aspx|title=What is Dual Language Education?|website=dlenm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dual language is a type of bilingual education where students learn about reading and writing in two languages. In the United States, majority of programs are English and Spanish but new partner languages have emerged lately such as Japanese, Korean, French, Mandarin, and Arabic. The concept of Dual Language promotes bilingualism, improved awareness of cultural diversity, and higher levels of academic achievement by means of lessons in two languages.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"/&gt; 
* '''Late-Exit''' or '''Developmental''' Bilingual Education. Education is in the child's native language for an extended duration, accompanied by education in English. The goal is to develop literacy in the child's native language first, and transfer these skills to the second language. This education is ideal for many English learning students, but in many instances the resources for such education are not available.

==Myths surrounding bilingual education==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around bilingual education. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most entrenched misconceptions:&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities  |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=21  |issue=6  |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all her/his languages;
* childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* exposing a child to more than one tongue may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
*children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.

These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt; yet still persist among many parents. It is important to understand what constitutes the decision for sending children to a bilingual school. The decision should be based on, appropriate age, curriculum, and the preference of the child.&lt;ref name="biling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Racoma|first=Bernadine|title=The Pros and Cons of Sending Your Kids to a Bilingual School|url=https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/2014/03/the-pros-and-cons-of-sending-your-kids-to-a-bilingual-school-3924|website=Day Translations|date=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=June 2017|certain=y}}

In spite of these myths surrounding language education, there are numerous significant benefits to a child's development when exposed to secondary language education. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages has identified over twenty benefits to a child's development when provided adequate secondary language education, therefore debunking the vast majority of myths that may inhibit such education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crane |first1=John |title=When Will Public Elementary Schools in the US Finally Start Teaching Foreign Languages? |url=https://medium.com/@jcrane1/when-will-public-elementary-schools-in-the-us-finally-start-teaching-foreign-languages-6cbc2716161b |website=Medium.com |accessdate=16 November 2018|date=2018-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==By country or region==

===Africa===
In the African region, Countries such as Mozambique have taken the lead in bilingual education. The Ministry of Education and Human Development has made primary education fully bilingual in 2017. Children will be taught 16 Mozambican dialects during their early years of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201503190228.html|title=Mozambique: Fully Bilingual Primary Education as From 2017|date=2015-03-19|work=Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (Maputo)|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African states introduce mother languages as subjects and education tools along commonly spoken international or foreign languages. Mother language instruction is terminated immediately during the schooling cycle and leaves only the international language established. It becomes a disadvantage that contributes to substantial lack of motivation on the part of teachers, students, and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/mother-language-education-africa|title=Mother language education in Africa|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{expand section|date=May 2016|1=e.g., [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-30424-3_122], [http://www.edqual.org/publications/published-research/clegg07.pdf.1], [http://www.praesa.org.za/files/2012/07/Paper6.pdf], [https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/C413%20Juba%20Publication_FINAL_WEB%20ONLY%20v3.pdf], [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMoWyso1vuQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIIzAA], [https://books.google.com/books?id=D6iIlllyNCEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIRTAG], etc.}}

====Senegal====
Although bilingual schools exist, the majority of Senegalese schools teach in French and follow the French system. However, studies have shown that approximately 80% of teachers use a 'local language' in order to communicate with all of their students.&lt;ref name="World Data on Education, Senegal"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. International Bureau of Education. [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Senegal.pdf "World Data on Education, Senegal"]. UNESCO-IBE, 2010. Web. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[Asia]] is the [[Earth|Earth's]] largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s. It includes a large number of countries, some of which are grouped into subregions.

====China====
In the [[Autonomous regions of China]] many children of the country's major ethnic minorities attend public schools where the medium of instructions is the local language, such as e.g. [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] or [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Traditionally, the textbooks there were little different from merely a translated version of the books used in the Chinese schools throughout the country; however, as of 2001, a move was on foot to create more teaching materials with locally based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

|author= Minglang Zhou, Hongkai Sun
|publisher= Springer|year= 2004
|isbn= 978-1-4020-8038-8|pages =119–120}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as second language are also offered in these minority schools, and the central government makes increasing efforts to make them more effective. A law passed in February 2001 provided for the Mandarin-as-second-language classes in the ethnic-minority schools to start in the early years of elementary school whenever local conditions permit, rather than in the senior years of elementary school, as it was practiced before.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been reported that Chinese has been used as the medium of instructions in some [[Autonomous county|autonomous counties]] even though less than 50% of the population "spoke and understood some Chinese"; this mismatch was thought to have contributed to the low grades earned by the students on the math and Chinese exams.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hong Kong =====
In [[Hong Kong]] where both [[English language|English]] and [[Cantonese]] are official, both languages are taught in school and are mandatory subjects. Either English or Cantonese is used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. Increasingly, there are a large number of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]-speaking schools in operation throughout Hong Kong as well since 1996. Study of Mandarin is mandatory in junior years (from Grade 1 to Grade 9). Hong Kong also has a bilingual education program using both Cantonese and Hong Kong Sign Language.

=====Macao=====
Chinese and Portuguese are the official languages of [[Macau]], but English plays an unofficial and highly prominent role. English is the language of instruction at the University of Macau and at some secondary schools. Other schools use Cantonese as the language of instruction. {{as of|2013}} there was one Portuguese-medium school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageonthemove.com/multilingual-macau/|title=Multilingual Macau|date=April 22, 2013|publisher=languageonthemove.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{More citations needed|date=March 2007}}
In Japan, the need for bilingualism (mostly Japanese and English) has been pointed out, and there are some scholars who advocate teaching children subjects such as mathematics using English rather than Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japansociology.com/2013/06/08/bilingual-education-in-japan/|title=Bilingual Education in Japan|date=2013-06-08|work=JAPANsociology|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this proposal, subjects such as history, however, would be taught solely in Japanese.

On the island of [[Hokkaido]], the indigenous and endangered [[Ainu language]] is receiving newfound interest with establishment of a small number of bilingual Ainu-Japanese elementary schools.

The largest non-Japanese, non-native to Japan minority are the [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]]. Bilingual education in [[Korean language]] is provided by Korean international schools, more of which are affiliated with [[Chongryon]].

====Middle East====

=====The Arab World=====
Schools in the [[Middle East]] follow dual or triple language programmes.  The triple language programme is most commonly found in [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], [[Syria]], and often implemented as well in [[Egypt]].  History, grammar, literature and the [[Arabic language]] are taught in the native language (Arabic), whereas Mathematics and sciences are generally taught in English and/or French.  In Lebanon, however, science and mathematics are taught in either French or English, depending on the school's administration or the grade level.  It is not uncommon to find French- or English- only schools, though usually these institutions are primarily international establishments.

In most [[Gulf countries]] as well as [[Jordan]], English is introduced as a second language early on alongside the primary medium of instruction, Arabic.  In [[Iraq]] however, triple language programmes are, like in Lebanon and Syria, normal, except rather than using French, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is taught alongside Arabic and English due to Iraq's considerably sized Kurdish minority in the north, and bilingual official language policy regarding Kurdish.

In [[Morocco]], [[Berber languages|Berber]] can be used as a regional medium of elementary education, with widespread use of French and Arabic in higher grades. Due to Morocco's history of French colonialism, sole French-medium education is very widespread.

=====Israel=====
Normally, Israelis are taught in either Hebrew or Arabic depending on religion and ethnicity. Within the standard education system, thorough study of English is compulsory, and depending on the primary medium of education, Arabic or Hebrew are introduced as third languages with significantly lesser emphasis placed on achieving solid proficiency.  Within Hebrew-medium programmes, other foreign languages such as French, German, Russian, or Yiddish can often be studied as well.

Israel is also home to several international schools whereby the sole medium of education is either [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. In general, as English is taught early on across all Israeli schools, most Israelis become comfortably bilingual, much like what one would see in The Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. This in combination with a large proportion of English-language programming on television that is merely subtitled and seldom dubbed.

Recent peace initiatives have also led to a small number of bilingual and multi-religious schools in which both Hebrew and Arabic are used in equal emphasis.  The [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]] runs four bilingual schools, and the [[Neve Shalom]] peace village also hosts a local school.

====Mongolia====
There has been long standing encouragement to teach at least one other language other than Mongolian. Traditionally [[Russian language]] was taught during middle school and high school. After the 1990 transition to democracy, English language has been gaining more ground in Mongolian schools. Today many public schools at all levels teach one other language that are usually English, Russian, Korean, Japanese or Chinese. Although the core curriculum is in Mongolian, it is generally encouraged by the government and the public that the students should have some command of a secondary language when they graduate from high school. Also there are other private schools that teach their curricula in English.

====South Asia====
[[South Asia]] is the [[south]]ern [[region]] of the [[Asia]]n [[continent]], comprising the [[Himalayas|sub-Himalayan]] [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) countries and, [[#Definition by South Asian Studies programs|for some authorities]], adjoining countries to the west and east.

=====Bangladesh=====
In Bangladesh, Bengali is the first language. However, it has a colonial past and English is widely used in administrations, schools, courts etc. Bangladeshi children start English as Second Language quite early in their age (mostly from age 5-6). In National Curriculum, English is given an importance and it is taught compulsorily until twelfth grade. There are Government approved curriculum as well as other international systems of Educations which maintains English as a 'medium of instruction'.

The official languages of the Union of [[India]] are [[Hindi]] and English, with 21 other regional languages holding co-official status, including: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]].

Education in India follows the [[Three-language formula]], where children are to be taught English (or the medium of instruction in the school, grades 1-12), The Second Language (grades 1-10) is the Official language of the state (In most non-Hindi states) or Hindi (in the others), in a few states some schools offer a choice between the State Language and Hindi, and the third language (grades 5-8, often Hindi (in the non-Hindi states), the regional language of the state (if the student opted for Hindi as the second language,  a foreign language or Sanskrit). An exception is [[Tamil Nadu]] where only [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and English are taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

English-medium schools often find favour with parents, especially in urban areas, due to English's international prestige, India's Colonial heritage, its usage in Indian business and it being the medium of instruction in most Indian universities.

=====Philippines=====
In July 2009 [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] moved towards [[Education in the Philippines#Breakdown of the Program|mother-tongue based learning]] initially by issuing an order which allowed two alternative three-year bridging plans. Depending on the bridging plan adopted, the Filipino and English languages are to be phased in as the language of instruction beginning in the third and fourth grades.&lt;ref&gt;. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100821182443/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074%2C%20s.%202009.pdf DepEd Order 74 of 2009] (PDF, archived from [http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf the original] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616225924/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }} on 2010-08-21))&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Philippine languages|Philippine regional languages]] are taught in schools, colleges and universities located in their [[Provinces of the Philippines|respective provinces]].

In 2007, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in Spain that would reintroduce teaching and learning the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2012/07/re-introduction-of-spanish-mandated-by-arroyo-in-2007-trumpeted-by-bs-aquino-today/|title=Re-introduction of Spanish mandated by Arroyo in 2007, trumpeted by BS Aquino today|date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order, Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007, issued on November 29, 2007, ordered the Department of Education to encourage the teaching and learning of the Spanish language throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2007/11/29/memorandum-order-no-276-s-2007/|title= Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007|date=November 29, 2007|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Singapore=====
In Singapore, education is bilingual. The medium of instruction is in English and the learning of the mother tongue is compulsory. The mother tongue subject is usually [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the other official languages of Singapore. They are taught till pre-university level. Previously, students either attended an English-medium or a "vernacular school", which taught in one of the mother tongues. In 1960, government legislation standardised the primary medium of instruction to English, with the different vernacular languages ("mother tongue") allocated as the second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Development of Education in Singapore since 1965|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1121703274255/1439264-1153425508901/Development_Edu_Singapore_draft.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2012 |work= Associate Professor Goh Chor Boon and Professor S. Gopinathan|publisher=National Institute of Education | date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may also choose to learn a third language (German, French, Japanese, etc.) in secondary school and junior college or, if their respective school does not offer the language, at a [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|MOE]] Language Centre. This option is limited however, to the top 10% of any PSLE cohort; prospective third language students must have also scored A grades for English and their second language. Singaporean students returning from abroad who did not learn a second language may be exempted from their mother tongue and learn another second language in place of the mother tongue; however, such exemptions are rare and only granted on a case-to-case basis.

=====Thailand and Malaysia=====
Since the mid-1990s bilingual approaches to schooling and higher education have become popular in parts of [[South-east Asia]], especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] where different models have been applied, from L2 immersion (content taught in a non-native language) to parallel immersion, where core subjects are taught in both the mother-tongue and a second language (usually English).

English has been taught in schools in Malaysia as it is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country (former British colony). During the 1980s to 1990s, when schools were nationalised under the government of Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], English became a second language instead of the primary language of instruction. The Malaysian government reversed its decision to have Maths and Science taught in English, but is implementing different programmes designed to improve English language teaching within schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia drops English language teaching|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/10/malaysia-tefl|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has raised numerous debates, with various groups arguing for and against the use of English in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The sad state of English in Malaysia|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/sad-state-english-malaysia|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the existence of vernacular schools and prominent usage of dialects, some Chinese and Indian children become trilingual, speaking Malay, English and their mother tongue or dialect. However, English is still widely spoken as a [[de facto]] language of trade and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Language Development in Singapore and Malaysia|chapter=The Malaysian Sociolinguistic Situation:An Overview|page=7|first1=Irene F.H.|last1=Wong|first2=Henry|last2=Thambyrajah|editor-first=Anna|editor-last=Kwan-Terry|date=1991|publisher=[[NUS Press|Singapore University Press]]|isbn=9789971691493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties and disputes characteristic of the US experience have not been replicated in these Asian countries, though they are not without controversy.  Generally, it can be said that there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to improve English competence in the population, and bilingual approaches, where language is taught through subject content, are seen to be the most effective means of attaining this.  The most significant limiting factors are the shortage of teachers linguistically competent to teach in a second language and the costs involved in use of expatriate native speakers for this purpose.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], some schools teach bilingual programs which cater to children speaking languages other than English. Baldauf&lt;ref&gt;(2005)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that these programs are now beginning to benefit from more government support. Bilingual education for Indigenous students, however, has only received intermittent official backing. In the Northern Territory, for example, bilingual programs for Indigenous students begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s, but by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift $3 million away from the 29 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position. Most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the guise of two-way education. Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be "revitalizing bi-lingual education" at 15 Community Education Centres: [[Alekerange, Northern Territory|Alekerange]], [[Angurugu, Northern Territory|Angurugu]], [[Borroloola, Northern Territory|Borroloola]], [[Gapuwiyak, Northern Territory|Gapuwiyak]], [[Gunbalanya, Northern Territory|Gunbalanya]], [[Kalkaringi, Northern Territory|Kalkaringi]], [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]], [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]], [[Milingimbi Island|Milingimbi]], [[Ramingining, Northern Territory|Ramingining]], [[Ngkurr, Northern Territory|Ngkurr]], Shepherdson College, [[Numbulwar, Northern Territory|Numbulwar]], [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] and [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]]. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at "providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory's 15 Community Education Centres". As Harris &amp; Devlin (1986) observe, "Aboriginal bilingual education in Australia represents much more than a range of education programs. It has been a measure of non-Aboriginal commitment to either assimilation or cultural pluralism". In 2008 it again shifted with the government attempting to force the nine remaining bilingual schools to teach the first four hours of classes in English.

===Europe===
The ''[[European Schools]]'' group is a network of thirteen private schools in EU countries that provide multilingual and multicultural education at nursery, primary and secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Locations of the European Schools |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/locations |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organisation of studies |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/studies/studies-organisation |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]] has three official languages: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. The constitution guarantees free education, so private schools can use any language, but state(-recognised) schools teach in the language of the language area where it is located. For [[Brussels]], which is an officially bilingual French-Dutch area, schools use either Dutch or French as medium.

Even though Belgium has two major languages (Dutch in Flanders, and French in Wallonia), bilingual instruction does rarely occur since Belgian law only permits education in one official language. In Flanders, bilingual instruction is only allowed as a short-term project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=Exploring bilingualism in a monolingual school system: insights from Turkish and native students from Belgian schools|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|date=1 May 2010|volume=31|issue=3|pages=307–321|doi=10.1080/01425691003700540|url=https://ugent.academia.edu/OrhanAgirdag/Papers/202294/Exploring_Bilingualism_In_a_Monolingual_School_System_Insights_From_Turkish_and_Native_Students_From_Belgian_Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{See also|Language policy in France}}
[[France]] has one official language, [[French language|French]]. However, regional provincial languages including [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have charter protection, and bilingual education programmes and regional language course electives have been established. However, due to the strict French-language policy imposed by national government, there is no centrally allocated funding for any of these programmes. All funding is at the municipal level, with many of the regional languages face extreme endangerment. France is known for wanting to maintain its lingual and cultural roots, and speaking a language other than French or mixing French with other languages is looked down on. This is apparent the French educational system, where French is highly prioritized over other languages and emphasis is put not only on the maintenance of the French language, but also on pushing students not to integrate French with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=James|date=6 Mar 2010|title=France and Language (s): Old Policies and New Challenges in Education.

====Netherlands====
In the [[Netherlands]], there are around 100 bilingual schools. In these schools, the first language is Dutch, whereas the second language is usually English and occasionally German. In the province of [[Friesland]], where [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is an official language, some primary schools are trilingual, teaching in Dutch, West Frisian, and English. Most bilingual secondary schools are TVWO (Bilingual Preparatory Scientific Education), but THAVO (Bilingual Higher General Secondary Education) and TVMBO-TL (Bilingual Preparatory Vocational Education - Theoretical Learning Pathway)&lt;ref&gt;TVMBO-TL was recently introduced at O.R.S. Lek en Linge, Culemborg https://www.lekenlinge.nl/downloaddocument?pid=163&amp;doc=KDEyKS10d2VldGFsaWctdm1iby10LnBkZg==&lt;/ref&gt; have been introduced, too.

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland has two official languages, [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. With the [[Irish language]] facing endangerment, as well as the presence of regions where Irish is still spoken as native (referred to as the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Irish constitution]] protects and reserves the right for education to be established through the medium of either official language, and it thus is.

An Irish-medium school is referred to as [[Gaelscoil]] (plural, Gaelscoileanna) This movement has been met with some success in that 10% of the schooling in Ireland is conducted in Irish. The movement has also been successful in setting up schools in both urban and rural areas, ranging from Dublin and Cork, to the traditional Gaeltacht regions.

====Spain====

=====Andalusia=====
In [[Andalusia]] (Spain's second southernmost region), things have changed drastically concerning bilingual education since the introduction of the Plurilingualism Promotion Plan by the autonomous government. The plan was born as the realization for the Andalusian territory of the European language policies regarding the teaching and learning of languages. With special strength in the past ten years bilingual education has worked at most elementary schools.

In addition to this new European scene, the Scheme for the Promotion of Plurilingualism has learned a lot from the first experimental bilingual sections set up in some schools by the Andalusian government in 1998. Following the content-based approach, French and German were used to partly teach other subjects. This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out.

Being aware of the necessity of the Andalusian people to adapt to the new scenario, a major government plan, called "strategies for the second modernization of Andalusia", was designed in 2003. The document also underlined language diversity as a source of richness and a valuable heritage of humankind which needs to be looked after.

It was then clear that a scheme was needed to carry out this new language policy in the territory, especially affecting education, with clear goals, timing and funding.

The scheme is to be developed through five major programmes and also an organization and assessment plan.

The programmes are:
*Bilingual schools
*Official Schools of Languages
*Plurilingualism and teachers
*Plurilingualism and society
*Organization and assessment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205105956/http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-05|title=Plurilingualism Promotion Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands=====
In addition to [[Castilian Spanish]] being the primary [[official language]] of [[Spain]], the kingdom also has several co-official regional languages which enjoy equal and unbiased constitutional protection and promotion: [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]), [[Galician language|Galician]] (in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), [[Basque language|Basque]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the northern zone of [[Navarre]]) and [[Aranese]] (in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]]).

Many schools are bilingual in the regional language as well as Castilian at both the elementary and secondary levels. Regional universities also often provide programmes through the regional medium. Education in all co-official languages uses to receive both national and regional funding.

Unlike [[France]] in which regional languages face incredible endangerment and possible extinction, Spain's long-established approach to making regional bilingual education mandatory has served often as a model for both the survival and thriving state of the languages indigenous to the country.

====Sweden====
[[Sweden]] has one official language and five recognized minority languages,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is to great extent the only one of these in which education is offered. During the 21st century more and more schools started to offer national programs in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=The International School Consultancy Group|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom and dependencies====
The British Isles have several indigenous languages apart from [[English language|English]]. These include [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (official in Wales), [[Irish Language|Irish]], [[Manx Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and the [[Scots language]] (which is sometimes considered as a dialect of English).

[[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]] have each established bilingual programmes which provide education through the medium of their indigenous language. Most often, except for the cases of Manx and Cornish, these programmes exist where the language is spoken communally as a first language.

=====Wales=====
Roughly a quarter of schoolchildren in Wales now receive their education through the [[Welsh medium education|medium of Welsh]], and children wishing to join a Welsh medium school ({{Lang-cy|ysgol Gymraeg}}) do not have to speak Welsh to go to one if they are young enough to learn the language quickly. Welsh medium education has met with great success across Wales since the first such schools opened in the 1940s. There are current plans to extend further provision in urban centres such as [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Swansea]] and [[Llanelli]] to cater for growing demand; this has caused controversy in some areas.

Welsh-speaking areas use Welsh-medium education almost exclusively. Parents have a legal right for their children to receive education in Welsh, and each local authority caters for this. In the Western flank of Wales, [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Gwynedd]] and [[Anglesey]], most primary and secondary schools are Welsh medium or have bilingual streams. Some 75-80% of all pupils in [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Ceredigion]] receive their education through the medium of Welsh, with this figure increasing in Gwynedd to around 90%.

In English-medium schools, the study of Welsh is compulsory and must be taught from age 5 to age 16 in all state-funded schools.

=====Northern Ireland=====
Irish Gaelic received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. A cross-border body known as [[Foras na Gaeilge]] was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The British government in 2001 ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish Gaelic (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status somewhat comparable to the Welsh language in Wales and Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters (whilst the Ulster variant of [[Scots language|Scots]], known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]], was specified under Part II of the Charter.)

The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 states: "It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education."

There are no Ulster Scots-medium schools, even at primary level.

===Americas===

====North America====

=====Canada=====
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada}}

======English and French======
In [[Canada]], education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been a strong supporter of establishing Canada as a bilingual country and has helped pioneer the [[French immersion]] programs in the public education systems throughout Canada. In French-immersion, students with no previous French language training, usually beginning in Kindergarten or grade 1, do all of their school work in French. Depending on provincial jurisdiction, some provinces also offer an extended French program that begins in grade 5 which offers relatively more courses in French. In this case the student takes French immersion until grade nine but may continue throughout their high school education. Similar English-immersion programmes also exist for Francophone children.

Education is generally monolingual in either English or French according to the majority population within which a school is located.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The second official language is introduced with allocated time provided each week for instruction in the language as a subject.

======Quebec======
Quebec is Canada's only legally monolingual French-speaking province. Based on section 59 of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, provides that not all of the language rights listed under Canada's official bilingualism policy in previous section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:

(1) In Quebec, a child may be educated in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.

(2)In New Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province, students have the right to education in the official language which they understand; students able to understand both languages have the right to education in either system.

(3) In the rest of Canada, a child may be educated in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her mother tongue (defined in section 23 as "first language learned and still understood").

One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries are required to place their children in French-language schools. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English.

On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.
Section 23 also provides, in theory, a nearly universal right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.

Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only "where numbers warrant."

======First Nations reserves and Inuit settlements======
Canada also has bilingual programmes for [[First Nations]]' languages on numerous [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian aboriginal]] reserves in combination with either English, French, or both. Some programmes are gradually being established, whilst others are already long established. Most notable bilingual programmes that exist include [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Cree]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], and Pacific Coast [[Salish languages]].

Many of these programmes were set up in the late 1980s and early 1990s by academic [[linguists]] wishing to preserve the languages, respectively - especially in areas where there either is a healthy speaking base, or an endangerment of as low as two remaining speakers of a language. Prior to this, as late as the 1970s and early 1980s, First Nations and [[Inuit]] in Canada, as Native Americans in the United States, were forced into [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] imposed on them by the Canadian government to integrate indigenous cultures into European-Canadian society. This came with the dramatic loss of the languages, religious beliefs, and cultures themselves due to widespread use of corporal punishment and mental abuse. As of 2010, new programmes are mushrooming across Canada to try to save what is left, but are often met with mixed success and funding challenges at federal, provincial, and reserve levels.

======Other minority languages======
In the province of [[British Columbia]], the city of [[Vancouver]] since 2002 has established a new bilingual Mandarin Chinese-English immersion programme at the elementary school level in order to accommodate Vancouver's both historic and present strong ties to the Chinese-speaking world, already in itself having a very sizeable Chinese population local to the city. Six Vancouver schools have thus far adopted the programme, and a secondary school track to continue thereupon is being designed. Other suburbs within what is referred to as the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] are also considering adopting the programme into a small number of schools. Similar programmes are being developed for both [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to serve in representing the large South Asian cultural community and its interests in the [[City of Surrey]]. By default, most schools in British Columbia teach through English, with French immersion options available. In both English and French-medium schools, one can study and take government exams in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] at the secondary level.

In [[Alberta]], the city of [[Edmonton]] has had a well established Chinese (Mandarin) bilingual education program ([[Edmonton Chinese Bilingual Education Association]]) since 1982. The program is currently offered in 13 schools throughout the city consisting of 6 elementary schools, 4 junior high schools and 3 high schools. Students enrolled in any of the elementary schools spend half a day learning in Chinese and the other half in English.

In [[Manitoba]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] communities have played an extensive role in the development and history of the province. Bilingual Ukrainian-English education programmes have therefore long been established, alongside smaller programmes introducing and implementing [[French language|French]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] in the town of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], and [[First Nations]]' languages.

Private Islamic and Jewish schools across Canada also have bilingual and trilingual programmes that include [[Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]], respectively.

In [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and other parts of [[Nova Scotia]], a number of secondary schools now offer the option of taking introductory courses in [[Scottish Gaelic]], as reflecting upon the province's both intimate and dark history with the Gaelic language and Highland Scottish diaspora.

Bilingual education in the U.S. focuses on English Language Learners (ELL).

The emphasis on English rejects that the student has a dominant language as part of their identity and culture that will continue to develop with time. According to the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] website, a bilingual education program is "an educational program for [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] students". (The Office of English Language Acquisition, 2009).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The term "limited English proficiency" remains in use by the federal government, but has fallen out of favor elsewhere. According to [http://www.bankstreet.edu/literacyguide/ell.html Bankstreet's Literacy Guide] this shift is due to the fact that the term ELL represents a more accurate reflection of language acquisition. The term "English language learner" is now preferred in schools and educational research to refer to a student whose first language is not English and who needs language support services in order to succeed in school.

In the United States, proponents of the practice argue that it will not only help to keep non-English-speaking children from falling behind their peers in math, science, and social studies while they master English, but such programs teach English better than English-only programs. For many students, the process of learning literacy and a new language simultaneously is simply an overwhelming task, so bilingual programs began as a way to help such students develop native language literacy first - research by Cummins,&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; a central researcher in the field, shows that skills such as literacy developed in a first language will transfer to English. Opponents of bilingual education argue that it delays students' mastery of English, thereby retarding the learning of other subjects as well. In [[California]], where at least one-third of students were enrolled in bilingual classes in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="'70s 270"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|pages= 270–271|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been considerable politicking for and against bilingual education.

The very first instance of bilingual education in the United States occurred with Polish immigrants in the first permanent English settlement of [[Virginia]] in what is now the United States. The Poles provided the community with manufactured pitch necessary to prevent the sinking of ships, and glass works among other industries. When the [[House of Burgesses]] met in 1619, the rights extended only to Englishmen. The Poles, in turn, launched the first recorded strike in the New World.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"&gt;{{cite book |title= In Quest of a Cultural Identity: An Inquiry for the Polish Community|last= Seidner|first= Stanley S.|year= 1976|publisher= IUME, Teachers College, [[Columbia University]]|location= New York, New York|id= ERIC ED167674|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED167674&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED167674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In dire need of their skills and industries, the Poles received the "[[rights of Englishmen]]," and established the first bilingual schools with subjects taught in English and Polish.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"/&gt;  From this first documented historic beginning, bilingual education existed in some form or another in the United States. During the 18th century, Franciscan missionaries from California to Texas used indigenous languages for translating and teaching the Catholic catechism to Native Americans. By the mid-19th century, private and public bilingual schools had include such native languages as Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.&lt;ref name="The American bilingual Tradition"&gt;{{cite book |title= The American bilingual Tradition|last= Kloss|first= Heinz|origyear= 1977|year= 1998|publisher= Newbury House|location= Rowley, MA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio became the first state in 1839, to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice|last= Crawford|first= James|year= 1999|publisher= BES|location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt; Beginning in 1959, public schools in Miami introduced bilingual programs. In 1968 the U.S., with Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or, informally, the [[Bilingual Education Act]], Congress first mandated bilingual education in order to give immigrants access to education in their "first" language. The Act was amended in 1988.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt;  Federal spending on bilingual education jumped from $7.5 million in 1968 to $150 million by 1979.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

A 1974 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'', gave further momentum to bilingual education.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;  Here, the Court held that [[San Francisco]] schools violated minority language students' rights when they educated students in the same classes as other students&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; without special provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/17_02/Bili172.shtml Bilingual Education Is A Human and Civil Right - Volume 17 No. 2 - Winter 2002/2003 - Rethinking Schools Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, the [[Bilingual Education Act]] and the ''Lau v. Nichols'' ruling mandated that schools needed to at least provide some type of services to support English language learners, though neither specified what type of educational program needed to be provided.  As such, both bilingual and English-only programs flourished after the law's passage and the court ruling.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

The [[Bilingual Education Act]] was terminated in 2001 by new federal education policy, with the passage of [[No Child Left Behind]] by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. This law offers no support for native language learning, but rather emphasized accountability in English only, and mandates that all students, including ELLs, are tested yearly in English.

The majority of U.S. high school students in the United States are required to take at least one to two years of a second language.  The vast majority of these classes are either French or Spanish.  In a large number of schools this is taught in a manner known as [[Language immersion|FLES]], in which students learn about the second language in a manner similar to other subjects such as mathematics or science.  Some schools use an additional method known as [[FLEX (Language Teaching)|FLEX]] in which the "nature of the language" and culture are also taught. High school education almost never uses "immersion" techniques.

======Controversy in the United States======
In recent times there has been a lot of discussion about bilingual education. In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Horne v. Flores]], the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI ([[Structured English Immersion]]) is significantly more effective than bilingual education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Proponents of bilingual education claim that it is not only easier for students to learn English if they are literate in their first language, but that such students will learn English better and become bilingual and biliterate.&lt;ref&gt;(see Krashen, 2002; August &amp; Hakuta, 1997; Crawford, 2000; Cummins, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that English language learners introduced to a transitional bilingual program gained a fair amount of English comprehension and reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tong |first=F. |author2=Lara-Alecio, R. |author3=Irby, B. |author4=Mathes, P. |author5=Kwok, O. |date=2008 |title=Accelerating Early Academic Oral English Development in Transitional Bilingual and Structured English Immersion Programs |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1044 |doi=10.3102/0002831208320790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents further claim that effective bilingual programs strive to achieve proficiency in both English and the students' home language. Dual language or Two-Way bilingual programs are one such approach, whereby half of the students speak English and half are considered English language learners (ELLs). The teacher instructs in English and in the ELLs' home language. The dual purpose of this type of classroom is to teach the children a new language and culture, and language diversity in such classrooms is seen as a resource. Programs in English only eradicate the native languages immigrants bring to this country, while dual language bilingual programs serve to maintain such languages in an "additive" context, where a new language is added without the first being lost. One paper states that two-way developmental bilingual education programs in elementary school have the most success in language minority students' long term academic achievement. These students will maintain their gains in academic performance in secondary level academic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Virginia P. |date=Fall 1995 |title=Acquiring a Second Language for School |journal=Directions in Language &amp; Education - National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education |volume=1 |issue=4 |quote=To assure cognitive and academic success in a second language, a student's first language system, oral and written, must be developed to a high cognitive level at least through the elementary-school years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study shows the positive results of a two-way bilingual education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning |date=March 1999 |title=Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs in Practice: A National and Local Perspective |journal=Center for Applied Linguistics |url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/ed379915.html |accessdate=2008-03-14 |quote=Two-way programs provide both sets of students with ample exposure to the two languages, allowing them to progress academically in both languages and gain an appreciation of another culture. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314215044/http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/ed379915.html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that the transitional bilingual education method can improve development of the native language without hindering the development of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duran |first=L.K. |author2=Roseth, C.J. |author3=Hoffman, P. |date=2010 |title=An experimental study comparing English-only and Transitional Bilingual Education on Spanish-speaking preschoolers' early literacy development |journal=Early Chilhood Research Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some mistakenly believe that once a student can converse in English (Basic interpersonal communication skills - BICS), they will naturally perform well academically (cognitive academic language proficiency - CALP) in English. It has been postulated that BICS and CALP are two different sets of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   |last =Carrasquillo  | first =Angela L  |author2=Rodriguez, Vivian  | title =Language Minority Students in the Mainstream Classroom | publisher =Multilingual Matters Ltd. | year =1996  | location =Bristol, PA  | page =202 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED392281&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED392281  | isbn =978-1-85359-297-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of bilingual education claim that students with other primary languages besides Spanish are placed in Spanish classes rather than taught in their native languages&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; and that many bilingual education programs fail to teach students English.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; Critics of bilingual education have claimed that studies supporting bilingual education tend to have poor methodologies and that there is little empirical support in favor of it.

The controversy over bilingual education is often enmeshed in a larger political and cultural context. Opponents of bilingual education are sometimes accused of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]]. This is especially so in the case of such groups as [[English First (lobbying organization)|English First]], which is a conservative organization that promotes the stance that English should be the official language of the United States. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and other cities, Minister of education of the [[Young Lords]], Tony Baez and others held marches and other activities to promote bilingual education. Proponents of bilingual education are frequently accused of practicing [[identity politics]], to the detriment of children and of immigrants.
:"To aid and monitor the education of English language learners (ELL)through mother-tongue and English education, the federal government enacted the Bilingual Education Act (Title V11) of the elementary and secondary Education Act in 1968. As an offshoot of president Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, the act strove to help disenfranchised language-miniority students, especially Hispanics. Unfortunately, the acts aims were somewhat ambiguous. As Crawford (2000a) writes 'enacted at the apex of the Great Society, bilingual education act of 1968 passed congress without a single dissent. Americans have spent the past 30 years debating what it was meant to accomplish'." (p.&amp;nbsp;107).&lt;ref&gt;Ovando, Carlos J. (2003). "Bilingual Education in the United States: Historical Development and Current Issues" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ666800 (Bilingual Research Journal, 27(1), 1-24.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

======California======
[[California]] is the state with the highest number of English Learners (ELs) in the United States. One out of three students in California is an EL.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; In June 1998, [[Proposition 227]] was passed by 61% of the California electorate. This proposition mandates that ELs be placed in structured English immersion for a period "not normally to exceed one year," then be transferred to mainstream classrooms taught "overwhelmingly in English."&lt;ref&gt;[http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm State of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposition also gave parents the possibility to request alternative programs for their children, however, the availability of waivers and information to parents have been a challenge in the implementation of this proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish et al., (2002). "Proposition 227 and Instruction of English Learners in California: Evaluation Update" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED482963&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED482963 (U.S. Department of Education)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and WestEd to conduct a five-year evaluation of the effects of Proposition 227.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |title=American Institutes for Research (AIR) |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913185100/http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study methodology focused on "A combination of student achievement analysis, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what [[unintended consequence]]s resulted from Proposition 227's implementation."

The authors caution about the limitations in the statewide data. California does not have the capacity to link student academic progress over time across years; however, using student-level linked data over time from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and complementing that analysis with surveys, site visits and interviews, the study found "no conclusive evidence favoring one instructional program over another." Students who remained in bilingual education have similar academic growth trajectories when compared with students who switched to English Immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |title=WestEd: Effects of the Implementation of Proposition 227 on the Education of English Learners, K-12: 2002 Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711042851/http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |archive-date=2007-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, among other states, also has many public schools which have Immersion programs, most commonly Spanish/English Immersion but also including other languages. Immersion programs include native speakers of both languages and include instruction in both languages, with primary (grade) schools typically having 90% instruction in the minority language in the early grades, transitioning to 50% instruction in each of the minority language and English in the upper grades.

Proposition 227 has been repealed in 2016 by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)]].

======Arizona======
California was followed by [[Arizona]] in the passage of similar legislation, [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|Arizona Proposition 203]], which ended several programs previously available to ESL students. Arizona was the first state to provide bilingual education in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

======Georgia======
During the 1990s the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] increased its foreign born population by 233%. That was the second largest increase in the country, and Georgia is the sixth fastest growing state in the United States. Georgia has the seventh largest illegal immigrant population in the country; in the 2000 census 228,000 illegal immigrants lived in the state. During the 1980s and 1990s a labor shortage in the carpet industry contributed to an increase in the Hispanic population of Whitfield County, Georgia. Today almost half of the students in the Dalton (the hub of Whitfield County) public schools are Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2416 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Whitfield County]&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Mitchell, a local Dalton lawyer, founded the [[Georgia Project]] in 1996 to help teach the influx of Hispanic students who have moved into the Dalton public schools. The Georgia Project partners with the [[University of Monterrey]] in Monterrey, [[Mexico]] to bring teachers from Mexico to Georgia Schools. Sixty teachers from the University of Monterrey have taught in Georgia since 1997, and they typically teach for two to three years on [[H-1B visa]]s. The Georgia Project also has a Summer Institute that trains American teachers to speak Spanish and learn about Mexican culture. The Georgia Project is a bilingual/bicultural program that is primarily funded from federal education appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communityresourcebank.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=874 National Immigration Forum: Community Resource Bank, Success Stories, The Georgia Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Native American Reservations======
Following similar [[First Nations]]' models to [[Canada]], academic [[linguists]] throughout the [[United States]] are working closely with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations communities to establish immersion and second-language programs for a number of respective tribal languages including [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Cherokee]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Lakhota]], and [[Sioux]], among others. Due to the combination of often a violent and isolative relationship between European settlers and Native Americans, their languages and communities have suffered dramatically in terms of facing extreme endangerment or extinction. The success of these programmes is mixed, depending largely on how healthy the status of the language in question is.

However, English-medium education still remains most widely used. Native programs often suffer a lack of state support in terms of funding or encouragement due in large part to the strong preference towards a melting-pot society. [[Native American boarding schools]], which enforced white American values and the English language were extensively used as late as the 1990s, and were notorious for implementing corporal punishment if a Native child was caught speaking his or her language or freely practicing their tribal faith.

====South America====

=====Argentina=====
There are many English-Spanish schools in Argentina. Several of them are in the provinces where the Irish who were part of the local Elite used to live. While medium to big sized cities are likely to have several bilingual schools, bilingual education remains an exception rather than the norm and is generally reserved for the upper classes. There is not a nationally encompassing bilingual program available for public schools. Because of the ties that have historically bound private education to religious institutions, many of the bilingual schools in the country are Roman Catholic schools. For example, out of the three available bilingual schools in a medium-sized city such as Mar del Plata, two of them (Holy Mary of Northern Hills and Holy Trinity College) are practicing Roman Catholic schools. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Effects of mother-tongue instruction ==
Continuing to foster the abilities of children's mother tongue along with other languages has proven essential for their personal and educational development because they retain their cultural identity and gain a deeper understanding of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2001|title=Bilingual children's mother tongue: Why is it important for education|url=|journal=Sprogforum|volume=19|pages=15–20|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 2016 studies of mother-tongue instruction in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively show that it had positive outcomes for the students in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seid|first=Yared|date=2016-12-01|title=Does learning in mother tongue matter?

{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}

In many of the world's military establishments, a '''brevet''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-brevet.oga|b|r|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-brevet-2.ogg|ˈ|b|r|ɛ|v|ɪ|t}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/brevet|title=the definition of brevet|author=|date=|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[warrant (legal)|warrant]] giving a [[commissioned officer]] a higher [[Military rank|rank title]] as a reward for gallantry or meritorious conduct but without conferring the authority, precedence, or pay of real rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boatner III|first=Mark M.|title=The Civil War Dictionary |year=1991 |month= |url= |accessdate= |edition=|series= |publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |language= |isbn=0-679-73392-2 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=84 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An officer so promoted was referred to as being '''brevetted''' (for example, "''he was brevetted [[major general]]''"). The promotion would be noted in the officer's title (for example, "''Bvt. Maj. Gen. [[Joshua Chamberlain|Joshua L. Chamberlain]]''" or "''Bvt. Col. [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.|Arthur MacArthur]]''").

It is not to be confused with a ''[[brevet d'état-major|brevet]]'' in [[Francophone]] European military circles, where it is an award, nor should it be confused with [[acting (rank)|temporary commissions]].

==France==
In France, a ''brevet'' is a very broad-meaning word which includes every document giving a capacity to a person. For instance, the various military speciality courses, such as [[Parachutist Badge|military parachutism]], are ended by the award of a brevet.

The more important brevet in the French military is the one of the [[École Militaire|École de guerre]], the French [[Staff College]]. Between  1870 and 1940, an ''officier breveté'' was a graduate of the ''École supérieure de guerre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/04histoire/articles/articles_rha/ecolesuperieuredeguerre.htm |title=Service historique de la Défense |publisher=Servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506054541/http://www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/04histoire/articles/articles_rha/ecolesuperieuredeguerre.htm |archivedate=2009-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, while many officers still attend the école de guerre, they do not use the term ''officier breveté''.

The French military does not use brevets to give officers a higher standing. It uses instead [[acting (rank)|temporary commission]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Code de la Défense, art. L4134-2.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, [[Charles de Gaulle]] was promoted "provisional brigadier general" (''général de brigade à titre provisoire'') in 1940 when he was [[Charles_de_Gaulle#The_Battle_of_France:_division_commander|commander of an armoured division]].

==Germany==
In the [[Prussia]]n and German army and navy, it was possible to bestow a ''Charakter'' rank on officers that was in many respects similar to a brevet rank. For example, an ''Oberst'' could receive the ''Charakter als Generalmajor''. Very often, German officers would be promoted to the next higher ''Charakter'' rank on the day of their retirement.

==Spain==
It was not uncommon during the 19th century to distinguish between ''empleo'' ("employed")  rank and ''graduación'' ("grade") being the effective command position. In the 1884 rank regulations (which with minor modifications were in force during the [[Spanish–American War]]) stars marked the rank whilst the actual post was reflected in gold lace on the cuffs.

As in practice both situations coincided the system was dropped in 1908 leaving only the starred system of denoting rank. Nevertheless, during the Spanish Civil War the system was revived in the Nationalist side due to the lack of trained officers because of the enlargement of the army. The breveted officers (known as ''habilitados'' or ''estampillados'') wore their actual rank on the cuffs but their brevetted one in a rectangular black patch on the left breast of their coats or shirts.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom the brevet commission was only by courtesy. Officially, both titles were used, as: "Major and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel [[Cornwallis]]". Originally the term designated a promotion given on such occasions as a coronation, or the termination of a great war, and had its origin during the reign of King [[James II of England|James II]] (1685–1688); but it was abused so frequently and used to such an extent by the general award of brevet commissions that from 1854, during the [[Crimean War]] of 1853-1856 and subsequently, its bestowal was limited{{By whom|date=October 2016}} strictly to cases of very distinguished service in the [[Theater (warfare)|field]] and on the principle of seniority. The [[British Army]] confined brevet commissions to ranks from captain to lieutenant-colonel.

The brevet conferred rank in the British Army overall, but importantly, not in the [[Regiment#Regimental system|regiment]]. Advancement in the regiment could take place generally only by [[Sale of commissions|purchase]] (until 1871) or by seniority, and when there was a suitable vacancy (caused by the death, retirement or promotion of a more senior officer). For an officer on duty with his regiment, only regimental rank counted; if the regiment formed part of a larger formation then brevet rank could be used to determine command of temporary units formed for special purposes. In particular [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]] did not become a permanent rank until 1947, so command of [[brigade]]s was determined by seniority, including by the date of promotion to any brevet rank.  Thus it was possible for a regimental [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] to hold a brevet [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonelcy]] with seniority over the commission of his own commanding officer as lieutenant-colonel and be given command of a brigade (potentially including his own regiment). Similarly, while the officer served in a [[Staff Officer|staff]] position or as an [[aide-de-camp]], then he could use his brevet rank.  Appointment to a brevet also counted towards the requirement to have served for a sufficient time in a lower rank to be eligible for promotion (by purchase) to a more senior one.&lt;ref&gt;

==United States==
The [[Articles of War]] adopted by the [[United States Army]] in 1776 and slightly revised in 1806 established the use and significance of brevet ranks or awards in the U.S. Army. When first used, a brevet commission in the U.S. Army entitled the officer to be identified by a higher rank, but the award had limited effect on the right to higher command or pay. A brevet rank had no effect within the officer's current unit, but, when assigned duty at the brevet rank by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]], such an officer would command with the brevet rank and be paid at the higher rank.  This higher command and pay would last only for the duration of that assignment. The brevet promotion would not affect the officer's seniority and actual permanent rank in the army.&lt;ref name=HuntINTROv&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on April 16, 1818, brevet commissions also required confirmation by the [[United States Senate]], just as all other varieties of officer commissions did.&lt;ref name=Eicher34&gt;Eicher, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early use===
Brevets were first used in the U.S. Army during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Often, the nation's [[Continental Congress]] could not find suitable positions for foreign officers&amp;mdash;mostly from France&amp;mdash;who sought commissions. The first U.S. brevet was given to [[Jacques Antoine de Franchessin]] on July 20, 1776, allowing him to hold the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] within the [[Continental Army]]. Franchessin and another 35 men of foreign birth would hold brevet commissions in the army by the end of the war. By 1784, an additional 50 officers would receive brevets for "meritorious services" during the conflict.&lt;ref name=HuntINTROv/&gt;

In the 19th-century U.S. Army, brevet promotions were quite common because the army had many frontier forts to garrison and other missions to perform but could not always appoint appropriately ranked officers to command these forts or missions. The [[U.S. Congress]] permitted only a limited number of officers of each rank. Thus, an officer of lower rank might receive a brevet commission to a rank more appropriate for his assignment. Also, newly commissioned officers often received brevet rank until authorized positions became available. For example, an officer might graduate from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and be appointed a brevet [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] until a permanent second lieutenant posting opened up. In early 1861, some recent graduates of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] temporarily were named brevet second lieutenants because not enough [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] officer vacancies were available to give them commissions as regular second lieutenants.&lt;ref&gt;Faust, Patricia L., ed. ''Historical Times Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War,'' p. 79.  Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc., New York, NY, 1986. {{ISBN|0-06-181261-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to officers being appointed to a brevet rank to temporarily serve in positions designated for higher-ranked officers (i.e., in lieu of promotion to permanent rank), officers might be awarded brevet rank as recognition for gallantry or meritorious service.

===American Civil War===
During the [[American Civil War]], almost all senior officers received some form of brevet award, mainly during the final months of the war. These awards were made for gallantry or meritorious service, rather than for command. In addition to the authorization in a previous law for awards of brevet ranks to [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] officers, an [[act of Congress]] of March 3, 1863, authorized the award of brevet rank to officers of the [[United States Volunteers]].&lt;ref&gt;Boatner, III, Mark M., ''The Civil War Dictionary,'' p. 84, David McKay Company, Inc., New York, 1959. {{ISBN|0-679-50013-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, brevet awards became increasingly common later in the war. Some officers even received more than one award. Because of the existence of both Regular Army and United States Volunteers ranks, and the possibility that an officer could hold actual and brevet ranks in both services, some general and other officers could hold as many as four different ranks simultaneously. For example, by the end of the war, [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]] was a brevet [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of volunteers, an actual, full-rank [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, a brevet [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the United States [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]], and an actual Regular Army [[Captain (United States)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Ezra J. ''Generals in Blue,'' p. xvii. Louisiana State University Press, 1964. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-0822-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brevet rank in the [[Union Army]], whether in the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] or the [[United States Volunteers]], during and at the conclusion of the American Civil War, may be regarded as an honorary title which conferred none of the authority, precedence, nor pay of real or full rank.&lt;ref name="Boatner, III, p. 84"&gt;Boatner, III, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of the Union Army brevet ranks were awarded posthumously or on or as of March 13, 1865, as the war was coming to a close.&lt;ref name="Boatner, III, p. 84"/&gt; U.S. Army regulations concerning brevet rank provided that brevet rank could be claimed "in courts-martial and on detachments, when composed of different corps" and when the officer served with provisional formations made up of different regiments or companies, or "on other occasions."&lt;ref name="Boatner, III, p. 84"/&gt; These regulations were vague enough to support the positions of some brevet generals who caused controversies by claiming supposed priorities or privileges of brevet ranks that had been awarded to them at earlier dates during the war.&lt;ref name="Boatner, III, p. 84"/&gt;

Some full-rank brigadier generals in the United States Volunteers (USV) in the American Civil War had been awarded brevet brigadier general rank in the USV before receiving full-rank promotions to brigadier general of United States Volunteers. Some full-rank brigadier generals in the USV were awarded the rank of brevet major general in the USV, but were not promoted to full-rank major generals in the USV. Some United States Regular Army officers who served with the USV in ranks below general officer were awarded brevet general officer rank in the USV, but were not promoted to full-rank general officers in the USV. On the other hand, at least a few USV general officers also were awarded brevet general officer rank in the Regular Army in addition to their full-rank appointments or brevet general officer awards in the United States Volunteers. Many of the Regular Army officers of lower rank who became full-rank USV generals, however, received neither actual promotions to a general officer rank nor brevet general officer awards in the Regular Army in addition to their USV ranks or awards. Some of them who stayed in the United States Regular Army after the war did achieve general officer rank in later years.

In addition to the brevet awards to current (or future) full-rank United States Volunteers (USV) generals during the American Civil War, 1,367 other USV officers of lower ranks were awarded the rank of brevet brigadier general, brevet major general, or both, in the United States Volunteers, but not promoted to full-rank USV generals.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, ''Generals in Blue,'' p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one enlisted man, [[Private (rank)|Private]] Frederick W. Stowe, was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the Union Army during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Faust, p .79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Confederate States of America]] had legislation and regulations for the use of brevets in their armed forces, provided by Article 61 of the nation's Articles of War, and by their 1861 ''Army Regulations'', which were based on the U.S. Army's 1857 version of their regulations. Although Article 61 was revised in 1862, it ultimately had no practical effect since the [[Confederate States Army]] did not use any brevet commissions or awards during its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Weinert, pp. 5-6; Faust, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Marine Corps]] also issued brevets.  After officers became eligible for the [[Medal of Honor]], a rare [[Marine Corps Brevet Medal]] was issued to living officers who had been brevetted between 1861 and 1915.&lt;ref name=FOXFALLMEDALS&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-10|url=http://www.foxfall.com/fmd-navy-bvt.htm|title=Marine Corps Brevet Medal|publisher=Foxfall Medals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
The practice of brevetting disappeared from the (regular) U.S. military at the end of the 19th century; honors were bestowed instead with a series of medals. Brevetting was declared obsolete in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/79029/brevet|title=Brevet - military rank|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the similar practice of [[frocking]] continues in four of the five branches of the U.S. armed forces. The [[U.S. Air Force]] does not allow the regular practice of frocking before a promotion date, except in rare circumstances, such as when an officer selected for promotion is assigned to a billet (typically a senior joint duty assignment), that requires him or her to hold/wear the higher rank to which he/she is expected to be promoted.  Frocking typically requires special approval to be obtained from the service headquarters.

The promotion of an enlisted person or non-commissioned officer to commissioned officer rank as a reward for displaying leadership and bravery is referred to as a direct appointment rather than a brevet. It temporarily grants the rank of 1st lieutenant. The holder must then attend Officer Candidate School in order to keep the commission. They must also have or acquire a four-year college degree if they wish to be promoted to the rank of captain or above.

The U.S. National Guard, which depends on the governor of a state to concede its commissions in the [[Army National Guard]] and [[Air National Guard]], may still confer brevets.  Many states maintain a clause permitting the governor to confer any rank in its defense forces, including the militia and National Guards.  Some states provide that the sitting governor may confer any rank, but this appointment is considered valid only for the duration of the governor's own term in office.

Some states also confer brevets as part of their regular honors system. Georgia confers honorary ranks into its state police force. Kentucky is famous for [[Kentucky colonel|its colonels]], and so too is Tennessee, both of which make the appointment as an honorary member of the governor's staff. Alabama, Kentucky, Texas and [[Nebraska Admiral|Nebraska]] also confer an admiralty within a symbolic navy.  Similar honors have been issued for the [[Georgia Naval Militia]], which has existed only on paper since 1908.  In all cases these honorary titles may be considered effective brevets, equal to that of the National Guard, by being conferred by a sitting governor.

{{pp-move-indef}}

'''Bullshit''' (also '''bullcrap''') is a common [[English language|English]] [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] which may be shortened to the [[euphemism]] '''bull''' or the [[initialism]] '''BS'''. In [[British English]], "[[bollocks]]" is a comparable expletive. It is mostly a [[slang]] [[profanity]] term meaning "[[nonsense]]", especially as a rebuke in response to communication or actions viewed as [[Deception|deceptive]], misleading, disingenuous, unfair or false. As with many expletives, the term can be used as an [[interjection]], or as many other [[parts of speech]], and can carry a wide variety of [[Meaning (linguistic)|meanings]]. A person who communicates nonsense on a given subject may be referred to as a "bullshit artist".

In philosophy and psychology of [[cognition]] the term "bullshit" is sometimes used to specifically refer to statements produced without particular concern of truth, to distinguish from a deliberate, manipulative [[lie]] intended to subvert the truth. &lt;ref name=ppbs&gt;[[http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.html On the reception and detection of pseudo-profound bullshit],
Gordon Pennycook,  James Allan Cheyne,   Nathaniel Barr,   Derek J. Koehler,   Jonathan A. Fugelsang, Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 10, No. 6, November 2015, pp. 549-563&lt;/ref&gt;

While the word is generally used in a deprecatory sense, it may imply a measure of respect for language skills or frivolity, among various other benign usages. In [[philosophy]], [[Harry Frankfurt]], among others, analyzed the concept of ''bullshit'' as related to, but distinct from, lying.

As an exclamation, "Bullshit!" conveys a measure of dissatisfaction with something or someone, but this usage need not be a comment on the [[truth]] of the matter.

==Etymology==
"Bull", meaning nonsense, dates from the 17th century, while the term "bullshit" has been used as early as 1915 in British&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; and American&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bullshit |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[slang]], and came into popular usage only during [[World War II]]. The word "bull" itself may have derived from the [[Old French]] ''bole'' meaning "fraud, deceit".&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; The term "horseshit" is a near synonym. An occasionally used [[South African English]] equivalent is "bull dust".

The earliest attestation mentioned by the ''Concise Oxford English Dictionary'' is in fact [[T. S. Eliot]], who between 1910 and 1916 wrote an early poem to which he gave the title "The Triumph of Bullshit", written in the form of a [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]. The word bullshit does not appear in the text of the poem, and Eliot himself never published the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T.S. (1997). ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909–1917''. Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-15-100274-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to earlier etymology the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites ''bull'' with the meaning "trivial, insincere, untruthful talk or writing, nonsense". It describes this usage as being of unknown origin, but notes that in [[Old French]], the word could mean "boul, boule, bole fraud, deceit, trickery; [[Icelandic language|mod. Icel]] bull 'nonsense'; also [[Middle English|ME]] bull BUL 'falsehood', and BULL verb, to befool, mock, cheat."&lt;ref name="penn"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002404.html | title = Bullshit: invented by T.S. Eliot in 1910? | author = Mark Liberman | publisher = Language Log | date = 2005-08-17 | access-date = 2007-02-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070219180648/http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/002404.html# | archive-date = 2007-02-19 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no confirmed etymological connection, these older meanings are synonymous with the modern expression "bull", generally considered and used as a contraction of "bullshit".

Another proposal, according to the lexicographer Eric Partridge, is that the term was popularized by the Australian and New Zealand troops from about 1916 arriving at the front during World War I. Partridge claims that the British commanding officers placed emphasis on ''bull''; that is, attention to appearances, even when it was a hindrance to waging war. The foreign Diggers allegedly ridiculed the British by calling it bull'''shit'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Hartcher |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/us-looks-down-under-to-stop-poll-rot-20121105-28tz1.html |title=US looks Down Under to stop poll rot |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2012-11-06 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the philosophy of truth and rhetoric{{anchor|Philosophy}}==

===Assertions of fact===
"Bullshit" is commonly used to describe statements made by people more concerned with the response of the audience than in truth and accuracy, such as goal-oriented statements made in the field of politics or advertising. On one prominent occasion, the word itself was part of a controversial advertisement. During the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 U.S. presidential campaign]], the [[Citizens Party (United States)|Citizens Party]] candidate [[Barry Commoner]] ran a radio advertisement that began with an actor exclaiming: "Bullshit! [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[John B. Anderson|Anderson]], it's all bullshit!" [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] refused to run the advertisement because of its use of the expletive, but Commoner's campaign successfully appealed to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to allow the advertisement to run unedited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKGXrbaBWEAC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;lpg=PA507&amp;dq=Barry+Commoner+Bullshit| title=Communication Law in America |author=Paul Siegel | publisher=Paul Siegel | pages=507–508 | year=2007 | isbn=0-7425-5387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harry Frankfurt's concept===
In his essay ''[[On Bullshit]]'' (originally written in 1986, and published as a monograph in 2005), philosopher [[Harry Frankfurt]] of [[Princeton University]] characterizes bullshit as a form of falsehood distinct from lying. The liar, Frankfurt holds, knows and cares about the truth, but deliberately sets out to mislead instead of telling the truth. The "bullshitter", on the other hand, does not care about the truth and is only seeking to impress:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tauroscatology.com/frankfurt.htm |title=Harry Frankfurt on bullshit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308024618/http://www.tauroscatology.com/frankfurt.htm |archivedate=2005-03-08 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction. A person who lies is thereby responding to the truth, and he is to that extent respectful of it. When an honest man speaks, he says only what he believes to be true; and for the liar, it is correspondingly indispensable that he considers his statements to be false. For the bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.}}

Frankfurt connects this analysis of bullshit with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s disdain of "non-sense" talk, and with the popular concept of a "bull session" in which speakers may try out unusual views without commitment. He fixes the blame for the prevalence of "bullshit" in modern society upon [[anti-realism]] and upon the growing frequency of situations in which people are expected to speak or have opinions without appropriate knowledge of the subject matter.

Several political commentators have seen that Frankfurt's concept of bullshit provides insights into  political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shafer | first = Jack | author-link = Jack Shafer | date = December 24, 2015 | title = The Limits of Fact-Checking | magazine = Politico Magazine | url = http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/12/the-limits-of-the-fact-checker-213461 | accessdate = 10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald Cohen]], in "Deeper into Bullshit", contrasted the kind of "bullshit" Frankfurt describes with a different sort: nonsense discourse presented as sense. Cohen points out that this sort of bullshit can be produced either accidentally or deliberately. While some writers do deliberately produce bullshit, a person can also aim at sense and produce nonsense by mistake; or a person deceived by a piece of bullshit can repeat it innocently, without intent to deceive others.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G.A. (2002). "Deeper into Bullshit". Originally appeared in Buss and Overton, eds., ''Contours of Agency: Themes from the Philosophy of Harry Frankfurt''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. Reprinted in Hardcastle and Reich, ''Bullshit and Philosophy'' (Chicago: Open Court, 2006), {{ISBN|0-8126-9611-5}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen gives the example of [[Alan Sokal]]'s [[Sokal Affair|"Transgressing the Boundaries"]] as a piece of ''deliberate'' bullshit. Sokal's aim in creating it, however, was to show that the "postmodernist" editors who accepted his paper for publication could not distinguish nonsense from sense, and thereby by implication that their field was "bullshit".

==In everyday language==

Outside of the [[academia|academic]] world, among [[natural language|natural]] speakers of [[North American English]], as an [[interjection]] or [[adjective]], ''bullshit'' conveys general displeasure, an objection to, or points to unfairness within, some state of affairs. This [[colloquial]] usage of "bullshit", which began in the 20th century, designates another's discourse to be rubbish or nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "Bullshit". This entry gives a cross-reference to the definition of "Bull", 4.3: "Trivial, insincere, or untruthful talk or writing; nonsense."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullshit asymmetry principle==
Publicly formulated the first time in January 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brandolini|first1=Alberto|title=Bullshit Asymmetry Principle – Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/ziobrando/status/289635060758507521 |website=Twitter.com |accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Alberto Brandolini, an Italian programmer, the bullshit asymmetry principle (also known as Brandolini's law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brandolini's law|url=http://ordrespontane.blogspot.fr/2014/07/brandolinis-law.html|website=Ordre spontané on blogspot|accessdate=1 March 2015|quote=Here is what seems to be the very first appearance of what must, from now on, be known as the Brandolini's law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Take the time and effort to correct misinformation|url=http://www.nature.com/news/take-the-time-and-effort-to-correct-misinformation-1.21106|website=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It became especially popular after a picture of a presentation by Brandolini at XP2014 on May 30, 2014, was posted on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farley|first1=Tim|title=Bullshit asymmetry principle|url=https://twitter.com/krelnik/status/472046082135162881|website=Twitter|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandolini was inspired by reading [[Daniel Kahneman]]'s ''[[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]'' right before watching an Italian political talk show with journalist [[Marco Travaglio]] and former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] attacking each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brandolini|first1=Alberto|title=Twitter reply|url=https://twitter.com/ziobrando/status/664420696886349824|website=Twitter|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brandolini|first1=Alberto|title=Twitter reply|url=https://twitter.com/ziobrando/status/666301347512324097|website=Twitter|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept, the "mountain of shit theory", was formulated by the Italian blogger Uriel Fanelli in 2010, roughly stating the same sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farley|first1=Tim|title=La Teoria della Montagna di Merda|url=https://nientestronzate.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/la-teoria-della-montagna-di-merda/|website=Blogspot|accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandolini's law emphasizes the difficulty of debunking bullshit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brandolini's law|url=http://ordrespontane.blogspot.fr/2014/07/brandolinis-law.html|website=Ordre spontané on blogspot|accessdate=1 March 2015|quote=it's not that much about the speed of dissemination of bullshit but rather about the inherent difficulty to refute bullshit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the faster propagation of bullshit is an old proverb: "a lie is halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMGPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=A+lie+is+halfway |editor=Jennifer Speake |publisher=OUP Oxford |year=2015 |isbn=978-0191059599 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]], '''confessional writing''' is a first-person style that is often presented as an ongoing diary or letters, distinguished by revelations of a person's deeper or darker motivations.

Originally, the term derived from [[Confession (religion)|confession]]: The writer is not only autobiographically recounting his life, but confessing to his sins. Among the earlier examples is [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', perhaps the first autobiography of Western Europe. In it, he not only recounted the events of his life, he wrestled with their meaning and significance, as in a passage where he tried to fathom why he had stolen pears with friends, not to eat but to throw away.

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] turned it to a secular purpose in his ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]''.

From this meaning evolved the meaning of writing that reveals more of the writer's motivations, particularly the darker reactions, and the events that are normally kept secret.

Fictionally, the confessional story is a story written, in the first person, about emotionally fraught and morally charged situations in which a [[fictional character]] is caught. These stories may be anything from thinly veiled recounting of the writer's life to completely fictional works.

With the advent of the magazine ''[[True Story (magazine)|True Story]]'' in 1919 and the imitations of it, the confessional (or romance) magazine was created, containing such stories.&lt;ref&gt;Linda M. Scott, ''Fresh Lipstick:  Redressing Fashion and Feminism'' p 158 {{ISBN|1-4039-6686-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such confessions magazines were chiefly aimed at an audience of working-class women.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Honey, ''Creating Rosie the Riveter:  Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II'', p. 139, {{ISBN|0-87023-443-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their formula has been characterized as "sin-suffer-repent": The heroine violates standards of behavior, suffers as a consequence, learns her lesson and resolves to live in light of it, not embittered by her pain.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Honey, ''Creating Rosie the Riveter:  Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II'', p. 141-43, {{ISBN|0-87023-443-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Days on market''' (DOM, alternatively '''active days on market''', '''market time''', or '''time on market''') is a measurement of the age of a [[real estate]] listing.  The statistic is defined as the total number of days the listing is on the active market before either an offer is accepted or the [[listing agreement|agreement]] between [[real estate broker]] and seller ends.

Generally, properties with a large DOM value will command lower prices than properties with few DOM because a perception exists that the property may be overpriced or less desirable. DOM often factors into developing a pricing strategy.  DOM can also be used as a "[[thermometer]]" to gauge the temperature of a [[housing market]].{{clarify|date=July 2013}}

The other use for this statistic is allowing prospective home sellers an idea of how long it may take to sell a property. The MLS is controlled by the real estate industry and has been the subject of many [[lawsuits]].

This value is not necessarily how long the house has been on the market due to intricacies within the [[multiple listing service]] (MLS) database.  Depending on the rules of the MLS that is being used, the number is reset if a seller switches real estate agents.  Sometimes there is also the arguably unethical practice of "withdrawing" the listing before it expires and adding the listing again to reset the DOM.  As a result, when this statistic is used it is often lower than the true value.  However, savvy real estate agents (if the MLS allows) will research the property's listing history and can tell more effectively how long the property has been on the market.

==DOMM==
'''Days on the Market'''- MLS ('''DOM-M''' or '''DOMM''') is the number of days this exact [[Multiple Listing Service]] (MLS) listing has been on the market.

==DOMP==
'''Days on the Market- Property''' ('''DOM-P''' or '''DOMP''') is the number of days the property has been for sale regardless of the number of different Realtors.

==Housing bubble==
Prior to the historic [[housing bubble]] that formed in or around 2001 due to loose [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and [[irrational exuberance]], the term DOMP was practically a mystery to anyone other than real estate industry insiders.

When the Housing Bubble began to rapidly deflate in late 2005, the inventory of homes for sale exploded, which caused both sales and prices to fall well below levels predicted  by leading [[economists]]. These economists were frequently separated into varying levels of respect depending on their affiliation with the REIC, because the [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR) economists were caught giving incorrect predictions about the state of the [[Real estate economics|housing market]] despite what was actually happening in many U.S cities.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Manipulating DOMP==
To prop up rapidly falling sales, [[Real estate broker|real estate agents]] across the country began to rely on the process of manipulating the amount of time that homes had been on the market more than ever to attract buyers and maintain sales prices. There were great disparities concerning the practice in the various regional MLS's across the country. Some MLS's charged real estate agents to alter the statistics,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and referred to the practice as "refreshing a listing." In general however, the old guard of the [[real estate]] industry considered the practice as deceptive at best, and fraudulent at worst. Rumors of possible lawsuits circulated in the industry because homes that had been on the market for long periods of time were considered to be overpriced and thus not worth their advertised sales prices. The practice also stood in dark contrast to the National Association of Realtor's [[ethical code|Code of Ethics]] that prohibits doing anything that is deceptive to buyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realtor.org/mempolweb.nsf/pages/code realtor.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a property might be 83 days with one Realtor, and then 10 days with another. That would show up as: DOMP/DOMM= 93/10. Some realtors will try to fudge this data to make a listing look brand new.

==Current use==
This business practice is still being carried out by the REIC and is a point of contention with bloggers calling it "deceptive".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Others maintain it is a way to acquire the attention of new customers, akin to a store moving its inventory from one location to another. MLS information like days on the market, the selling price and who were the buying agents or buyers is not available in Canada to any-one but REALTORS&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;.

In [[sport|sports]], a '''division''' is a group of teams who compete against each other for a championship.

==League system==
In sports using a [[league system]] (also known as a pyramid structure), a division consists of a group of teams who play a sport at a similar competitive level. Teams can move up to a higher division of play or drop down to a lower one via the process of [[promotion and relegation]], based on their performance in the standings at the end of the season. The existence of divisions based on level of competition ensures that teams at one competitive level can play other teams at a similar competitive level, thus creating [[parity (sports)|parity]] and more exciting matches.

==Franchise system==
In [[North America]], where sports usually operate on a [[Professional sports league organization#Structure of North American leagues (Franchise and minor league system)|franchise system]] rather than a league system, a division is a group of teams within a [[sports league|league]] which is organized along geographical lines rather than competitive success. Teams based in cities that are in a particular region of the continent are grouped together in the same division. For instance, in [[Major League Baseball]], both the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]]s have East, Central, and West divisions; the teams in each division are mostly (but not always) located in the eastern, central, and western sections of North America respectively. In a franchise system, teams are not promoted or relegated as are teams in a league system. All teams in the league (and by extension, the divisions of the league) are at the same competitive level and remain so year after year.

North American professional sports leagues often construct their season schedules in a way such that teams in a division play matches against each other more often than other teams in the league. This not only has the effect of reducing travel costs, but also creates exciting [[list of sports rivalries|rivalries]] between the teams in the division. Moreover, the top teams in a division qualify for the postseason [[playoffs|playoff]] tournament that crowns the league champion, which heightens the rivalries between the teams in a division.

Geographically-based divisions can become skewed if an [[expansion team]] joins the league or if one of the franchises within a division moves to another city, necessitating a shuffling or [[realignment (sports)|realignment]] of the teams in a division. Furthermore, the results of the realignment may not always reflect geographical realities. For instance, in 1995, the [[History of the Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) moved to [[St Louis, Missouri]] and became the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St Louis Rams]]. The team retained its place in the [[NFC West]] division despite the fact that St. Louis is further east than [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], home of the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Although Dallas is located in the south-central United States, the Cowboys are a member of the [[NFC East]] division due to their long-standing rivalries with the [[New York Giants]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and [[Washington Redskins]], all of whom are located on the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]].

==U.S. college sports==
In [[college athletics|U.S. college sports]], a "division" has a meaning different from either sense listed above, although somewhat closer to that of the league system.

The major governing bodies for college sports, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and [[National Association for Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], divide their member schools into large competitive groups. These groups are much larger than divisions in either the league or franchise system—for example, the NCAA's highest competitive level, [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], has more than 300 member schools. The vast majority of teams are members of [[List of college athletic conferences|conferences]], smaller groupings that usually have between 6 and 14 members. Conference champions, plus selected other teams, compete in national championship tournaments (with the exception of schools in [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|the highest level]] of NCAA [[college football|(American) football]], which have [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|never had an NCAA-recognized national championship]]).

As an example, the NCAA is split into three divisions:

* Division I – Usually the largest and most prominent schools, with the largest athletic budgets. All Division I member schools are allowed to award [[athletic scholarship]]s to students, although some schools and conferences voluntarily choose not to award athletic scholarships in some or all sports (most notably the [[Ivy League]], which prohibits such scholarships in all sports).
* [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] – Generally smaller schools that do not choose to take on the sometimes-massive expense of Division I athletics. The NCAA allows D-II schools to award scholarships, but places much more stringent limits on the amount of athletic aid awarded than at the D-I level.
* [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] – Schools, usually but not always small institutions, at which intercollegiate sports is treated more as a regular student activity. In keeping with this philosophy, the NCAA prohibits Division III schools from awarding athletic scholarships.

==="Division" within conferences===
The term ''division'' is also used in US college sports to indicate the groupings of members of a given [[List of college athletic conferences|conference]]. However, this usage is more recent. The first conference to divide its teams into divisions was the Southeastern Conference which, upon expanding to 12 members in 1992, divided into Eastern and Western divisions. Other conferences have undergone similar expansion and division. The usage in the section above is still maintained. For example, the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] are in Division I, but are also in the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference.

In [[proof theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], '''elementary function arithmetic''', also called '''EFA''', '''elementary arithmetic''' and '''exponential function arithmetic''', is the system of arithmetic with the usual elementary properties of 0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;, together with [[mathematical induction|induction]] for  formulas with [[bounded quantifier]]s.

EFA is a very weak logical system, whose [[proof theoretic ordinal]] is ω&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, but still seems able to prove much of ordinary mathematics that can be stated in the language of [[Peano axioms|first-order arithmetic]].

==Definition==
EFA is a system in first order logic (with equality). Its language contains:
*two constants 0, 1,
*three binary operations +, &amp;times;, exp, with exp(''x'',''y'') usually written as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;,
*a binary relation symbol &lt; (This is not really necessary as it can be written in terms of the other operations and is sometimes omitted, but is convenient for defining bounded quantifiers).

'''Bounded quantifiers''' are those of the form ∀(x&lt;y) and ∃ (x&lt;y) which are abbreviations for ∀ x (x&lt;y)→… and ∃x (x&lt;y)∧… in the usual way.

The axioms of EFA are
*The  axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]] for 0, 1, +, &amp;times;, &lt;
*The  axioms for exponentiation: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''x''.
*Induction for formulas all of whose quantifiers are bounded (but which may contain free variables).

==Friedman's grand conjecture&lt;!--'Friedman's grand conjecture' redirects here--&gt;==
[[Harvey Friedman]]'s '''grand conjecture''' implies that many mathematical theorems, such as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], can be proved in very weak systems such as EFA.

The original statement of the conjecture from {{harvtxt|Friedman|1999}} is:

: "Every theorem published in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' whose statement involves only finitary mathematical objects (i.e., what logicians call an arithmetical statement) can be proved in EFA. EFA is the weak fragment of [[Peano Arithmetic]] based on the usual quantifier-free axioms for 0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;,&amp;nbsp;exp, together with the scheme of [[mathematical induction|induction]] for all formulas in the language all of whose quantifiers are bounded."

While it is easy to construct artificial arithmetical statements that are true but not provable in EFA{{example needed}}, the point of Friedman's conjecture is that natural examples of such statements in mathematics seem to be rare. Some natural examples include consistency statements from logic, several statements related to [[Ramsey theory]] such as the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]] and the [[graph minor theorem]], and Tarjan's algorithm for the [[disjoint-set data structure]].

==Related systems==

Several related computational complexity classes have similar properties to EFA:
*One can omit the binary function symbol exp from the language, by taking Robinson arithmetic together with induction for all formulas with bounded quantifiers and an axiom stating roughly that exponentiation is a function defined everywhere. This is similar to EFA and has the same proof theoretic strength, but is more cumbersome to work with.

*There are weak fragments of second-order arithmetic called RCA{{su|p=*|b=0}} and WKL{{su|p=*|b=0}} that have the same consistency strength as EFA and are conservative over it for Π{{su|p=0|b=2}} sentences{{explain|date=November 2017}}, which are sometimes studied in [[reverse mathematics]] {{harv|Simpson|2009}}.

*'''Elementary recursive arithmetic''' ('''ERA''') is a subsystem of [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] (PRA) in which recursion is restricted to [[ELEMENTARY#Definition|bounded sums and products]]. This also has the same Π{{su|p=0|b=2}} sentences as EFA, in the sense that whenever EFA proves ∀x∃y P(x,y), with P quantifier-free, ERA proves the open formula P(x,T(x)), with T a term definable in ERA. Like PRA, ERA can be defined in an entirely logic-free{{clarify|date=November 2017}} manner, with just the rules of substitution and induction, and defining equations for all elementary recursive functions. Unlike PRA, however, the elementary recursive functions can be characterized by the closure under composition and projection of a ''finite'' number of basis functions, and thus only a finite number of defining equations are needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18813">'''Environmental security''' examines threats posed by environmental events and trends to individuals, communities or nations. It may focus on the impact of human [[War|conflict]] and [[international relations]] on the [[Natural environment|environment]], or on how environmental problems cross [[Sovereign state|state]] borders.

==General==
The [[United Nations Millennium Project|Millennium Project]] assessed definitions of environmental security and created a synthesis definition:

Environmental security is environmental viability for life support, with three sub-elements: 
*preventing or repairing military damage to the environment,
*preventing or responding to environmentally caused conflicts, and
*protecting the environment due to its inherent [[moral value]].

It considers the abilities of individuals, communities or nations to cope with [[Environmental hazard|environmental risks]], [[Climate change|changes]] or conflicts, or limited [[Natural Resources|natural resources]]. For example, climate change can be viewed a threat to environmental security. Human activity impacts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, impacting regional and global climatic and environmental changes and thus changes in agricultural output. This can lead to food shortages which will then cause political debate, ethnic tension, and civil unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Chalecki, Elizabeth. Environmental Security: A Case Study of Climate Change. Pacific Institute for Studies of Development, Environment, and Security&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental security is an important concept in two fields: [[international relations]] and [[international development]].

Within international development, projects may aim to improve aspects of environmental security such as [[food security]] or [[water security]], but also connected aspects such as [[energy security]], that are now recognised as [[Sustainable Development Goals]] at UN level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW AND BUSINESS|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targets for [[MDG]] 7 about environmental sustainability show international priorities for environmental security. Target 7B is about the security of [[fisheries]] on which many people depend for [[food]]. Fisheries are an example of a resource that cannot be contained within state borders. A conflict before the [[International Court of Justice]] between Chile and Peru about maritime borders and their associated fisheries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/9/091.html |title=Maritime Dispute (Peru v. Chile) |publisher=The Hague Justice Portal |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a case study for environmental security.

==History==
The [[The Copenhagen School (international relations)|Copenhagen School]] defines the referent object of environmental security as the environment, or some strategic part of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Buzan, Ole Waever, and Jaap de Wilde, ''Security: A New Framework for Analysis'' (Boulder: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the definition of [[international security]] has varied over time. After [[World War II]], definitions typically focused on the subject of [[realpolitik]] that developed during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]].

As tensions between the superpowers eased after the collapse of the Soviet Union, academic discussions of definitions of security significantly expanded to encompass a far broader range of threats to peace, including, particularly, environmental threats associated with the political implications of resource use or pollution. By the mid-1980s, this field of study was becoming known as "environmental security". Despite a wide range of semantic and academic debates over terms, it is now widely acknowledged that environmental factors play both direct and indirect roles in both political disputes and violent conflicts.

In the academic sphere environmental security is defined as the relationship between security concerns such as armed conflict and the natural environment.  A small but rapidly developing field, it has become particularly relevant for those studying resource scarcity and conflict in the developing world.  Prominent early researchers in the field include [[Felix Dodds]], [[Norman Myers]], [[Jessica Tuchman Mathews]], Michael Renner, Richard Ullman, Arthur Westing, [[Michael Klare]], [[Thomas Homer Dixon]], [[Geoffrey Dabelko]], [[Peter Gleick]], Rita Floyd and [[Joseph Romm]].

===Origins===
According to Jon Barnett, environmental security emerged as an important concept in [[security studies]] because of some interrelated developments which started in 1960s. The first one was the increasing level of [[environmental consciousness]] in so called [[developed countries]].&lt;ref name=Alan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alan|first1=Collins|title=Contemporary Security Studies|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Great Britain|isbn=9780199694778|pages=190–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various occurrences and events triggered the growth of the [[environmental movement]] during this period of time. [[Rachel Carson]]'s well-known book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' was one of the extraordinary publications of that time and brought greater degree of environmental awareness among ordinary people by warning them of the dangers to all natural systems including animals and food chain from the misuse of [[chemical pesticides]] such as [[DDT]]. Whilst Carson undoubtedly contributed to public debate at the time she was arguably not amongst the more radical 'social revolutionaries' who were also urging greater public awareness of [[environmental issue]]s.&lt;ref name="Rachel Carson"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rachelcarson.org/ | title=Life and Legacy of Rachel Carson| accessdate=29 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the number of largest well-known [[environmental non-governmental organizations]] such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (1961), [[Friends of the Earth]] (1969), and [[Greenpeace]] (1971) were founded during that time.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;
 
The second notable development which brings the emergence of concept of environmental security was number of scholars started to criticize the traditional notion of security and mainstream security debates in their work from 1970s by emphasizing its inability to handle environmental problems at national and international security level.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;  First commentators were [[Richard Falk]] who published 'This Endangered Planet' (1971), and Harold and Margaret Sprout who wrote 'Toward a Politics of Planet Earth' (1971). These two commentators asserted in their book that the notion of security can no longer be centered only on military power, rather nations should collectively take measurements against common environmental problems since they pose threat to national well-being and thus international stability. These main ideas about environmental interdependence between countries and common security threat have remained key themes of environmental [[security studies]].&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richard|first1=Matthew et al|title=Global Environmental Change and Human Security|date=2010|publisher=MIT Press|location=London|isbn=9780262013406|pages=118–130|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzI5MTgzOV9fQU41?sid=8f8224fb-89c9-47f7-a3bf-f5705ce6969e@sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1=yes|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, not until Richard Ullman publishes an academic article named "Redefining Security" (1983), radical departure from the dominant security discourse haven't happened. Ullman offered the following definition of national security threat as "an action or sequence of events that (1) threatens drastically and over a relatively brief span of time to degrade the quality of life for the inhabitants of a state, or (2) threatens significantly to narrow the range of policy choices available to the government of a state, or to private, nongovernmental entities within the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Ullman|title=Redefining Security Issues|journal=International Security|date=1983|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/446023/pdf=yes|accessdate=29 September 2016|doi=10.2307/2538489}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant other scientists onward also linked the issue of security by focusing on the role of environmental degradation in causing violent conflict. Others, while recognizing the importance of environmental problems, argued that labeling them 'environmental security' was problematic and abandoned analytical rigor for normative and emotional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deudney|first=Daniel|date=2016-06-23|title=The Case Against Linking Environmental Degradation and National Security|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03058298900190031001|journal=Millennium|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=461–476|doi=10.1177/03058298900190031001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental change and national security==
Even though [[environmental degradation]] and [[climate change]] sometimes cause [[war]] and violent conflict within and between countries and other times not,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey|date=December 2008|title=Challenges and opportunities of human conflict and environmental transformation in Ecuadorian highlands|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44201034_Challenges_and_opportunities_of_human_conflict_and_environmental_transformation_in_Ecuadorian_highlands|journal=Pirineos|volume=163|pages=63–75|via=|doi=10.3989/pirineos.2008.v163.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can weaken the national security of the state in number of profound ways. [[Environmental change]] can undermine the economic prosperity which plays big role in country’s military capacity and material power. In some [[developed countries]], and in most [[developing countries]], [[natural resources]] and [[environmental services]] tend to be important factors for [[economic growth]] and [[employment rate]].

The '''Icelandic Language Institute''' (''Íslensk málstöð''), founded in 1985, was responsible for the planning and preservation of the [[Icelandic language]].  The Icelandic Language Institute was a department within the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture of [[Iceland]], and its role was to officially answer questions regarding characteristics of the Icelandic Language, as well as to provide benchmarks and guidelines for educators of Icelandic.

Starting in 1997, The Icelandic Language Institute created a database on the internet, which contained 52 special glossaries compiled for use in specific areas of focus.  While all of these glossaries contain Icelandic words, some are bilingual, including terms taken from [[English language|English]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]], among other languages.

In September 2006, The Icelandic Language Institute was merged with four other institutes to form the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12783">{{Redirect|Predicativism|the other school of philosophy, also known as predicativism|Ultrafinitism}}
Something that is '''impredicative''', in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], is a [[self reference|self-referencing]] [[definition]]. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.

The opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratified]] (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is [[intuitionistic type theory]], which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.

[[Russell's paradox]] is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The [[paradox]] is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be  asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.

The [[greatest lower bound]] of a set {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|glb({{var|X}})}}, also has an impredicative definition: {{math|1={{var|y}} = glb({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and any {{math|{{var|z}}}} less than or equal to all elements of {{math|{{var|X}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|y}}}}. This definition quantifies over the set (potentially [[infinite set|infinite]], depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, one of which being the glb itself. Hence '''predicativism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would reject this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quotebox|width=30%
|quote=Norms (containing one variable) which do not define classes I propose to call ''non-predicative'';
those which do define classes I shall call ''predicative''. 
|source={{harv|Russell|1907|loc=p.34}} (Russell used "norm" to mean a proposition: roughly something that can take the values "true" or "false".)
}}

The terms "predicative" and "impredicative" were introduced by {{harvtxt|Russell|1907}}, though the meaning has changed a little since then. 

[[Solomon Feferman]] provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vicious circle principle]] was suggested by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905-6, 1908)&lt;ref&gt;dates derived from Kleene 1952:42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called ''impredicative''.

The first modern paradox appeared with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]]'s 1897 ''A question on transfinite numbers''&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) ''A question on transfinite numbers'' in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) ''Letter to Dedekind'' in van Heijenoort 1967:113&lt;/ref&gt; and would become known as the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) "naive" set theory and this become known as [[Cantor's paradox]]. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's ''Lettern to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; with his reading of [[Frege]]'s treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:
{{quote|On the other hand, it may be also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' in van Heijenoort 1967:23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, given {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} the function {{math|{{var|f}}}} is the variable and {{math|{{var|a}}}} is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} for {{math|{{var|f}}}} itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:
{{quote|You state ... that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let {{math|{{var|w}}}} be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can {{math|{{var|w}}}} be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. There we must conclude that {{math|{{var|w}}}} is not a predicate. Likewise, there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell's 1902 ''Letter to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124-125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:
{{quote|Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that "The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in ''The principles of mathematics'' (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...".&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by "propounding his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a ''predicative'' function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments".&lt;ref&gt;Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;/ref&gt; But this "axiom" was met with resistance from all quarters.

The rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the [[natural number]]s as classically understood) leads to the position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as predicativism, advocated by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in his ''Das Kontinuum''. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.

[[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 "A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering"{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}} presents an entire section "b. ''Objection concerning nonpredicative definition''" where he argued against "Poincaré (1906, p.&amp;nbsp;307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt; He gives two examples of impredicative definitions &amp;ndash; (i) the notion of [[Dedekind chain]]s and (ii) "in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers {{math|{{var|Z}}}} is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190–191&lt;/ref&gt; He ends his section with the following observation: "A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:191&lt;/ref&gt;

Zermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of [[Least upper bound]] in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 ''Das Kontinuum'' (''The Continuum'') to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the "theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set {{math|M}} of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] argued that "impredicative" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of "tallest person in the room" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: {{math|1={{var|y}} = min({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and {{math|{{var|y}}}} is in {{math|{{var|X}}}}.

Burgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of [[Frege]]'s logic, [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second order arithmetic]], and [[axiomatic set theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23525">'''Individual variation in second-language acquisition''' is the study of why some people [[Second-language acquisition|learn a second language]] better than others. Unlike children who [[Language acquisition|acquire a language]], adults learning a [[second language]] rarely reach the same level of competence as [[First language|native speakers]] of that language. Some may stop studying a language before they have fully internalized it, and others may stop improving despite living in a foreign country for many years. It also appears that children are more likely than adults to reach native-like competence in a second language. There have been many studies that have attempted to explain these phenomena.

A flurry of studies in the 1970s, often labelled the "good language learner studies", sought to identify the distinctive factors characteristic of successful learners. Although those studies are now widely regarded as simplistic, they did serve to identify a number of factors affecting language acquisition. More detailed research on many of these specific factors continues today. For this reason, ''individual variation in second-language acquisition'' is not generally considered a single area of research. Rather, it is simply a convenient way to categorize studies about [[language aptitude]], [[Critical period hypothesis|age and language learning]], strategy use, and affective factors that affect language acquisition.

==Language aptitude==
{{main|Language-learning aptitude}}
There are two definitions that help explain individual difference variables. The first is predictive, language aptitude is related to a set of cognitive abilities. These cognitive abilities, allow one to predict how well an individual can learn a foreign language. These abilities change under limited time and circumstances. The second definition is interactional. It views language aptitude as comprehension abilities during second language learning. Aptitude is or can be subject to change according to an environment. It highlights that no specific instruction works for all second language learners. Therefore, in order for an individual to grasp a second language, there must be an adaption. Where the learner’s abilities can flourish under different learning conditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shaofeng|date=2014-10-07|title=The Associations Between Language Aptitude and Second Language Grammar Acquisition: A Meta-Analytic Review of Five Decades of Research|url=https://academic.oup.com/applij/article/36/3/385/2422456|journal=Applied Linguistics|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=385–408|doi=10.1093/applin/amu054|issn=1477-450X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis brought to light that the importance of aptitude is an overestimate when it comes to grammatical capability. In specific conditions, language aptitude is a conscious construct which affects learning results. Language aptitude can be useful in predicting the beginning stages of second language learning, when it comes to grammatical competence, but it is not a reliable way to learning stages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tests of language aptitude have proven extremely effective in predicting which learners will be successful in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bylund et al., 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, considerable controversy remains about whether language aptitude is properly regarded as a unitary concept, an organic property of the brain, or as a complex of factors including motivation and short-term memory. Research has generally shown that language aptitude is quite distinct from general aptitude or [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], as measured by various tests, and is itself fairly consistently measurable by different tests.

Language aptitude research is often criticized for being irrelevant to the problems of language learners, who must attempt to learn a language regardless of whether they are gifted for the task or not. This claim is reinforced by research findings that aptitude is largely unchangeable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In addition, traditional language aptitude measures such as the [[Modern Language Aptitude Test]] strongly favor decontextualized knowledge of the sort used in taking tests, rather than the sort used in [[conversation]]. For this reason little research is carried out on aptitude today. However, operators of selective language programs such as the United States [[Defense Language Institute]] continue to use language aptitude testing as part of applicant screening.

==Age==
{{Main|Critical period hypothesis}}

How children acquire native language (L1) and the relevance of this to foreign language (L2) learning has long been debated. Although evidence for L2 learning ability declining with age is controversial, a common notion is that children learn L2s easily and older learners rarely achieve fluency. This assumption stems from ‘[[critical period]]’ (CP) ideas. A CP was popularised by [[Eric Lenneberg]] in 1967 for L1 acquisition, but considerable interest now surrounds age effects on second-language acquisition (SLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lenneberg|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; SLA theories explain learning processes and suggest causal factors for a possible CP for SLA, mainly attempting to explain apparent differences in language aptitudes of children and adults by distinct learning routes, and clarifying them through psychological mechanisms. Research explores these ideas and hypotheses, but results are varied: some demonstrate pre-pubescent children acquire language easily, and some that older learners have the advantage, and yet others focus on existence of a CP for SLA. Recent studies have recognised that certain aspects of SLA may be affected by age, though others remain intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayberry|Lock|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of specific ages, Steven Pinker and colleagues conducted a large-scale internet study aimed at measuring individual’s age, English proficiency, and amount of time spent practicing English. The findings suggest that the ability to learn a new language with fluency declines after age 18 and must begin by age 10.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web-b-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.csusm.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=399732ea-3c49-4c1b-9929-df3c587aaf2c@sessionmgr120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=130152662&amp;db=aph|title=EZProxy Login {{!}} CSUSM University Library|website=web-b-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.csusm.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main factors why our ability to acquire a new language declines after the age of 18.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; First, significant social changes usually occur at the age of 18. For example, during this period of time individuals may be heading off to college or entering the workforce. As a result, less time is dedicated towards learning a new language. Secondly, an individual’s primary language may impede the development of a newer language. The grammatical rules of our first language become more readily available in our minds as we are exposed to our first language in larger quantities. Lastly, our brains are still developing. In this case, learning becomes more difficult because the brain is undergoing significant changes during our late teenage years and early-20’s.

==Strategy use==
The effective use of strategies has been shown to be critical to successful language learning, so much so that Canale and Swain (1980) included "strategic competence" among the four components of [[communicative competence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Canale|Swain|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Research here has also shown significant [[#Pedagogical effects|pedagogical effects]]. This has given rise to "[[strategies-based instruction]]."

Strategies are commonly divided into [[Language learning strategies|learning strategies]] and [[communicative strategy|communicative strategies]], although there are other ways of categorizing them. Learning strategies are techniques used to improve learning, such as [[mnemonics]] or using a [[dictionary]]. Learners (and native speakers) use communicative strategies to get meaning across even when they lack access to the correct language: for example, by using [[pro-form]]s like "thing", or non-spoken means such as [[mime artist|mime]]. Communicative strategies may not have any direct bearing on learning, and some strategies such as avoidance (not using a form with which one is uncomfortable) may actually hinder learning.

Children use their own strategies of cross reference to learn second languages. A longitudinal study investigated preschool children in an environment where they were exposed to English as a second language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Raquel|date=April 2004|title=Phonological acquisition in preschoolers learning a second language via immersion: A longitudinal study|url=https://plu.mx/a/?ebsco-client=&amp;doi=10.1080/0269920042000193571&amp;pmid=15151191|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|language=|volume=18|pages=183-210|doi=10.1080/0269920042000193571&amp;pmid=15151191|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was noted was that the children applied the knowledge from their first language, using patterns to develop their phonology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was seen that mere immersion and rehearsal was an effective way for the children to increase their proficiency of their second language. 

Learners from different [[culture]]s use strategies in different ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hadzibeganovic|Cannas|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as a research tradition led by [[Rebecca Oxford]] has demonstrated. Related to this are differences in strategy use between male and female learners. Numerous studies have shown that female learners typically use strategies more widely and intensively than males; this may be related to the statistical advantage which female learners enjoy in language learning.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Different learning strategies have been evaluated and tested to determine the efficacy of their methods. 

A strategy that was found effective with English speaking Chinese learners was the use of a virtual environment. A virtual environment consists of a digital world in which a person may experience whatever is programmed. A virtual environment was created using the online virtual world known as Second Life, where the users could interact with objects, learning the words and sounds simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lan |first1=Yu-Ju |last2=Fang |first2=Shin-Yi |last3=Legault |first3=Jennifer |last4=Li |first4=Ping |title=Second language acquisition of Mandarin Chinese vocabulary: context of learning effects |journal=Educational Technology Research and Development |date=May 29, 2015 |volume=63 |issue=5 |page=671-690 |doi=10.1007/s11423-015-9380-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning strategy was found to be significantly more effective than traditional methods of displaying solely an image and sound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A similar study was done immersing Chinese learners in a virtual environment and found visualization of the objects increased the learning proficiency and scores on the proficiency test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsiao|first=Indy Y. T.|last2=Lan|first2=Yu-Ju|last3=Kao|first3=Chia-Ling|last4=Li|first4=Ping|date=2017|title=Visualization Analytics for Second Language Vocabulary Learning in Virtual Worlds|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/90002172|journal=Journal of Educational Technology &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=161–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the two studies suggest an advantage when using a virtual environment juxtaposed to traditional methods among Chinese learners.

==Affective factors==
Affective factors relate to the learner's emotional state and attitude toward the target language. Research on affect in language learning is still strongly influenced by [[Bloom's taxonomy]], which describes the affective levels of receiving, responding, valuing, organization, and self-characterization through one's value system. It has also been informed in recent years by research in [[neurobiology]] and [[neurolinguistics]]. A research study conducted by Ni (2012), was interested in the role that affective factors played in second-language acquisition (SLA).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ni|first=Hui|date=July 2012|title=The effects of affective factors in SLA and pedagogical implications|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8d1a/804def9080d8055ef2d673c00212eca4bde8.pdf|journal=Theory and Practice in Language Studies|volume=2|pages=1508-1513|via=doi:10.4304/tpls.2.7.1508-1513}}&lt;/ref&gt;Additionally, she wanted to know how to apply this knowledge to the context of an educational setting. For example, many instructors want to create lessons for students that facilitate the process of learning a new foreign language. The study Ni (2012) conducted sought to find what important skills students could implement in their SLA pursuits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 10-item questionnaire was administered to 50 students enrolled in the Foreign Language Department at Heze University in China. The questions collected data on participants’ English fluency, affective factors influence in their SLA, and the preferred method of feedback from their instructor. The main findings displayed how affective factors (e.g. motivation, self-confidence, and anxiety) may advance the acquisition of English as a second language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By using this knowledge, teachers can strengthen their students’ emotional states and create a more welcoming class environment. In doing so, students may be able to acquire a second language more effectively.

===Affective Filter===
{{main|Affective filter}}
Furthermore, researchers believe that language learners all possess an affective filter which affects language acquisition.  If a student possesses a high filter they are less likely to engage in language learning because of shyness, concern for grammar or other factors.  Students possessing a lower affective filter will be more likely to engage in learning because they are less likely to be impeded by other factors.  The affective filter is an important component of second-language learning.

===Anxiety===
Although some continue to propose that a low level of anxiety may be helpful, studies have almost unanimously shown that [[anxiety]] damages students' prospects for successful learning. Anxiety is often related to a sense of threat to the learner's self-concept in the learning situation, for example if a learner fears being ridiculed for a mistake.

===Personality factors===
Second-language acquisition is defined as the learning and adopting of a language that is not the learner's native language.
Studies{{Vague|date=August 2010}} have shown that [[extrovert]]s acquire a second language better than [[introvert]]s.

One particular study done by Naiman{{vague|date=November 2010}} reflected this point.  The subjects were 72 Canadian high school students from grades 8, 10 and 12 who were studying French as a second language.

Naiman gave them all questionnaires to establish their psychological profiles, which also included a French listening test and imitation test.  He found that approximately 70% of the students with the higher grades (B or higher) would consider themselves extroverts.

Extroverts will be willing to try to communicate even if they are not sure they will succeed.  Two scientists, Kinginger and Farrell, conducted interviews with U.S. students after their study abroad program in France in 2003.{{citation broken|date=November 2010}}  They found that many of the students would avoid interaction with the native speakers at all costs, while others jumped at the opportunity to speak the language. Those who avoided interaction were typically quiet, reserved people (i.e., introverts).

Logically, [[anxiety]] will cause students not to try and advance their skills, especially when they feel they are under pressure.  Just the lack of practice will make introverts less likely to fully acquire the second language.

===Social effects===
The process of language learning can be very stressful, and the impact of positive or negative [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s from the surrounding society can be critical. One aspect that has received particular attention is the relationship of [[gender role]]s to language achievement. Studies across numerous [[culture]]s have shown that women, on the whole, enjoy an advantage over men. Some have proposed that this is linked to gender roles. Doman notes in a journal devoted to issues of Cultural effects on SLA, "Questions abound about what defines SLA, how far its borders extend, and what the attributions and contributions of its research are. Thus, there is a great amount of heterogeneity in the entire conceptualization of SLA. Some researchers tend to ignore certain aspects of the field, while others scrutinize those same aspects piece by piece."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doman|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Community]] attitudes toward the language being learned can also have a profound impact on Second Language Acquisition. Where the community has a broadly negative view of the target language and its speakers, or a negative view of its relation to them, learning is typically much more difficult. This finding has been confirmed by research in numerous contexts. A widely cited example is the difficulty faced by [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] children in learning [[English language learning and teaching|English as a second language]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Other common social factors include the attitude of parents toward language study, and the nature of [[group dynamics]] in the language classroom. Additionally, early attitudes may strengthen motivation and facility with language in general, particularly with early exposure to the language. All these sum up to affect learners' acquisition of the target language and learners' language/ code choice when multiple varieties of a (second) language are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leung|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
{{Main|Motivation in second-language learning}}
The role of [[motivation]] in SLA has been the subject of extensive scholarship, closely influenced by work in motivational [[psychology]]. Motivation is internally complex, and Dörnyei begins his work by stating that "strictly speaking, ''there is no such thing as motivation.''"&lt;ref name="dornyei2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dörnyei|2001|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different kinds of motivation; these are often divided into types such as integrative or instrumental, intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation refers to the desire to do something for an internal reward. Most studies have shown it to be substantially more effective in long-term language learning than extrinsic motivation, for an external reward such as high grades or praise. Integrative and instrumental orientations refer to the degree that a language is learned "for its own sake" (integratively) or for instrumental purposes. Studies have not consistently shown either form of motivation to be more effective than the other, and the role of each is probably conditioned by various personality and cultural factors.

Some research has shown that motivation correlates strongly with proficiency, indicating both that successful learners are motivated and that success improves motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Shatz, I. [http://itamarshatz.me/wp-content/uploads/Parameters-for-Assessing-the-Effectiveness-of-Language-Learning-Strategies.pdf "Parameters for Assessing the Effectiveness of Language Learning Strategies"], ''Journal of Language and Cultural Education'', 2(3), 96–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus motivation is not fixed, but is strongly affected by [[feedback]] from the environment. Accordingly, the study of motivation in SLA has also examined many of the [[Second-language acquisition#Learner-external factors|external factors]] discussed above, such as the effect of instructional techniques on motivation. An accessible summary of this research can be found in Dörnyei (2001).&lt;ref name="dornyei2001" /&gt;

In their research on [[willingness to communicate]], MacIntyre et al. have shown that motivation is not the final construct before learners engage in communication. In fact, learners may be highly motivated yet remain unwilling to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacIntyre|Clément|Dörnyei|Noels|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union Lifelong learning programme has funded a project to research and build a set of best practices to motivate adult language learners, called [http://dontgiveup.eu/ Don't Give Up]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5864">'''Indoor games and sports''' are a variety of structured forms of play or competitive physical activity, typically carried out either in the home or in specially constructed indoor facilities.

==Card games==
{{Main|Card game}}

Most card games are played with a pack of 52 [[playing card]]s, which are divided equally into four [[Suit (cards)|suits]]: spades, clubs, hearts and diamonds. Each suit has the numbers 2 to 10 followed by the picture cards – '''J'''oker, '''Q'''ueen and '''K'''ing – and the [[ace]] with a single pip. In some games the ace is treated as a 1, in others as better than a king. In English language packs, the picture cards are marked J, Q, K and the ace '''A'''.

Amongst the most popular card games are ‘trump-and-trick’ games, which include [[whist]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]]. In games of this kind the ace usually ranks highest, followed by the picture cards and number cards in descending order. One suit is made trumps, which means that cards of that suit beat any card of another suit. One player leads (plays the first card) and the others must follow suit (play a card of the same suit) if they can. Each round or trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, but if a player cannot follow suit, they may play a trump and the highest trump wins. The winner is the player or team that wins the most tricks.

Playing cards came to Europe from the [[Muslim]] world in the 14th century. At that time the suit signs were swords, batons, coins and cups, which are still used in some countries. [[India]], [[China]] and [[Korea]] also have traditional packs of playing cards. The Indian [[ganjifa]] cards are usually round, and have 8, 10  12 cards each. [[Chinese playing cards]] are very small and narrower than European cards.

==Board games==
{{Main|Board game}}

Many different kinds of board games are played throughout the world, and many of them have been popular for hundreds of years. A few board games are decided by chance or luck alone, but most require some amount of skill on the part of the players. Games of pure chance are usually ‘race’ games, such as the children’s game snakes and ladders which was invented by [[Jaques of London|Jaques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jaquesamerica.com/about-jaques-london |title=Jaques Of america's Official U.S site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner – the player who reaches a certain square first – is decided by throwing numbered dice, over which the players have no control.

Games such as [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] and [[backgammon]] are a mixture of chance and skill. Even though luck (usually the throw of dice) plays a part, choices made by the players in the course of the game also help to decide the winner. Backgammon is one of the oldest board games that people still play. Its name comes from the Saxon (it means ‘back game’ because sometimes pieces have to go back to the beginning), but the Romans played this game too.

Luck plays little or no part in games of skill – the outcome is decided by the players’ ability to make the most advantageous moves available. Such games are often ‘war’ games, which involve capturing an opponent’s pieces. The most popular of all such games today is chess. [[Chess]] is a game of great skill that calls for the ability to plan moves and recognize threats several steps ahead. Each player has an ‘army’ of 16 pieces with which to fight a battle. There are six different kinds of piece – king, queen, bishop, knight, rook and pawn – and each has its own special way of moving about the board. If a player moves onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, that piece is captured and removed from the board. The object of the game is to trap (checkmate) the enemy king by putting it in a position where it cannot escape capture.

==Table-top games==
{{See also|Tabletop game}}

Various indoor games, including billiards, snooker and pool, are played on a large, flat, cloth-covered table with six pockets. In these games, each of the two players tries to pot the balls (knock them into the pockets) by striking them with a cue-ball, which is hit with the tip of a stick called a cue.
     
In ''[[billiards]]'', there are just three balls: a white cue-ball for each player and one red ball. Points are scored by potting the balls, by sending the cue-ball into a pocket ‘in off’ one of the other balls, or by getting the cue-ball to hit both the other balls (a cannon). The winner is the player who reaches an agreed score first, or who has the highest score after a certain time.

In ''[[snooker]]'' there are 22 balls: 1 cue-ball, 15 reds and 6 colours. A player must first pot one of the red balls (scoring 1 point) and then one of the colours, which are worth between 2 points (yellow) and 7 (black). The colour ball is put back on the table, and the player tries to put another red. The turn or break continues until the player fails to score or plays a foul shot. When all the reds have gone, the colours are potted in sequence from yellow to black, which marks the end of the game or frame. The winner of the frame is the player with the most points. Most professional matches are decided over a fixed number of frames.

==Indoor sports==
Indoor sports complexes are springing up around the country (ex: [http://www.southshoresportscomplex.com South Shore Sports Complex in Oceanside, NY]). These complexes often provide a Turf Field that allows a wide variety of typically outdoor sports to be played indoors. These turf fields are large and has a grassy texture to it without the maintenance required to keep it green and plush. Many sports are being played on this type of service, such as soccer, baseball, flag football, shooting softball, lacrosse, rugby, and many others.

The '''Irish language''' ({{lang|ga|Gaeilge}}), also sometimes referred to as '''Gaelic''' or the '''Irish Gaelic language''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Gaelic|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=Definition : Gaelic|accessdate=5 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216101948/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Gaelic|archive-date=16 December 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic language]] (Gaelic) of the [[Indo-European language family]] originating in [[Ireland]] and historically spoken by the [[Irish people]]. Irish is spoken as a [[first language]] in substantial areas of counties Galway, Kerry, Cork and Donegal, smaller areas of Waterford, Mayo and Meath, and a few other locations, and as a [[second language]] by a larger group of non-habitual speakers across the country.

Irish has been the predominant language of the Irish people for most of their recorded history, and they brought it with them to other regions, notably [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]], where [[Middle Irish]] gave rise to [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]] respectively. It has [[Early Irish literature|the oldest vernacular literature]] in [[Western Europe]].

Irish has [[Constitution of Ireland|constitutional]] status as the [[Languages of Ireland|national and first official language]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and is an officially recognised [[Languages of Northern Ireland|minority language in Northern Ireland]]. It is also among the official [[languages of the European Union]]. The public body [[Foras na Gaeilge]] is responsible for the promotion of the language throughout the island of Ireland.

==Names==
In {{lang|ga|[[#An Caighdeán Oifigiúil|An Caighdeán Oifigiúil]]}} (the official written standard) the name of the language is {{lang|ga|Gaeilge}} ({{IPA-ga|ˈɡeːlʲɟə}}). Before the spelling reform of 1948, this form was spelled {{lang|ga|Gaedhilge}}; originally this was the [[genitive case|genitive]] of {{lang|ga|Gaedhealg}}, the form used in [[History of the Irish language#Early Modern Irish|Classical Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dinneen |first=Patrick S. |authorlink=Patrick S.

The modern spelling results from the deletion of the silent ''dh'' in the middle of ''Gaedhilge'', whereas [[Goidelic]], used to refer to the language family including Irish, is derived from the Old Irish term.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Irish language}}

Written Irish is first attested in [[Ogham]] inscriptions from the 4th century AD, a stage of the language known as [[Primitive Irish]]. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into [[Old Irish]] through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the [[Latin alphabet]] and is attested primarily in [[marginalia]] to Latin manuscripts. During this time, the Irish language absorbed some [[Latin]] words, some via [[Old Welsh]], including ecclesiastical terms: examples are ''easpag'' (bishop) from {{smallcaps|episcopus}}, and ''Domhnach'' (Sunday, from {{smallcaps|dominica}}).

By the 10th century, Old Irish had evolved into [[Middle Irish]], which was spoken throughout Ireland and in [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. It is the language of a large corpus of literature, including the [[Ulster Cycle]]. From the 12th century, Middle Irish began to evolve into modern Irish in Ireland, into [[Scottish Gaelic]] in Scotland, and into the [[Manx language]] in the [[Isle of Man]]. Early Modern Irish, dating from the 13th century, was the basis of the literary language of both Ireland and Gaelic-speaking Scotland. Modern Irish, as attested in the work of such writers as [[Geoffrey Keating]], may be said to date from the 17th century, and was the medium of popular literature from that time on.

From the 18th century on, the language lost ground in the east of the country. The reasons behind this shift were complex but came down to a number of factors:

* Discouragement of its use by Anglo-British administrations.
* The Catholic church supporting the use of English over Irish.
* The spread of bilingualism from the 1750s, resulting in [[language shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=De Fréine|first=Seán|title=The Great Silence: The Study of a Relationship Between Language and Nationality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2NiAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Irish Books &amp; Media|isbn=978-0-85342-516-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a change characterised by [[diglossia]] (two languages being used by the same community in different social and economic situations) and transitional bilingualism (monoglot Irish-speaking grandparents with bilingual children and monoglot English-speaking grandchildren). By the mid-18th century, English was becoming a language of the Catholic middle class, the Catholic Church and public intellectuals, especially in the east of the country. Increasingly, as the value of English became apparent, the prohibition on Irish in schools had the sanction of parents.&lt;ref name="Ó Gráda"&gt;Ó Gráda 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Once it became apparent that immigration to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] was likely for a large portion of the population, the importance of learning English became relevant. This allowed the new immigrants to get jobs in areas other than farming. It has been estimated that, due to the immigration to the United States because of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Famine]], anywhere from a quarter to a third of the immigrants were Irish speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://blog.nyhistory.org/the-unadulterated-irish-language-irish-speakers-in-nineteenth-century-new-york/ |title="The unadulterated Irish language": Irish Speakers in Nineteenth Century New York |last=O'Reilly  |first=Edward  |date=2015-03-17 |work=New-York Historical Society |access-date=2017-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729225257/http://blog.nyhistory.org/the-unadulterated-irish-language-irish-speakers-in-nineteenth-century-new-york/ |archive-date=29 July 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish was not marginal to Ireland's modernisation in the 19th century, as often assumed. In the first half of the century there were still around three million people for whom Irish was the primary language, and their numbers alone made them a cultural and social force. Irish speakers often insisted on using the language in law courts (even when they knew English), and Irish was also common in commercial transactions. The language was heavily implicated in the "devotional revolution" which marked the standardisation of Catholic religious practice and was also widely used in a political context. Down to the time of the Great Famine and even afterwards, the language was in use by all classes, Irish being an urban as well as a rural language.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion in {{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l37VBQAAQBAJ |title=An Irish-Speaking Island: State, Religion, Community, and the Linguistic Landscape in Ireland, 1770–1870 |last=Wolf |first=Nicholas M. |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-299-30274-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This linguistic dynamism was reflected in the efforts of certain public intellectuals to counter the decline of the language. At the end of the 19th century, they launched the [[Gaelic revival]] in an attempt to encourage the learning and use of Irish, although few adult learners mastered the language.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon 2008, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle of the revival was the Gaelic League ([[Conradh na Gaeilge]]), and particular emphasis was placed on the folk tradition, which in Irish is particularly rich. Efforts were also made to develop journalism and a modern literature.

Although it has been noted that the Catholic Church played a role in the decline of the Irish language before the Gaelic Revival, the Protestant Church of Ireland also made only minor efforts to encourage use of Irish in a religious context. An Irish translation of the Old Testament by Leinsterman [[Muircheartach Óg Ó Cíonga|Muircheartach Ó Cíonga]], commissioned by [[William Bedell|Bishop Bedell]], was published after 1685 along with a translation of the New Testament. Otherwise, Anglicisation was seen as synonymous with 'civilising'" of the native Irish. Currently, modern day Irish speakers in the church are pushing for language revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ireland.anglican.org/our-faith/apck/the-irish-language-and-the-church-of-ireland|title=The Irish language and the Church of Ireland|work=Church of Ireland|access-date=2017-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710061104/https://www.ireland.anglican.org/our-faith/apck/the-irish-language-and-the-church-of-ireland|archive-date=10 July 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 census, 10.5% of respondents stated that they spoke Irish, either daily or weekly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 – Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212083359/http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|archive-date=12 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while over 70,000 people speak it as a habitual daily means of communication.

From the foundation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 (see also [[History of the Republic of Ireland]]), a degree of proficiency in Irish was required of all those newly appointed to the [[Civil Service of the Republic of Ireland]], including [[postal worker]]s, [[tax collector]]s, agricultural inspectors, [[Garda Síochána]], etc. By law if a Garda was stopped and addressed in Irish he had to respond in Irish as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ó Murchú |first=Máirtín |chapter=Aspects of the societal status of Modern Irish |pages=471–90 |editor=Martin J.

Although the Irish requirement was also dropped for wider public service jobs, Irish remains a required subject of study in all schools within the Republic which receive public money (see also [[Education in the Republic of Ireland]]). Those wishing to teach in primary schools in the State must also pass a compulsory examination called ''Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge''. The need for a pass in [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Certificate]] Irish or English for entry to the [[Garda Síochána]] (police) was introduced in September 2005, and recruits are given lessons in the language during their two years of training. The most important official documents of the Irish government must be published in both Irish and English or Irish alone (in accordance with the Official Languages Act 2003, enforced by ''An Coimisinéir Teanga'', the Irish language ombudsman).

The [[National University of Ireland]] requires all students wishing to embark on a degree course in the NUI federal system to pass the subject of Irish in the Leaving Certificate or [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]]/[[GCSE]] examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nui.ie/college/entry-requirements.asp |title=NUI Entry Requirements – Ollscoil na hÉireann – National University of Ireland |publisher=Nui.ie |date= |accessdate=7 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705142738/http://www.nui.ie/college/entry-requirements.asp |archive-date=5 July 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exemptions are made from this requirement for students born outside of the Republic of Ireland, those who were born in the Republic but completed primary education outside it, and students diagnosed with [[dyslexia]]. [[NUI Galway]] is required to appoint people who are competent in the Irish language, as long as they are also competent in all other aspects of the vacancy to which they are appointed. This requirement is laid down by the University College Galway Act, 1929 (Section 3).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA35Y1929S3.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130121122/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA35Y1929S3.html|date=30 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University faced controversy, however, in 2016 when it was announced that the next president of the University would not have any Irish. [[Misneach]] staged a number of protests against this decision. It was announced in September 2017 that Ciarán Ó hÓgartaigh, a fluent Irish speaker, will be NUIG's 13th president.

For a number of years there has been vigorous debate in political, academic and other circles about the failure of most students in mainstream (English-medium) schools to achieve competence in the language, even after fourteen years of school instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/academic-claims-the-forced-learning-of-irish-has-failed-118356.html |title=Academic claims the forced learning of Irish 'has failed' |date=19 January 2006 |work=Independent.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/education/end-compulsory-irish-says-fg-as-14000-drop-subject-118897.html |title=End compulsory Irish, says FG, as 14,000 drop subject |last=Regan |first=Mary |date=2010-05-04 |work=Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donncha Ó hÉallaithe: "Litir oscailte chuig Enda Kenny": [http://www.beo.ie/alt-litir-oscailte-chuig-enda-kenny-td.aspx BEO.ie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120013022/http://www.beo.ie/alt-litir-oscailte-chuig-enda-kenny-td.aspx |date=20 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concomitant decline in the number of traditional native speakers has also been a cause of great concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/study-sees-decline-of-irish-in-gaeltacht-1.949907 |title=Study sees decline of Irish in Gaeltacht |last=Siggins |first=Lorna |date=16 July 2007 |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nollaig Ó Gadhra, 'The Gaeltacht and the Future of Irish, ''Studies'', Volume 90, Number 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsh Robert and Stewart, Bruce (1996).

There is, however, a growing body of Irish speakers in urban areas, most coming through the  ''[[Gaelscoil|Gaelscoilenna]]'', national schools, and a small number of secondary schools, in which Irish is the sole language of instruction. These Irish-medium schools send a much higher{{clarify|date=October 2018}} proportion of pupils on to third-level education than do "mainstream" schools, and it seems increasingly possible that, within a generation, non-Gaeltacht habitual users of Irish will typically be members of an urban, middle class and highly-educated minority.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion and the conclusions reached in 'Language and Occupational Status: Linguistic Elitism in the Irish Labour Market,’ The Economic and Social Review, Vol. 40, No. 4, Winter, 2009, pp. 435–460: [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html Ideas.repec.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329152128/https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html |date=29 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parliamentary legislation is supposed to be available in both Irish and English but is frequently only available in English.

====Gaeltacht====
{{Main|Gaeltacht}}
[[File:Gaeltacht.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|Official [[Gaeltacht]] areas]]
There are rural areas of Ireland where Irish is still spoken daily to some extent as a [[first language]]. These regions are known individually and collectively as the [[Gaeltacht]], or in the plural as ''Gaeltachtaí''. While the Gaeltacht's fluent Irish speakers, whose numbers have been estimated at twenty or thirty thousand,&lt;ref name="Siggins 5"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Only 25% of Gaeltacht households fluent in Irish – survey|last=Siggins|first=Lorna|date=6 January 2003|work=The Irish Times |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a minority of the total number of fluent Irish speakers, they represent a higher concentration of Irish speakers than other parts of the country and it is only in Gaeltacht areas that Irish continues, to some extent, to be spoken as a community vernacular.
[[File:Percentage stating they speak Irish daily outside the education system in the 2011 census.png|thumb|upright=1.13|The percentage of respondents who said they spoke Irish daily outside the education system in the 2011 census in the State.]]
According to data compiled by the [[Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs]], only one quarter of households in officially Gaeltacht areas are fluent in Irish. The author of a detailed analysis of the survey, Donncha Ó hÉallaithe of the [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]], described the Irish language policy followed by Irish governments as a "complete and absolute disaster". ''[[The Irish Times]]'', referring to his analysis published in the Irish language newspaper ''[[Foinse]]'', quoted him as follows: "It is an absolute indictment of successive Irish Governments that at the foundation of the Irish State there were 250,000 fluent Irish speakers living in Irish-speaking or semi Irish-speaking areas, but the number now is between 20,000 and 30,000".&lt;ref name="Siggins 5"/&gt;

In the 1920s, when the [[Irish Free State]] was founded, Irish was still a vernacular in some western coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;Hindley 1991, Map 7: Irish speakers by towns and distinct electoral divisions, census 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, areas where more than 25% of the population spoke Irish were classified as Gaeltacht. Today, the strongest Gaeltacht areas, numerically and socially, are those of South [[Connemara]], the west of the [[Dingle Peninsula]] and northwest Donegal, where many residents still use Irish as their primary language. These areas are often referred to as the {{lang|ga|Fíor-Ghaeltacht}} ("true Gaeltacht"), a term originally officially applied to areas where over 50% of the population spoke Irish.

There are larger Gaeltacht regions in [[County Galway]] ({{lang|ga|Contae na Gaillimhe}}), including Connemara ({{lang|ga|Conamara}}), the [[Aran Islands]] ({{lang|ga|Oileáin Árann}}), [[Carraroe]] ({{lang|ga|An Cheathrú Rua}}) and [[Spiddal]] ({{lang|ga|An Spidéal}}), on the west coast of [[County Donegal]] ({{lang|ga|Contae Dhún na nGall}}), and on the [[Dingle Peninsula|Dingle]] ({{lang|ga|Corca Dhuibhne}}) and [[Iveragh Peninsula]]s ({{lang|ga|Uibh Rathach}}) in [[County Kerry]] ({{lang|ga|Contae Chiarraí}}).

Smaller ones also exist in Counties [[County Mayo|Mayo]] ({{lang|ga|Contae Mhaigh Eo}}), [[County Meath|Meath]] ({{lang|ga|Contae na Mí}}), [[County Waterford|Waterford]] ({{lang|ga|An Rinn, Contae Phort Láirge}}), and [[County Cork|Cork]] ({{lang|ga|Contae Chorcaí}}). [[Gweedore]] ({{lang|ga|Gaoth Dobhair}}), County Donegal, is the largest Gaeltacht parish in Ireland.

[[File:Aire-leanai.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A sign reads, ''Caution, Children'']]
Irish language summer colleges in the Gaeltacht are attended by tens of thousands of teenagers annually. Students live with Gaeltacht families, attend classes, participate in sports, go to ''[[cèilidh|céilithe]]'' and are obliged to speak Irish. All aspects of Irish culture and tradition are encouraged.

Before the partition of Ireland in 1921, Irish was recognised as a school subject and as "Celtic" in some third level institutions. Between 1921 and 1972, [[Northern Ireland]] had devolved government. During those years the political party holding power in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont Parliament]], the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), was hostile to the language.  The context of this hostility was the use of the language by nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/language/oreilly97.htm#national |title=CAIN: Issues: Language: O'Reilly, C.

The Irish language has often been used as a bargaining chip during government formation in Northern Ireland, prompting protests from organisations and groups such as [[An Dream Dearg]]. There is currently an ongoing debate in relation to the status of the language in the form of an Irish Language Act. An Dream Dearg have launched a campaign in favour of such an Act called ''Acht na Gaeilge Anois'' ("Irish Language Act Now"). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/thousands-call-for-irish-language-act-during-belfast-rally-1.3090740|title=Thousands call for Irish Language Act during Belfast rally|website=Irishtimes.com|accessdate=15 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115205211/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/thousands-call-for-irish-language-act-during-belfast-rally-1.3090740|archive-date=15 November 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Parliament===
Irish became an official language of the EU on 1 January 2007, meaning that MEPs with Irish fluency can now speak the language in the [[European Parliament]] and at committees, although in the case of the latter they have to give prior notice to a simultaneous interpreter in order to ensure that what they say can be interpreted into other languages. While an official [[Languages of the European Union|language of the European Union]], only co-decision regulations must be available in Irish for the moment, due to a renewable five-year derogation on what has to be translated, requested by the Irish Government when negotiating the language's new official status. Any expansion in the range of documents to be translated will depend on the results of the first five-year review and on whether the Irish authorities decide to seek an extension. The Irish government has committed itself to train the necessary number of translators and interpreters and to bear the related costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/spotlight/irish_en.htm |accessdate=14 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318191550/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/spotlight/irish_en.htm |archivedate=18 March 2008 |title=Is í an Ghaeilge an 21ú teanga oifigiúil den Aontas Eorpach}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derogation is expected to end completely by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/languages-culture/news/irish-to-be-given-full-official-eu-language-status/|title=Irish to be given full official EU language status|website=EURACTIV.com|accessdate=23 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924044948/https://www.euractiv.com/section/languages-culture/news/irish-to-be-given-full-official-eu-language-status/|archive-date=24 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Irish became an official language it was afforded the status of treaty language and only the highest-level documents of the EU were made available in Irish.

===Outside Ireland===
{{Main|Irish language outside Ireland|Irish language in Newfoundland}}

The Irish language was carried abroad in the modern period by a vast [[diaspora]], chiefly to [[Great Britain|Britain]] and North America, but also to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Argentina]].
The first large movements began in the 17th century, largely as a result of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], which saw many Irish sent to the [[West Indies]]. Irish emigration to the United States was well established by the 18th century, and was reinforced in the 1840s by thousands fleeing from the Famine. This flight also affected Britain. Up until that time most emigrants spoke Irish as their first language, though English was establishing itself as the primary language. Irish speakers had first arrived in Australia in the late 18th century as convicts and soldiers, and many Irish-speaking settlers followed, particularly in the 1860s. New Zealand also received some of this influx. Argentina was the only non-English-speaking country to receive large numbers of Irish emigrants, and there were few Irish speakers among them.

Relatively few of the emigrants were literate in Irish, but manuscripts in the language were brought to both Australia and the United States, and it was in the United States that the first newspaper to make significant use of Irish was established: [[An Gael|An Gaodhal]]. In Australia, too, the language found its way into print. The Gaelic revival, which started in Ireland in the 1890s, found a response abroad, with branches of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] being established in all the countries to which Irish speakers had emigrated.

The decline of Irish in Ireland and a slowing of emigration helped to ensure a decline in the language abroad, along with natural attrition in the host countries. Despite this, small groups of enthusiasts continued to learn and cultivate Irish in diaspora countries and elsewhere, a trend which strengthened in the second half of the 20th century. Today the language is taught at tertiary level in North America, Australia and Europe, and Irish speakers outside Ireland contribute to journalism and literature in the language. There are significant Irish-speaking networks in the United States and Canada;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O Broin|first=Brian|title=An Analysis of the Irish-Speaking Communities of North America: Who are they, what are their opinions, and what are their needs?|publisher=Academia|url=https://wpunj.academia.edu/Brian%C3%93Broin/Talks/61329/An_Analysis_of_the_Irish-Speaking_Communities_of_North_America_Who_are_they_what_are_their_opinions_and_what_are_their_needs|accessdate=31 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510104027/http://wpunj.academia.edu/Brian%C3%93Broin/Talks/61329/An_Analysis_of_the_Irish-Speaking_Communities_of_North_America_Who_are_they_what_are_their_opinions_and_what_are_their_needs|archive-date=10 May 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; figures released for the period 2006–2008 show that 22,279 Americans claimed to speak Irish at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = table | contribution = 1.

The Irish language is also one of the languages of the [[Celtic League]], a non-governmental organisation that promotes self-determination and Celtic identity and culture in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, [[Brittany]], [[Cornwall]] and the Isle of Man, known as the [[Celtic nations]]. It places particular emphasis on the indigenous Celtic languages. It is recognised by the United Nations as a non-governmental organisation with "Roster Status" and is part of the UN's Economic and Social Council. The organisation has branches in all the Celtic nations and in [[Patagonia]], Argentina, [[New York City]], US, and [[London]], UK.

Irish was spoken as a community language until the early 20th century on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in a form known as [[Irish language in Newfoundland|Newfoundland Irish]].

The following 2016 census data shows:&lt;blockquote&gt;The total number of people who answered ‘yes’ to being able to speak Irish in April 2016 was 1,761,420, a slight decrease (0.7 per cent) on the 2011 figure of 1,774,437. This represents 39.8 per cent of respondents compared with 41.4 in 2011... Of the 73,803 daily Irish speakers (outside the education system), 20,586 (27.9%) lived in Gaeltacht areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dialects==
Irish is represented by several traditional [[dialect]]s and by various varieties of "urban" Irish. The latter have acquired lives of their own and a growing number of native speakers. Differences between the dialects make themselves felt in stress, intonation, vocabulary and structural features.

Roughly speaking, the three major dialect areas which survive coincide roughly with the provinces of [[Munster]] ({{lang|ga|Cúige Mumhan}}), [[Connacht]] ({{lang|ga|Cúige Chonnacht}}) and [[Ulster]] ({{lang|ga|Cúige Uladh}}). Records of some dialects of [[Leinster]] (''Cúige Laighean'') were made by the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] and others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doegen.ie/taxonomy/term/21984|title=The Doegen Records Web Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908015716/https://doegen.ie/taxonomy/term/21984|archive-date=8 September 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in eastern Canada, had a form of Irish derived from the Munster Irish of the later 18th century (see [[Newfoundland Irish]]).

===Munster===
{{Main|Munster Irish}}
Munster Irish is the dialect spoken in the Gaeltacht areas of the three counties [[County Cork|Cork]] ({{lang|ga|Contae Chorcaí}}), [[County Kerry|Kerry]] ({{lang|ga|Contae Chiarraí}}), [[County Waterford|Waterford]] ({{lang|ga|Contae Phort Láirge}}).  The Gaeltacht areas of Cork can be found in [[Cape Clear Island]] ({{lang|ga|Oileán Chléire}}) and [[Muskerry]] ({{lang|ga|Múscraí}}); those of Kerry lie in [[Corca Dhuibhne]] and [[Iveragh Peninsula]]; and those of Waterford in [[Ring, County Waterford|Ring]] ({{lang|ga|An Rinn}}) and [[Old Parish]] ({{lang|ga|An Sean Phobal}}), both of which together form [[Gaeltacht na nDéise]].  Of the three counties, the Irish spoken in Cork and Kerry are quiet similar while that of Waterford is more distinct.

Some typical features of Munster Irish are:
# The use of endings to show person on verbs in parallel with a pronominal subject system, thus "I must" is in Munster {{lang|ga|caithfead}} as well as {{lang|ga|caithfidh mé}}, while other dialects prefer {{lang|ga|caithfidh mé}} ({{lang|ga|mé}} means "I"). "I was and you were" is {{lang|ga|Bhíos agus bhís}} as well as {{lang|ga|Bhí mé agus bhí tú}} in Munster, but more commonly {{lang|ga|Bhí mé agus bhí tú}} in other dialects. Note that these are strong tendencies, and the personal forms ''Bhíos'' etc. are used in the West and North, particularly when the words are last in the clause.
# Use of [[Dependent and independent verb forms|independent/dependent forms of verbs]] that are not included in the Standard. For example, "I see" in Munster is {{lang|ga|chím}}, which is the independent form – Northern Irish also uses a similar form, ''tchím''), whereas "I do not see" is {{lang|ga|ní fheicim}}, ''feicim'' being the dependent form, which is used after particles such as ''ní'' "not"). ''Chím'' is replaced by ''feicim'' in the Standard. Similarly, the traditional form preserved in Munster {{lang|ga|bheirim}} I give/{{lang|ga|ní thugaim}} is {{lang|ga|tugaim}}/{{lang|ga|ní thugaim}} in the Standard; {{lang|ga|gheibhim}} I get/{{lang|ga|ní bhfaighim}} is {{lang|ga|faighim}}/{{lang|ga|ní bhfaighim}}.
# When before -''nn'', -''m'', -''rr'', -''rd'', -''ll'' and so on, in monosyllabic words and in the stressed syllable of multisyllabic words where the syllable is followed by a consonant, some short vowels are lengthened while others are [[diphthong]]ised, thus ''ceann'' {{IPA|[caun]}} "head", ''cam'' {{IPA|[kɑum]}} "crooked", ''gearr'' {{IPA|[ɟaːr]}} "short", ''ord'' {{IPA|[oːrd]}} "sledgehammer", ''gall'' {{IPA|[ɡɑul]}} "foreigner, non-Gael", ''iontas'' {{IPA|[uːntəs]}} "a wonder, a marvel", ''compánach'' {{IPA|[kəumˈpɑːnəx]}} "companion, mate", etc.
# A [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]r construction involving {{lang|ga|ea}} "it" is frequently used. Thus "I am an Irish person" can be said ''is Éireannach mé'' and ''Éireannach is ea mé'' in Munster; there is a subtle difference in meaning, however, the first choice being a simple statement of fact, while the second brings emphasis onto the word ''Éireannach''.  In effect the construction is a type of "[[Topicalization|fronting]]".
# Both masculine and feminine words are subject to lenition after ''insan'' (''sa''/''san'') "in the", ''den'' "of the" and ''don'' "to/for the" : ''sa tsiopa'', "in the shop", compared to the Standard ''sa siopa'' (the Standard lenites only feminine nouns in the dative in these cases).
# Eclipsis of ''f'' after ''sa'': ''sa bhfeirm'', "in the farm", instead of ''san fheirm''.
# Eclipsis of ''t'' and ''d'' after preposition + singular article, with all prepositions except after ''insan'', ''den'' and ''don'': ''ar an dtigh'' "on the house", ''ag an ndoras'' "at the door".
# [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] falls in general found on the second syllable of a word when the first syllable contains a short vowel, and the second syllable contains a long vowel, diphthong, or is ''-(e)ach'', e.g. {{lang|ga|bio''rán''|italic=unset}} ("pin"), as opposed to {{lang|ga|''bio''rán|italic=unset}} in Connacht and Ulster.

===Connacht===
{{Main|Connacht Irish}}
Historically, Connacht Irish represents the westernmost remnant of a dialect area which once stretched from east to west across the centre of Ireland. The strongest dialect of Connacht Irish is to be found in [[Connemara]] and the [[Aran Islands]]. Much closer to the larger Connacht Gaeltacht is the dialect spoken in the smaller region on the border between Galway ({{lang|ga|Gaillimh}}) and Mayo ({{lang|ga|Maigh Eo}}).  There are a number of differences between the popular South Connemara form of Irish, the Mid-Connacht/Joyce Country form (on the border between Mayo and Galway) and the Achill and Erris forms in the north of the province.

Features in Connacht Irish differing from the official standard include a preference for verbal nouns ending in {{lang|ga|-achan}}, e.g. {{lang|ga|lagachan}} instead of {{lang|ga|lagú}}, "weakening". The non-standard pronunciation of the [[Gaeltacht Cois Fharraige]] area with lengthened vowels and heavily reduced endings gives it a distinct sound. Distinguishing features of Connacht and Ulster dialect include the pronunciation of word-final broad ''bh'' and ''mh'' as {{IPA|[w]}}, rather than as {{IPA|[vˠ]}} in Munster. For example, {{lang|ga|sliabh}} ("mountain") is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃlʲiəw]}} in Connacht and Ulster as opposed to {{IPA|[ʃlʲiəβ]}} in the south. In addition Connacht and Ulster speakers tend to include the "we" pronoun rather than use the standard compound form used in Munster, e.g. {{lang|ga|bhí muid}} is used for "we were" instead of {{lang|ga|bhíomar}}.

As in Munster Irish, some short vowels are lengthened and others diphthongised before -''nn'', -''m'', -''rr'', -''rd'', -''ll'', in monosyllabic words and in the stressed syllable of multisyllabic words where the syllable is followed by a consonant. This can be seen in ''ceann'' [cɑ:n] "head", ''cam'' [kɑ:m] "crooked", ''gearr'' [gʲɑ:r] "short", ''ord'' [ourd] "sledgehammer", ''gall'' [gɑ:l] "foreigner, non-Gael", ''iontas'' [i:ntəs] "a wonder, a marvel", etc. The form '-aibh', when occurring at the end of words like 'agaibh', tends to be pronounced as an 'ee' sound.

In South Connemara, for example, there is a tendency to substitute a "b" sound at the end of words ending in "bh" {{IPA|[β]}}, such as ''sibh'', ''libh'' and ''dóibh'', something not found in the rest of Connacht (these words would be pronounced respectively as "shiv," "liv" and "dófa" in the other areas). This placing of the B-sound is also present at the end of words ending in vowels, such as ''acu'' (pronounced as "acub") and ''leo'' (pronounced as "lyohab"). There is also a tendency to omit the "g" sound in words such as ''agam'', ''agat'' and ''againn'', a characteristic also of other Connacht dialects. All these pronunciations are distinctively regional.

The pronunciation prevalent in the [[Joyce Country]] (the area around [[Lough Corrib]] and [[Lough Mask]]) is quite similar to that of South Connemara, with a similar approach to the words ''agam'', ''agat'' and ''againn'' and a similar approach to pronunciation of vowels and consonants. But there are noticeable differences in vocabulary, with certain words such as ''doiligh'' (difficult) and ''foscailte'' being preferred to the more usual ''deacair'' and ''oscailte''. Another interesting aspect of this sub-dialect is that almost all vowels at the end of words tend to be pronounced as ''í'': ''eile'' (other), ''cosa'' (feet) and ''déanta'' (done) tend to be pronounced as ''eilí'', ''cosaí'' and ''déantaí'' respectively.

The northern Mayo dialect of [[Erris]] ({{lang|ga|Iorras}}) and [[Achill]] ({{lang|ga|Acaill}}) is in grammar and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] essentially a Connacht dialect, but shows some similarities to Ulster Irish due to large-scale immigration of dispossessed people following the [[Plantation of Ulster]].  For example, words ending ''-mh'' and ''-bh'' have a much softer sound, with a tendency to terminate words such as ''leo'' and ''dóibh'' with "f", giving ''leofa'' and ''dófa'' respectively. In addition to a vocabulary typical of other area of Connacht, one also finds Ulster words like ''amharc'' (meaning "to look" and pronounced "onk"), ''nimhneach'' (painful or sore), ''druid'' (close), ''mothaigh'' (hear), ''doiligh'' (difficult), ''úr'' (new), and ''tig le'' (to be able to – i.e. a form similar to ''féidir'').

Irish President [[Douglas Hyde]] was possibly one of the last speakers of the [[Roscommon]] dialect of Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/681-history-of-rte/682-rte-1920s/289997-first-radio-broadcast-from-2rn-1-january-1926/ | work=RTÉ News | title=Douglas Hyde Opens 2RN 1 January 1926 | date=15 February 2012 | access-date=8 May 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106173216/http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/681-history-of-rte/682-rte-1920s/289997-first-radio-broadcast-from-2rn-1-january-1926/ | archive-date=6 January 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ulster===
{{Main|Ulster Irish}}
Ulster Irish is the dialect spoken in the Gaeltacht regions of Donegal.  These regions contain all of Ulster's communities where Irish has been spoken in an unbroken line back to when the language was the dominant language of Ireland.  The Irish-speaking communities in other parts of Ulster are a result of language revival – English-speaking families deciding to learn Irish.

Linguistically, the most important of the [[Ulster]] dialects today is that which is spoken, with slight differences, in both [[Gweedore]] ({{lang|ga|Gaoth Dobhair}} = Inlet of Streaming Water) and [[The Rosses]] ({{lang|ga|na Rossa}}).  Natives of Gweedore include singers [[Enya]] ({{lang|ga|Eithne}}) and [[Moya Brennan]] and their siblings in [[Clannad]] ({{lang|ga|Clann as Dobhar}} = Family from the Dobhar [a section of Gweedore]) [[Na Casaidigh]], and [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]] from another local band [[Altan (band)|Altan]].  Natives of The Rosses include the literary brothers [[Séamus Ó&amp;nbsp;Grianna]] and [[Seosamh Mac&amp;nbsp;Grianna]], locally known as Jimí Fheilimí and Joe Fheilimí.

Ulster Irish sounds quite different to the other two main dialects.  It shares several features with southern dialects of [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], as well as having lots of characteristic words and shades of meanings. However, since the demise of those Irish dialects spoken natively in what is today Northern Ireland, it is probably an exaggeration to see present-day Ulster Irish as an intermediary form between Scottish Gaelic and the southern and western dialects of Irish. Northern Scottish Gaelic has many non-Ulster features in common with Munster Irish.

One noticeable trait of Ulster Irish, Scots Gaelic and Manx is the use of the negative particle {{lang|ga|cha(n)}} in place of the Munster and Connacht {{lang|ga|ní}}. Though southern Donegal Irish tends to use {{lang|ga|ní}} more than ''cha(n)'', ''cha(n)'' has almost ousted ''ní'' in northernmost dialects (e.g. [[Rosguill]] and [[Tory Island]]), though even in these areas {{lang|ga|níl}} "is not" is more common than ''chan fhuil'' or ''cha bhfuil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=A Phonetic Study of the Irish of Tory Island, County Donegal| last=Hamilton |first=John Noel |publisher=Institute of Irish Studies, The Queen's University of Belfast |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grammar of Ros Goill Irish, County Donegal |first=Leslie W. |last=Lucas |publisher=Institute of Irish Studies, The Queen's University of Belfast |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another noticeable trait is the pronunciation of the first person singular verb ending ''-im'' as ''-am'', also common to Man and Scotland (Munster/Connacht ''siúlaim'' "I walk", Ulster ''siúlam'').

===Leinster===
Down to the early 19th century and even later, Irish was spoken in all twelve counties of Leinster. The evidence furnished by placenames, literary sources and recorded speech indicates that there were three dialects spoken in Leinster.  The main dialect was represented by a broad central belt stretching from west Connacht eastwards to the [[River Liffey|Liffey estuary]] and southwards to [[Wexford]], though with many local variations.  Two smaller dialects were represented by the Ulster speech of counties Meath and Louth, which extended as far south as the [[River Boyne|Boyne valley]], and a Munster dialect found in Kilkenny and south Laois. 

The main dialect had characteristics which survive today only in the Irish of Connacht. It typically placed the stress on the first syllable of a word, and showed a preference (found in placenames) for the pronunciation ''cr'' where the standard spelling is ''cn''. The word {{lang|ga|cnoc}} (hill) would therefore be pronounced {{lang|ga|croc}}. Examples are the placenames Crooksling ({{lang|ga|Cnoc Slinne}}) in County Dublin and Crukeen ({{lang|ga|Cnoicín}}) in Carlow. East Leinster showed the same diphthongisation or vowel lengthening as in Munster and Connacht Irish in words like {{lang|ga|poll}} (hole), {{lang|ga|cill}} (monastery), {{lang|ga|coill}} (wood), {{lang|ga|ceann}} (head), {{lang|ga|cam}} (crooked) and {{lang|ga|dream}} (crowd). A feature of the dialect was the pronunciation of the vowel ''ao'', which generally became ''ae'' in east Leinster (as in Munster), and ''í'' in the west (as in Connacht).&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1994, pp. 467–478.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early evidence regarding colloquial Irish in east Leinster is found in ''The Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge'' (1547), by the English physician and traveller Andrew Borde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Borde |first=Andrew |title=''The Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge'' |editor=F.J. Furnivall |publisher=N. Trubner &amp; Co. |date=1870 |pages=131–135 |url=https://archive.org/stream/fyrstbokeintrod01boorgoog#page/n140/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrative phrases he uses include the following (with regularised Irish spelling in brackets):

{| style="margin-left: 1em;"

====The Pale====
[[File:The Pale According to the Statute of 1488.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|right|The Pale – According to Statute of 1488]]
[[The Pale]] ({{lang|ga|An Pháil}}) was an area around late medieval Dublin under the control of the English government. By the late 15th century it consisted of an area along the coast from [[Dalkey]], south of [[Dublin]], to the garrison town of [[Dundalk]], with an inland boundary encompassing [[Naas]] and [[Leixlip]] in the [[Earldom of Kildare]] and [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]] and [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] in County Meath to the north. In this area of "Englyshe tunge" English had never actually been a dominant language - and was moreover a relatively late comer; the first colonisers were Normans who spoke Norman French, and before these Norse. The Irish language had always been the language of the bulk of the population. An English official remarked of the Pale in 1515 that "all the common people of the said half counties that obeyeth the King's laws, for the most part be of Irish birth, of Irish habit and of Irish language".&lt;ref&gt;"State of Ireland &amp; Plan for its Reformation" in ''State Papers Ireland'', Henry VIII, ii, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the strengthening of English cultural and political control, language change began to occur, but this did not become clearly evident until the 18th century. Even then, in the decennial period 1771–81, the percentage of Irish speakers in Meath was at least 41%. By 1851 this had fallen to less than 3%.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;See Fitzgerald 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

====General decline====
English expanded strongly in Leinster in the 18th century, but Irish speakers were still numerous. In the decennial period 1771–81 certain counties had estimated percentages of Irish speakers as follows (though the estimates are likely to be too low):&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;

:Kilkenny 57%
:Louth 57%
:Longford 22%
:Westmeath 17%

The language saw its most rapid initial decline in Laois, Wexford, Wicklow, County Dublin and perhaps Kildare.
The proportion of Irish-speaking children in Leinster went down as follows: 17% in the 1700s, 11% in the 1800s, 3% in the 1830s and virtually none in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Ó Gráda 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish census of 1851 showed that there were still a number of older speakers in County Dublin.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt; Sound recordings were made between 1928 and 1931 of some of the last speakers in [[Omeath]], County Louth (now available in digital form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doegen.ie/ |title=The Doegen Records Web Project &amp;#124; DHO |publisher=Dho.ie |date=5 September 1928 |accessdate=19 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319210106/http://www.doegen.ie/ |archive-date=19 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last known traditional native speaker in Omeath, and in Leinster as a whole, was Annie O'Hanlon (née Dobbin), who died in 1960.&lt;ref name="Ó Gráda" /&gt;

===Urban aspect===

Irish was spoken as a community language in Irish towns and cities down to the 19th century. In the 16th and 17th centuries it was widespread even in Dublin and the Pale.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Gerard]] commented as follows: "All Englishe, and the most part with delight, even in Dublin, speak Irishe", while [[Richard Stanihurst]] lamented that "When their posteritie became not altogither so warie in keeping, as their ancestors were valiant in conquering, the Irish language was free dennized in the English Pale: this canker tooke such deep root, as the bodie that before was whole and sound, was by little and little festered, and in manner wholly putrified." See "Tony Crowley, "The Politics of Language in Ireland 1366–1922: A Sourcebook" and [[Joep Leerssen|Leerssen, Joep]], ''Mere Irish and Fior-Ghael: Studies in the Idea of Irish Nationality, Its Development and Literary Expression Prior to the Nineteenth Century'', University of Notre Dame Press 1997, p. 51. {{ISBN|978-0268014278}}. There were still an appreciable number of Irish speakers in [[County Dublin]] at the time of the 1851 census: see Fitzgerald 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish of Dublin, situated as it was between the east Ulster dialect of Meath and Louth to the north and the Leinster-Connacht dialect further south, may have reflected the characteristics of both in phonology and grammar. In County Dublin itself the general rule was to place the stress on the initial vowel of words. With time it appears that the forms of the dative case took over the other case endings in the plural (a tendency found to a lesser extent in other dialects). In a letter written in Dublin in 1691 we find such examples as the following: ''gnóthuimh'' (accusative case, the standard form being ''gnóthaí''), ''tíorthuibh'' (accusative case, the standard form being ''tíortha'') and ''leithscéalaibh'' (genitive case, the standard form being ''leithscéalta'').&lt;ref&gt;See Ó hÓgáin 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

English authorities of the Cromwellian period, aware that Irish was widely spoken in Dublin, arranged for its official use. In 1655 several local dignitaries were ordered to oversee a lecture in Irish to be given in Dublin. In March 1656 a converted Catholic priest, Séamas Corcy, was appointed to preach in Irish at Bride’s parish every Sunday, and was also ordered to preach at [[Drogheda]] and [[Athy]].&lt;ref&gt;Berresford Ellis 1975, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1657 the English colonists in Dublin presented a petition to the Municipal Council complaining that in Dublin itself "there is Irish commonly and usually spoken".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Berresford Ellis, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is contemporary evidence of the use of Irish in other urban areas at the time. In 1657 it was found necessary to have an Oath of Abjuration (rejecting the authority of the Pope) read in Irish in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] so that people could understand it.&lt;ref&gt;Berresford Ellis 1975, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish was sufficiently strong in early 18th century Dublin to be the language of a coterie of poets and scribes led by Seán and Tadhg Ó Neachtain, both poets of note.&lt;ref&gt;Caerwyn Williams &amp; Uí Mhuiríosa 1979, p. 279 and 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Scribal activity in Irish persisted in Dublin right through the 18th century. An outstanding example was Muiris Ó Gormáin (Maurice Gorman), a prolific producer of manuscripts who advertised his services (in English) in ''Faulkner's Dublin Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;Ní Mhunghaile 2010, pp. 239–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other urban centres the descendants of medieval Anglo-Norman settlers, the so-called [[Old English]], were Irish-speaking or bilingual by the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; The English administrator and traveller [[Fynes Moryson]], writing in the last years of the 16th century, said that "the English Irish and the very citizens (excepting those of Dublin where the lord deputy resides) though they could speak English as well as we, yet commonly speak Irish among themselves, and were hardly induced by our familiar conversation to speak English with us".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Graham Kew (ed.), ''The Irish Sections of Fynes Moryson's unpublished itinerary'' (IMC, Dublin, 1998), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of native cultural institutions in the seventeenth century saw the social prestige of Irish diminish, and the gradual Anglicisation of the middle classes followed.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Laoire 2007, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The census of 1851 showed that the towns and cities of Munster still had significant Irish-speaking populations. In 1819 James McQuige, a veteran Methodist lay preacher in Irish, wrote: "In some of the largest southern towns, Cork, Kinsale and even the Protestant town of Bandon, provisions are sold in the markets, and cried in the streets, in Irish".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in de Brún 2009, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish speakers constituted over 40% of the population of Cork even in 1851.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;

The 19th century saw a reduction in the number of Dublin’s Irish speakers, in keeping with the trend elsewhere. This continued until the end of the century, when the [[Gaelic revival]] saw the creation of a strong Irish–speaking network, typically united by various branches of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], and accompanied by renewed literary activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Conluain &amp; Ó Céileachair 1976, pp. 148–153, 163–169, 210–215.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s Dublin had a lively literary life in Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Uí Mhuiríosa 1981, pp. 168–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban Irish has been the beneficiary, over the last few decades, of a rapidly expanding independent school system, known generally as [[Gaelscoil]]eanna. These schools teach entirely through Irish, and there are over thirty in Dublin alone.

It is likely that the number of urban native speakers (i.e. people who were born into Irish-speaking households and educated through Irish) is on the increase. It has been suggested that Ireland's towns and cities are acquiring a critical mass of Irish speakers, reflected in the expansion of Irish language media.&lt;ref name="schism"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ó Broin|first=Brian|date=16 January 2010|title=Schism fears for Gaeilgeoirí|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/schism-fears-for-gaeilgeoir%C3%AD-1.1269494|work=[[The Irish Times]]|access-date=16 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216211616/https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/schism-fears-for-gaeilgeoir%C3%AD-1.1269494|archive-date=16 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquial urban Irish is changing in unforeseen ways, with attention being drawn to the rapid loss of consonantal mutations (which are intrinsic to the language). It is presently uncertain whether the urban Irish of non-native speakers will become a dialect in its own right or grow further apart from native Gaeltacht Irish and become a creole (i.e. a new language).&lt;ref name="schism" /&gt;

===An Caighdeán Oifigiúil===
{{Main|An Caighdeán Oifigiúil}}
''An Caighdeán Oifigiúil'' ("The Official Standard"), often shortened to ''An Caighdeán'', is the standard for the spelling and grammar of written Irish, developed and used by the Irish government.  Its rules are followed by most schools in Ireland, though schools in and near Irish-speaking regions also use the local dialect.  It was published by the translation department of [[Dáil Éireann]] in 1953&lt;ref name="blas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/dictionaries.shtml | title=Beginners' Blas | accessdate=18 March 2011 | date=June 2005 | publisher=BBC | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303083711/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/dictionaries.shtml | archive-date=3 March 2009 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and updated in 2012 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/translators/An-Caighde%C3%A1n-Oifigi%C3%BAil-2017.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2018|language=Irish|format=PDF|date=January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425182331/http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/translators/An-Caighde%C3%A1n-Oifigi%C3%BAil-2017.pdf|archive-date=25 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no official standard for pronouncing the Irish language.  Certain dictionaries, such as {{lang|ga|Foclóir Póca}}, provide a single pronunciation which is followed by most schools in regions which do not have a native dialect.

The differences between dialects are considerable, and have led to recurrent difficulties in defining standard Irish. In recent decades contacts between speakers of different dialects have become more frequent and the differences between the dialects are less noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701154842/http://www.irishlanguage.net:80/irish/dialects.asp|title=Irish Dialects |publisher=Archive.org copy of Irishlanguage.net |date= |accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{Main|Irish phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}

In pronunciation, Irish most closely resembles its nearest relatives, Scottish Gaelic and Manx. One notable feature is that consonants (except {{IPA|/h/}}) come in pairs, one "broad" ([[velarization|velarised]], pronounced with the back of the tongue pulled back towards the soft palate) and one "slender" ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]], pronounced with the middle of the tongue pushed up towards the hard palate). While broad–slender pairs are not unique to Irish (being found, for example, in [[Russian language|Russian]]), in Irish they have a grammatical function.

==Syntax and morphology==
{{Main|Irish grammar|Irish declension|Irish conjugation|Irish syntax}}

Irish is a [[fusional language|fusional]], [[verb-subject-object|VSO]], [[nominative-accusative language]]. Irish is neither [[verb framing|verb]] nor [[verb framing|satellite framed]], and makes liberal use of [[deixis|deictic]] verbs.

Nouns [[declension|decline]] for 3 [[grammatical number|numbers]]: [[Grammatical number#Singular versus plural|singular]], [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], [[plural]]; 2 [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine; and 4 [[grammatical case|cases]]: ainmneach ([[nominative]] and [[accusative]]), gairmeach ([[vocative]]), ginideach ([[genitive]]), and tabharthach ([[prepositional case|prepositional]]). [[Adjective]]s [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns in [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical case|case]]. Adjectives generally follow nouns, though some precede or [[prefix]] nouns. [[Demonstrative]] [[adjective]]s have [[Demonstrative#Distal and proximal demonstratives|proximal]], [[Demonstrative#Distal and proximal demonstratives|medial]], and [[Demonstrative#Distal and proximal demonstratives|distal]] forms. The [[prepositional case]] is called the [[dative]] by convention.

Verbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for 3 [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]]; 2 [[grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[Uses of English verb forms#Simple|simple]], [[habitual aspect|habitual]]; 2 numbers: [[Grammatical number#Singular versus plural|singular]], [[plural]]; 4 [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]], [[imperative mood|imperative]]; [[Connacht Irish#Verbs|relative forms]]; and in some verbs, [[Dependent and independent verb forms|independent]] and [[Dependent and independent verb forms|dependent]] forms. Verbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for 3 [[grammatical person|persons]] and an impersonal form in which no [[agent (grammar)|agent]] can be determined. There are two verbs for "to be", one for [[essence|inherent qualities]], and one for [[Substance theory#Aristotle|transient qualities]]. The [[passive voice]] and many other forms are [[periphrasis|periphrastic]]. There are a number of preverbal [[grammatical particle|particles]] marking the [[affirmative and negative|negative]], [[interrogative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[relative clause]]s, etc. There is a [[verbal noun]], and [[verbal adjective]]. Verb forms are highly [[Inflection#Regular and irregular inflection|regular]], many grammars recognise only [[Irish conjugation#Irregular verbs|11 irregular verbs]].

[[preposition and postposition|Prepositions]] [[inflection|inflect]] for [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. Different prepositions [[government (linguistics)|govern]] different [[grammatical case|cases]]. Some prepositions [[government (linguistics)|govern]] different cases depending on intended [[semantics]].  The word {{lang|ga|ag}} (at), becomes {{lang|ga|agam}} (at me) in the first person singular. When used with the verb {{lang|ga|bí}} (to be), {{lang|ga|ag}} indicates [[possession (linguistics)|possession]]. Irish shares this attribute with Russian.

*{{lang|ga|''Tá leabhar'' agam.|italic=unset}} "I have a book." (Literally, "there is a book at (on) me," cf. Russian "У меня есть книга")
*{{lang|ga|''Tá leabhar'' agat.|italic=unset}} "You have a book."
*{{lang|ga|''Tá leabhar'' aige.|italic=unset}} "He has a book."
*{{lang|ga|''Tá leabhar'' aici.|italic=unset}} "She has a book."
*{{lang|ga|''Tá leabhar'' againn.|italic=unset}} "We have a book."
*{{lang|ga|''Tá leabhar'' agaibh.|italic=unset}} "Ye have a book."
*{{lang|ga|''Tá leabhar'' acu.|italic=unset}} "They have a book."

[[numerals (linguistics)|Numerals]] have 4 forms: abstract, impersonal, personal, and ordinal.
*{{lang|ga|"a dó"}} Two.
*{{lang|ga|"dhá leabhar"}} Two books.
*{{lang|ga|"beirt"}} Two people.
*{{lang|ga|"dara"}} Second.

===Initial mutations===
{{Main|Irish initial mutations}}
In Irish, there are two classes of initial [[consonant mutation]]s, which express grammatical relationship and meaning in verbs, nouns and adjectives:

* [[Lenition]] ({{lang|ga|séimhiú}}) describes the change of stops into fricatives. Indicated in [[gaelic type|Gaelic script]] by a {{lang|ga|sí buailte}} (a dot) written above the consonant, it is shown in [[Latin script]] by adding a ''h''.
** {{lang|ga|caith!}} "throw!" – {{lang|ga|chaith mé}} "I threw" (lenition as a past-tense marker, caused by the particle {{lang|ga|do}}, now generally omitted)
** {{lang|ga|gá}} "requirement" – {{lang|ga|easpa an ghá}} "lack of the requirement" (lenition marking the genitive case of a masculine noun)
** {{lang|ga|Seán}} "John" – {{lang|ga|a Sheáin!}} "John!" (lenition as part of the vocative case, the vocative lenition being triggered by {{lang|ga|a}}, the vocative marker before {{lang|ga|Sheáin}})
* [[Irish initial mutations#Eclipsis|Eclipsis]] ({{lang|ga|urú}}) covers the voicing of voiceless stops, and [[nasalisation]] of voiced stops.
** {{lang|ga|athair}} "father" – {{lang|ga|ár n-Athair}} "our Father"
** {{lang|ga|tús}} "start", {{lang|ga|ar dtús}} "at the start"
** {{lang|ga|Gaillimh}} "Galway" – {{lang|ga|i nGaillimh}} "in Galway"

Mutations are often the only way to distinguish grammatical forms. For example, the only non-contextual way to distinguish [[pronoun#Possessive|possessive pronouns]] "her," "his" and "their", is through initial mutations since all meanings are represented by the same word ''a''.

* their shoe – ''a mbróg'' (eclipsis)
* his shoe – ''a bhróg'' (lenition)
* her shoe – ''a bróg'' (unchanged)

Due to [[irish initial mutations|initial mutation]], [[prefix]]es, [[clitic]]s, [[suffix]]es, [[root (linguistics)|root]] [[inflection]], ending [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[elision]], [[sandhi]], [[epinthesis]], and [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]]; the beginning, core, and end of words can each change radically and even simultaneously depending on context.

==Orthography==
{{Main|Irish orthography}}
Modern Irish traditionally used the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] without the letters j, k, q, w, x, y and z, but with the addition of one [[diacritic]] sign, the [[acute accent]] (''á é í ó ú''), known in Irish as the {{lang|ga|síneadh fada}} ("long mark"; plural: {{lang|ga|sínte fada}}). However, some gaelicised words use those letters: for instance, 'Jeep' is written as 'Jíp' (the letter v has been naturalised into the language, although it is not part of the traditional alphabet, and has the same pronunciation as "bh"). In idiomatic English usage, this diacritic is frequently referred to simply as the {{lang|ga|fada}}, where the adjective is used as a noun. The ''fada'' serves to lengthen the sound of the vowels and in some cases also changes their quality. For example, in Munster Irish (Kerry), ''a'' is {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and ''á'' is {{IPA|/ɑː/}} in "father" but in Ulster Irish (Donegal), ''á'' tends to be {{IPA|/æː/}}.

Traditional orthography had an additional diacritic{{spaced ndash}}a [[dot (diacritic)|dot]] over some consonants to indicate [[lenition]]. In modern Irish, the letter h suffixed to a consonant indicates that the consonant is lenited. Thus, for example, 'Gaelaċ' has become 'Gaelach'.

Around the time of the [[Second World War]], Séamas Daltún, in charge of {{lang|ga|Rannóg an Aistriúcháin}} (the official translations department of the Irish government), issued his own guidelines about how to standardise Irish spelling and grammar. This de facto standard was subsequently approved by the State and called the Official Standard or {{lang|ga|Caighdeán Oifigiúil}}. It simplified and standardised the orthography. Many words had silent letters removed and vowel combination brought closer to the spoken language. Where multiple versions existed in different dialects for the same word, one or more were selected.

Examples:
* {{lang|ga|Gaedhealg / Gaedhilg(e) / Gaedhealaing / Gaeilic / Gaelainn / Gaoidhealg / Gaolainn}} →  {{lang|ga|Gaeilge}}, "Irish language"
* {{lang|ga|Lughbhaidh}}  →  {{lang|ga|Lú}}, "Louth" (see [[County Louth Historic Names]])
* {{lang|ga|biadh}}  →  {{lang|ga|bia}}, "food"

The standard spelling does not necessarily reflect the pronunciation used in particular dialects. For example, in standard Irish, ''bia'', "food", has the genitive ''bia''. In Munster Irish, however, the genitive is pronounced {{IPA|/bʲiːɟ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= An Ghaeilge, Podręcznik Języka Irlandzkiego|first1=Aidan|last1=Doyle|first2=Edmund|last2=Gussmann|year= 2005|isbn= 83-7363-275-1|page= 412}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the spelling {{lang|ga|biadh}} is still used by the speakers of some dialects, in particular those that show a meaningful and audible difference between {{lang|ga|biadh}} (nominative case) and {{lang|ga|bídh}} (genitive case) "of food, food's". In Munster the latter spelling regularly produces the pronunciation {{IPA|/bʲiːɟ/}} because final ''-idh, -igh'' regularly delenites to ''-ig'' in Munster pronunciation. Another example would be the word ''crua'', meaning "hard". This pronounced {{IPA|/kruəɟ/}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= An Ghaeilge, Podręcznik Języka Irlandzkiego|first1=Aidan|last1=Doyle|first2=Edmund|last2=Gussmann|year= 2005|isbn= 83-7363-275-1|page= 417}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Munster, in line with the pre-Caighdeán spelling, ''cruaidh''. In Munster, ''ao'' is pronounced {{IPA|/eː/}} and ''aoi'' pronounced {{IPA|/iː/}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Teach Yourself Irish|authorlink=Myles Dillon|first1=Myles|last1=Dillon|first2=Donncha|last2=Ó Cróinín|year= 1961|isbn= 0-340-27841-2|page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the new spellings of ''saoghal'', "life, world", genitive: ''saoghail'', have become ''saol'', genitive ''saoil''. This produces irregularities in the match-up between the spelling and pronunciation in Munster, because the word is pronounced {{IPA|/sˠeːl̪ˠ/}}, genitive {{IPA|/sˠeːlʲ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= An Ghaeilge, Podręcznik Języka Irlandzkiego|first1=Aidan|last1=Doyle|first2=Edmund|last2=Gussmann|year= 2005|isbn= 83-7363-275-1|page= 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dot (diacritic)|dot-above diacritic]], called a {{lang|ga|ponc séimhithe}} or {{lang|ga|sí buailte}} (often shortened to {{lang|ga|buailte}}), derives from the ''punctum delens'' used in medieval manuscripts to indicate deletion, similar to crossing out unwanted words in handwriting today. From this usage it was used to indicate the [[lenition]] of ''s'' (from {{IPA|/s/}} to {{IPA|/h/}}) and ''f'' (from {{IPA|/f/}} to [[null morpheme|zero]]) in [[Old Irish]] texts.

Lenition of ''c'', ''p'', and ''t'' was indicated by placing the letter ''h'' after the affected consonant; lenition of other sounds was left unmarked. Later both methods were extended to be indicators of lenition of any sound except ''l'' and ''n'', and two competing systems were used: lenition could be marked by a {{lang|ga|buailte}} or by a postposed ''h''. Eventually, use of the {{lang|ga|buailte}} predominated when texts were written using Gaelic letters, while the ''h'' predominated when writing using Roman letters.

Today, [[Gaelic type]] and the {{lang|ga|buailte}} are rarely used except where a "traditional" style is required, e.g. the motto on the [[University College Dublin]] coat of arms{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} or the symbol of the Irish Defence Forces, The [[Irish Defence Forces cap badge]] {{lang|ga|(Óglaiġ na h-Éireann)}}. Letters with the {{lang|ga|buailte}} are available in [[Unicode]] and [[ISO 8859-14|Latin-8]] [[character set]]s (see Latin Extended Additional chart).&lt;ref&gt;Unicode 5.0, {{cite web |url= https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf |title= Latin Extended Additional |access-date= 24 March 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180410091257/http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf |archive-date= 10 April 2018 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(163&amp;nbsp;KB)}}.

'''Ithkuil''' is an [[experimental language|experimental]] [[constructed language]] created by John Quijada,&lt;ref name="foer-2012"&gt;Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dec. 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; designed to express deeper levels of human cognition briefly yet overtly and clearly, particularly with regard to human categorization. Presented as a cross between an [[a priori (languages)|a priori]] [[philosophical language|philosophical]] and a [[logical language|logical]] language striving to minimize the ambiguities and semantic vagueness found in natural human languages,&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/00_intro.html ''A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language''– Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Ithkuil is notable for its grammatical complexity and extensive phoneme inventory, the latter being simplified in the final version of the language. The name "Ithkuil" is an anglicized form of ''Îţkûil'', which in the original form roughly means "hypothetical representation of a language".&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; Quijada states he did not create Ithkuil to be [[international auxiliary language|auxiliary]] or used in everyday conversations, but rather to serve as a language for more elaborate and profound fields where more insightful thoughts are expected, such as philosophy, arts, science and politics.&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;[http://ithkuil.net/faqs.html Ithkuil FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The many examples from the original grammar book&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt; show that a message, like a meaningful phrase or a sentence, can usually be expressed in Ithkuil with fewer sounds, or lexically distinct speech-elements, than in natural human languages. For example, the two-word Ithkuil sentence "''Tram-mļöi  hhâsmařpţuktôx''" can be translated into English as "On the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point".&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt; Quijada deems his creation too complex and strictly regular a language to have developed naturally, but nonetheless a language suited to human conversation. No person, including Quijada himself, is known to be able to speak Ithkuil fluently.

Three versions of the language have been publicized: the initial version in 2004, a simplified version called Ilaksh in 2007, and the most recent version in 2011, with additional updates on the morphophonology and lexicon.

In 2004&lt;ref name=kozl/&gt;—and again in 2009&lt;ref name=gertelmann&gt;[http://library.conlang.org/articles/ithkuil_Komputerra_17.pdf Ithkuil and its philosophical design] (Russian) by Mikhail Gertelman, Kompyuterra (17(781)2009 p 12)&lt;/ref&gt; with Ilaksh—Ithkuil was featured in the Russian-language popular science and IT magazine ''[[Computerra]]''. In 2008, [[David J. Peterson|David Peterson]] awarded it the Smiley Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dedalvs.com/smileys/2008.html The 2008 Smiley Award Winner: Ithkuil]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Bartłomiej Kamiński codified the language to be able to quickly parse complicated sentences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ebvalaim.pl/en/2016/01/14/making-fun-with-ithkuil-easier Making fun with Ithkuil easier]&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2015, Quijada has published several Ithkuil music voiced by Peterson under the album ''Kaduatán'', which translates to "Wayfarers".

'''Translation:''' "As our vehicle leaves the ground and plunges over the edge of the cliff toward the valley floor, I ponder whether it is possible that one might allege I am guilty of an act of moral failure, having failed to maintain a proper course along the roadway."

'''Romanized:''' Pull̀ uíqišx ma’wałg eřyaufënienˉ päţwïç aŭë’yaļt xne’wïļta’şui tua kit öllá yaqazmuiv li’yïrzişka’ p’amḿ aìlo’wëčča šu’yehtaş

Fillmore]]’s case grammar into "a complex, intricate array of interwoven grammatical concepts [...] inspired by ideas inspired by countless hours studying texts in [[theoretical linguistics]], [[cognitive grammar]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[language acquisition]], [[linguistic relativity]], [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], philosophy, [[fuzzy set theory]], and even quantum physics. "

For his influences, Quijada cites the obscure "morpho-phonology of [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] verb complexes, the [[Grammatical mood|moods]] of verbs of certain [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American Indian languages]], the [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] system of [[Niger–Kordofanian languages]], the [[Noun case|nominal case]] systems of [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Dagestanian languages]], the [[enclitic]] system of the [[Wakashan languages]], the positional orientation systems of [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]] and [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimithirr]], the [[Semitic root|Semitic triliteral root]] morphology, and the hearsay and possessive categories of [[Suzette Elgin]]'s [[Láadan]] language". The writing system's logical design borrows principles from [[Ge'ez script|Ethiopic]] and [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] scripts, but employs a unique morpho-phonemic principle.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; The script used throughout the Ithkuil grammar bears superficial resemblance to [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]] square script and the various [[Klingon script|Klingon]] fonts, and Ilaksh has also used a "[[cartouche]] script" and a cursive format. Because Ithkuil is designed for users to be precise in their speech, it is quite difficult to express humorous concepts in Ithkuil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/a-l|title=Ça üšlá|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ilaksh (2007) ===
The initial publication of Ithkuil in 2004 had an extensive phonology of 65 consonants and 17 vowels. Since the mention of Ithkuil in the Russian magazine ''Computerra'',&lt;ref name="kozl" /&gt; several speakers of Russian contacted Quijada and expressed enthusiasm to learn Ithkuil for its application to [[psychonetics]], with several complaining about its difficulty in pronunciation. Quijada remade Ithkuil's morphophonology with 30 consonants and 10 vowels (and the addition of [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]]) and published the revision on 10 June 2007 as Ilaksh.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; The language featured other amendments to grammar, including some additional Levels and a change of Cases. It was redesigned to be easier to speak and included an additional writing system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605210044/http://ithkuil.net/ilaksh/images/script_diagram.gif Ilaksh script diagram (indicates what the various parts of an Ilaksh logogram indicate) (no longer available on site, link shows archive.org's cache)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ithkuil.net/11_script.htm#Sec11o6 Ilaksh formal / ornamental script example, an updated version of the older script diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522161309/http://www.ithkuil.net:80/ilaksh/Chapter_11.htm|title=A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 11: The Script|date=2009-05-22|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial sequential "informal" system suitable for handwriting or compact typesetting, and a "formal" [[logographic]] system with artistic possibilities resembling [[Maya script]]s.

In the "informal" writing system, several parallel sets of lines are shaped to correspond sequentially to the different parallel sets of lexemes and inflections. It is directly pronounceable. The author designed it with reserve for convenient handwriting. The overall design would permit compact, clear, black-and-white rendering.

In the colorful "formal" script, a single complex glyph represented an entire sentence. Diversely shaped, shaded and superimposed cartouches represent the [[syntax|syntactic]] relations of the verb and noun phrases of a sentence. The edges of the cartouches had particular shapes that indicate one set of inflections, the colors indicate another set of inflections, and the textures yet another one. On the cartouches, letters of hexagonal outline would spell out the forms of particular [[lexeme]]s. The cartouches formed phrases, with primary phrases overlapping subordinate phrases. The coloring system utilized different color densities and texturing for different colors in order to be usable by colorblind people. These density conventions also allowed the formal system to be inexpensively printed in black-and-white, or inscribed or imprinted on stone or other materials.&lt;ref name="script"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/11_script.htm Ilaksh Chapter 11: The Writing System]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ithkuil (2011) ===
Ilaksh was superseded by a newer language, also termed Ithkuil because of its ties to the initial publication. Its script uses a unique morpho-phonemic principle that allows sentences representing grammatical categories to be pronounced in multiple ways as the speaker sees fit. As of July 2011, Quijada planned to adopt the cartouche script "for use as an alternative, 'ornamental' writing system for artistic purposes" to the newest revision of Ithkuil, which was made to be morphologically similar to Ilaksh.

Owing to complaints about the difficult patterns in the language morphology from the community [[Reddit]] forum, on 30 October 2017, Quijada published a tentative [http://www.ithkuil.net/Morpho-Phonology_Redesign_01.pdf outline] for a new version of the language, which has yet to be named, addressing learners' desires for a more [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] [[morphophonology]], including a restructured Formative outline, and extended use of Adjuncts for flexible expression of the grammar to further create [[phonaesthetics]].

=== Phonology ===
The newly revised Ithkuil has 45 consonants and 13 vowels. At the left of each cell in the table below is the [[phoneme]], and at the right its transliterated representation if it is not written the same in IPA as in romanized Ithkuil. The consonants are as follows:&lt;ref name="phonology"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/01_phonology.html Ithkuil.net – Chapter 1: Phonology]&lt;/ref&gt;

/{{IPAlink|ɪ}} {{IPAlink|ʊ}}/ are pronounced [{{IPAlink|i}} {{IPAlink|u}}] when they precede another vowel, and when at the end of a word. /{{IPAlink|ɛ}} {{IPAlink|ɔ}}/ are pronounced [{{IPAlink|e}} {{IPAlink|o}}] when they precede another vowel, excepting /{{IPAlink|ɪ}} {{IPAlink|ʊ}}/. In a future revision of the language, Quijada has noted that ê and ô will be removed to allow for easier memorization.

The diphthongs in Ithkuil are {{IPA|/äɪ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɛɪ̯/}}, {{IPA|/əɪ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɔɪ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ø̞ɪ̯/}},  {{IPA|/ʊɪ̯/}}, {{IPA|/äʊ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɛʊ̯/}}, {{IPA|/əʊ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɪʊ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɔʊ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ø̞ʊ̯/}}. All other sequences of vowels are pronounced as separate syllables.

=== Morphophonology ===
Ithkuil words can be divided into just two [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], ''formatives'' and ''adjuncts''. Formatives can function both as nouns and as verbs, derived from the root and depending on the morpho-semantic context.&lt;ref name="morphophonology"&gt;[http://ithkuil.net/02_morpho-phonology.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 2: Morpho-phonology]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formatives====
Roots are Ithkuil's most basic semantic units. All Ithkuil formatives are derived from a limited number of roots. Each root consists of a cluster of 1–4 [[consonant]]s (five-consonant clusters are also available, but remain without an assigned meaning).&lt;ref name="morphophonology"/&gt; The current [[lexicon]] of Ithkuil can potentially consist of approximately 3,600 [[Root (linguistics)|word roots]].&lt;ref name="morphophonology" /&gt; So far, just over 1000 have been assigned translations.&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/lexicon.htm The Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; From the root, word stems are formed by affixing the vocalic affix that indicates pattern, stem type, and function, and by stressing a particular syllable to indicate informal or formal designation.&lt;ref name="morphophonology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="morphology"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net//03_morphology.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 3: Basic Morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three stems associated with each root. Each stem comes in three patterns, one holistic and two complementary ones. Holistic stem 1 typically refers to the most general manifestation of a root, whereas holistic stems 2 and 3 typically refer to more specific manifestations associated with the root. Each holistic stem has two complementary stems associated with it, which refer to the complementary concepts related to the holistic stem.&lt;ref name="morphophonology"/&gt; The specific meaning of complementary stems depends somewhat on the root. These are derived from the word roots by prefixing a vowel or diphthong that also indicates the grammatical category ''function''.&lt;ref name="morphophonology"/&gt; Two examples are given in the tables below:

=====Basic morphology=====
All Ithkuil formatives, whether functioning as nouns or verbs, inflect for various grammatical categories that are quite dissimilar from any of those in natural languages.&lt;ref name="morphology"/&gt; Quantization is more or less covered by the grammatical categories of ''Configuration'', ''Affiliation'', and ''Perspective'', even though these do not technically refer to number per se.&lt;ref name="morphology"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

=====Cases=====
There are 96 [[grammatical case]]s in Ithkuil, one special case being the Vocative, used for direct address. Verbal formatives inflect for case under Frame constructions (i.e., [[dependent clause]]s). The grammatical cases of Ithkuil can be divided into several distinct groups:&lt;ref name="case"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/04_case.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 4: Case morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Verbal morphology=====
Several distinct grammatical categories apply only to verbal formatives. These are listed below:&lt;ref name="verbs1"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/05_verbs_1.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 5 – Verb morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

|24
|}

Ithkuil nominal formatives also carry a ''function'', but cannot be inflected for them, always remaining in the "stative".&lt;ref name="verbs1"/&gt;

====Suffixes====

Ithkuil uses a variety of affixes, termed suffixes, to further delineate what is described by the formative.

====Adjuncts====
There are two types of adjuncts in Ithkuil: personal-reference adjuncts and verbal adjuncts.&lt;ref name="morphophonology"/&gt; All adjuncts are highly [[synthetic language|synthetic]].

Personal-reference adjuncts are akin to pronouns in English. There are two types of personal-reference adjuncts in Ithkuil: Single-referent and dual-referent.&lt;ref name="adjuncts"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/08_adjuncts.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 8: Adjuncts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbal adjuncts are adjuncts that work in conjunction with verbal formatives to provide information about the latter's ''Valence'', ''Level'', ''Phase'', ''Sanction'', ''Illocution'', ''Modality'', ''Aspect'', and ''Bias''.&lt;ref name="morphophonology"/&gt; Of these, ''Modality'' and ''Level'' can only be indicated using verbal adjuncts, whereas the others can also be expressed on the verbal formative.&lt;ref name="verbs2"&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/06_verbs_2.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 6 – More verb morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Numerical system ====
Ithkuil uses a [[Radix|base 100]] numeral system with roots for the numbers 1 to 10, and a stem-specific derivative suffix used with a number root to add a multiple of 10, providing the numerals up to 99. Ithkuil did not originally use the concept of zero. Numbers greater than 100 are expressed periphrastically in speech, whereas a special numerical script had [[logogram]]s for the numbers 1 to 100 and exponential powers of 100.

On 27 March 2015 Quijada released a [http://www.ithkuil.net/ithkuil_math_and_measurement.pdf mathematical sublanguage] using a [[dozenal]] number system.

===Orthography===

[[File:Ithkuil-ex001.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ithkuil-ex001.jpg|thumb|"Tram-mļöi hhâsmařpţuktôx" written in the Ithkuil script. English translation: "On the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point"]]

Ithkuil uses a morphophonemic script because characters convey both phonetic and morphological information. Its use is closely tied to Ithkuil's grammatical system, which allows much of the phonological aspect of words to be morpho-syntactically inferred. Those parts of an Ithkuil word whose pronunciation is predictable are not written, whereas the characters used to indicate the pronunciation of the unpredictable parts of a word also convey the grammatical information necessary to reconstruct the implicit phonetics. Words are thus written in a highly abbreviated manner, particularly useful for the highly inflected, occasionally elongated words of the Ithkuil language. The script is also used alphabetically for transliterating foreign words and mathematical expressions.

== Past versions ==

===Original Ithkuil===
The 2004 version of Ithkuil had a significantly more complicated morphophonology.

==== Phonology ====
The [[phonology|phonological]] system of the original Ithkuil consisted of 65 [[consonant]]s, including the [[palatal plosive]]s /ɟ/, /c/, /cʰ/, /cʼ/; [[uvular plosive]] /ɢ/; retroflex affricates /ɖ͡ʐ/, /ʈ͡ʂ/, /ʈ͡ʂʰ/, /ʈ͡ʂʼ/; lateral [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and central [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] affricates /cʎ̥˔ʰ/, /c͡çʼ/; [[Velar consonant|velar]] affricates /k͡xʼ/, /q͡χʼ/; retroflex fricatives /ʐ/, /ʂ/; [[Voiced palatal fricative|palatal fricative]] /ʝ/; [[Voiced velar fricative|velar fricative]] /ɣ/; [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]] /ħ/; two [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar lateral approximants|dental approximants]] /l̪/ /ɫ̪/ (substituted for the [[alveolar approximant]] /l/); and the [[retroflex approximant]] /ɻ/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithkuil.net:80/ithkuil-ch1-phonology.htm|title=Ithkuil Phonology|last=|first=|date=2009-06-08|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608003709/http://www.ithkuil.net:80/ithkuil-ch1-phonology.htm|archive-date=2009-06-08|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; /m n̪ ŋ l ɫ ɻ/ could be syllabic. /h/ was [ɸ] when preceded by a vowel and followed by another consonant. [cʎ̥˔ʰ] was in free variation with [cʎ̥˔ʼ], the latter being more common at the beginning of a word. All consonants except /j w/ could be geminated; when geminated, /h/ was a [[Voiceless bidental fricative|bidental fricative]] and /ɽ/ an [[Alveolar Trill|aveolar trill]].

At the left of each cell in the table below is the [[phoneme]], and at the right its transliterated representation. The original 17 vowels are as follows:

The diphthongs were {{IPA|/ai̯/}}, {{IPA|/æi̯/}}, {{IPA|/ei̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɤi̯/}}, {{IPA|/øi̯/}}, {{IPA|/oi̯/}}, {{IPA|/ʊi̯/}}, {{IPA|/au̯/}}, {{IPA|/æu̯/}}, {{IPA|/eu̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɤu̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɪu̯/}}, {{IPA|/ou̯/}}, {{IPA|/øu̯/}}, {{IPA|/aɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/eɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɤɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ʊɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/oɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɪɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/æɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/øɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ʉɯ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ae̯/}}. All other sequences of vowels were pronounced as separate syllables.

==== Grammar ====
The [[lexicon]] of the original Ithkuil consisted of the same pattern as the current form of the language. However, each root consisted of 2 [[consonant]]al ''radicals'', and could [[Derivation (linguistics)|derive]] thousands of [[lexeme]]s through the use of Ithkuil's complex rules of [[morphophonology]], which involved both [[consonant mutation|consonantal]] and vocal mutation, shifts in syllabic stress and tone, and affixation.

Ithkuil words can be divided into just two [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], ''formatives'' and ''adjuncts''. Formatives functioned both as nouns and as verbs, depending on the morpho-semantic context. Formatives were inflected for the current grammatical categories, plus 2 [[Focus (linguistics)|''foci'']], and 81 [[Grammatical case|''cases'']]; they could also have taken on some of the 153 [[affix]]es, which further qualified into one of 9 ''degrees''. Verbal formatives were additionally inflected for 7 ''conflations''.

''Verbal adjuncts'' similarly worked in conjunction with adjacent formatives to provide additional grammatical information. Two types of verbal adjuncts were inflected to indicate 14 [[Valency (linguistics)|''valencies'']], 6 ''versions'', 8 ''formats'', 37 ''derivations'', 30 [[Linguistic modality|''modalities'']], 4 [[Comparative|''levels'']], 9 [[Evidentiality|''validations'']], 9 ''phases'', 9 ''sanctions'', 32 [[Grammatical aspect|''aspects'']], 8 [[Grammatical mood|''moods'']], and 24 ''biases''.

====An example of morphological analysis====
:''(based entirely on the original Ithkuil grammar book)''

The word ''iţkuîl'' was a ''formative'' derived from the ''root'' ''k-l'' (broadly concerning "speech", "voice", or even "interpretation") through the addition of several morphological determinants:
* The '''-u-''' vocalic infix
:''kul'' was the ''holistic'' variety of the ''Stem 2'' of the three other possible stems from ''k-l''. Translating roughly as "a meaningful unit of speech", i.e. "a word", it gave no emphasis on the meaning or the vocal rendering of the word.
* The '''u → uî''' mutation of the infix
:''Secondary'' ''mode'', as opposed to ''primary'' ''mode'', meant that the word ''kuîl'' is not to refer to a real-life phenomenon, but rather to a mental representation, or projection, of that phenomenon; to an imaginary or hypothetical object. Thus translating as, "a made-up word".
* A ''grade 8'' mutation of the first radical consonant: '''k → ţk'''
:The ''configuration'' of the term was ''composite''. Roughly corresponding to the [[plural]]ity concept in [[Indo-European languages]], it also implies the objects in question (words, ''kuîl'') to be diverse, while forming a "coherent emergent entity" (rather than just a collection or an array of different words), thus meaning "a [[vocabulary]]" or "[[lexicon]]".
* The '''i-''' vocalic prefix, one of the 24 possible for formative roots
:The ''extension'' was ''delimitive'', perceiving "vocabulary" as entire, with clearly distinguished boundaries, as opposed to it being just a local manifestation{{spaced ndash}}such as slang or a dialect{{spaced ndash}}of a broader lexicon (''-ţkuîl'').
:The ''affiliation'' of the set of objects in question was ''coalescent''. This indicates that the individual members of the set act together toward a higher purpose by coordinating their complementary functions. Thus, "a [[vocabulary]]/[[lexicon]]" becomes "a language".
* [[Stress (linguistics)|Syllabic stress]] on the penultimate syllable (''-u-'')
:The ''perspective'' of the noun is ''monadic'', seeing "the language" as a single and specific entity, rather than a collection of many languages existing separately, the general phenomenon ("human languages") or the abstract idea of language.
Thus, the approximate translation of ''iţkuîl'' was "an idea/fantasy of a complete purposeful system of complementary speech elements", or simply "an imaginary language".

=== Ilaksh (2007) ===
In an effort to make the language more speakable, Quijada created a revision called ''Ilaksh''.

==== Phonology ====
The [[phonology|phonological]] system of Ilaksh was revised to consist of only 30 [[consonant]]s and 10 [[vowels]]. The consonants were as follows:
{| style="text-align:center" class="IPA wikitable"
|-

/[[Bilabial nasal|m]] [[Denti-alveolar nasal|n̪]] [[Velar nasal|ŋ]] [[Alveolar lateral approximant|l]] [[Retroflex flap|ɽ]]/ could be syllabic. All consonants except /[[Palatal approximant#Palatal|j]] [[Voiced labio-velar approximant|w]] [[Glottal stop|ʔ]]/ could be geminated; when geminated, [[Voiceless glottal fricative|h]] is a [[Voiceless bidental fricative|bidental fricative]] or a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], and [[Retroflex flap|ɽ]] is an [[alveolar trill]]. The clusters /n̪j/, /tj/, /dj/, and /lj/ could be pronounced as such or as the palatals [ɲ], [c], [ɟ], and [ʎ].

The vowels were follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! [[Front vowel|Front]] !! [[central vowel|Central]] !! [[back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|i}} || {{IPA|ɨ ʉ}} || {{IPA|u}}

| {{IPA|e ø}} || {{IPA|ə}} || {{IPA|o}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| {{IPA|æ}} || {{IPA|a}} 
|}
The 14 diphthongs of Ilaksh were {{IPA|/ai̯/}}, {{IPA|/æi̯/}}, {{IPA|/ei̯/}}, {{IPA|/əi̯/}}, {{IPA|/oi̯/}}, {{IPA|/øi̯/}}, {{IPA|/ui̯/}}, {{IPA|/au̯/}}, {{IPA|/æu̯/}}, {{IPA|/eu̯/}}, {{IPA|/əu̯/}}, {{IPA|/iu̯/}}, {{IPA|/ou̯/}}, and {{IPA|/øu̯/}}. All other sequences of vowels were pronounced as separate syllables.

==Possible advantages==
The [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] postulates that a person's language influences their perceptions and cognitive patterns. Stanislav Kozlovsky proposed&lt;ref name=kozl&gt;(Russian) [http://old.computerra.ru/xterra/205420/ «Скорость мысли», Станислав Козловский] – ''Speed of thought'' by Stanislav Kozlovsky, ''Computerra'', &amp;#8470;26–27, June 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in the Russian popular-scientific magazine ''Computerra'' that a fluent speaker of Ithkuil, accordingly, would think "about five or six times as fast" as a speaker of a typical natural language. The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis would suggest that, Ithkuil being an extremely precise and [[synthetic language]], its speakers would have a more discerning, deeper understanding both of everyday situations and of broader phenomena, and of abstract [[philosophy|philosophical]] categories.

However, strong forms of the hypothesis, which postulate that language ''determines'' thought and not only influences it, have been disproven within mainstream linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ahearn|first=Laura|title=Living language: an introduction to linguistic anthropology|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=9781405124416|page=69|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in line with this, Quijada has stated he does not believe a speaker would think necessarily any faster, because even though Ithkuil is terse, a single word requires a lot more thought before it can be spoken than it would in a natural language.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;[http://www.ithkuil.net/faqs.html FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

"For these reasons, I believe use of Ithkuil would probably allow one to think more deeply, critically, and analytically; but think faster? I doubt it."

Kozlovsky also likened Ithkuil to the fictional ''[[Speedtalk]]'' from [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novella ''[[Gulf (Heinlein)|Gulf]]'', and contrasted both languages with the ''[[Newspeak]]'' of the communicationally restricted society of [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Ithkuil is by far the most complete language of the three, though Speedtalk and Newspeak were merely "sampled" by their creators, with an outline of neither grammar nor lexicon. John Quijada acknowledged the similarity of Ithkuil's design goals to those of Speedtalk,&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt; remarking that,

"[h]owever, Heinlein's Speedtalk appears to focus only on the morpho-phonological component of language[, whereas] Ithkuil has been designed with an equal focus on [morphology, lexico-morphology, or lexico-semantics]. Additionally, the apparent purpose of Heinlein's language is simple rapidity/brevity of speech and thought, while Ithkuil is focused on maximal communication in the most efficient manner, a somewhat different purpose, in which brevity per se is irrelevant."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6587">The so-called "'''Jena Symphony'''" is a [[symphony]] that was at one time attributed to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].  The symphony was discovered by [[Fritz Stein]] in 1909 in the archives of a concert society in [[Jena]], from which it derived its name. Stein believed it to be the work of Beethoven and it was so published by [[Breitkopf und Härtel]] in 1911.  It is now known that the piece was the work of [[Friedrich Witt]] (born the same year as Beethoven).

==History==

Stein thought it was quite likely an early work by Beethoven and pointed out some stylistic similarities in the preface to the score. From each of the four movements he singled out a few passages he considered especially Beethoven-like. Stein's belief in Beethoven's authorship was strengthened by the fact that Beethoven's letters show that prior to writing his own [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 1]] he tried to write a C major symphony with [[Joseph Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 97 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 97]] as a model,&lt;ref&gt;N. Marston, "Symphonies" in ''The Beethoven Compendium'', ed. Barry Cooper. Ann Arbor: Borders Group (1995): 214&lt;/ref&gt; and it is easy to find parallels between the Jena Symphony and Haydn's No. 97.

When [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] found another copy of the work at the archives of [[Göttweig Abbey]] with Witt's name on it, he convinced most other scholars that the work was in fact by Witt. Ralph Leavis, for example, condemned the work as "a piece of plagiarism, put together almost with scissors and paste from reminiscences of Haydn."&lt;ref&gt;Leavis, Ralph. "Witt, Friedrich" in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', Stanley Sadie, ed. Volume 20. London: Macmillan Publishers Limited (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
In four movements, the symphony is scored for [[flute]], 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 2 [[French horn|horns]] in C, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, [[timpani]] and [[String section|strings]].

The first movement begins with an [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] introduction of 20 measures. A [[sonata form]] movement follows with a mostly triadic first subject group

[[Image:JenaSymSatz1Quote1.png|400px]]

and a more dance-like second subject group.

[[Image:JenaSymSatz1Quote2.png|500px]]

The exposition has a repeat (not always followed in performance). The development of just 30 measures ends with a crescendo leading directly to the recapitulation.

The second movement in [[F major]] has a central section in [[F minor]].

[[Image:JenaSymSatz2Quote.png|500px]]

The timpano in C is used in this movement (the timpani were set to C and G for the first movement and are not changed in the course of work).

The third movement is a Minuet with Trio.

[[Image:JenaSymSatz3Quote.png|500px]]

The fourth movement begins piano.

[[Image:JenaSymSatz4Quote.png|500px]]

The handling of the winds in this movement led some scholars to believe (before Robbins Landon's discovery) that perhaps this movement was in fact written by Beethoven while the rest was written by an unknown composer.

He has a degree in Spanish [[Philology]] in the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (1976). In 2016 be got his [[doctorate]] in the [[Jaume I University]] of [[Castellón de la Plana|Castelló]] with a doctoral dissertation whose title was “Estudi biogràfic i literari d’Artur Perucho Badia. Comunicació i societat en la primera meitat del segle xx” (Biographical and literary research about Artur Perucho Badía. Communication and society in the first half of the XXth century). He has been high school teacher of Spanish language and literature (1977-1985) and of Valencian language and literature (1985-2013). He is member of the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua|Valencian Language Academy]], of the [[Associació d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana|Association of Catalan-language writers]], of the ''International Association of Catalan Language and Literature'', of the [[PEN International]], of the [[Sociedad General de Autores de España|Spanish Society of Authors and Publishers]] and of the ''Spanish Center of Reprographical Rights''.

Palomero has combined the job of teacher for high school students, his political career in his village, some positions during some time in the Education Department of the [[Generalitat Valenciana]] (Valencian regional government), with his literary tasks, almost always in [[Catalan language]]. He has gotten several literary awards. The following ones can be pointed out: ''Jordi de Sant Jordi'' award for poetry (1980) and ''Eduard Escalante'' for theater (2001) (both from the ''Ciutat de València'' awards), ''Tirant lo Blanc'' award for teenagers literature (1982), ''València'' award for Novel (1983), Prize of the Critics of the Valencian Writers (1994), ''Ciutat d'Alzira'' award for Novel (1996).

'''[[Laz language|Laz]]''' is a [[Kartvelian language]]. It is sometimes considered as a southern dialect of [[Zan languages]], the northern dialect being the [[Mingrelian language]].

Today, the area where Laz is spoken stretches from the village [[Sarpi, Georgia|Sarpi]] of [[Khelvachauri]] district in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the village Kemer of [[Rize Province|Rize province]] in [[Turkey]]. Laz is spoken also in Western [[Turkey]] in the villages created by [[Laz people|Laz]] [[Muhajir (Caucasus)|muhajirs]] in 1877-1878. In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], out of [[Sarpi, Georgia|Sarpi]], the Laz language islets were also in [[Abkhazia]], but the fate of them is obscure at present.

Laz is divided into three dialects: Khopa-Chkhala, Vitze-Arkabe and Atina-Artasheni. Dialectical classification is mainly conditioned by phonetic characteristics. More specifically, the crucial point is the reflexes of the Kartvelian phoneme {{IPA|[qʼ]}}, which is maintained only in the Khopa-Chkhala dialect but has different reflections in Vitze-Arkabe and Atina-Artasheni dialects (see below).

==Phonology and Writing system==

===Vowels===

Laz vowel inventory consists of five sounds: ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u''.

===Consonants===

The consonant inventory of Laz varies among the dialects. A full set of sounds is present in the Khopa-Chkhala dialect, while the Vitze-Arkabe and Atina-Artasheni dialects lost glottalized uvular ''q''.

===Phonetic processes===

====Uvular ''q'' sound change====

Glottalized uvular ''q'' is preserved only in the Khopa-Chkhala dialect before the vowels and the consonants ''v'' and ''l''. This sound is also evidenced after glottalized stops and affricates in several words, such as ''p̌qorop'' (I love smb./sth.); ''ǩqorop'' (I love you); ''t̆qubi'' (twins), ''ǯqv-/ǯqvin-'' (to reconcile); ''ç̌qint̆i'' (fresh-soft and unripe). But in the most of cases ''*t̆q → t̆ǩ''; ''*ǯq → ǯǩ''; ''*ç̌q → ç̌ǩ''.

In the Vitze-Arkabe dialect, in the neighborhood of consonants ''*q → ǩ'' (exception is the verb ''ovapu ← *oqvapu'' "to be"). In the word-initial prevocalic and in the intervocalic positions ''*q → ∅''.

In Atina-Artasheni dialect:
*in word-initial prevocalic position ''q → ∅''. E.g. ''*qoropa → oropa'' "love", ''*qona → ona'' "cornfield" etc.
* in intervocalic position ''*q → y/∅''. E.g. ''*loqa → *loʔa → loya/loa'' "sweet", *luqu → *luʔu → luu'' "cabbage" etc.
*word-initial ''qv → ''ǩv/v''. E.g. ''qvali → ''ǩvali/vali'' "cheese, ''*qvaci → ǩvaci/vaci'' "testicle" etc.
*intervocalic ''qv → y''. E.g.  ''*oqvapu → oyapu'' "to be/become", ''*iqven → iyen'' "s/he will be/become" etc.
*in all other cases ''q → ∅''

====Regressive assimilation====

The most common types are:
* regressive voicing:
** ''s → z''
** ''t → d''
** ''k → g''
** ''ş → j''
** ''ç → c''
** ''p → b''
* regressive devoicing:
** ''b → p''
** ''g → k''
* regressive glottalization
** ''b → p̌''
** ''p → p̌''
** ''g → ǩ''

====Dissimilative deletion of consonant====

In some morphological contexts featuring two consonants ''n'' split only with a vowel, the former can be deleted. ''miqonun → miqoun'' (I have {an animate object}), ''iqvasinon → iqvasion'' (s/he will be), ''mulunan → *muluan → mulvan'' (they are coming).

Another dissimilation, presumably sporadic, occurs in ''deǩiǩe → deiǩe'' (minute); note also that the Arabic source of this word [[wikt:دقيقة|دقيقة]] ''daqīqa'' contains a uvular {{IPA|[q]}}, and as above uvulars are unstable in Laz.

====Intervocalic reduction of ''r''====
This process is evidenced in the Khopa-Chkhala and Vitze-Arkabe dialects, where in intervocalic position facultatively ''r  → y  → ∅''.

====Palatalization of velars====
In the Atina-Artasheni dialect, the velars followed by the front vowels ''e'' and ''i'' and the glide ''y'' transform to alveolar affricates:
*''g → c''
*''ǩ → ç̌''
*''k → ç''

=== Alphabet ===

[[Laz language|Laz]] has eight [[grammatical case]]s: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[ergative case|ergative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[Lative case|lative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]] and almost extinct [[adverbial case|adverbial]].

==Nouns==

As in other [[South Caucasian languages]], Laz distinguishes two classes of nouns and classifies objects as:

* 'Intelligent' entities. Respective interrogative is ''mi?'' (who?)
* 'Non-intelligent' entities. Respective interrogative is ''mu?'' (what?)

=== Noun classification scheme ===

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
| colspan="3" |''[[Physical body|Concrete]]''
|''[[Abstract object|Abstract]]''
|-
| colspan="2" |''Animate''
| colspan="2" |''Inanimate''
|-
|''Human and "human-like" beings (e.g. God, deities, angels)''
|''[[Animals]]''
|''Inanimate physical entities''
|''[[Abstract objects]]''
|-
|'''Intelligent'''
| colspan="3" |'''Non-Intelligent'''
|-
|mi? ("who?")
| colspan="3" |mu? ("what?")
|}

==Numerals==

The Laz numerals are near identical to their [[Megrelian]] equivalents with minor phonetic differences. The number system is [[vigesimal]] like in [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

===Cardinal numbers===

Almost all basic Laz cardinal numbers stem from the [[Proto-Kartvelian language]], except ''ar(t)'' (one) and ''eči'' (twenty), which are reconstructed only for the Karto-Zan chronological level, having regular phonetical reflexes in [[Zan languages|Zan (Megrelo-Laz)]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. The numeral ''šilya'' (thousand) is a [[Pontic Greek]] loanword and is more commonly used than original Laz ''vitoši''.

===Ordinal numbers===

Ordinal numbers in [[Laz language|Laz]] are produced with the circumfix ''ma-...-a'', which, in contrast with [[Megrelian]], may be extended with suffix ''-n''. The circumfix ''ma-...-a'' originates from [[Proto-Kartvelian language|Proto-Kartvelian]] and has regular phonetical equivalents in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (''me-...-e'') and [[Svan language|Svan]] (''me-...-e'')

==Verbs==
Laz verbs are inflected for seven categories: person, number, version, tense, mood, aspect and voice.

===Person and Number===

In Laz, like [[Megrelian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Svan language|Svan]], verbs can be unipersonal, bipersonal and tripersonal

*Monovalent verbs have only subjective person and are intransitive.
*Bivalent verbs have one subject and one object (''direct'' or ''indirect''). They are:
**transitive if the object is ''direct''
**intransitive if the object is ''indirect''
*Trivalent verbs have one subject and two objects (one ''direct'' and the other ''indirect'') and are ditransitive.

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"

|-
! Direct Object
|

|-
! Indirect Object
|
|

|}

The person may be singular or plural.

Subject and object markers in [[Laz language|Laz]] are the same as in [[Megrelian]]

====Subject markers====

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"

! &amp;nbsp;
! '''Singular'''
! '''Plural'''
|-
! '''S1'''
| v-
| v-...-t
|-
! '''S2'''
| ∅-
| ∅-...-t
|-
! '''S3'''
| ∅-...-n/-s/-u
| ∅-...-an/-es
|}

====Object markers====

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"

! &amp;nbsp;
! '''Singular'''
! '''Plural'''
|-
! '''O1'''

|-
! '''O2'''
| g-
| g-...-an/-es/-t
|-
! '''O3'''
| ∅-
| ∅-...-an/-es
|}

In pre-consonant position, the markers ''v-'' and ''g-'' change phonetically:

*Before voiced consonants:'' v- → b-''
*Before voiceless (nonglottalized) consonants:
**''v- → b- → p-''
**''g- → k-''
*Before glottalized consonants:
**''v- → b- → p̌-''
**''g- → ǩ-''

===Version===

Like [[Megrelian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Svan language|Svan]], [[Laz language|Laz]] has four types of version marking:
*subjective - shows that the action is intended for oneself,
*objective - action is intended for another person,
*objective-passive - the action is intended for another person and at the same time indicating the passiveness of subject,
*neutral - neutral with respect to intention.

===Tenses===

The maximum number of [[screeve]]s in [[Laz language|Laz]] is 22. They are grouped in three series. Two screeves (''future I'' and ''past of future I'') exist only for the verb ''r-'', which serves as a 1st series root for ''oqopumu/ovapu/oyapu'' (to be).

According to oldness these [[screeve]]s can be grouped in two sets:
*old (primary) (common with [[Megrelian]]).
*new (secondary) derived from the basic screeves (specific [[Laz language|Laz]]).

===Mood===

====Indicative====
Indicative statement claims that the proposition should be taken as an apparent fact.

====Interrogative====
There are two ways to transform an indicative statement into a question:
*by means of interrogative words. E.g. ''mi?'' (who?), ''mu?'' (what?), ''so?'' (where?), ''mundes?'' (when?), ''muç̌o?'' (how?) etc. This rule is valid for [[Megrelian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Svan language|Svan]] as well.
*by adding an interrogative particle ''-i'' to the end of a verb. It has the same function as [[Megrelian]] ''-o'', [[Old Georgian language|Old Georgian]] ''-a'' and [[Svan language|Svan]] ''-ma/-mo/-mu''.

====Imperative====
Indicates a command or request. The aorist form is used when addressing 2nd person (singular/plural) and aoristic optative in all other cases.

====Subjunctive====
Expresses possibility, wish, desire.

====Conditional====
Indicates condition in contrary to a fact. For this reason a verbal suffix ''-ǩo'' (At.-Arsh, Vtz.-Ark.) / ''-ǩon/-ǩoni'' (Khop.-Chkh.) is used.

A '''line pair''' can be more than one thing.

==In philately==
A '''line pair''' in [[philately]] is a [[coil pair]] of [[postage stamp]]s bearing an inked line between the two stamps. There are at least two kinds of these:
*A guide line pair has a [[Guide line (philately)|guide line]] between the stamps. Since the guide lines are deliberately incised into the plate, they will generally be sharp and clear.
*A joint line pair has a [[joint line]] between the stamps, deriving from the seam in the cylindrical plate used to print the stamps. These lines are somewhat smeared in appearance.

==In image processing==
A '''line pair''' in [[image processing]] is this: on a test pattern consisting of closely spaced black parallel lines on a white background, a line pair is one black line together with the white space on one side of it. When photographers say "lines of resolution", they mean line pairs. In television and video, one line pair equals two TV lines or [[pixels]], of [[Display resolution|resolution]].

'''Majken Johansson''' (August 7, 1930, [[Malmö]] &amp;ndash; December 11, 1993) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[poet]], [[writer]] and a [[Salvation Army]] soldier.

Majken Johansson was born [[Legitimacy (family law)|out of wedlock]] in [[Malmö]], and spent her childhood in foster care with an abusive foster mother. At the age of 9, she was evacuated from Malmö at the outbreak of [[World War II]] and lived with relatives in [[Småland]]. Despite her difficult childhood she went through school with good grades and managed to get in at the prestigious [[Lund University]], where she graduated. During her tenage and university years she also suffered from [[alcoholism]]. In 1956, after a stormy relationship with another woman, which ended with the woman committing suicide, Majken Johansson suffered a life crisis which would lead to her decision to join the Swedish section of the [[Salvation Army]] in 1958.

She began to write in the early 1950s, both socially debating articles in newspapers, and poetry. Her first volume of poetry was the critically acclaimed ''Buskteater'' in 1952. She published 8 volumes of poetry between 1952 and 1989. Her poems are not only concerned with life, love and God, but also on everyday reflections in a very simple and keen way, often with a lot of humor.

Her life partner was the Salvation Army officer and hymn writer [[Karin Hartman]], who in 2002 published ''Bottenglädjen'', a book about Majken Johansson's life.

In recent years Johansson's poetry has been published in new editions and gained a generation of new readers. She is today regarded as one of Sweden's greatest poets of the mid-20th century, alongside names such as [[Hjalmar Gullberg]] and [[Werner Aspenström]]. In 1970 she was awarded the Large Prize by ''[[Samfundet De Nio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samfundetdenio.se/pdf/De%20Nios%20priser.pdf List of prize winners since 1916, Samfundet De Nio]&lt;/ref&gt; She was also awarded a literary prize by the magazine ''Vi'' in 1958, the ''[[Sveriges Radio]]s poetry award'' in 1965, the ''Deverthska kulturstiftelsens Forsethpris'' in 1972, and the ''[[Sydsvenskan|Sydsvenska Dagbladet]]s kulturpris'' in 1975.

__NOTOC__

'''Maranatha''' (Aramaic: either מרנא תא: '''''maranâ thâ' ''''' or מרן אתא: '''''[[maran]] 'athâ' ''''', Greek: Μαραναθα) is a two-word [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] formula occurring [[Hapax legomenon|only once]] in the [[New Testament]] (''see [[Aramaic of Jesus#Maranatha (Μαραναθα)|Aramaic of Jesus]]''). It appears in [[Didache]] 10:14&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-lightfoot.html|title=Didache. The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (translation J. B. Lightfoot).|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is part of the [[Apostolic Fathers]]' collection. It is [[transliterated]] into Greek letters rather than [[translated]] and, given the nature of early manuscripts, the lexical difficulty rests in determining just which two Aramaic words constitute the single Greek expression, found at the end of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s ''[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]'' ([http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm 1 Cor 16:22]).

If one chooses to split the two words as מרנא תא (maranâ thâ), a vocative concept with an imperative verb, then it can be translated as a command to the [[Names of God|Lord]] to come. On the other hand, if one decides that the two words מרן אתא ([[maran]] 'athâ), a possessive "Our Lord" and a perfect/preterite verb "has come," are actually more warranted, then it would be seen as a credal expression. This interpretation, "Our Lord has come," is supported by what appears to be an equivalent of this in the early credal acclamation found in the biblical books of Romans 10:9 and 1 Corinthians 12:3, "Jesus is Lord."

[[File:Soliloquies OE - maranatha (British Library Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, folio 5r).jpg|thumb|left|A mention of maranatha in the ''Southwick Codex'', a medieval text]]
In general, the recent interpretation has been to select the command option ("Come, Lord!"), changing older decisions to follow the preterite option ("Our Lord has come") as found in the ancient Aramaic [[Peshitta]], in the Latin [[Clementine Vulgate]], in the Greek Byzantine texts, maranatha ("O Lord, come!" in 1Co 16:22), which was part of the eucharistic dialogue of the early Church. [[Textus Receptus]], critical Greek texts like Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, Cambridge, etc., and in the English translations like the [[King James Version]], the Finnish Raamattu, etc. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]] of 1 Cor 16:22 translates the expression as: "Our Lord, come!" but notes that it could also be translated as: "Our Lord has come"; the [[New International Version|NIV]] translates: "Come, O Lord"; the ''[[The Message (Bible)|Message]]'' version puts it differently as: "Make room for the Master!" [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+16%3A22&amp;version=MSG]; the [[New American Bible|NAB]] notes:

{{quote|As understood here ("O Lord, come!"), it is a [[Prayer in the New Testament|prayer]] for the early [[Second Coming|return of Christ]]. If the Aramaic words are divided differently (Maran atha, "Our Lord has come"), it becomes a [[Creed|credal]] declaration. The former interpretation is supported by what appears to be a Greek equivalent of this acclamation in [[Book of Revelation]] 22:20 "Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!"}}

The 1985 [[New Jerusalem Bible]] translates 1 Cor 16:22, "If there is anyone who does not love the Lord, a curse on such a one. Maran atha." In the context of 1 Corinthians, understanding the Greek "maranatha" as Aramaic "Maran atha" in the [[preterite]] sense would provide substantiation for the preceding [[anathema]]. That is, one who does not love the Lord is accursed because our Lord has ascended and come unto his throne (e.g., Dan 7:13). It would also substantiate the following prayer for grace from the ascended Lord Jesus, who has come to his throne and then sends the [[Holy Spirit]]. {{Citation needed|reason=July 2016|date=July 2016}}

The last chapter of the Book of Revelation makes use of the same concept as מרנא תא "marana tha" by the Greek ἔρχου κύριε Ἰησοῦ (Rev. 22:20 [[NA28]]) "erchou kurie Iesou", "Come, Lord Jesus."

In the [[Catholic Church]], the word "Maranatha" has also been used as a solemn formula of [[excommunication]] (alongside "[[anathema]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01455e.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Anathema|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Contemplative Prayer==
Based on the teachings of [[John Cassian]], [[John Main]] recommended the recitation of ''Maranatha'' as “the ideal Christian [[mantra]]”, meaning “Come Lord”, repeated silently interiorly as four equally stressed syllables ''Ma-ra-na-tha'': “Not only is this one of the most ancient Christian prayers, in the language Jesus spoke, but it also has a harmonic quality that helps to [[hesychasm|bring the mind to silence]]. Other words or short phrases could be used but he saw it as important that during the meditation one doesn't think about the meaning or use the imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theschoolofmeditation.org/content/john-main-biography&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian authors and communities cultivate similar practices centred on this recitation.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [http://www.swamij.com/maranatha.htm Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">'''Máire Bhuí Ní Laoghaire''' (1774&amp;ndash;1849) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]].

Ní Laoghaire was born in Túirín na nÉan in Uibh Laoghaire (Iveleary), near Ballingeary, [[County Cork]]. She was from a family of five sons and three daughters who lived on her father's fifty acre farm. In 1792, she married Séamus de Búrca, a [[Skibbereen]] horsetrader and the couple settled on a holding they purchased near Céim an Fhia/Keimaneigh, living in some prosperity. They were widely known for their generosity. By 1847, however, their fortunes declined and they were unable to pay their rent. Mounting debts and their arrest for membership of a secret agrarian organisation led to their eviction. Ní Laoghaire died soon after and was buried in Inchigeelagh.

==Career==
She was illiterate, which was unusual for the time, and she learned her trade from the oral tradition. Her poems frequently allude to classical tropes thus indicating her exposure to wider contemporary literary tastes in Munster. but her songs and poems survived via the oral folk tradition of the area, as did compositions by her contemporaries such as [[Antoine Ó Raifteiri]].

Her best-known composition is ''Cath Chéim an Fhia'' (''The Battle of Keimaneigh''), which graphically records a fight between the local yeoman militia and the [[Whiteboys]] in 1822.

NLU is the post-processing of text, after the use of NLP algorithms (identifying parts-of-speech, etc.), that utilizes context from recognition devices (ASR, vision recognition, last conversation, misrecognized words from ASR, personalized profiles, microphone proximity etc.), in all of its forms, to discern meaning of fragmented and run-on sentences to execute an intent from typically voice commands.  A NLU has an ontology around particular product vertical that is used to figure out the probability of an intent.  A NLU has a defined list of known intents that derives the message payload from designated contextual information recognition sources.

The program [[STUDENT (computer program)|STUDENT]], written in 1964 by [[Daniel Bobrow]] for his PhD dissertation at [[MIT]] is one of the earliest known attempts at natural-language understanding by a computer.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]] ''Brief History of AI'' [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/BriefHistory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bobrow]]'s PhD Thesis [http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/5922 Natural Language Input for a Computer Problem Solving System].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Machines who think'' by Pamela McCorduck 2004 {{ISBN|1-56881-205-1}} page 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Stuart J.; Norvig, Peter (2003), ''Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach'' Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-790395-2}}, http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Computer Science Logo Style: Beyond programming'' by Brian Harvey 1997 {{ISBN|0-262-58150-7}} page 278&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight years after [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] coined the term [[artificial intelligence]], Bobrow's dissertation (titled ''Natural Language Input for a Computer Problem Solving System'') showed how a computer could understand simple natural language input to solve algebra word problems.

A year later, in 1965, [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] at MIT wrote [[ELIZA]], an interactive program that carried on a dialogue in English on any topic, the most popular being psychotherapy. ELIZA worked by simple parsing and substitution of key words into canned phrases and Weizenbaum sidestepped the problem of giving the program a [[database]] of real-world knowledge or a rich [[lexicon]]. Yet ELIZA gained surprising popularity as a toy project and can be seen as a very early precursor to current commercial systems such as those used by [[Ask.com]].&lt;ref&gt;Weizenbaum, Joseph (1976). ''Computer power and human reason: from judgment to calculation'' W. H. Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-0463-3}} pages 188-189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 [[Roger Schank]] at [[Stanford University]] introduced the [[conceptual dependency theory]] for natural-language understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Schank]], 1969, ''A conceptual dependency parser for natural language'' Proceedings of the 1969 conference on Computational linguistics, Sång-Säby, Sweden, pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; This model, partially influenced by the work of [[Sydney Lamb]], was extensively used by Schank's students at [[Yale University]], such as [[Robert Wilensky]], Wendy Lehnert, and [[Janet Kolodner]].

In 1970, [[William Aaron Woods|William A. Woods]] introduced the [[augmented transition network]] (ATN) to represent natural language input.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, William A (1970). "Transition Network Grammars for Natural Language Analysis". Communications of the ACM 13 (10): 591–606 [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED037733&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED037733]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of ''[[phrase structure rules]]'' ATNs used an equivalent set of [[finite state automata]] that were called recursively. ATNs and their more general format called "generalized ATNs" continued to be used for a number of years.

In 1971 [[Terry Winograd]] finished writing [[SHRDLU]] for his PhD thesis at MIT. SHRDLU could understand simple English sentences in a restricted world of children's blocks to direct a robotic arm to move items. The successful demonstration of SHRDLU provided significant momentum for continued research in the field.&lt;ref&gt;''Artificial intelligence: critical concepts'', Volume 1 by Ronald Chrisley, Sander Begeer 2000 {{ISBN|0-415-19332-X}} page 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Winograd's SHRDLU page at Stanford [http://hci.stanford.edu/~winograd/shrdlu/ SHRDLU]&lt;/ref&gt; Winograd continued to be a major influence in the field with the publication of his book ''Language as a Cognitive Process''.&lt;ref&gt;Winograd, Terry (1983), ''Language as a Cognitive Process'', Addison–Wesley, Reading, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; At Stanford, Winograd would later be the adviser for [[Larry Page]], who co-founded [[Google]].&lt;!--does this really belong here?  it seems like trivia--&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s the natural language processing group at [[SRI International]] continued research and development in the field. A number of commercial efforts based on the research were undertaken, ''e.g.'', in 1982 [[Gary Hendrix]] formed [[Symantec Corporation]] originally as a company for developing a natural language interface for database queries on personal computers. However, with the advent of mouse driven, [[graphic user interface]]s Symantec changed direction. A number of other commercial efforts were started around the same time, ''e.g.'', Larry R. Harris at the Artificial Intelligence Corporation and Roger Schank and his students at Cognitive Systems corp.&lt;ref&gt;Larry R. Harris, ''Research at the Artificial Intelligence corp.'' ACM SIGART Bulletin, issue 79, January 1982 [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1056663.1056670]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inside case-based reasoning'' by Christopher K. Riesbeck, Roger C. Schank 1989 {{ISBN|0-89859-767-6}} page xiii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Michael Dyer developed the BORIS system at Yale which bore similarities to the work of Roger Schank and W. G. Lehnart.&lt;ref&gt;''In Depth Understanding: A Model of Integrated Process for Narrative Comprehension.''. Michael g. Dyer. MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-04073-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third millennium saw the introduction of systems using machine learning for text classification, such as the IBM [[Watson (computer)|Watson]]. However, it is debated how much "understanding" such systems demonstrate, ''e.g.'' according to [[John Searle]], Watson did not even understand the questions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703407304576154313126987674&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ball (cognitive scientist)|John Ball, cognitive scientist]] and inventor of Patom Theory supports this assessment. Natural language processing has made inroads for applications to support human productivity in service and ecommerce but this has largely been made possible by narrowing the scope of the application. There are thousands of ways to request something in a human language which still defies conventional natural language processing. "To have a meaningful conversation with machines is only possible when we match every word to the correct meaning based on the meanings of the other words in the sentence – just like a 3-year-old does without guesswork" [http://www.isi.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Philosophische_Fakultaet/Sprache_und_Information/Ball_PatomTheory.pdf Patom Theory]

==Scope and context==
The umbrella term "natural-language understanding" can be applied to a diverse set of computer applications, ranging from small, relatively simple tasks such as short commands issued to [[robot]]s, to highly complex endeavors such as the full comprehension of newspaper articles or poetry passages. Many real world applications fall between the two extremes, for instance [[Document classification|text classification]] for the automatic analysis of emails and their routing to a suitable department in a corporation does not require in depth understanding of the text,&lt;ref&gt;''An approach to hierarchical email categorization'' by Peifeng Li et al. in ''Natural language processing and information systems'' edited by Zoubida Kedad, Nadira Lammari 2007 {{ISBN|3-540-73350-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but needs to deal with a much larger vocabulary and more diverse syntax than the management of simple queries to database tables with fixed schemata.

Throughout the years various attempts at processing natural language or ''English-like'' sentences presented to computers have taken place at varying degrees of complexity. Some attempts have not resulted in systems with deep understanding, but have helped overall system usability. For example, [[Wayne Ratliff]] originally developed the ''Vulcan'' program with an English-like syntax to mimic the English speaking computer in [[Star Trek]]. Vulcan later became the [[dBase]] system whose easy-to-use syntax effectively launched the personal computer database industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Infoworld]], Nov 13, 1989, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Infoworld]], April 19, 1984, page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Systems with an easy to use or ''English like'' syntax are, however, quite distinct from systems that use a rich [[lexicon]] and include an internal representation (often as [[first order logic]]) of the semantics of natural language sentences.

Hence the breadth and depth of "understanding" aimed at by a system determine both the complexity of the system (and the implied challenges) and the types of applications it can deal with.  The "breadth" of a system is measured by the sizes of its vocabulary and grammar.  The "depth" is measured by the degree to which its understanding approximates that of a fluent native speaker.  At the narrowest and shallowest, ''English-like'' command interpreters require minimal complexity, but have a small range of applications.  Narrow but deep systems explore and model mechanisms of understanding,&lt;ref&gt;''Building Working Models of Full Natural-Language Understanding in Limited Pragmatic Domains'' by James Mason 2010 [http://www.yorku.ca/jmason/UnderstandingEnglishInLimitedPragmaticDomains.html]&lt;/ref&gt; but they still have limited application.  Systems that attempt to understand the contents of a document such as a news release beyond simple keyword matching and to judge its suitability for a user are broader and require significant complexity,&lt;ref&gt;''Mining the Web: discovering knowledge from hypertext data'' by Soumen Chakrabarti 2002 {{ISBN|1-55860-754-4}} page 289&lt;/ref&gt; but they are still somewhat shallow.  Systems that are both very broad and very deep are beyond the current state of the art.

==Components and architecture==
Regardless of the approach used, most natural-language-understanding systems share some common components. The system needs a [[lexicon]] of the language and a [[parser]] and [[grammar]] rules to break sentences into an internal representation. The construction of a rich lexicon with a suitable [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] requires significant effort, ''e.g.'', the [[Wordnet]] lexicon required many person-years of effort.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Miller, R. Beckwith, C. D. Fellbaum, D. Gross, K. Miller. 1990. ''WordNet: An online lexical database''. Int. J. Lexicograph. 3, 4, pp. 235-244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system also needs a ''[[semantics|semantic theory]]'' to guide the comprehension. The interpretation capabilities of a language-understanding system depend on the semantic theory it uses. Competing semantic theories of language have specific trade-offs in their suitability as the basis of computer-automated semantic interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''Using computers in linguistics: a practical guide'' by John Lawler, Helen Aristar Dry 198 {{ISBN|0-415-16792-2}} page 209&lt;/ref&gt; These range from ''[[naive semantics]]'' or ''[[stochastic semantic analysis]]'' to the use of ''[[pragmatics]]'' to derive meaning from context.&lt;ref&gt;Naive semantics for natural language understanding'' by Kathleen Dahlgren 1988 {{ISBN|0-89838-287-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stochastically-based semantic analysis'' by Wolfgang Minker, [[Alex Waibel]], Joseph Mariani 1999 {{ISBN|0-7923-8571-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pragmatics and natural language understanding'' by Georgia M. Green 1996 {{ISBN|0-8058-2166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced applications of natural-language understanding also attempt to incorporate logical [[inference]] within their framework. This is generally achieved by mapping the derived meaning into a set of assertions in [[predicate logic]], then using [[logical deduction]] to arrive at conclusions. Therefore, systems based on functional languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] need to include a subsystem to represent logical assertions, while logic-oriented systems such as those using the language [[Prolog]] generally rely on an extension of the built-in logical representation framework.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural Language Processing Prolog Programmers'' by M. Covington, 1994 {{ISBN|0-13-629478-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Natural language processing in Prolog'' by Gerald Gazdar, Christopher S. Mellish 1989 {{ISBN|0-201-18053-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The management of context in natural-language understanding can present special challenges. A large variety of examples and counter examples have resulted in multiple approaches to the formal modeling of context, each with specific strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding language understanding'' by Ashwin Ram, Kenneth Moorman 1999 {{ISBN|0-262-18192-4}} page 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Formal aspects of context'' by Pierre Bonzon et al 2000 {{ISBN|0-7923-6350-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norms''' are concepts ([[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s) of practical import, oriented to effecting an action, rather than conceptual abstractions that describe, explain, and express. Normative sentences imply "ought-to" types of statements and assertions, in distinction to sentences that provide "is" types of statements and assertions. Common normative sentences include [[Imperative mood|commands]], permissions, and prohibitions; common normative abstract concepts include ''sincerity'', ''justification'', and  ''honesty''. A popular account of norms describes them as [[reason]]s to take [[action (philosophy)|action]], to [[belief|believe]], and to [[emotion|feel]].

==Types of norms==
Orders and permissions express norms. Such norm sentences do not describe how the [[world]] is, they rather prescribe how the world should be. [[Imperative mood|Imperative]] sentences are the most obvious way to express norms, but declarative sentences also may be norms, as is the case with [[law]]s or 'principles'. Generally, whether an expression is a norm depends on what the sentence intends to assert. For instance, a sentence of the form "All Ravens are Black" could on one account be taken as descriptive, in which case an instance of a white raven would contradict it, or alternatively "All Ravens are Black" could be interpreted as a norm, in which case it stands as a principle and definition, so 'a white raven' would then not be a raven.

Those norms purporting to create [[Convention (norm)|obligation]]s (or [[duty|duties]]) and [[permission (philosophy)|permission]]s are called ''[[deontology|deontic]] norms'' (see also [[deontic logic]]). The concept of deontic norm is already an extension of a previous concept of norm, which would only include imperatives, that is, norms purporting to create duties. The understanding that permissions are norms in the same way was an important step in [[ethics]] and [[philosophy of law]].
[[File:Constitutive Norms vs. Deontic Norms.png|thumb|A flowchart with examples of constitutive and deontic norms.|339x339px]]
In addition to deontic norms, many other varieties have been identified. For instance, some [[constitution]]s establish the [[national anthem]]. These norms do not directly create any duty or permission. They create a "[[National symbols|national symbol]]". Other norms create [[nation]]s themselves or [[politics|political]] and [[Administration (government)|administrative]] regions within a nation. The action orientation of such norms is less obvious than in the case of a command or permission, but is essential for understanding the relevance of issuing such norms: When a folk song becomes a "national anthem" the meaning of singing one and the same song changes; likewise, when a piece of land becomes an administrative region, this has legal consequences for many activities taking place on that territory; and without these consequences concerning action, the norms would be irrelevant. A more obviously action-oriented variety of such ''constitutive norms'' (as opposed to deontic or ''regulatory norms'') establishes social institutions which give rise to new, previously inexistent types of actions or activities (a standard example is the institution of marriage without which "getting married" would not be a feasible action; another is the rules constituting a game: without the norms of soccer, there would not exist such an action as executing an [[indirect free kick]]).

Any [[convention (norm)|convention]] can create a norm, although the relation between both is not settled.

There is a significant discussion about (legal) norms that give someone the [[power (sociology)|power]] to create other norms. They are called ''power-conferring norms'' or ''norms of competence''. Some authors argue that they are still deontic norms, while others argue for a close connection between them and [[institutional fact]]s (see Raz 1975, Ruiter 1993).

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] conventions, for example, the convention in [[English language|English]] that "cat" means cat or the convention in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] that "gato" means cat, are among the most important norms.

[[Game]]s completely depend on norms. The fundamental norm of many games is the norm establishing who wins and loses. In other games, it is the norm establishing how to score points.

==Major characteristics==
One major characteristic of norms is that, unlike [[proposition]]s, they are not descriptively [[truth|true]] or false, since norms do not purport to describe anything, but to prescribe, create or change something.  Some people say{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} they are "prescriptively true" or false.  Whereas the truth of a descriptive statement is purportedly based on its [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] to [[reality]], some philosophers, beginning with [[Aristotle]], assert that the (prescriptive) truth of a prescriptive statement is based on its correspondence to right [[Motivation|desire]].  Other philosophers maintain that norms are ultimately neither true or false, but only successful or unsuccessful (valid or invalid), as their [[proposition]]al content obtains or not (see also [[John Searle]] and [[speech act]]).

There is an important difference between ''norms'' and ''normative propositions'', although they are often expressed by identical sentences.  "You may go out." usually expresses a norm if it is uttered by the teacher to one of the students, but it usually expresses a normative proposition if it is uttered to one of the students by one of his or her classmates.  Some ethical theories reject that there can be normative propositions, but these are accepted by [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]].  One can also think of propositional norms; [[Logical assertion|assertion]]s and [[question]]s arguably express propositional norms (they set a proposition as asserted or questioned).

Another purported feature of norms, it is often argued, is that they never regard only natural [[property|properties]] or [[entity|entities]].  Norms always bring something artificial, [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], [[institution]]al or "unworldly".  This might be related to [[David Hume|Hume's]] assertion that it is not possible to [[is-ought problem|derive ought from is]] and to [[G.E. Moore|G.E. Moore's]] claim that there is a [[naturalistic fallacy]] when one tries to analyse "good" and "bad" in terms of a natural [[concept]].  In [[aesthetics]], it has also been argued that it is impossible to derive an aesthetical [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] from a non-aesthetical one. The acceptability of [[Ethical non-naturalism|non-natural properties]], however, is strongly debated in present-day philosophy. Some authors deny their [[existence]], some others try to [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduce]] them to natural ones, on which the former [[Supervenience|supervene]].

Other thinkers (Adler, 1986) assert that norms can be [[nature|natural]] in a different sense than that of "corresponding to something proceeding from the object of the prescription as a strictly internal source of action".  Rather, those who assert the existence of natural prescriptions say norms can suit a natural ''need'' on the part of the prescribed entity.  More to the point, however, is the putting forward of the notion that just as descriptive statements being considered true are conditioned upon certain [[self-evident]] descriptive truths suiting the nature of reality (such as:  it is impossible for the same thing to be and not be at the same time and in the same manner), a prescriptive truth can suit the nature of the will through the authority of it being based upon [[self-evident]] prescriptive truths (such as:  one ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else).

Recent works maintain that normativity has an important role in several different philosophical subjects, not only in ethics and philosophy of law (see Dancy, 2000).

'''Northern Kurdish''' ({{lang|kmr|Kurdiya jorîn}}, {{lang|kmr-Arab|کوردیا ژۆرین|rtl=yes}}), also called '''Kurmanji''' ({{lang|kmr|Kurmancî}}, {{lang|kmr-Arab|کورمانجی|rtl=yes}}), is a [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish language]] spoken in southeast [[Turkey]], northwest and northeast [[Iran]], northern [[Iraq]] and northern [[Syria]]. It is the most widespread language of the [[Kurdish languages]]. &lt;!-- Kurmanji is difficult to classify, like Kurdish in general, due to strong influence from Persian and other neighbouring related Iranian languages, numerous lexical borrowings and conflicting or ambiguous dialectal traits. --&gt;While Kurdish is generally categorized as one of the [[Western Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranian languages]] along with [[Balochi language|Baluchi]]&lt;!-- given its placement regarding the very oldest isoglosses within Iranian --&gt;,&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Kurdish language I.

== Scripts and books ==
Northern Kurdish is written using the [[Latin script]] in [[Turkey]], where most of its speakers live, as well as in [[Syria]]. Northern Kurdish is the most widely spoken [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] language, being spoken by 80% of all [[Kurds]]. The earliest textual record of a Kurdish language dates to the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

Kurmanji is also the ceremonial language&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yazidis-i-general-1 Kurmanji is the language of almost all the orally transmitted religious traditions of the Yazidis.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=YEZIDIS in Armenia |title=People  Armenia Travel, History, Archeology &amp; Ecology  TourArmenia Travel Guide to Armenia |url=http://www.tacentral.com/people.asp?story_no=8 |website=www.tacentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Yazidism]]. The sacred book ''[[Mishefa Reş]]'' (the "[[Yazidi Black Book]]") and all prayers are written and spoken in Kurmanji. In this context, the Kurmanji language may also be called '''Ezdiki'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arakelova |first1=Victoria |date=2001 |title=Healing Practices among the Yezidi Sheikhs of Armenia |journal=Asian Folklore Studies |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=319–328 |doi=10.2307/1179060 |quote = As for their language, the Yezidis themselves, in an attempt to avoid being identified with Kurds, call it ''Ezdiki''. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
Northern Kurdish forms a [[dialect continuum]] of great variability. Loosely, five dialect areas can be distinguished:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Regional variation in Kurmanji: A preliminary classification of dialects|first1=Ergin|last1=Öpengin|first2=Geoffrey|last2=Haig|journal=Kurdish Studies|volume=2|year=2014|issn=2051-4883}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Northwestern Kurmanji''', spoken in the [[Kahramanmaraş Province|Kahramanmaraş]] (in Kurmanji: ''Meraş''), [[Malatya Province|Malatya]] (''Meletî'') and [[Sivas Province|Sivas]] (''Sêwaz'') provinces of [[Turkey]].
* '''Southwestern Kurmanji''', spoken in the [[Adıyaman Province|Adıyaman]] (''Semsûr''), [[Gaziantep Province|Gaziantep]] (''Entab'') and [[Şanlıurfa Province|Şanlıurfa]] provinces of Turkey and the [[Aleppo Governorate]] of [[Syria]].
* '''Northern Kurmanji''' or '''Serhed''' , spoken mainly in the [[Ağrı Province|Ağrı]] (''Agirî''), [[Erzurum Province|Erzurum]] (''Erzerom'') and [[Muş Province|Muş]] (''Mûş'') provinces of Turkey, as well as adjacent areas.
* '''Southern Kurmanji''', spoken in the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]] in Syria, the [[Sinjar]] distinct in Iraq, and in several adjacent parts of Turkey centering on the [[Mardin Province|Mardin]] and [[Batman Province|Batman]] provinces. 
* '''Southeastern Kurmanji''' or '''Badînî''', spoken in the [[Hakkâri Province|Hakkâri]] province of Turkey and [[Dohuk Governorate]] of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].
* '''Anatolian Kurmanji''' is spoken in [[central Anatolia]], especially in [[Konya]], [[Ankara]], [[Aksaray]], by [[Kurds of Central Anatolia|Anatolian Kurds]]

The most distinctive{{clarify|date=March 2017}} of these is ''Badînî''.&lt;ref&gt;
for [[Bahdinan]], a historical Kurdish principality, paralleling use of [[Sorani Kurdish|Sorani]], also the name of [[Soran Emirate|a historical principality]], for southern dialects. See [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahdinan-kurdish-region-river-dialect-group-and-amirate BAHDĪNĀN] in ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' by A. Hassanpour, 1988 (updated 2011): "The majority of the population are Kurds (see figures in Edmonds, [''Kurds, Turks and Arabs'', London, 1957,] p. 439) and speak Kurmanji, the major Kurdish dialect group, also called Bādīnānī (see, among others, Jardine [''Bahdinan Kurmanji: A Grammar of the Kurmanji of the Kurds of Mosul Division and Surrounding Districts'', Baghdad, 1922] and Blau [''Le Kurde de ʿAmādiya et de Djabal Sindjar: Analyse linguistique, textes folkloriques, glossaires'', Paris, 1975])."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oorlams''' (also: ''Oorlands'', ''Oorlans'') is a dialect of Afrikaans spoken in the Republic of [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]], by the [[Oorlam people]]. 

It is considered to be either an [[Afrikaans]]-based [[creole language]] or a dialect of [[Afrikaans]] proper. 

Oorlams has many elements from [[Khoi]] languages.

The '''Orya–Tor''' languages are a [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]] spoken in Indonesia.

==Classification==
The Tor family is clearly established. Its closest relative appears to be [[Orya language|Orya]].

;Orya–Tor
*[[Orya language|Orya]] (Uria)
*'''Tor''' family: [[Berik language|Berik]], [[Bonerif language|Bonerif]], [[Dabe language|Dabe]]–[[Keijar language|Keijar]]–[[Betaf language|Betaf]], [[Itik language|Itik]], [[Jofotek-Bromnya language|Jofotek-Bromnya]], [[Kwesten language|Kwesten]], [[Kwinsu language|Kwinsu]], [[Mander language|Mander]], [[Maremgi language|Maremgi]] (Dineor), [[Vitou language|Vitou]]

[[Stephen Wurm]] (1975) linked Orya and the Tor languages with the [[Lakes Plain languages]], forming a branch of his [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] phylum. Clouse (1997) found no evidence of such a connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clouse | first = Duane A. | year = 1997 | title = Towards a reconstruction and reclassification of the Lakes Plains languages of Irian Jaya | editor = Karl Franklin, ed. | journal = Papers in New Guinea Linguistics | volume = 2 | pages = 133–236 | issn = 0078-9135 | oclc = 2729642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] (2005) linked them instead with part of another erstwhile branch of TNG in a [[Tor–Kwerba languages|Tor–Kwerba]] proposal.   ''Glottolog'' accepts only the link with Orya as having been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt;

{{anchor|Wares}}A purported Wares language is sometimes reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|wai|Wares}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no such language is attested. The Wares people are not known to have a distinct language, and the language of the village of Wares is [[Mawes language|Mawes]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronouns==
The pronouns Ross reconstructs for proto-Orya–Tor are,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="833">A '''papponymic''' is a [[personal name]] based on the name of one's grandfather, similar to a [[patronymic]], a name derived from the name of one's father. Papponyms have been common in a number of societies such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Israel]]. 

Papponymy has been frequently practiced in the [[Alaouite dynasty]] of Moroccan royalty for centuries, with sons sometimes being named after their great-grandfather, but never after their father. The last six generations of the Alaouite dynasty are:

'''''Pas de trois''''' {{IPA-fr|pɑ də tʁwɑ|}} is a [[French language|French]] term usually referring to a dance in [[ballet]] between three people. Typically a ''Pas de trois'' in ballet consists of 5 parts -

#The Entrée (the opening number for the 3 dancers, usually preceded by a short introduction)
#[[Variation (ballet)|Variation]] (or solo) for the 1st dancer
#Variation for the 2nd dancer
#Variation for the 3rd dancer
#the Coda (a finale usually set to music of a quick tempo in which the dancers bring the piece to a spectacular finish)

Today, the most celebrated ''Pas de trois'' in the classical ballet repertory are derived from the works of the great choreographer [[Marius Petipa]]. Although the Balletmaster created many ''Pas de trois'' for the near 150 ballets he created throughout his career in Russia, only three survive: the ''Pas de trois des Odalisques'' from his revival of the ballet ''[[Le Corsaire]]'' (set to the music of [[Adolphe Adam]] and [[Cesare Pugni]], choreographed for 3 women); the ''Paquita Pas de trois'' added to his 1881 revival of the ballet ''[[Paquita]]'' (set to the music of [[Ludwig Minkus]] and [[Eduard Deldevez]], sometimes referred to as the ''Golden Pas de trois'' or ''Minkus Pas de trois'', and choreographed for 2 women and one man); and the ''Pas de trois'' from the first act of his 1895 revival of the ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (choreographed for 2 women and one man).

Typically Petipa fashioned the ''Entrée'' of a ''Pas de trois'' in such a way so that the dancer who performs the first [[Variation (ballet)|variation]] exits the stage about 3 quarters of the way through in order to rest and prepare for his or her solo.

In [[military]]/[[security]] studies and [[international relations]], "'''police action'''" is a [[euphemism]] for a military action undertaken without a formal [[declaration of war]].

Since [[World War II]], formal declarations of war have been rare, especially actions conducted by developed nations in connection with the [[Cold War]]. Rather, nations involved in military conflict (especially the major-power nations) sometimes describe the conflict by fighting the war under the auspices of a "police action" to show that it is a limited military operation different from [[total war]].

[[File:CO 1069-485-16 (7887880108).jpg|thumb|right|The surviving crews of the SS ''Nisero'', 1878.]]
The earliest appearance of the phrase was in 1883, referring to attempts by Netherlands forces and English forces to liberate the 28-man crew of the SS ''Nisero'', who were held hostage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?160714&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch term ''[[politionele acties]]'' (police actions) was used for this.  It was also used to imply a formal claim of sovereignty by [[colonialism|colonial powers]], such as in the military actions of the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], and other allies during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945–1949) and the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948–1960).{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Examples of "police actions"==
The two major [[Dutch military]] offensives, of July 1947 and December 1948, during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] were referred to by the Dutch government as the [[Operation Product|first]] and [[Operation Kraai|second]] "[[Politionele acties|police actions]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vickers|first1=Adrian|title=A History of Modern Indonesia|date=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University ya ya yaPress|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-54262-6|pages=99-100, 110-111|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 invasion, by [[India]], of [[Hyderabad State]], code named [[Operation Polo]], was referred to as a police action by the [[Government of India|government]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the early days of the [[Korean War]], President [[Harry S. Truman]] referred to the United States response to the North Korean invasion as a "police action" under the aegis of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=594 The President's News Conference of June 29, 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the secession of [[Biafra]] in 1967, the Nigerian military government launched a "police action" to retake the secessionist territory beginning the [[Nigerian civil war]].

The [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Kargil War]] were undeclared wars and hence are sometimes described as police actions.

The [[Soviet–Afghan War]] was an undeclared war and hence also could be described as a police action, especially since the initial troop deployments into [[Afghanistan]] were at the request of the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]].

In other events, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] (of the United States) had not made a formal declaration of war, yet the President, as the [[commander-in-chief]], has claimed authority to send in the armed forces when he deemed necessary, with or without the approval of Congress. The legal legitimacy of each of these actions was based upon declarations such as the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] and [[Iraq Resolution]] by Congress and various [[United Nations resolution]]s. Nonetheless, Congressional approval has been asserted by means of funding appropriations or other authorizations as well as the contested [[War Powers Resolution]].

===Under international law===
{{Further|Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter#Article 42|Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter}}
Police actions are authorized specifically by the Security Council under Article 53 (for regional action) or Article 42 (for global action). In both cases, the term used in the Charter text (English) is 'enforcement action'; the term 'police action' is not used.

==Appropriate use of the term==
Use of the term does not appear to have gained currency outside of the limited arena of justification of military action:{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} for example, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] refers to the Korean conflict as the Korean War, and when they refer to police action, they surround the term in [[quotation marks]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/kowar/kowar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis-inline|date=December 2010}}

Similarly, a plaque at the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] refers to the Vietnam Conflict as a war, not a police action, even though it was undeclared.

Use of the term "police action" is intended to imply either a claim of formal sovereignty or of authority to intervene militarily at a nation's own discretion, typically unilaterally or with a small group of nations. This is often done through the United Nations or by asserting that the military operation is defensive or humanitarian in nature such as the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti]] or the [[Invasion of Grenada]].

Veterans often display a high degree of disdain for the term "police action", as it somehow implies that their sacrifices were not legitimate and perhaps also that they are not even veterans of a true "war".{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

'''Portuguese verbs''' display a high degree of [[inflection]]. A typical regular verb has over fifty different forms, expressing up to six different [[grammatical tense]]s and three [[grammatical mood|moods]]. Two forms are peculiar to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] within the [[Romance languages]]:
* The personal [[infinitive]], a [[non-finite verb|non-finite form]] which does not show tense, but is inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]].
* The future [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], is sometimes archaic in some dialects (including peninsular) of related languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but still active in Portuguese.

It has also several verbal [[periphrasis|periphrases]].

==Overview==
Portuguese verbs have the following properties.

# Two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]—singular, plural
# Three [[Grammatical person|persons]]—first, second, third
# Three [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]—perfective, imperfective, progressive*
# Two [[Grammatical voice|voices]]—active, passive*
# Six [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological forms]] for [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], aspects, and/or moods — present, preterite, imperfect, pluperfect, future, and conditional.
# Three (or four) [[Grammatical mood|moods]]—indicative, subjunctive, imperative (and conditional, according to some authors)

Classes with an asterisk are entirely [[periphrasis|periphrastic]]. The passive voice can be constructed in two different ways. The pluperfect and the future of the indicative mood, as well as the conditional form, are often replaced with other verbal constructions or [[periphrasis|verbal periphrases]] in the spoken language.

==Basic tenses and moods==

Conjugation is demonstrated here with the important [[irregular verb]] ''[[wikt:fazer#Portuguese|fazer]]'' "to do". The Portuguese names of the tenses (''tempos'') and moods (''modos'') are given along with their English translations.

===Notes===
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name=fn1|The pluperfect indicative can also be expressed with an equivalent periphrasis.}}
{{efn|name=fn2|The [[future tense|future]] indicative is usually replaced with a periphrasis or the present indicative in the spoken language.}}
{{efn|name=fn3|The Portuguese [[conditional mood|conditional]] is sometimes replaced with a [[periphrasis]] or with the imperfect indicative in the spoken language. Some authors regard it as a mood of its own, others treat it as a tense of the indicative mood.}}
{{efn|name=fn4|In regular verbs, the future [[subjunctive]] and the personal infinitive are identical.}}
{{efn|name=fn5|See the section on the imperative, below.}}
}}

===Description===

The tenses correspond to:
* Present (''presente''): "I do" or "I am doing".
* Preterite (''pretérito'', or ''pretérito perfeito''): "I did" or "I have done".
* Imperfect (''imperfeito'', or ''pretérito imperfeito''): "I did", "I used to do", "I was doing".
* Pluperfect (''mais-que-perfeito'', or ''pretérito mais-que-perfeito''): "I had done".
* Future (''futuro'', or ''futuro do presente'' in [[Brazilian Portuguese]]): "I will do", "I am going to do".
* Conditional (''condicional'', or ''futuro do pretérito'' in [[Brazilian Portuguese]]): "I would do". Used in some types of [[conditional sentence]]s, as a form of courtesy, or as a future-in-the-past.

The five [[non-finite verb|non-finite forms]] generally correspond to:
* (Impersonal) infinitive (''infinitivo'', or ''infinitivo impessoal''): equivalent to English "to do".
* Past participle (''particípio'', or ''particípio passado''): equivalent to English "done".
* Present participle (''particípio presente''): equivalent to English "doing".
* Gerund (''gerúndio''): equivalent to English "doing".
* Personal infinitive (''infinitivo pessoal''): "(for me) to do", an infinitive which [[inflection|inflects]] according to its [[subject (grammar)|subject]]; a rare feature that Portuguese shares with [[Galician language|Galician]].

The moods are used roughly as follows:
* Indicative (''indicativo''): for factual statements or positive beliefs. Example of an English equivalent: "I have done".
* Subjunctive (''subjuntivo'', or ''conjuntivo''): mostly used when speaking of unreal, uncertain, or unassumed conditions: "Were I to do".
* Imperative (''imperativo''): for direct commands or requests; equivalent to the English "Do!"

For the Portuguese personal pronouns (which are omitted whenever they can be inferred from the ending of the conjugated verb or the context), see [[Portuguese personal pronouns and possessives]].

==Conjugations==
Regular verbs belong to one of three [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation classes]], distinguished by the ending of their [[infinitive]] forms (which is also their [[Lemma (morphology)|citation form]]):
* Those whose infinitive ends in '''-ar''' belong to the '''''first conjugation''''' (e.g. ''lavar'', ''matar'', ''ladrar'');
* Those whose infinitive ends in '''-er''' belong to the '''''second conjugation''''' (e.g. ''correr'', ''comer'', ''colher'');
* Those whose infinitive ends in '''-ir''' belong to the '''''third conjugation''''' (e.g. ''partir'', ''destruir'', ''urdir'');
The verb ''pôr'' is conventionally placed in the ''second conjugation'' by many authors, since it is derived from Old Portuguese ''poer'' (Latin ''ponere''). In any event, this is an [[irregular verb]] whose conjugation must be learned on its own. Other verbs with infinitives ending in '''-or''', such as ''depor'', ''compor'', and ''propor'' are derivatives of ''pôr'', and are conjugated in the same way.

==Conditional and future==
There are few irregular verbs for these tenses (only ''[https://www.conjugateverb.com/pt/c--dizer dizer]'', ''[https://www.conjugateverb.com/pt/c--fazer fazer]'', ''trazer'', and their compounds – also ''haver'', ''ter'', ''ser'', ''ir'', ''pôr'', ''estar'', etc. – for the subjunctive future imperfect). The indicative future imperfect, conditional, and subjunctive future imperfect are formed by adding to the infinitive of the verb the indicative present inflections of the [[auxiliary verb]] ''haver'' (dropping the ''h'' and ''av''), the 2nd/3rd conjugation endings of the preterite, imperfect, and the personal infinitive endings, respectively. Thus, for the majority of verbs, the simple personal infinitive coincides with subjunctive future.

==Imperative==
The affirmative imperative for second person pronouns ''tu'' and ''vós'' is obtained from the present indicative, by deletion of the final ''-s'' (in some cases, an accent mark must be added to the vowel which precedes it). For other persons, and for negative clauses, the present subjunctive takes the role of imperative.

==Pronunciation of present inflections==
In the present tense, the stress fluctuates between the root and the termination. As a rule of thumb, the last radical vowel (the one that can be stressed) will retain its original pronunciation when unstressed (atonic) and change into {{IPA|[a]}}, {{IPA|[e]}} (subjunctive or indicative 1st pers sing)/{{IPA|[ɛ]}} (infinitive), or {{IPA|[o]}} (subjunctive or indicative 1st pers sing)/{{IPA|[ɔ]}} (infinitive) – depending on the vowel in question – in case it is stressed (is in a tonic syllable). Other vowels (''u'', ''i'') and nasalized sounds will probably stay unchanged.

Example: Consider the conjugation of ''correr'' (analogous to ''comer'', presented above) in the Indicative Present Simple. The first-person singular ''corro'' has {{IPA|[o]}} in the stressed vowel, while other forms ''corres, corre, correm'' have {{IPA|[ɔ]}}.

In Portugal, all verbs with {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} in the stem vowel alternate similarly ({{IPA|/e/}} alternates between {{IPA|[e]}} in the 1st person singular and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} elsewhere). In the forms where the stem vowel is unstressed, the {{IPA|/e/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɨ]}} and the {{IPA|/o/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/u/}} in some verbs (e.g. ''comer'') and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in others (e.g. ''absorver'', below). The difference is probably due to whether the stem syllable is open (followed by at most one consonant) or closed (followed by at least two consonants).

In Brazil, the following difference apply:
* Alternation in stem-stressed forms is similar, but is blocked when a nasal consonant ({{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/ɲ/}}) follows, in which case the higher alternant (i.e. {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/e/}}) is used in all forms. For example, in the verb ''comer'', all of the forms ''como, comes, come, comem'' have {{IPA|/o/}}.
* Stem-unstressed forms consistently have {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} for most speakers in most verbs, but there are exceptions, with some dialects (e.g. northeastern Brazilian dialects) likely to present an open form {{IPA|/ɔ/}} or {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. At times, the difference is not particularly clear, producing {{IPA|[o̞]}}, {{IPA|[e̞]}}, particularly in transition zones like the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and the Brazilian Federal District, unless vowel harmony is involved (e.g. ''comove'' "move, touch (emotionally)" {{IPA|[k'''ɔ'''ˈmɔvi]}}).

Example, ''abs'''o'''rver'' "to absorb" ({{IPA|[u]}} in Portugal, {{IPA|[o]}} in Brazil).

It will be conjugated in Portugal as
{{IPA|[ɐpˈs'''o'''ɾvu]}},
{{IPA|[ɐpˈs'''ɔ'''ɾvɨʃ]}},
{{IPA|[ɐpˈs'''ɔ'''ɾvɨ]}},
{{IPA|[ɐps'''ɔ'''ɾˈvemuʃ]}},
{{IPA|[ɐps'''ɔ'''ɾˈvɐjʃ]}},
{{IPA|[ɐpˈs'''ɔ'''ɾvɐ̃j]}}.

In Brazil, it is pronounced approximately as
{{IPA|[abiˈs'''o'''xvu]}},
{{IPA|[abiˈs'''ɔ'''xvis]}},
{{IPA|[abiˈs'''ɔ'''xvi]}},
{{IPA|[abis'''o'''xˈvemus]}},
{{IPA|[abis'''o'''xˈvejs]}},
{{IPA|[abiˈs'''ɔ'''xvẽj]}}. ("Approximately" because some dialects don't have the "i" sound after b, and some substitute different sounds for the {{IPA|[x]}} and the final {{IPA|[s]}}.)

This also has repercussions in the imperative, for its inflections are constructed from the Indicative Present Simple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1480">'''Presidential Proclamation 2714''' (61 Stat. 1048) was signed by President [[Harry S. Truman]] on December 31, 1946, to officially declare the cessation of all hostilities in [[World War II]]. Even though the actual combat of the war ended May 8, 1945, in [[Europe]] and September 2, 1945, in the [[Pacific]], the state of war was not lifted off of Japan and Germany in order to give a reason for the necessity of occupation troops in these countries. Once the War Crimes Trials were over, the hostilities were seen as over. The signing of Proclamation 2714 is the reason why the U.S. recognizes its World War II veterans as anyone who has served between the dates of December 7, 1941, and ''December 31, 1946''.

The declarations of war against Japan and Germany in 1941 were officially lifted as follows:

* '''September 8, 1951''': Forty-nine nations sign the Japanese Peace Treaty in San Francisco, officially ending World War II and re-establishing Japanese sovereignty.
* '''October 19, 1951''': President Truman signs an act formally ending World War II, after having Congress abolish the ''state of war'' with Germany ({{USPL|82|181}}).

&lt;/ref&gt; American psychologists began to attempt to study repression in the experimental laboratory around 1930. However, psychoanalysts were at first disinterested in attempts to study repression in laboratory settings, and later came to reject them. Most psychoanalysts concluded that such attempts misrepresented the psychoanalytic concept of repression.

==Sigmund Freud's theory==

As [[Sigmund Freud]] moved away from [[hypnosis]], and towards urging his patients to remember the past in a conscious state, 'the very difficulty and laboriousness of the process led Freud to a crucial insight'.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1998) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of his struggles to get his patients to recall past memories led him to conclude that 'there was some force that prevented them from becoming conscious and compelled them to remain unconscious ... pushed the pathogenetic experiences in question out of consciousness. I gave the name of ''repression'' to this hypothetical process'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1995) p. 28–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud would later call the theory of repression "the corner-stone on which the whole structure of psychoanalysis rests" ("On the History of the Psycho-Analytic Movement").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/repression Repression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906032856/http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/repression |date=2010-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud developed many of his early concepts with his mentor, [[Josef Breuer]]. Moreover, while Freud himself noted that the philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in 1884 had hinted at a notion of repression (but he had only read him in later life), he did not mention that [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], psychologist and founder of [[pedagogy]] whose ideas were very influential in Freud's environment and in particular with Freud's psychiatry teacher [[Theodor Meynert]], had used the term in 1824 in his discussion of unconscious ideas competing to get into consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/studiesonhysteri037649mbp/studiesonhysteri037649mbp_djvu.txt xxii Introduction to Studies on Hysteria]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages ===
Freud considered that there was 'reason to assume that there is a ''primal repression'', a first phase of repression, which consists in the psychical (ideational) representative of the instinct being denied entrance into the conscious', as well as a 'second stage of repression, ''repression proper'', which affects mental derivatives of the repressed representative: distinguished what he called a first stage of '''primal'' repression' from 'the case of repression proper ("after-pressure").'&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 147 and p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

In the primary repression phase, 'it is highly probable that the immediate precipitating causes of primal repressions are quantitative factors such as ... the earliest outbreaks of anxiety, which are of a very intense kind'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; The child realizes that acting on some desires may bring [[anxiety]]. This anxiety leads to repression of the desire.

When it is internalized, the threat of punishment related to this form of anxiety becomes the [[superego]], which intercedes against the desires of the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] (which works on the basis of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]). Freud speculated that 'it is perhaps the emergence of the super-ego which provides the line of demarcation between primal repression and after-pressure'&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

===Therapy===

Abnormal repression, as defined by Freud, or [[Neurosis|neurotic behavior]] occurs when repression develops under the influence of the superego and the internalized feelings of anxiety, in ways leading to behavior that is illogical, self-destructive, or anti-social.

A [[psychotherapist]] may try to ameliorate this behavior by revealing and re-introducing the repressed aspects of the patient's [[mental process]]es to their conscious [[awareness]] - 'assuming the role of mediator and peacemaker ... to lift the repression'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Five Lectures'' p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In favourable circumstances, '''Repression'' is replaced by a ''condemning judgement'' carried out along the best lines',&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Five Lectures'' p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; thereby reducing anxiety over the impulses involved.

=== Reactions ===
The philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] challenged Freud's theory by maintaining that there is no "mechanism" that represses unwanted thoughts. Since "all consciousness is conscious of itself" we will be aware of the process of repression, even if skilfully dodging an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=John G.|date=2016-12-01|title=Sartre and the Imagination: Top Shelf Magazines|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-016-9358-x|journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=775–784|doi=10.1007/s12119-016-9358-x|issn=1095-5143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]], writing in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (1995), stated that Sartre's argument that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of Freud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|author=Baldwin, Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-19-926479-1|editor=Honderich, Ted|location=Oxford|pages=835–7|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], writing in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), argued that Freud's theory of repression disproves the claim, made by [[Karl Popper]] and [[Ernest Nagel]], that Freudian theory implies no testable observation and therefore does not have genuine predictive power, since the theory has "strong empirical content" and implies testable consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation|author=Scruton, Roger|publisher=Phoenix|year=1994|isbn=1-85799-100-1|location=London|page=201|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

The psychoanalyst [[Otto Fenichel]] stressed that 'if the disappearance of the original aim from consciousness is called repression, every [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] is a repression (a "successful" one: through the new type of discharge, the old one has become superfluous)'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] stressed the role of the signifier in repression — 'the primal repressed is a signifier' — examining how the symptom is 'constituted on the basis of primal repression, of the fall, of the ''Unterdrückung'', of the binary signifier ... the necessary fall of this first signifier'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 176, p. 236, and p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Family therapy]] has explored how familial taboos lead to 'this screening-off that Freud called "repression"', emphasising the way that 'keeping part of ourselves out of our awareness is a very ''active'' process ... a deliberate ''hiding'' of some feeling from our family'.&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (1993) p. 36–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental attempts to study repression==
According to the psychologist [[Donald W. MacKinnon]] and his co-author William F. Dukes, American psychologists began to attempt to study repression in the experimental laboratory around 1930. These psychologists were influenced by an exposition of the concept of repression published by the psychoanalyst [[Ernest Jones]] in the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'' in 1911. Like other psychologists who attempted to submit the claims of psychoanalysis to experimental test, they did not immediately try to develop new techniques for that purpose, instead conducting surveys of the psychological literature to see whether "experiments undertaken to test other theoretical assertions" had produced results relevant to assessing psychoanalysis. In 1930, H. Meltzer published a survey of experimental literature on "the relationships between feeling and memory" in an attempt to determine the relevance of laboratory findings to "that aspect of the theory of repression which posits a relationship between hedonic tone and conscious memory." However, according to MacKinnon and Dukes, because Meltzer had an inadequate grasp of psychoanalytic writing he misinterpreted Freud's view that the purpose of repression is to avoid "unpleasure", taking the term to mean simply something unpleasant, whereas for Freud it actually meant deep-rooted anxiety. Nevertheless, Meltzer pointed out shortcomings in the studies he reviewed, and in MacKinnon and Dukes's view he also "recognized that most of the investigations which he reviewed had not been designed specifically to test the Freudian theory of repression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=MacKinnon, Donald W. |author2=Dukes, William F. |editor=Postman, Leo |title=Psychology in the Making: Histories of Selected Research Problems |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=1962 |page=663, 673-674 |isbn=0-19-866224-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the psychologist [[Saul Rosenzweig]] and his co-author G. Mason criticized Meltzer, concluding that the studies he reviewed suffered from two basic problems: that the studies "worked with hedonic tone associated with sensory stimuli unrelated to the theory of repression rather than with conative hedonic tone associated with frustrated striving, which is the only kind of 'unpleasantnesss' which, according to the Freudian theory, leads to repression" and that they "failed to develop under laboratory control the experiences which are subsequently to be tested for recall". In MacKinnon and Dukes's view, psychologists who wanted to study repression in the laboratory "faced the necessity of becoming clear about the details of the psychoanalytic formulation of repression if their researches were to be adequate tests of the theory" but soon discovered that "to grasp clearly even a single psychoanalytic concept was an almost insurmountable task." MacKinnon and Dukes attribute this situation to the way in which Freud repeatedly modified his theory "without ever stating clearly just which of his earlier formulations were to be completely discarded, or if not discarded, how they were to be understood in the light of his more recent assertions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=MacKinnon, Donald W. |author2=Dukes, William F. |editor=Postman, Leo |title=Psychology in the Making: Histories of Selected Research Problems |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=1962 |pages=674-675 |isbn=0-19-866224-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKinnon and Dukes write that, while psychoanalysts were at first only disinterested in attempts to study repression in laboratory settings, they later came to reject them. They comment that while "the psychologists had criticized each other's researches largely on the grounds that their experimental techniques and laboratory controls had not been fully adequate, the psychoanalysts rejected them on the more sweeping grounds that whatever else these researches might be they simply were not investigations of repression." They relate that in 1934, when Freud was sent reprints of Rosenzweig's attempts to study repression, he responded with a dismissive letter stating that "the wealth of reliable observations" on which psychoanalytic assertions were based made them "independent of experimental verification." In the same letter, Freud concluded that Rosenzweig's studies "can do no harm." MacKinnon and Dukes describe this conclusion of Freud's as a "first rather casual opinion", and state that most psychoanalysts eventually adopted a view contrary to that of Freud, becoming convinced that "such studies could indeed be harmful since they misrepresented what psychoanalysts conceived repression to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=MacKinnon, Donald W. |author2=Dukes, William F. |editor=Postman, Leo |title=Psychology in the Making: Histories of Selected Research Problems |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=1962 |pages=701-703 |isbn=0-19-866224-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repressed memories ==
{{Main|Repressed memory}}
One of the issues Freud struggled with was the status of the childhood "memories" recovered from repression in his therapy. He concluded that "these scenes from infancy are not always true. Indeed, they are not true in the majority of cases, and in a few of them they are the direct opposite of the historical truth".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy arose in the late 20th century about the status of such "recovered memories", particularly of child abuse, with many claiming that Freud had been wrong to ignore the reality of such recovered memories.

While accepting "the realities of child abuse", the feminist [[Elaine Showalter]] considered it important that one "distinguishes between abuse remembered all along, abuse spontaneously remembered, abuse recovered in therapy, and abuse suggested in therapy".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Showalter, ''Hystories'' (London 1997) p. 158 and p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The memory researcher [[Elizabeth Loftus]], has shown that it is possible to implant [[false memories]] in individuals, it is possible to "come to doubt the validity of therapeutically recovered memories of sexual abuse ... [as] confabulations".&lt;ref&gt;Showalter, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; However, criminal prosecutors continue to present them as evidence in legal cases {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

There is debate about the possibility of the repression of [[psychological trauma]]. While some evidence suggests that "adults who have been through overwhelming trauma can suffer a psychic numbing, blocking out memory of or feeling about the catastrophe",&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; it appears that the trauma more often ''strengthens'' memories due to heightened emotional or physical sensations.&lt;ref name="NPR-Aronson"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12125926 NPR: Why It's Hard to Admit to Being Wrong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108074330/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12125926 |date=2018-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (However these sensations may also cause distortions, as [[human memory]] in general is filtered both by layers of perception, and by "appropriate mental schema ... spatio-temporal schemata").&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 679–80&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Rett syndrome''' ('''RTT''') is a genetic [[brain disorder]] which typically becomes apparent after 6 to 18 months of age in females.&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; Symptoms include problems with language, coordination, and repetitive movements.&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; Often there is slower growth, problems walking, and a [[microcephaly|smaller head size]].&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Rett Syndrome Fact Sheet|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Rett-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet|website=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|accessdate=14 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014183306/https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Rett-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet|archivedate=14 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complications can include [[seizures]], [[scoliosis]], and [[sleeping problems]].&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; Those affected, however, may be affected to different degrees.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Rett syndrome is due to a genetic mutation of the [[MECP2]] gene.&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; This gene occurs on the [[X chromosome]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Typically it develops as a new mutation, with less than one percent of cases being inherited from a person's parents.&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; It occurs almost exclusively in girls.&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; Boys who have a similar mutation typically die shortly after birth.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Diagnosis is based on symptoms and can be confirmed with [[genetic testing]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
There is no known cure for Rett syndrome.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Treatment is directed at improving symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; [[Anticonvulsant]]s may be used to help with seizures.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; [[Special education]], physiotherapy, and braces may also be useful.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Many people with the condition live into middle age.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
The condition affects about 1 in 8,500 females.&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; [[Andreas Rett]], a pediatrician in Vienna, first described the condition in 1966.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rett1966"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rett |first=A. |author-link=Andreas Rett |date=1966-09-10 |title=[On a unusual brain atrophy syndrome in hyperammonemia in childhood]|journal=[[Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift]] |language=de |volume=116 |issue=37 |pages=723–726 |issn=0043-5341 |pmid=5300597 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his writings were in German, they did not become widely known in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name="Per2013" /&gt; Bengt Hagberg, a Swedish pediatrician, published an English article in 1983 and named the condition after Rett.&lt;ref name="Per2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Percy |first=Alan |date=January 2014 |title=The American History of Rett Syndrome |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0887899413005432 |journal=Pediatric Neurology |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2013.08.018|pmc=3874243}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Lebanese-American physician [[Huda Zoghbi]] discovered the mutation that causes the condition.&lt;ref name="Per2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huda1999&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/13810 | title=Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X-linked MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 | year=1999 | last1=Amir | first1=Ruthie | last2=Van den Veyver | first2=Ignatia | last3=Wan | first3=Mimi | last4=Tran | first4=Charles | last5=Francke | first5=Uta | last6=Zoghbi | first6=Huda | journal=Nature Genetics | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages=185–8 | pmid=10508514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
===Stage I===
Stage I, called early onset, typically begins between 6 and 18 months of age.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; This stage is often overlooked because symptoms of the disorder may be somewhat vague, and parents and doctors may not notice the subtle slowing of development at first.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; The infant may begin to show less eye contact and have reduced interest in toys. There may be delays in gross motor skills such as sitting or crawling.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Hand-wringing and decreasing head growth may occur, but not enough to draw attention. This stage usually lasts for a few months but can continue for more than a year.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

===Stage II===
Stage II, or the rapid destructive stage, usually begins between ages 1 and 4 and may last for weeks or months.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Its onset may be rapid or gradual as the child loses purposeful hand skills and spoken language.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Characteristic hand movements such as wringing, washing, clapping, or tapping, as well as repeatedly moving the hands to the mouth often begin during this stage.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; The child may hold the hands clasped behind the back or held at the sides, with random touching, grasping, and releasing.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; The movements continue while the child is awake but disappear during sleep.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Breathing irregularities such as episodes of apnea and hyperventilation may occur, although breathing usually improves during sleep.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Some girls also display autistic-like symptoms such as loss of social interaction and communication.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Walking may be unsteady and initiating motor movements can be difficult. Slowed head growth is usually noticed during this stage.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

===Stage III===
Stage III, or the plateau or pseudo-stationary stage, usually begins between ages 2 and 10 and can last for years.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; [[Apraxia]], motor problems, and [[seizure]]s are prominent during this stage.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; However, there may be improvement in behavior, with less irritability, crying, and [[autistic]]-like features.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; In stage III there may be more interest in the surroundings and alertness, attention span, and communication skills may improve.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Many girls remain in this stage for most of their lives.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

===Stage IV===
Stage IV, or the late motor deterioration stage, can last for years or decades.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Prominent features include reduced mobility, [[scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], and muscle weakness, rigidity, spasticity, and increased muscle tone with abnormal posturing of an arm, leg.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Girls who were previously able to walk may stop walking.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Cognition, communication, or hand skills generally do not decline in stage IV.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Repetitive hand movements may decrease and eye gaze usually improves.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

The definition itself of the Rett syndrome has been refined over the years: as the atypical forms subsist near to the classical form (Hagberg &amp; Gillberg, 1993), the "Rett Complex" terminology has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gillberg |first=C. |year=1997 |title=Communication in Rett syndrome complex |journal=[[European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry]] |volume=6 Suppl 1 |pages=21–2 |pmid=9452914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zappella |first=Michele |last2=Gillberg |first2=Christopher |last3=Ehlers |first3=Stephan |year=1998 |title=The preserved speech variant: A subgroup of the Rett complex: A clinical report of 30 cases |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=519–26 |doi=10.1023/A:1026052128305 |pmid=9932238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Genetically, Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the gene [[MECP2]] located on the X chromosome (which is involved in transcriptional silencing and epigenetic regulation of methylated DNA), and can arise sporadically or from germline mutations. In less than 10% of RTT cases, mutations in the genes [[CDKL5]] or [[FOXG1]] have also been found to resemble it. Rett syndrome is initially diagnosed by clinical observation, but the diagnosis is definitive when there is a genetic defect in the MECP2 gene. In some very rare cases, no known mutated gene can be found; possibly due to changes in MECP2 that are not identified by presently used techniques or mutations in other genes that may result in clinical similarities.

It has been argued that Rett syndrome is in fact a neurodevelopmental condition as opposed to a neurodegenerative condition. One piece of evidence for this is that mice with induced Rett Syndrome show no neuronal death, and some studies have suggested that their phenotypes can be partially rescued by adding functional MECP2 gene back when they are adults. This information has also helped lead to further studies aiming to treat the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Guy |first=J. |last2=Gan |first2=J. |last3=Selfridge |first3=J. |last4=Cobb |first4=S. |last5=Bird |first5=A. |year=2007 |title=Reversal of Neurological Defects in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |issue=5815 |pages=1143–7 |doi=10.1126/science.1138389 |pmid=17289941|bibcode=2007Sci...315.1143G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sporadic mutations===

In at least 95% of Rett syndrome cases, the cause is a [[Mutation|''de novo'' mutation]] in the child. That is, it is not inherited from either parent. Parents are generally genotypically normal, without a MECP2 mutation.

In cases of the sporadic form of RTT, the mutated MECP2 is thought to derive almost exclusively from a de novo mutation on the male copy of the X chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Trappe |first=R. |last2=Laccone |first2=F. |last3=Cobilanschi |first3=J. |last4=Meins |first4=M. |last5=Huppke |first5=P. |last6=Hanefeld |first6=F. |last7=Engel |first7=W. |year=2001 |title=MECP2 Mutations in Sporadic Cases of Rett Syndrome Are Almost Exclusively of Paternal Origin |journal=[[The American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1093–101 |doi=10.1086/320109 |pmc=1226090 |pmid=11309679}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not yet known what causes the sperm to mutate, and such mutations are rare.

===Germline mutations===
It can also be inherited from phenotypically normal mothers who have a [[germline]] mutation in the gene encoding ''methyl-CpG-binding protein-2'', [[MeCP2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zoghbi |first=Huda Y. |last2=Van Den Veyver |first2=Ruthie E. |last3=Wan |first3=Ignatia B. |last4=Tran |first4=Mimi |last5=Francke |first5=Charles Q. |last6=Zoghbi |first6=Uta |year=1999 |title=Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X-linked MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 |journal=[[Nature Genetics]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=185–8 |doi=10.1038/13810 |pmid=10508514}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, inheritance follows an [[X-linked dominant inheritance|X-linked dominant]] pattern and is seen almost exclusively in females, as most males die ''[[in utero]]'' or shortly after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/rett-syndrome#inheritance |title=Rett syndrome |website=Genetics Home Reference |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727231653/https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/rett-syndrome#inheritance |archive-date=2016-07-27 |dead-url=no |access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; MECP2 is found near the end of the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq28. An atypical form of RTT, characterized by infantile spasms or early onset epilepsy, can also be caused by a mutation to the gene encoding ''cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5'' ([[CDKL5]]). Rett syndrome affects one in every 12,500 female live births by age 12 years.

==Mechanism==
===Pontine noradrenergic deficits===
Brain levels of [[norepinephrine]] are lower in people with Rett syndrome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ana.410250109 |title=Cerebrospinal fluid biogenic amines and biopterin in Rett syndrome |year=1989 |last1=Zoghbi |first1=Huda Y. |last2=Milstien |first2=Sheldon |last3=Butler |first3=Ian J. |last4=Smith |first4=E.

Researchers have concluded that "Because these neurons are a pivotal source of norepinephrine throughout the brainstem and forebrain and are involved in the regulation of diverse functions disrupted in Rett syndrome, such as respiration and cognition, we hypothesize that the locus coeruleus is a critical site at which loss of ''MECP2'' results in CNS dysfunction." The restoration of normal locus coeruleus function may therefore be of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of Rett syndrome.&lt;ref name="Taneja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt;

===Midbrain dopaminergic disturbances===
The majority of dopamine in the mammalian brain is synthesized by nuclei located in the [[mesencephalon]]. The [[substantia nigra]] pars compacta (SNpc), the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) and the [[retrorubral field]] (RRF) contains dopaminergic neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (Th, i.e. the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical Neuroanatomy |last=Björklund |first=A. |last2=Lindvall |first2=O |publisher=Elsevier |year=1984 |editor-last=Björklund |editor-first=A. |series=Classical Transmitters in the CNS, Part l |volume=2 |location=New York |pages=55–122 |chapter=Dopamine-containing systems in the CNS |editor-last2=Hökfelt |editor-first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical Neuroanatomy |last=Hokfelt |first=T. |last2=Martensson |first2=R. |last3=Björklund |first3=A. |last4=Kleinau |first4=S. |last5=Goldstein |first5=M. |publisher=Elsevier |year=1984 |editor-last=Björklund |editor-first=A. |series=Classical Transmitters in the CNS, Part I |volume=2 |location=New York |pages=277–379 |chapter=Distribution maps of tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the rat brain |editor-last2=Hökfelt |editor-first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Björklund |first=Anders |last2=Dunnett |first2=Stephen B. |year=2007 |title=Dopamine neuron systems in the brain: An update |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=194–202 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.03.006 |pmid=17408759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nigro-striatal pathway originates from SNpc and irradiate its principal rostral target, the Caudate-Putamen (CPu) through the median forebrain bundle (MFB). This connection is involved in the tight modulation of motor strategies computed by a cortico-basal ganglia- thalamo-cortical loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0165-0173(94)00007-C |title=Functional anatomy of the basal ganglia.

Indeed, based on the canonical anatomofunctional model of basal ganglia, nigrostriatal dopamine is able to modulate the motor loop by acting on dopaminergic receptors located on striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gerfen |first=Charles R. |year=2000 |title=Molecular effects of dopamine on striatal-projection pathways |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=23 |issue=10 Suppl |pages=S64–70 |doi=10.1016/S1471-1931(00)00019-7 |pmid=11052222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the motor spectrum of the RTT phenotype, ''Mecp2''-null mice show motor abnormalities from postnatal day 30 that worsen until death. These models offer a crucial substrate to elucidate the molecular and neuroanatomical correlates of an ''MeCP2''-deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/FBP.0b013e32830c3645 |title=Mouse models of Rett syndrome: From behavioural phenotyping to preclinical evaluation of new therapeutic approaches |year=2008 |last1=Ricceri |first1=Laura |last2=De Filippis |first2=Bianca |last3=Laviola |first3=Giovanni |journal=Behavioural Pharmacology |volume=19 |issue=5–6 |pages=501–17 |pmid=18690105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently (2008), it was shown that the conditional deletion of ''Mecp2'' in catecholaminergic neurons (by crossing of Th-Cre mice with loxP-flanked ''Mecp2'' ones) recapitulates a motor symptomatology, it was further documented that brain levels of Th in mice lacking ''MeCP2'' in catecholaminergic neurons only are reduced, participating to the motor phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0912257106 |title=Loss of MeCP2 in aminergic neurons causes cell-autonomous defects in neurotransmitter synthesis and specific behavioral abnormalities |year=2009 |last1=Samaco |first1=R.

However, the most studied model for the evaluation of therapeutics is the ''Mecp2''-null mouse (totally devoid of ''MeCP2''). In this context, a reduction in the number and soma size of Th-expressing neurons is present from 5 weeks of age and is accompanied by a decrease of Th immunoreativity in the caudate-putamen, the principal target of dopaminergic neurons arising from the SNpc.&lt;ref name="Panayotis"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2010.10.006 |title=Morphological and functional alterations in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the Mecp2-null mouse |year=2011 |last1=Panayotis |first1=Nicolas |last2=Pratte |first2=Michel |last3=Borges-Correia |first3=Ana |last4=Ghata |first4=Adeline |last5=Villard |first5=Laurent |last6=Roux |first6=Jean-Christophe |journal=Neurobiology of Disease |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=385–97 |pmid=20951208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a neurochemical analysis of dopaminergic contents in microdissected midbrain and striatal areas revealed a reduction of dopamine at five and nine weeks of age. It is noteworthy that later on (at nine weeks), the morphological parameters remain altered but not worsen, whereas the phenotype progresses and behavioral deficits are more severe. The amount of fully activated Th (Serine40-phosphorylated isoform) in neurons that remain in the SNpc is mildly affected at 5 weeks but severely impaired by 9 weeks.&lt;ref name="Panayotis"/&gt; Finally, using a chronic and oral L-Dopa treatment on ''MeCP2''-deficient mice authors reported an amelioration of some of the motor deficits previously identified.&lt;ref name="Panayotis"/&gt; Altogether, these results argue for an alteration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in ''MeCP2''-deficient animals as a contributor of the neuromotor deficits.

There is an association of the disease{{which|date=August 2014}} with [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.01.014 |title=The Ups and Downs of BDNF in Rett Syndrome |year=2006 |last1=Sun |first1=Yi E. |last2=Wu |first2=Hao |journal=Neuron |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=321–3 |pmid=16446133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactive pathway map===
An [[Template:MECP2andAssociatedRettSyndrome WP3584|interactive pathway map of Rett syndrome]] has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrhart|first1=Friederike|last2=Coort|first2=Susan L.

==Diagnosis==
Prior to the discovery of a genetic cause, Rett syndrome had been designated as a [[pervasive developmental disorder]] by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), together with the [[autism spectrum disorders]]. Some argued against this conclusive assignment because RTT resembles non-autistic disorders such as [[fragile X syndrome]], [[tuberous sclerosis]], or [[Down syndrome]] that also exhibit autistic features.&lt;ref name="pmid1483976"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01046327 |title=Is Rett syndrome a subtype of pervasive developmental disorders? |year=1992 |last1=Tsai |first1=Luke Y. |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=551–61 |pmid=1483976|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/44607/1/10803_2005_Article_BF01046327.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After research proved the molecular mechanism, in 2013 the [[DSM-5]] removed the syndrome altogether from classification as a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbeduto|first1=Leonard|last2=Ozonoff|first2=Susan|last3=Thurman|first3=Angela John|last4=McDuffie|first4=Angela|last5=Schweitzer|first5=Julie|editor1-last=Hales|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Yudofsky|editor2-first=Stuart|editor3-last=Robert|editor3-first=Laura Weiss|title=Chapter 8.

Rett syndrome diagnosis involves close observation of the child's growth and development to observe any abnormalities in regards to developmental milestones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rett-syndrome/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20028086|title=Rett syndrome Tests and diagnosis|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030003645/https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rett-syndrome/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20028086|archivedate=2017-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A diagnosis is considered when decreased head growth is observed. Conditions with similar symptoms must first be ruled out.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a certain criteria that must be met for the diagnosis. A blood test can rule in or rule out the presence of the MECP2 mutation, however, this mutation is present in other conditions as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rettsyndrome.org/about-rett-syndrome/about-the-diagnosis?|title=About Rett syndrome - About the Diagnosis - Rettsyndrome.org|website=www.rettsyndrome.org|publisher=International Rett Syndrome Foundation|language=en-us|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029173049/https://www.rettsyndrome.org/about-rett-syndrome/about-the-diagnosis|archivedate=2017-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a classic diagnosis, all four criteria for ruling in a diagnosis must be met, as well as the two criteria for ruling out a diagnosis. A period of symptom regression followed by recovery or symptom stabilization must also occur. Supportive criteria may also be present, but are not required for diagnosis. For an atypical or variant diagnosis, at least two of the four criteria for ruling in the diagnosis must be met, as well as five of the eleven supportive criteria. A period of symptom regression followed by recovery or symptom stabilization must also occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Children are often misdiagnosed as having autism, cerebral palsy, or another form of developmental delay. A positive test for the MECP2 mutation is not enough to make a diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Treatment==
{{Main|Treatment of Rett syndrome}}
Currently there is no cure for Rett syndrome. Treatment is directed towards improving function and addressing symptoms throughout life. A multi-disciplinary team approach is typically used to treat the person throughout life. This team may include primary care physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, nutritionist, and support services in academic and occupational settings.

Treatment of Rett syndrome includes:{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* management of gastrointestinal (reflux, [[constipation]]) and nutritional (poor weight gain) issues
* surveillance of [[scoliosis]]
* surveillance of [[long QT syndrome]] by annual EKG
* increasing the patient's communication skills, especially with augmentative communication strategies
* parental counseling
* modifying social medications
* [[sleep aids]]
* [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs)
* [[anti-psychotic]]s (for self-harming behaviors)
* [[beta-blocker]]s for [[long QT syndrome]]
* [[occupational therapy]], [[speech therapy]] and [[physical therapy]]
}}

Because of the increased risk of sudden cardiac death, when [[long QT syndrome]] is found on an annual screening EKG it is treated with an anti-arrhythmic such as a [[beta-blocker]]. There is some evidence that [[phenytoin]] may be more effective than a beta-blocker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McCauley |first=Mark D. |last2=Wang |first2=Tiannan |last3=Mike |first3=Elise |last4=Herrera |first4=Jose |last5=Beavers |first5=David L. |last6=Huang |first6=Teng-Wei |last7=Ward |first7=Christopher S. |last8=Skinner |first8=Steven |last9=Percy |first9=Alan K. |date=2011-12-14 |title=Pathogenesis of Lethal Cardiac Arrhythmias in Mecp2 Mutant Mice: Implication for Therapy in Rett Syndrome |url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/3/113/113ra125 |journal=[[Science Translational Medicine]] |language=en |volume=3 |issue=113 |pages=113ra125 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3002982 |issn=1946-6234 |pmid=22174313|pmc=3633081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Males with pathogenic ''MECP2'' mutations usually die within the first 2 years from severe [[encephalopathy]], unless they have an extra X chromosome (often described as [[Klinefelter syndrome]]), or have [[mosaic (genetics)|somatic mosaicism]].

Male fetuses with the disorder rarely survive to term. Because the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome, a female born with an MECP2 mutation on her X [[chromosome]] has another X chromosome with an ostensibly normal copy of the same gene, while a male with the mutation on his X chromosome has no other X chromosome, only a Y chromosome; thus, he has no normal gene. Without a normal gene to provide normal proteins in addition to the abnormal proteins caused by a MECP2 mutation, the XY [[karyotype]] male fetus is unable to slow the development of the disease, hence the failure of many male fetuses with a MECP2 mutation to survive to term.

Females with a MECP2 mutation, however, have a non-mutant chromosome that provides them enough normal [[protein]] to survive longer. Research shows that males with Rett syndrome may result from [[Klinefelter's syndrome]], in which the male has an XXY karyotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-2001-16620 |title=Rett Syndrome in a Boy with a 47,XXY Karyotype Confirmed by a Rare Mutation in the MECP2 Gene |year=2001 |last1=Schwartzman |first1=J.

There have, however, been several cases of 46,XY karyotype males with a MECP2 mutation (associated with classical Rett syndrome in females) carried to term, who were affected by neonatal encephalopathy and died before 2 years of age.&lt;ref name="Hardwick-etal-2006" /&gt; The incidence of Rett syndrome in males is unknown, partly owing to the low survival of male fetuses with the Rett syndrome-associated MECP2 mutations, and partly to differences between signs caused by MECP2 mutations and those caused by Rett's.&lt;ref name="Hardwick-etal-2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hardwick |first=Simon A |last2=Reuter |first2=Kirsten |last3=Williamson |first3=Sarah L |last4=Vasudevan |first4=Vidya |last5=Donald |first5=Jennifer |last6=Slater |first6=Katrina |last7=Bennetts |first7=Bruce |last8=Bebbington |first8=Ami |last9=Leonard |first9=Helen |year=2007 |title=Delineation of large deletions of the MECP2 gene in Rett syndrome patients, including a familial case with a male proband |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1218–29 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201911 |pmid=17712354 |lay-source=ScienceDaily |lay-date=August 12, 2006 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060812090802.htm |last10=Williams |first10=Simon R |last11=Smith |first11=Robert L |last12=Cloosterman |first12=Desiree |last13=Christodoulou |first13=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females can live up to 40 years or more. Laboratory studies on Rett syndrome may show abnormalities such as:
* [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] abnormalities from 2 years of age
* atypical brain [[glycolipid]]s
* elevated CSF levels of [[beta-endorphin|''beta''-endorphin]] and [[glutamate]]
* reduction of [[substance P]]
* decreased levels of CSF nerve growth factors

A high proportion of deaths are abrupt, but most have no identifiable cause; in some instances death is the result most likely of:
* spontaneous brainstem dysfunction
* [[cardiac arrest]], likely due to [[long QT syndrome]], [[ventricular tachycardia]] or other arrhythmias&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Acampa |first=M. |last2=Guideri |first2=F. |date=May 2006 |title=Cardiac disease and Rett syndrome |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=440–443 |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.090290 |issn=1468-2044 |pmc=2082747 |pmid=16632674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Rudolf Rocker''' (March 25, 1873 – September 19, 1958) was an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] writer and activist. Though often described as an [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], he was a self-professed [[anarchist without adjectives]], believing that [[anarchist schools of thought]] represented "only different methods of economy" and that the first objective for anarchists was "to secure the [[personal freedom|personal]] and social freedom of men".{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=7}}

== Early life ==
{{Anarcho-syndicalism sidebar}} 
Rudolf Rocker was born to the [[Lithography|lithographer]] Georg Philipp Rocker (1845-1877) and his wife Anna Margaretha née Naumann (1869-1887, daughter of Heinrich Naumann) as one of their four children, in [[Mainz]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]] (now [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]), [[German Empire|Germany]], on March 25, 1873. (His siblings were Philipp, 1870-1873; Catharina Barbara, 20&amp;nbsp;March 1870&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 3&amp;nbsp;April 1870; and Friedrich, b. 1877.) This Catholic, yet not particularly devout, family had a democratic and anti-[[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] tradition dating back to Rocker's grandfather, who participated in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|March Revolution]] of 1848. However, Georg Philipp died just four years after Rocker's birth. After that, the family managed to evade poverty, only through the massive support by his mother's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2002|pp=315–316}}; {{harvnb|Wienand|1981|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Graur|1997|pp=16, 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rocker's uncle and godfather Carl Rudolf Naumann, a long-time member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), became a substitute for his dead parents and a role model, who directed the boy's intellectual development. Rocker was disgusted by his schoolteacher's authoritarian methods, calling the man a "heartless despot". He was, therefore, a poor student.

Rocker's father died in 1877. In October 1884, the Rocker household was joined by his mother's new husband Ludwig Baumgartner. This marriage presented Rudolf with a half brother, Ernest Ludwig Heinrich Baumgartner, with whom Rocker did not maintain close contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graur|1997|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rocker was shocked once again as his mother died in February 1887. After his stepfather remarried soon thereafter, Rocker was put into an orphanage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wienand|1981|pp=20, 28}}; {{harvnb|Graur|1997|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disgusted by the unconditional obedience demanded by the Catholic orphanage and drawn by the prospect of adventure, Rocker ran away from the orphanage twice. The first time he just wandered around in the woods around Mainz with occasional visits to the city to forage for food and was retrieved after three nights. The second time, which was at the age of fourteen and a reaction to the orphanage wanting him to be apprenticed as a [[tinsmith]],{{sfn|Graur|1997|pp=17–18}} he worked as a cabin-boy for [[Köln-Düsseldorfer|Köln-Düsseldorfer Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft]]. He enjoyed leaving his hometown and traveling to places like [[Rotterdam]]. After he returned, he started an apprenticeship to become a typographer like his uncle Carl.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2002|p=316}}; {{harvnb|Wienand|1981|p=30}}; {{harvnb|Graur|1997|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

| Political rights do not originate in parliaments; they are, rather, forced upon parliaments from without. And even their enactment into law has for a long time been no guarantee of their security. Just as the employers always try to nullify every concession they had made to labor as soon as opportunity offered, as soon as any signs of weakness were observable in the workers' organizations, so governments also are always inclined to restrict or to abrogate completely rights and freedoms that have been achieved if they imagine that the people will put up no resistance. Even in those countries where such things as freedom of the press, right of assembly, right of combination, and the like have long existed, governments are constantly trying to restrict those rights or to reinterpret them by juridical hair-splitting. Political rights do not exist because they have been legally set down on a piece of paper, but only when they have become the ingrown habit of a people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet with the violent resistance of the populace. Where this is not the case, there is no help in any parliamentary Opposition or any Platonic appeals to the constitution.

Carl also had a substantial library consisting of socialist literature of all colors. Rocker was particularly impressed by the writings of {{ill|Constantin Frantz|de}}, a [[federalist]] and opponent of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s centralized [[German Empire]]; [[Eugen Dühring]], an anti-[[Marxist]] socialist, whose theories had some anarchist aspects; novels like [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'' and [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]''; as well as the traditional socialist literature such as [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' and [[Ferdinand Lasalle]] and [[August Bebel]]'s writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2002|pp=316–317}}; {{harvnb|Wienand|1981|pp=34–38}}; {{harvnb|Graur|1997|pp=20–21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rocker became a socialist and regularly discussed his ideas with others. His employer became the first person he converted to socialism.{{sfn|Graur|1997|p=21}}

Under the influence of his uncle, he joined the SPD and became active in the typographers' labor union in Mainz. He volunteered in the [[German federal election, 1890|1890 electoral campaign]], which had to be organized in semi-clandestinity because of continuing government repression, helping the SPD candidate {{ill|Franz Jöst|de}} retake the seat for the district Mainz-[[Oppenheim]] in the ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]''. Because the seat was heavily contested, important SPD figures like [[August Bebel]], [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], [[Georg von Vollmar]], and [[Paul Singer (politician)|Paul Singer]] visited the town to help Jöst and Rocker had a chance to see them speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2002|p=318}}; {{harvnb|Graur|1997|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anarchism sidebar |People}}

In 1890, there was a major debate in the SPD about the tactics it would choose after the lifting of the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]]. A radical oppositional wing known as ''Die Jungen'' (''The Young Ones'') developed. While the party leaders viewed the parliament as a means of social change, ''Die Jungen'' thought it could at best be used to spread the socialist message. Unwilling to wait for the collapse of capitalist society which [[Marxism]] predicted, they wanted to start a revolution as soon as possible. Although this wing was strongest in [[Berlin]], [[Magdeburg]], and [[Dresden]], it also had a few adherents in Mainz, among them Rudolf Rocker. In May 1890, he started a reading circle, named ''Freiheit'' (''Freedom''), to study theoretical topics more intensively. After Rocker criticized Jöst and refused to retract his statements, he was expelled from the party. The same would happen to the rest of ''Die Jungen'' in October 1891. Nonetheless, he remained active and even gained influence in the socialist labor movement in Mainz. Although he had already encountered anarchist ideas as a result of his contacts to ''Die Jungen'' in Berlin, his conversion to [[anarchism]] did not take place until the International Socialist Congress in [[Brussels]] in August 1891. He was heavily disappointed by the discussions at the congress, as it, especially the German delegates, refused to explicitly denounce [[militarism]]. He was rather impressed by the Dutch socialist and later anarchist [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]], who attacked Liebknecht for his lack of militancy. Rocker got to know Karl Höfer, a German active in smuggling anarchist literature from [[Belgium]] to Germany. Höfer gave him [[Bakunin]]'s ''[[God and the State]]'' and [[Kropotkin]]'s ''Anarchist Morality'', two of the most influential anarchist works, as well as the newspaper ''Autonomie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2002|pp=318–321}}; {{harvnb|Graur|1997|pp=22–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|left|[[Mikhail Bakunin]]]]

Rocker became convinced that the source of political institutions is an irrational belief in a higher authority, as Bakunin claimed in ''God and the State''. However, Rocker rejected the Russian's rejection of theoretical propaganda and his claim that only [[revolution]]s can bring about change. Nevertheless, he was very much attracted by Bakunin's style, marked by [[pathos]], emotion, and enthusiasm, designed to give the reader an impression of the heat of revolutionary moments. Rocker even attempted to emulate this style in his speeches, but was not very convincing. Kropotkin's [[anarcho-communist]] writings, on the other hand, were structured logically and contained an elaborate description of the future anarchist society. The work's basic premise, that an individual is entitled to receive the basic means of living from the community independently of his or her personal contributions, impressed Rocker.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graur|1997|pp=34–36}}; {{harvnb|Wienand|1981|pp=77–80, 95–96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, all ''Die Jungen'' were either expelled from the SPD or left voluntarily. They then founded the [[Union of Independent Socialists]] (VUS). Rocker became a member and founded a local section in Mainz, mostly active in distributing anarchist literature smuggled in from Belgium or the Netherlands in the city. He was a regular speaker at labor union meetings. On December 18, 1892, he spoke at a meeting of unemployed workers. Impressed by Rocker's speech, the speaker that followed Rocker, who was not from Mainz and therefore did not know at what point the police would intervene, advised the unemployed to take from the rich, rather to starve. The meeting was then dissolved by the police. The speaker was arrested, while Rocker barely escaped. He decided to flee Germany to Paris via [[Frankfurt]]. He had, however, already been toying with the idea of leaving the country, in order to learn new languages, get to know anarchist groups abroad, and, above all, to escape [[conscription in Germany|conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2002|pp=321–323}}; {{harvnb|Graur|1997|pp=39–41}}; {{harvnb|Wienand|1981|pp=110–112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paris ==
In Paris, he first came into contact with [[Jewish anarchism]]. In Spring 1893, he was invited to meeting of Jewish anarchists, which he attended and was impressed by. Though neither a Jew by birth nor by belief, he ended up frequenting the group's meeting, eventually holding lectures himself. Solomon Rappaport, later known as [[S. Ansky]], allowed Rocker to live with him, as they were both typographers and could share Rappaport's tools. During this period, Rocker also first came into contact with the blending of [[anarchist]] and [[syndicalist]] ideas represented by the [[Confédération générale du travail|General Confederation of Labor]] (CGT), which would influence him in the long term. In 1895, as a result of the anti-anarchist sentiment in France, Rocker traveled to London to visit the German consulate and examine the possibility of his returning to Germany but was told he would be imprisoned upon return.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishman|1974|pp=231–234}} and {{harvnb|Rübner|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== London ==

===Rocker's first years in London===
Rocker decided to stay in London. He got a job as the librarian of the [[Communist Workers' Educational Union]], where he got to know [[Louise Michel]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], two influential anarchists. Inspired to visit the quarter after reading about "Darkest London" in the works of [[John Henry Mackay]], he was appalled by the poverty he witnessed in the predominantly Jewish [[East End of London|East End]]. He joined the Jewish anarchist ''[[Arbeter Fraint]]'' group he had obtained information about from his French comrades, quickly becoming a regular lecturer at its meetings. There, he met his lifelong companion [[Milly Witkop]], a Ukrainian-born Jew who had fled to London in 1894. In May 1897, having lost his job and with little chance of re-employment, Rocker was persuaded by a friend to move to New York. Witkop agreed to accompany him and they arrived on the 29th. They were, however, not admitted into the country, because they were not legally married. They refused to formalize their relationship. Rocker explained that their "bond is one of free agreement between my wife and myself. It is a purely private matter that only concerns ourselves, and it needs no confirmation from the law." Witkop added: "Love is always free. When love ceases to be free it is prostitution." The matter received front-page coverage in the national press. The Commissioner-General of Immigration, the former [[Knights of Labor]] President [[Terence V. Powderly]], advised the couple to get married to settle the matter, but they refused and were deported back to England on the same ship they had arrived on.{{sfn|Fishman|1974|pp=235–238}}

Unable to find employment upon return, Rocker decided to move to [[Liverpool]]. A former Whitechapel comrade of his persuaded him to become the editor of a recently founded [[Yiddish]] weekly newspaper called ''[[Dos Fraye Vort]]'' (''The Free Word''), even though he did not speak the language at the time. The newspaper only appeared for eight issues, but it led the ''Arbeter Fraint'' group to re-launch its eponymous newspaper and invite Rocker to return to the capital and take over as its editor.{{sfn|Fishman|1974|p=239}}

[[File:Arbeter Fraynd.jpg|thumb|left|1899 advertisement in ''[[Arbayter Fraynd]]'' for a lecture by [[Emma Goldman]]]]

Although it received some funds from Jews in [[New York City|New York]], the journal's financial survival was precarious from the start. However, many volunteers helped by selling the paper on street corners and in workshops. During this time, Rocker was especially concerned with combating the influence of [[Marxism]] and [[historical materialism]] in London's Jewish labor movement. In all, the ''Arbeter Fraint'' published twenty-five essays by Rocker on the topic, the first ever critical examination of Marxism in Yiddish, according to [[William J. Fishman]]. ''Arbeter Fraint''{{'}}s unsound financial footing also meant Rocker rarely received the small salary promised to him when he took over the journal and he depended financially on Witkop. Despite Rocker's sacrifices, however, the paper was forced to cease publication for lack of funds. In November 1899, the prominent American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] visited London and Rocker met her for the first time. After hearing of the ''Arbeter Fraint''{{'}}s situation she held three lectures to raise funds, but that was not enough.{{sfn|Fishman|1974|pp=239–242}}

[[File:Kropotkin Nadar.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Kropotkin]]]]

Not wanting to be left without any means of propaganda, Rocker founded the ''[[Germinal (journal)|Germinal]]'' in March 1900. Compared to ''Arbeter Fraint'', it was more theoretical, applying anarchist thought to the analysis of literature and philosophy. It represented a maturation of Rocker's thinking towards [[Kropotkin]]-ite anarchism and would survive until March 1903. 1902 saw the London Jews being targeted by a wave of [[Xenophobia|anti-alien sentiment]], while Rocker was away for a year in [[Leeds]]. Upon return in September, he was happy to see the Jewish anarchists had kept the ''Arbeter Fraint'' organization alive. A conference of all Jewish anarchists of the city on December 26 decided for a re-launch of the ''Arbeter Fraint'' newspaper as the organ of all Jewish anarchists in Great Britain and Paris and made Rocker the editor. The first issue appeared on March 20, 1903. Following the [[Kishinev pogrom]] in the [[Russian Empire]], Rocker led a demonstration in solidarity with the victims, the largest ever gathering of Jews in London. Afterwards he traveled to Leeds, [[Glasgow]], and [[Edinburgh]] to lecture on the topic.{{sfn|Fishman|1974|pp=243, 247–248, 251–252}}
&lt;!--Avrich: Der Arbeter Fraint and Germinal were read in the ghettos of the Pale. (39-40) In 1907, exiled Russian anarchists established a headquarters for the Anarchist Red Cross in London. Directed by Rocker and others, it supported anarchists remaining in Russia and protested the Russian government's oppressive policies. (113-114)--&gt;

===Jewish anarchism's golden years===
[[File:Zsherminal.jpg|thumb|left|December 1906 edition of ''Germinal'']]
From 1904, the Jewish labor and anarchist movements in London reached their "golden years", according to William J. Fishman. In 1905, publication of ''Germinal'' resumed, it reached a circulation of 2,500 a year later, while ''Arbeter Fraint'' reached a demand of 5,000 copies. In 1906, the ''Arbeter Fraint'' group finally realized a long-time goal, the establishment of a club for both Jewish and gentile workers. The Workers' Friend Club was founded in a former Methodist church on [[Whitechapel|Jubilee Street]]. Rocker, by now a very eloquent speaker, became a regular speaker. As a result of the popularity of both the club and ''Germinal'' beyond the anarchist scene, Rocker befriended many prominent non-anarchist Jews in London, among them the Zionist philosopher [[Ber Borochov]].{{sfn|Fishman|1974|pp=257, 261–262, 265, 286}}

From June 8, 1906, Rocker was involved in a garment workers' strike. Wages and working conditions in the East End were much lower than in the rest of London and tailoring was the most important industry. Rocker was asked by the union leading the strike to become part of the strike committee along with two other ''Arbeter Fraint'' members. He was a regular speaker at the strikers' gatherings. The strike failed, because the strike funds ran out. By July 1, all workers were back in their workshops.{{sfn|Fishman|1974|pp=280–284}}

[[File:RudolfMilly.jpg|thumb|Rudolf Rocker (back row, second from left) with several London anarchists. Rocker's arm lies over [[Milly Witkop]]'s shoulder.]]

Rocker represented the federation at the [[International Anarchist Congress in Amsterdam]] in 1907. [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Alexander Shapiro]], and he became the secretaries of the new Anarchist International, but it only lasted until 1911. Also in 1907, his son [[Fermin Rocker|Fermin]] was born. In 1909, while visiting France, Rocker denounced the execution of the anarchist pedagogue [[Francisco Ferrer]] in Barcelona, leading him to be deported back to England.{{sfn|Rübner|2007}}

In 1912, Rocker was once again an important figure in a strike by London's garment makers. In late April, 1,500 tailors from the West End, who were more highly skilled and better-paid than those in the East End, started striking. By May, the total number was between 7,000 and 8,000. Since much of the West Enders' work was now being performed in the East End, the tailors' union there, under the influence of the ''Arbeter Fraint'' group, decided to support the strike. Rudolf Rocker on the one hand saw this as a chance for the East End tailors to attack the sweatshop system, but on the other was afraid of an anti-Semitic backlash, should the Jewish workers remain idle. He called for a [[general strike]]. His call was not followed, since over seventy percent of the East End tailors were engaged in the ready-made trade, which was not linked with the West End workers' strike. Nonetheless, 13,000 immigrant garment workers from the East End went on strike following a May 8 assembly at which Rocker spoke. Not one worker voted against a strike. Rocker became a member of the strike committee and chairman of the finance sub-committee. He was responsible for collecting money and other necessities for the striking workers. On the side he published the ''Arbeter Fraint'' newspaper on a daily basis to disseminate news about the strike. He spoke at the workers' assemblies and demonstrations. On May 24 a mass meeting was held to discuss the question of whether to settle on a compromise proposed by the employers, which did not entail a closed [[union shop]]. A speech by Rocker convinced the workers to continue the strike. By the next morning, all of the workers' demands were met.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishman|1974|pp=295–299}} and {{harvnb|Fishman|1966|pp=48–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
Rocker opposed both sides in [[World War I]] on [[proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] grounds. Although most in the United Kingdom and continental Europe expected a short war, Rocker predicted on August 7, 1914 "a period of mass murder such as the world has never known before" and attacked the [[Second International]] for not opposing the conflict. Rocker with some other ''Arbeter Fraint'' members opened up a soup kitchen without fixed prices to alleviate the further impoverishment that came with the Great War. There was a debate between Kropotkin, who supported the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]], and Rocker in ''Arbeter Fraint'' in October and November. He called the war "the contradiction of everything we had fought for".{{sfn|Fishman|1974|pp=306–307}}

Shortly after the publication of this statement, on December 2, Rocker was arrested and interned as an enemy alien. This was also the result of the [[anti-German sentiment]] in the country.{{sfn|Fishman|1974|p=307}} ''Arbeiter Fraynd'' was suppressed in 1915. The Jewish anarchist movement in Britain never fully recovered from these blows.{{sfn|Fishman|2004}}

== Back in Germany ==

===FVdG===
[[File:Domela nieuwenhuis.jpg|thumb|[[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]]]]
In March 1918, Rocker was taken to the [[Netherlands]] under an agreement to exchange prisoners through the [[Red Cross]]. He stayed at the house of the socialist leader [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]] and he recovered from the health problems from which he suffered as a result of his internment in the UK and met up with his wife [[Milly Witkop]] and his son [[Fermin Rocker|Fermin]]. He returned to Germany in November 1918 upon an invitation from [[Fritz Kater]] to join him in [[Berlin]] to re-build the [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] (FVdG). The FVdG was a radical labor federation that quit the SPD in 1908 and became increasingly syndicalist and anarchist. During World War I, it had been unable to continue its activities for fear of government repression, but remained in existence as an underground organization.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|pp=77–78}}

Rocker was opposed to the FVdG's alliance with the communists during and immediately after the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|November Revolution]], as he rejected Marxism, especially the concept of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. Soon after arriving in Germany, however, he once again became seriously ill. He started giving public speeches in March 1919, including one at a congress of munitions workers in [[Erfurt]], where he urged them to stop producing war material. During this period the FVdG grew rapidly and the coalition with the communists soon began to crumble. Eventually all syndicalist members of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] were expelled. From December 27 to December 30, 1919, the twelfth national congress of the FVdG was held in Berlin.

The organization decided to become the [[Free Workers' Union of Germany]] (FAUD) under a new platform, which had been written by Rocker: the ''Prinzipienerklärung des Syndikalismus'' (''Declaration of Syndicalist Principles''). It rejected political parties and the dictatorship of the proletariat as bourgeois concepts. The program recognized only decentralized, purely economic, organizations. Although public ownership of land, means of production, and raw materials was advocated, nationalization and the idea of a communist state were rejected. Rocker decried [[nationalism]] as the religion of the modern state and opposed violence, championing instead [[direct action]] and the education of the workers.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|pp=80–81}}

===Heyday of syndicalism===
{{Syndicalism sidebar |Leaders}}
On [[Gustav Landauer]]'s death during the [[Munich Soviet Republic]] uprising, Rocker took over the work of editing the German publications of Kropotkin's writings. In 1920, the social democratic [[List of German defence ministers|Defense Minister]] [[Gustav Noske]] started the suppression of the revolutionary left, which led to the imprisonment of Rocker and Fritz Kater. During their mutual detainment, Rocker convinced Kater, who had still held some social democratic ideals, completely of anarchism.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|p=80}}

In the following years, Rocker became one of the most regular writers in the FAUD organ ''[[Der Syndikalist]]''. In 1920, the FAUD hosted an international syndicalist conference, which ultimately led to the founding of the [[International Workers Association]] (IWA) in December 1922. [[Augustin Souchy]], [[Alexander Schapiro]], and Rocker became the organization's secretaries and Rocker wrote its platform. In 1921, he wrote the pamphlet ''Der Bankrott des russischen Staatskommunismus'' (''The Bankruptcy of Russian State Communism'') attacking the Soviet Union. He denounced what he considered a massive oppression of individual freedoms and the suppression of anarchists starting with the purge on April 12, 1918. He supported instead the workers who took part in the [[Kronstadt uprising]] and the peasant movement led by the anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]], whom he would meet in Berlin in 1923. In 1924, Rocker published a biography of [[Johann Most]] called ''Das Leben eines Rebellen'' (''The Life of a Rebel''). There are great similarities between the men's vitas. It was Rocker who convinced the anarchist historian [[Max Nettlau]] to start publication of his anthology ''Geschichte der Anarchie'' (''History of Anarchy'') in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vallance|1973|pp=81–85}} and {{harvnb|Rübner|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of syndicalism===
During the mid-1920s, the decline of Germany's syndicalist movement started. The FAUD had reached its peak of around 150,000 members in 1921, but then started losing members to both the Communist and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]]. Rocker attributed this loss of membership to the mentality of German workers accustomed to military discipline, accusing the communists of using similar tactics to the Nazis and thus attracting such workers. At first only planning a short book on nationalism, he started work on ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'', which would be published in 1937 and become one of Rocker's best-known works, around 1925. 1925 also saw Rocker visit North America on a lecture tour with a total of 162 appearances. He was encouraged by the anarcho-syndicalist movement he found in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|pp=86–88}}

Returning to Germany in May 1926, he became increasingly worried about the rise of nationalism and fascism. He wrote to Nettlau in 1927: "Every nationalism begins with a [[Mazzini]], but in its shadow there lurks a [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]". In 1929, Rocker was a co-founder of the ''Gilde freiheitlicher Bücherfreunde'' (Guild of Libertarian Bibliophiles), a publishing house which would release works by [[Alexander Berkman]], [[William Godwin]], [[Erich Mühsam]], and [[John Henry Mackay]]. In the same year he went on a lecture tour in Scandinavia and was impressed by the anarcho-syndicalists there. Upon return, he wondered whether Germans were even capable of anarchist thought. In the [[German election, 1930|1930 elections]], the [[Nazi Party]] received 18.3% of all votes, a total of 6 million. Rocker was worried: "Once the Nazis get to power, we'll all go the way of [[Gustav Landauer|Landauer]] and [[Kurt Eisner|Eisner]]" (who were killed by reactionaries in the course of the Munich Soviet Republic uprising).{{sfn|Vallance|1973|pp=82–83, 88–89}}

[[File:Portrait Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|[[Emma Goldman]]]]

In 1931, Rocker attended the IWA congress in Madrid and then the unveiling of the Nieuwenhuis memorial in Amsterdam. In 1933, the Nazis came to power. After the [[Reichstag fire]] on February 27, Rocker and Witkop decided to leave Germany. As they left they received news of [[Erich Mühsam]]'s arrest. After his death in July 1934, Rocker would write a pamphlet called ''Der Leidensweg Erich Mühsams'' (''The Life and Suffering of Erich Mühsam'') about the anarchist's fate. Rocker reached Basel, Switzerland on March 8 by the last train to cross the border without being searched. Two weeks later, Rocker and his wife joined Emma Goldman in [[St. Tropez]], France. There he wrote ''Der Weg ins Dritte Reich'' (''The Path to the Third Reich'') about the events in Germany, but it would only be published in Spanish.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|pp=90–91}}

In May, Rocker and Witkop moved back to London. There Rocker was welcomed by many of the Jewish anarchists he had lived and fought alongside for many years. He held lectures all over the city. In July, he attended an extraordinary IWA meeting in Paris, which decided to smuggle its organ ''[[Die Internationale]]'' into Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|p=91}}

== United States ==
{{American socialism |expanded=Theorists}}

===First years===
On August 26, 1933, Rocker with his wife emigrated to New York. There they were reunited with Fermin who had stayed there after accompanying his father on his 1929 lecture tour in the US. The Rocker family moved to live with a sister of Witkop's in [[Towanda, Pennsylvania|Towanda]], [[Pennsylvania]] where many families with progressive or libertarian socialist views lived. In October, Rocker toured the US and Canada speaking about racism, fascism, dictatorship, socialism in English, Yiddish, and German. He found many of his Jewish comrades from London, who had since emigrated to America, and became a regular writer for ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'', a Jewish anarchist newspaper. Back in Towanda, in the summer of 1934, Rocker started work on an autobiography, but news of Erich Mühsam's death led him to halt his work. He was working on ''Nationalism and Culture'', when the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in July 1936 instilling great optimism in Rocker. He published a pamphlet ''The Truth about Spain'' and contributed to ''The Spanish Revolution'', a special fortnightly newspaper published by American anarchists to report on the events in Spain. In 1937, he wrote ''The Tragedy of Spain'', which analyzed the events in greater detail. In September 1937, Rocker and Witkop moved to the libertarian commune [[Lake Mohegan, New York|Mohegan]] Colony about {{convert|50|mi|km}} from New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vallance|1973|pp=91–93}} and {{harvnb|Reichert|1976|pp=476, 483}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nationalism and Culture'' and ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''===
{{main|Nationalism and Culture|Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)}}
In 1937, ''Nationalism and Culture'', which he had started work on around 1925, was finally published with the help of anarchists from Chicago Rocker had met in 1933. A Spanish edition was released in three volumes in [[Barcelona]], the stronghold of the Spanish anarchists. It would be his best-known work.{{sfn|Rothfels|Rocker|1951|p=839}} In the book, Rocker traces the origins of the state back to religion claiming "that all politics is in the last instance religion": both enslave their very creator, man; both claim to be the source of cultural progress. He aims to prove the claim that culture and power are essentially antagonistic concepts. He applies this model to human history, analyzing the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and modern capitalist society, and to the history of the socialist movement. He concludes by advocating a "new humanitarian socialism".

In 1938, Rocker published a history of anarchist thought, which he traced all the way back to ancient times, under the name ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. A modified version of the essay would be published in the Philosophical Library series ''European Ideologies'' under the name ''Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism'' in 1949.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|p=93}}

===World War II, ''Pioneers of American Freedom'', final years===
{{main|Pioneers of American Freedom}}
In 1939, Rocker had to undergo a serious operation and was forced to give up lecture tours. However, in the same year, the Rocker Publications Committee was formed by anarchists in Los Angeles to translate and publish Rockers writings. Many of his friends died around this time: Alexander Berkman in 1936, Emma Goldman in 1940, Max Nettlau in 1944; many more were imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|pp=93–94}} Although Rocker had opposed his teacher Kropotkin for his support of the Allies during World War I, Rocker argued that the [[Allies in World War II|Allied effort]] in World War II was just, as it would ultimately lead to preservation of libertarian values. Although he viewed every state as a coercive apparatus designed to secure the economic exploitation of the masses, he defended democratic freedoms, which he considered a result of a desire for freedom of the enlightened public. This position was criticized by many American anarchists, who did not support any war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rübner|2007}} and {{harvnb|Reichert|1976|pp=483–484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, an appeal in the ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'' detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. In 1947, Rocker published ''Zur Betrachtung der Lage in Deutschland'' (''Regarding the Portrayal of the Situation in Germany'') about the impossibility of another anarchist movement in Germany. It became the first post-World War II anarchist writing to be distributed in Germany. Rocker thought young Germans were all either totally cynical or inclined to fascism and awaited a new generation to grow up before anarchism could bloom once again in the country. Nevertheless, the Federation of Libertarian Socialists (FFS) was founded in 1947 by former FAUD members. Rocker wrote for its organ, ''[[Die Freie Gesellschaft]]'', which survived until 1953.{{sfn|Vallance|1973|pp=94–95}} In 1949, Rocker published another well-known work. In ''[[Pioneers of American Freedom]]'', a series of essays, he details the history of liberal and anarchist thought in the United States, seeking to debunk the idea that radical thought was foreign to American history and culture and had merely been imported by immigrants.{{sfn|Dorfman|1950|p=363}} On his eightieth birthday in 1953, a dinner was held in London to honor Rocker. Messages of gratitude were read by the likes of [[Thomas Mann]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Bertrand Russell]].{{sfb|Reichert|1976|p=484}}

On September 10, 1958, Rocker died in the Mohegan Colony.

{{essay|date=March 2012}}

A person’s '''second language''' or '''L2''' is a language that is not the [[native language]]/[[first language]]/L1 of the speaker, but is learned by the speaker after his/her native language (usually a [[foreign language]], see below). Additionally, a person’s second language can be explained as the second language in the country the speaker lives in and they may be both used in daily life. For example, [[Languages of Canada|Canada]] has two official languages (English and French) and some citizens speak and use both of them.&lt;br&gt;
A person’s dominant language, which is the language the speaker uses most or is most comfortable with, is not necessarily to be his/her first language. The second language can also be the dominant one. For example, the Canadian census defines first language for its purposes as "the first language learned in childhood and still spoken", recognizing that for some, the earliest language may be lost, a process known as [[language attrition]]. This can happen when young children move, with or without their family (because of [[immigration]] or [[international adoption]]), to a new language environment.&lt;br&gt;

==Second-language acquisition==
{{main|Second-language acquisition}}
{{Further|Theories of second-language acquisition}}
[[File:Spanish orthography.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|[[Blackboard]] used in [[Class (education)|class]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] shows [[student]]s' efforts at placing the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] and [[acute accent]] [[diacritic]]s used in the [[Spanish orthography]].]]
The distinction between '''acquiring''' and '''learning''' was made by [[Stephen Krashen]] (1982) as part of his [[Monitor Theory]]. According to Krashen, the ''acquisition'' of a language is a '''natural''' process; whereas ''learning'' a language is a '''conscious''' one. In the former, the student needs to partake in natural communicative situations. In the latter, error correction is present, as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language. Not all educators in second language agree to this distinction; however, the study of how a second language is ''learned/acquired'' is referred to as ''second-language acquisition'' (SLA).

Research in SLA "...focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language... [and] a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults." (Spada &amp; Lightbown, p.&amp;nbsp;115).

SLA has been influenced by both linguistic and [[psychology|psychological]] theories. One of the dominant linguistic theories hypothesizes that a ''device'' or ''module'' of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge. Many psychological theories, on the other hand, hypothesize that [[Cognition#Cognition as social process|cognitive mechanisms]], responsible for much of human learning, process language.

Other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies (which examine if L1 findings can be transferred to L2 learning), verbal behaviour (the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response), morpheme studies, behaviourism, error analysis, stages and order of acquisition, structuralism (approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics), 1st language acquisition studies, contrastive analysis (approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities) and inter-language (which describes L2 learners’ language as a rule-governed, dynamic system) (Mitchell, Myles, 2004).  
  
These theories have all influenced second-language teaching and pedagogy. There are many different methods of second-language teaching, many of which stem directly from a particular theory. Common methods are the [[grammar-translation method]], the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the [[audio-lingual method]] (clearly influenced by audio-lingual research and the behaviourist approach), the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], [[community language learning]], the [[Total Physical Response method]], and the [[communicative approach]] (highly influenced by Krashen’s theories) (Doggett, 1994). Some of these approaches are more popular than others, and are viewed to be more effective. Most language teachers do not use one singular style, but will use a mix in their teaching. This provides a more balanced approach to teaching and helps students of a variety of learning styles succeed.

===Effect of age===
The defining difference between a first language (L1) and a second language (L2) is the age the person learned the language. For example, [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Eric Lenneberg]] used ''second language'' to mean [[language acquisition|a language consciously acquired]] or used by its speaker after puberty. In most cases, people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language. These views are closely associated with the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beerten|first=Roeland |author2=Billiet, Jaak |author3=Bart Maddens|title=National Identity and Attitude Toward Foreigners in a Multinational State: A Replication|journal=International Society of Political Psychology|year=2003|volume=24|series=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Brian|title=Defining Culture in a Multicultural Environment: An Ethnography of Heritage High School|journal=American Journal of Education|date=Aug 1995|volume=103|series=4|pages=339–376|doi=10.1086/444107|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scarcella|first=Robin |author2=Krashen, Stephen D. |author3=Michael A. Long |title=Age, Rate and Eventual Attainment in Second Language Acquisition|journal=TESOL Quarterly|date=Dec 1979|volume=13|issue=4|pages=573–582|doi=10.2307/3586451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In acquiring an L2, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of six or seven seemed to be a cut-off point for [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]] to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, L2 learners could get ''near-native-like-ness'' but their language would, while consisting of few actual errors, have enough errors to set them apart from the L1 group. The inability of some subjects to achieve native-like proficiency must be seen in relation to the ''age of onset'' (AO). Later, Hyltenstam &amp; Abrahamsson (2003) modified their age cut-offs to argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire native-like-ness, but that there is no cut-off point in particular.&lt;br&gt;

As we are learning more and more about the brain, there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty, that is the time that accents ''start''. Before a child goes through puberty, the chemical processes in the brain are more geared towards language and social communication. Whereas after puberty, the ability for learning a language without an accent has been rerouted to function in another area of the brain—most likely in the frontal lobe area promoting cognitive functions, or in the neural system of hormone allocated for reproduction and sexual organ growth.

As far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in SLA is concerned, Krashen, Long, and Scarcella, say that people who encounter foreign language in early age, begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult. However, when it comes to the relationship between age and rate [[Second-language acquisition|SLA]], “Adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children (where time and exposure are held constant)” ([[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]], Long, Scarcella 573). Also, “older children acquire faster than younger children do (again, in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant)” (573). In other words, adults and older children are fast learners when it comes to the initial stage of foreign language education.

Gauthier and Genesee (2011) have done a research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language, and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gauthier |first1=Karine |last2=Genesee |first2=Fred |title=Language Development in Internationally Adopted Children: A Special Case of Early Second Language Learning |journal=Child Development |date=March 2011 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=887-901 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As for the fluency, it is better to do foreign language education at an early age, but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “weak identification” (Billiet, Maddens and Beerten 241). Such issue leads to a "double sense of national belonging," that makes one not sure of where he or she belongs to because according to Brian A. Jacob, multicultural education affects students' "relations, attitudes, and behaviors" (Jacob 364). And as children learn more and more foreign languages, children start to adapt, and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they “undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made” (Pratt 35). Due to such factors, learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one’s perspective of his or her native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Similarities and differences between learned and native proficiency===
====Speed====
Acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many. Despite persistent efforts, most learners of a second language will never become fully ''native-like'' in it, although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lang1234.info/2/category/accent/1.html|title=Good Accents|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of [[vocabulary]] and a few [[Grammar|grammatical]] structures, and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill. Moreover, if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger, they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Newport |first2=Elissa |title=Critical period effects in second language learning: The influence of maturational state on the acquisition of English as a second language |journal=Cognitive Psychology |date=January 1989 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=60-99 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028589900030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

====Correction====
In the first language, children do not respond to systematic correction. Furthermore, children who have limited input still acquire the first language, which is a significant difference between input and output. Children are exposed to a language environment of errors and lack of correction but they end up having the capacity to figure out the grammatical rules. Error correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language. Instruction may affect the rate of learning, but the stages remain the same. Adolescents and adults who know the rule are faster than those who do not. &lt;br&gt;

In the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought. Throughout the last century much advancement has been made in research on the correction of students’ errors. In the 1950s and 60s the viewpoint of the day was that all errors must be corrected at all costs. Little thought went to students’ feelings or self-esteem in regards to this constant correction (Russell, 2009).

In the 1970s Dulay and Burt’s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a pre-determined, inalterable order, and that teaching or correcting styles would not change this (Russell, 2009).

In this same decade Terrell (1977) did studies that showed that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students (Russell, 2009). He contested that the affective side of students and their self-esteem were equally important to the teaching process (Russell, 2009).

A few years later in the 1980s, the strict grammar and corrective approach of the 1950s became obsolete. Researchers asserted that correction was often unnecessary and that instead of furthering students’ learning it was hindering them (Russell, 2009). The main concern at this time was relieving student stress and creating a warm environment for them. Stephen Krashen was a big proponent in this hands-off approach to error correction (Russell, 2009).

The 1990s brought back the familiar idea that explicit grammar instruction and error correction was indeed useful for the SLA process. At this time, more research started to be undertaken to determine exactly which kinds of corrections are the most useful for students. In 1998, Lyster concluded that “recasts” (when the teacher repeats a student’s incorrect utterance with the correct version) are not always the most useful because students do not notice the correction (Russell, 2009). His studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors (Russell, 2009). Mackey, Gas and McDonough had similar findings in 2000 and attributed the success of this method to the student’s active participation in the corrective processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Victoria|title=Corrective feedback, over a decade of research since Lyster and Ranta (1997): Where do we stand today?|journal=Electronic Journal of Foreign Language Teaching|date=2009|volume=6|issue=1|pages=21–31|url=https://varussellblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/russell_eflt_2009.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depth of knowledge====
According to [[Noam Chomsky]], children will bridge the gap between input and output by their innate grammar because the input (utterances they hear) is so poor but all children end up having complete knowledge of grammar. Chomsky calls it the [[Poverty of the stimulus|Poverty of Stimulus]]. And second language learners can do this by applying the rules they learn to the sentence-construction, for example. So learners in both their native and second language have knowledge that goes beyond what they have received, so that people can make correct utterances (phrases, sentences, questions, etc) that they have never learned or heard before.&lt;br&gt;

====Emotionality====
[[Bilingualism]] has been an advantage to today's world and being bilingual gives the opportunity to understand and communicate with people with different cultural backgrounds. However, a study done by Optiz and Degner in 2012 shows that sequential bilinguals (i.e. learn their L2 after L1) often relate themselves to the emotions more when they perceive these emotions by their first language/native language/L1, but feel less emotional when by their second language even though they know the meaning of words clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=Bertram |last2=Degner |first2=Juliane |title=Emotionality in a second language: It's a matter of time |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=July 2012 |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=1961-1967 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393212001844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional distinction between L1 and L2 indicates that the "effective valence" of words is processed less immediate in L2 because of the delayed vocabulary/lexical access to these two languages.&lt;br&gt;

====Success====
Success in language learning can be measured in two ways: likelihood and quality. First language learners ''will'' be successful in both measurements. It is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions, they will be fully successful. For second language learners, success is not guaranteed. For one, learners may become fossilized or ''stuck'' as it were with ungrammatical items. ([[Fossilization (linguistics)|Fossilization]] occurs when language errors become a permanent feature. See Canale &amp; Swain (1980), Johnson (1992), Selinker (1972), and Selinker and Lamendella (1978).) The difference between learners may be significant. As noted elsewhere, L2 learners rarely achieve complete ''native-like'' control of the second language. &lt;br&gt;
For L2 pronounciation, there are two principles that haven been put forth by Levis (2005). The first is nativeness which means the speakers' ability to approximately reach the speaking pattern of the second language of speakers; and the second, understanding, refers to the speaker's ability to make themselves understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levis |first1=John |title=Changing Contexts and Shifting Paradigms in Pronunciation Teaching |journal=TESOL Quarterly |date=Autumn 2005 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=369-377 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/3588485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being successful in learning a second language can seem like a daunting task. Research has been done to look into why some students are more successful than others. Stern (1975), Rubin (1975) and Reiss (1985) are just a few of the researchers who have dedicated time to this subject. They have worked to determine what qualities make a "good language learner" (Mollica, Neussel, 1997). Some of their common findings are that a good language learner uses positive learning strategies, is an active learner who is constantly searching for meaning. Also a good language learner demonstrates a willingness to practice and use the language in real communication. He also monitors himself and his learning, has a strong drive to communicate, and has a good ear and good listening skills (Mollica, Neussel, 1997).&lt;br&gt;

Özgür and Griffiths have designed an experiment in 2013 about the relationship between different motivations and second language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Özgür |first1=Burcu |last2=Griffiths |first2=Carol |title=Second Language Motivation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |date=25 January 2013 |volume=70 |pages=1109-1114 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813001663}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have looked at four types of motivations—intrinsic (inner feelings of learner), extrinsic (reward from outside), integrative (attitude towards learning), and instrumental (practical needs). According to the test results, the intrinsic part has been the main  motivation for these student who learn English as their second language. However, students report themselves being strongly instrumentally motivated. In conclusion, learning a second language and being successful depend on every individual.&lt;br&gt;

==Foreign language==
[[File:Ldl-wortschatz.jpg|thumb|A German student learning French. [[English language|English]] (1.5 billion learners), [[French language|French]] (82 million learners) and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (30 million learners) are the three most commonly studied foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Noack and Lazaro Gamio, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/04/23/the-worlds-languages-in-7-maps-and-charts "The world’s languages, in 7 maps and charts"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 23 April 2015 (page visited on 9 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]

In [[pedagogy]] and [[sociolinguistics]], a distinction is made between second language and foreign language, the latter is being learned for use in an area where that language is originally from another country and not spoken in the native country of the speakers. And in other words, foreign language is used from the perspective of countries; the second language is used from the perspective of individuals.

For example, arguably, [[English language|English]] in countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[the Philippines]], the [[Nordic countries]] and the [[Netherlands]] can be considered a second language for many of its speakers, because they learn it young and use it regularly; indeed in [[southern Asia]] it is the [[official language]] of the courts, government and business. The same can be said for [[French language|French]] in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]], although French is nominally not an official language in any of these [[Arabic-speaking countries]]. In practice, French is widely used in a variety of contexts in these countries, and public signs are normally printed in both Arabic and French. A similar phenomenon exists in [[post-Soviet states]] such as the [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]], where [[Russian language|Russian]] can be considered a second language, and there are large [[Russophone]] communities there.

However, in [[China]] (with the exception perhaps of Hong Kong), English must be considered a foreign language due to the lack of opportunities for use, such as historical links, media, conversation between people, and similar vocabulary. Likewise, French would be considered a foreign language in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. This is despite Romanian and French being [[Romance languages]] (unlike Chinese and English, which come from two different [[language families]]: [[Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]). This is also despite Romania and Moldova being the only two countries in the world where Romanian is an official language at the national level, Romania's historical links to France, and both Romanian-speaking countries' membership in the [[Francophonie]].
== Benefits of Bilingualism ==
Psychological studies have found that speaking two or more languages is good for people's cognitive process and the differences between brains of bilinguals and single language speakers usually provides some mental benefits, according to an article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Merritt |first1=Anne |title=Why learn a foreign language? Benefits of bilingualism |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10126883/Why-learn-a-foreign-language-Benefits-of-bilingualism.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=19 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including but not limited to these: &lt;br&gt;
'''Becoming smarter'''&lt;br&gt;
Speaking a second language improves the functions of the brain by thinking and using the different language systems.&lt;br&gt;
'''Building multitasking skills'''&lt;br&gt;
According to a study from the Pennsylvania State University, "juggling language can make better brains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Juggling languages can build better brains |url=https://news.psu.edu/story/160653/2011/02/18/juggling-languages-can-build-better-brains |website=PennState |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because multilingual people are usually good at switching between different language systems, they can be good multitaskers as well. &lt;br&gt;
'''Improving memory'''&lt;br&gt;
The vocabulary capacity for a high school graduate student is about 45000 words, according to Nagy and Anderson (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nagy |first1=William |last2=Anderson |first2=Richard |title=How Many Words are There in Printed School English? |journal=Reading Research Quarterly |date=Spring 1984 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=304-330 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/747823.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and being a bilingual will double this number because learning a language involves memorizing rules and vocabulary.&lt;br&gt;

== Data for Further Information ==
==== Weber's Report ====
George H. J. Weber, a Swiss businessman and independent scholar, founder of the Andaman Association and creator of the encyclopedic andaman.org Web site, made a report in December 1997 about the number of secondary speakers of the world's leading languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ignatius.edu/turner/languages.htm The World's Most Widely Spoken Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 most influential Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt; Weber used the [[Fischer Weltalmanach]] of 1986 as his only source&lt;ref&gt;Fig 6. [number of secondary speakers] is based on a table given in the Fischer Weltalamanach {{sic}} 1986, p. 910. [http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm Full article]&lt;/ref&gt; for the L2-speakers data, in preparing the data in the following table. These numbers are here compared with those referred to by Ethnologue, a popular source in the linguistics field. See below Table 1.

'''Thin-shell structures''' are also called plate and shell structures. They are lightweight constructions using [[List of structural elements|shell elements]]. These elements, typically curved, are assembled to make large structures. Typical applications include aircraft [[fuselage]]s, boat hulls, and the [[roof]]s of large buildings.

==Definition==
A thin shell is defined as a shell with a thickness which is small compared to its other dimensions and in which deformations are not large compared to thickness. A primary difference between a shell structure and a plate structure is that, in the unstressed state, the shell structure has curvature as opposed to the plates structure which is flat. [[Tensile structure|Membrane]] action in a shell is primarily caused by in-plane forces ([[plane stress]]), but there may be secondary forces resulting from flexural deformations. Where a flat plate acts similar to a beam with bending and shear stresses, shells are analogous to a cable which resists loads through tensile stresses. The ideal thin shell must be capable of developing both tension and compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Structural Engineering, Second Edition|date=2005-02-28|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849315695|editor-last=Chen|editor-first=Wai-Fah|edition=2|location=Boca Raton|language=English|editor-last2=Lui|editor-first2=E. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The most popular types of thin-shell structures are:
* [[Concrete shell]] structures, often cast as a [[monolithic dome]] or [[stressed ribbon bridge]] or [[saddle roof]]
* Lattice shell structures, also called [[gridshell]] structures, often in the form of a [[geodesic dome]] or a [[hyperboloid structure]]
* [[Membrane structure]]s, which include [[fabric structure]]s and other [[tensile structure]]s, [[cable dome]]s, and [[pneumatic structure]]s.
