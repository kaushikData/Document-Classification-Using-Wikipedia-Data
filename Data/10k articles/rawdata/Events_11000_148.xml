The '''1947 BAA Finals''' was the championship round of playoffs following the inaugural [[Basketball Association of America]] [[1946–47 BAA season|1946–47 season]]. The [[Philadelphia Warriors]] of the Eastern Division faced the [[Chicago Stags]] of the Western Division for the inaugural championship, with Philadelphia having home court advantage. [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Joe Fulks]] played for the Warriors in the series. Following the 1948–49 season (the BAA's third season of play), the BAA and the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] merged to create the [[National Basketball Association]].

==Background==
Philadelphia was not the Eastern Division champion but advanced to the championship round by winning a four-team playoff among the Eastern and Western Division runners-up. Meanwhile, the Eastern and Western Division champions, Washington Capitols and Chicago Stags, played one long series to determine the other finalist, a best-of-seven series that Chicago won 4–2. In the runners-up bracket, Philadelphia and New York from the East had first eliminated St. Louis and Chicago from the West, then faced each other, all in best-of-three series. The format was repeated in 1948, and generated another champion from the runners-up bracket.&lt;ref name=BBR47/&gt;

The five games of the final series were played in seven days, with no days off between consecutive games in the same city (twice). Division champions Washington and Chicago had played the six games of their semifinal series from April 2 to 13, although they too took no days off between consecutive games in the same city (twice). In total, the entire playoff tournament lasted a total of 20 days.&lt;ref name=BBR47/&gt;

''Warriors win series 4–1''

===Game 1===
Around 7,900 people attended Game 1.  The Warriors led at halftime 34–20.  Fulks then scored 29 points in the second half, including 21 in the fourth quarter.  Angelo Musi, a guard out of Temple University, scored 19 points himself for Philadelphia as well.  The Stags took an astounding 129 shots, but only knocked down 26 of them, a 20.2 shooting percentage which made it easy for the Warriors to win, 84–71.

===Game 2===
Fulks was not the scorer he was in Game 1, but he did not have to be, because five other Warrior players scored in double figures, including 18 points from forward Howie Dallmar and 16 from guard/forward Fleishman.  Chicago did take a brief 69-68 lead until Philadelphia center Art Hillhouse came alive in the fourth quarter.  He scored 7 out of the last 10 points for the Warriors, en route to a second Philadelphia win, 85–74.

===Game 5===
With less than a minute remaining, Dallmar snapped an 80–80 tie by nailing a jump shot to seal the very first championship for the Warriors.

The '''2011 attack on the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Tehran|British Embassy]] in Iran''' was a mob action on 29 November 2011 by a crowd of Iranian protesters who stormed the embassy and another British diplomatic compound in [[Tehran]], Iran, ransacking offices and stealing documents. One small building was set on fire during the incident and several people were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/world/92466/us-president-condemns-embassy-attack |title=US President condemns embassy attack |date=30 November 2011 |publisher=radionz.co.nz |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Iranian government publicly condemned the violence.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, ''Iranian opposition student groups condemn storming of British embassy'', 1 December 2011 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/01/iranian-opposition-british-embassy-attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Iran–United Kingdom relations}}
The [[British government]] had imposed numerous sanctions on [[Iran]] regarding concerns over the [[Nuclear program of Iran|nature of Iran's nuclear program]]. Following the release of a November 2011 [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] report that documented weaponisation elements of Iran's nuclear activities, the British government banned all financial institutions in the United Kingdom doing business with their counterparts in Iran, including [[Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran's central bank]].&lt;ref name=aljazeera1&gt;{{cite news|title=Iranian protesters storm UK embassy|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111129132554123213.html|accessdate=1 December 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran responded by approving a bill to downgrade its ties with the United Kingdom, including a requirement for both countries to withdraw their respective ambassadors.&lt;ref name=aljazeera2&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran council approves downgrading of UK ties|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111128134939254881.html|accessdate=1 December 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first time that Iran has called for downgrading ties with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/174176.html |title=Iran to mull decreasing ties with UK |publisher=Press TV |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/175612.html |title=Iran warns UK against further meddling |publisher=Press TV |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incursion==
About 1,000 people gathered near the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Tehran|embassy]] to demand that the British ambassador be sent home immediately. The rally began quietly, but some participants stormed the building, breaking down the door, throwing around papers and replacing the British flag with an Iranian one.&lt;ref name=condemn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news8000.com/news/UK-condemns-Iranian-embassy-incursion/-/326/4838464/-/w89yq/-/index.html |title=UK condemns embassy incursion in Iran |date=29 November 2011 |publisher=news8000.com |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118081321/http://www.news8000.com/news/UK-condemns-Iranian-embassy-incursion/-/326/4838464/-/w89yq/-/index.html |archive-date=18 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weartv.com/template/inews_wire/wires.international/36b73d5f-weartv.com.shtml |title=Iranian students storm British Embassy in Tehran |date=30 November 2011 |publisher=weartv.com |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127104006/http://www.weartv.com/template/inews_wire/wires.international/36b73d5f-weartv.com.shtml |archive-date=27 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian security forces initially did not intervene as protesters entered the British Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/world/middleeast/tehran-protesters-storm-british-embassy.html |title=Protesters Storm British Embassy in Tehran |date=29 November 2011 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2011 |first1=Robert F. |last1=Worth |first2=Rick |last2=Gladstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15564655,00.html|title=Britain orders Iranian embassy closed, expels staff|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20111129-iran-protesters-storm-british-embassy|title=Iran protesters storm British embassy|quote=The intrusion occurred as ranks of Iranian police in riot gear stood by, doing nothing.|date=29 November 2011|access-date=2 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005457/http://www.france24.com/en/20111129-iran-protesters-storm-british-embassy|archive-date=2 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters removed the mission's flag and ransacked offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-29/iran-financial-sanctions-set-to-shrink-circle-of-foreign-buyers-of-crude.html | title=Iran Financial Sanctions Set to Shrink Circle of Foreign Buyers of Crude | publisher=Bloomberg | date=29 November 2011 | accessdate=30 November 2011 | author=DiPaola, Anthony | author2=Narayanan, Pratish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters chanted, "Death to America", "Death to England" and "Death to Israel", among other slogans.&lt;ref name=aljazeera1/&gt;

According to the [[British Ambassador to Iran]] [[Dominick Chilcott]], protesters rampaged through the embassy building, destroying paintings and furniture, spraying graffiti, smashing windows and starting fires. Seven embassy staff were seized by protesters but were eventually escorted out by police. The protesters also stole mobile phones and computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/12/02/uk-iran-britain-ambassador-idUKTRE7B128920111202|author=Adrian Croft|title=UK envoy tells of fear as mob rampage in Iran embassy|date=2 December 2011|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] described the incursion as "outrageous and indefensible" and demanded that Iran immediately ensure the safety of all British Embassy personnel. [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] said the "irresponsible action" had put the safety of diplomats and their families at risk and caused extensive damage to embassy property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksat.com/news/nationalnews/UK-condemns-Iranian-embassy-incursion/-/478364/4838464/-/lurlkdz/-/index.html |title=UK condemns embassy incursion in Iran |date=29 November 2011 |publisher=ksat.com/news |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414205643/http://www.ksat.com/news/nationalnews/UK-condemns-Iranian-embassy-incursion/-/478364/4838464/-/lurlkdz/-/index.html |archive-date=14 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anti-UK students had gathered at the front of Gholhak Garden in the north of Tehran. They also pulled down a picture of [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] and burned an embassy vehicle, as well as US, Israeli and UK flags. The protesters said they wanted to shut down the embassy. Protesters also targeted [[Gholhak Garden]], a British diplomatic compound in northern Tehran whose ownership has been a source of contention between Iranian and UK officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2766686 |title=Kings’ Dirty Operation: Concise Memos of My Cooperation with the CIA and Illuminati's Hell |date=14 April 2016 |author=Peiman Ghasemi |publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standupamericaus.org/middle-east-iran/iran-protesters-attack-uk-embassy-in-tehran/ |title=Iran protesters attack UK embassy in Tehran |date=29 November 2011 |publisher=standupamericaus.org |accessdate=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113093805/http://www.standupamericaus.org/middle-east-iran/iran-protesters-attack-uk-embassy-in-tehran/ |archive-date=13 January 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran expressed regret over the attacks and police arrested 12 protesters.&lt;ref name=farsRegret/&gt;

===Perpetrators===
Iranian state media agencies and certain international news sources described the protests as a reaction of students against Britain's anti-Iran policies.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian opposition student groups condemn storming of British embassy |author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/01/iranian-opposition-british-embassy-attack |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite news |title=British embassy attack was state-sponsored, experts claim |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15566286,00.html |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrators themselves issued an official statement, declaring, "Our actions are a spontaneous reaction of revolutionary students and were not ordered by any state organ."&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;

In a statement to the House of Commons on 30 November, Foreign Secretary William Hague said: "Iran is a country where Opposition leaders are under house arrest, more than 500 people have been executed so far this year and where genuine protest is ruthlessly stamped on. The idea that the Iranian authorities could not have protected our Embassy or that this assault could have taken place without some degree of regime consent is fanciful".&lt;ref name="fco.gov.uk-updated"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-british-embassy-tehran |title=Foreign Secretary statement to the House of Commons on British Embassy Tehran |publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts, media sources and Iranian opposition groups assert that the attack was orchestrated by the Iranian authorities, hence the strong British reaction.&lt;ref name=aljazeera1/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya"&gt;{{cite news |title=UK embassy attack orchestrated by Iranian authorities: sources |author=Najah Mohamed Ali |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/01/180268.html |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201161931/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/01/180268.html |archive-date=1 December 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Jazeera's correspondent in Tehran, Dorsa Jabbari, reported that the Iranian police and various ministries had prior knowledge of the protest, which was organised by the student arm of the Basij.

Police reportedly "stood back and let the protestors make their way into the compound". In the words of ''[[The Economist]]'', "This was the centre of the capital city . . . If the police had wanted to stop this, they could have flooded the compound with officers and rescued the British. The police, and whoever was pulling the strings behind the attack, chose not to intervene for a long while".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2011/12/britain-and-iran |title=Britain and Iran: A very near miss for Britain's diplomats in Iran |work=The Economist |accessdate=5 December 2011 |date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jabbari stated, "Any such action of this scale can never be independent in the Islamic Republic".&lt;ref name=aljazeera1/&gt; Dominick Chilcott told the BBC, Iran is a country in which such action is only taken "with the acquiescence and the support of the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16010547|title=Attack on UK embassy in Iran 'had support of the state' |publisher=BBC   |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on international schools==
The [[École Française de Téhéran]] (Tehran's French school) is located on property of the British embassy. It had its classes in session as the embassy attack occurred. Several windows at the [[German Embassy School Tehran]] (DBST), near the British embassy, were destroyed, and the French school, the German school, and the [[British School of Tehran]] (BST) closed indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Ya'ar, Chana.

''[[Arutz Sheva]]'' (Israel National News). 12 June 2011. Retrieved on 16 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The school board of trustees of the BST voted to have the school permanently disestablished, with the end date being 31 December 2011. The DBST acquired the assets of the BST and established an international section in the former BST buildings.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20120428005645/http://www.britishschooltehran.com/ To the Friends, Staff, Parents and Children of the British School, Tehran]".

==Reactions==

===Within Iran===
Iran's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Foreign Ministry]] expressed regret over the attack, calling it "unacceptable" and said that it happened "despite the efforts made by the Iranian Law Enforcement Police and reinforcement of the embassy guards". Iranian police arrested 12 protesters in connection with the attack.&lt;ref name=farsRegret&gt;{{cite news|title=Iranian Foreign Ministry Regrets Raid on Britain's Embassy |url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9007275493 |agency=[[Fars News Agency]] |date=30 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601050206/http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9007275493 |archivedate=1 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Iranian opposition student groups, [[Tahkim Vahdat]] and [[Advar Tahkim]], issued statements criticising the attack. Tahkim Vahdat said that those behind it were "not true representative of Iranian students, they were affiliated with the authorities in power".&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

Iran's Deputy Police Chief Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Radan announced that police have started investigations into the details of the protests, in which angry self-driven protesters raided and occupied the British embassy and its garden in Northern Tehran.&lt;ref name="farsProbe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english2.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9007275481 | title=Iranian Police Probing Details of Occupy Embassy Protests | date=30 November 2011 | agency=[[Fars News Agency]] | accessdate=4 May 2016 | id=FNA News number: 9007275481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian MP Parviz Sorouri, a senior member of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said that "the British government's hasty decision to close down the Iranian Embassy in London has created a new situation for both sides. But the Iranian government will do its utmost to stand up for the rights of Iranian citizens living in Britain through the establishment of an interests section in London".&lt;ref name=Mehr&gt;{{cite news|title=It's humble pie or bitter fruit for Britain|url=http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1475266|agency=[[Mehr News Agency]]|date=2 December 2011|access-date=3 December 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128162009/http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1475266|archive-date=28 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Sultanate of Oman agreed to act as a protecting power, representing the interests of Iran through its embassy in London.

===Within the United Kingdom===
[[File:William Hague 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|[[British Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] condemned the attacks.]]
Following the incident, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] issued a statement saying that "we are outraged by this. It is utterly unacceptable and we condemn it". Later that evening David Cameron described the Iranian Government's failure to protect the embassy as a "disgrace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=699379382 |title=Storming of British Embassy in Iran |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November 2011, during a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] announced that the Iranian Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]], his ambassadorial staff and other Iranian diplomats had 48 hours to leave the United Kingdom. The foreign secretary also announced that he had closed the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Tehran|British Embassy]], and its staff and dependants had left Tehran. This brought the United Kingdom's relations with Iran to their lowest level, and both the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister had warned of far more "serious consequences" towards Iran, for its failure to uphold its international obligations in line with the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|Vienna Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Reynolds |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15966628 |title=UK to expel all Iranian diplomats over embassy attack |publisher=BBC   |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford that the UK's relationship with Iran had "taken a very serious knock" but that "It doesn't mean we're cutting off all diplomatic relations with Iran. It doesn't mean we are in any way lessening our determination to try to find a diplomatic solution to the nuclear question, which is immensely important to Europe and the whole world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to find a negotiated solution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16010547|title=Attack on UK embassy in Iran 'had support of the state |publisher=BBC   |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Iran and the UK agreed to end the protecting power arrangements of Sweden and Oman and appointed non-resident ''charge d'affaires'' to conduct bilateral relations between London and Tehran. 
In June 2014, the UK announced that it intended to reopen its embassy in Tehran once practical arrangements had been completed and predicted that Iran would reopen its embassy in London.

===United Nations===

The [[United Nations Security Council]] condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms".

===United States===
United States Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] described the attacks as an "affront" to the international community.&lt;ref name=cbsnews&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57333536/uk-serious-consequences-for-iran-attack/?tag=cbsnewsMainColumnArea UK: "Serious consequences" for Iran attack]. ''[[CBS News]]''. 30 November 2011. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; US Vice-President [[Joe Biden]] said he had no evidence the attack on the British embassy in Tehran was orchestrated by Iranian authorities, but it was another example of why the country was a "[[pariah state|pariah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/01/us-usa-iran-biden-idUSTRE7B01VQ20111201 |title=Biden: No indication Iran orchestrated embassy attack|date=1 December 2011 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EU member states===
France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands recalled their ambassadors to discuss the diplomatic matter, with Austria stating they are considering a similar decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/norway-britain-withdrawing-embassy-staff-from-iran/2011/11/30/gIQAHR37BO_story.html|title=Iran faces increased isolation after attack on British Embassy|publisher=The [[Washington Post]]|date=30 November 2011|first1=Thomas|last1=Erdbrink|first2=Joby|last2=Warrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/envoy/uk-expels-iranian-diplomats-embassy-attacked-135908110.html|title=UK expels Iranian diplomats after embassy attack; French, German, Dutch envoys recalled

While not recalling its own ambassador, Sweden summoned the Iranian Ambassador to the Swedish Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/37666/20111130/|title=Sweden summons Iran envoy after storming|publisher=The Local|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany offered to act as a [[protecting power]] for the United Kingdom's diplomatic duties in Iran;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATE 8-UK expels Iran diplomats after embassy attack|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/30/iran-britain-embassy-idUSL5E7MU09B20111130|accessdate=30 November 2011|agency=Reuters|date=30 November 2011|author2=Mitra Amiri|first=Robin|last=Pomeroy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden took on those diplomatic duties as of July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/07/12/uk-britain-iran-sweden-idUKBRE86B19620120712 | title=Sweden to watch British interests in Iran | date=12 July 2012 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=8 September 2012 | author=Castle, Tim | author2=Shanley, Mia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary declined to recall its Ambassador to Iran following a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 1 December, saying it would cripple normal day-to-day operations due to its limited staff. However the Hungarian government joined its European allies in condemning the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungary keeps Ambassador in Iran|url=http://www.budapestreport.com/2011/12/02/hungary-keeps-ambassador-in-iran/|accessdate=3 December 2011|newspaper=The Budapest report|date=2 December 2011|author=Andras M.

===Russia and China===
Russia condemned the attack, stating that the actions were "unacceptable and deserve condemnation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/iranian-students-occupy-uk-embassy-481/|title=Iran attack: UK embassy stormed in Tehran|date=29 November 2011|publisher=RT|location=Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; China did not criticise Iran by name but stated that "the relevant action runs counter to international law and basic norms of international relations and should be handled appropriately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/World/Story/STIStory_739644.html|title=China refuses to criticise Iran by name for UK embassy attack|work=Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
On 7 September 2012, Canada [[Canada–Iran relations#2012 embassy closure|closed its embassy in Iran]] and declared all remaining Iranian diplomats in Canada ''[[personae non gratae]]'', ordering them to leave the country within five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ljunggren|first=Davod|title=Canada closes Iran embassy, to expel remaining Iranian diplomats|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/07/us-canada-iran-idUSBRE8860QC20120907|agency=Reuters|accessdate=7 September 2012|date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reopening of the Embassy==
In August 2015, nearly four years after the closure of the British Embassy in Tehran, and only weeks after reaching [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|a nuclear deal]] with Iran, it was announced by Iranian Foreign Minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]] in a joint press conference with British Foreign Secretary [[Philip Hammond]] at the Foreign Ministry in Tehran that the embassy will be reopened as soon as possible. The new round of relations between the two nations are on the account of the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|JCPOA]] and in anticipation of strategic relations in the course of coming years. However, a number of Iranian students and people protested against the reopening of the British embassy on Sunday morning in the presence of Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond according to [[Fars News Agency]].  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940601001345|title=Iranian Police Make Arrests to Prevent Protest Gathering against British Embassy Reopening|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Pop singer [[Miley Cyrus]] became the subject of widespread media attention following a controversial performance with [[Robin Thicke]]. The performance began with Cyrus performing "[[We Can't Stop]]" in bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage and Cyrus stripped down to a skin-colored two-piece latex outfit while they performed "[[Blurred Lines]]" in a duet. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's [[crotch]] area with a giant pedicured foam finger and [[twerking|twerked]] against him.

An article published in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described the performance as "crass" and "reminiscent of a bad [[acid trip]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/note-miley-cyrus-please-stop-614407|title=Note to Miley Cyrus: Please Stop; Plus Other VMAs Ruminations|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 26, 2013|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was described by ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' critic B. J. Steiner as a "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Awkward Hip-Hop Moments At MTV’s 2013 Video Music Awards|author=Steiner, B.

The performance generated 306,100 tweets per minute on Twitter, Cyrus' performance resulted in a gain of over 213,000 [[Twitter]] followers, 226,000 likes on [[Facebook]], and 90,000 downloads of her new single, "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]", within days of the controversial performance. This amounted to a total 112% increase in Cyrus' social media activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/125139/Miley-Cyrus-Raunchy-VMAs-Performance-Helps-Star-Gain-213104-Twitter-Followers-And-Sell-90000-Downloads |title=Miley Cyrus' Raunchy VMAs Performance Helps Star Gain 213,104 Twitter Followers And Sell 90,000 Downloads |author=Joanna Crawley |publisher=Entertainmentwise.

'''360networks, Inc.''' was a wholesale telecommunications carrier. The company developed many long-haul fiber optic routes, primarily along railroad rights of way, consisting of both [[dark fiber]] and lit fiber. These long-haul routes included Chicago to New Orleans, Chicago to Denver, Chicago to Detroit, Chicago to New York, Seattle to Los Angeles, and Denver to San Francisco. In 2011, the company was acquired by [[Zayo Group]].

==History==
The company was founded as Pacific Fiber Link, L.L.C. on February 5, 1998 as a subsidiary of Ledcor Industries of Canada, a member of the [[Ledcor Group of Companies]], owned by the Lede family. It commenced business operations on May 31, 1998.

As the fiber optic telecommunications industry boomed, one of the greatest impediments to rapid growth for the telecoms was the acquisition of the rights of way within which to lay the fiber optic cables. The Ledes came up with a solution to this problem and negotiated a deal with the [[Canadian National Railway]] to install the cable in the railroad's rights of way alongside the tracks. The company made significant contributions to the linear construction industry by inventing and patenting the Railplow, that is mounted on a flatbed railcar and used to rapidly excavate a trench alongside railroad tracks, install conduits used for housing fiber optic cables, then backfilling the trench and completing the construction and installation process within a very short span of time. This technology enabled 360networks to rapidly lay out a North American fiber optic network throughout Canada and the United States along and within numerous railroad rights of way. The patent for the Railplow was transferred to a subsidiary of the two companies and 360networks received a royalty-free, exclusive license for the use of the Railplow, giving it a significant advantage over some of its competitors that also utilized rail corridors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084587/000091205700018688/0000912057-00-018688.txt | title=360 Networks Form F-1 | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=April 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the company focused on building a fiber optic route from Seattle to Sacramento. In 1999, it changed its name to Worldwide Fiber Networks, Inc. and its focus toward a global network. 

Not long thereafter, the company again changed its name to 360networks (USA), Inc., to better describe its 360-degree focus on a global network.

[[Greg Maffei]], the former [[chief financial officer]] of [[Microsoft]], was hired as the [[chief executive officer]] of the company.&lt;ref name=afloat&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/11/13/291579/index.htm | title=Still Afloat In An Ocean Of Doubt | first=Stephanie N. | last=Mehta | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=November 13, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
The year '''506 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]] it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Rufus and Aquilinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 248 '' [[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 506 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== Civic forums ===
Alabama Together holds civic forums for officeholders and candidates for local, state, and national elective office.  On August 16th, 2018, Alabama Together hosted a Civic Forum to give voters the opportunity to learn about candidates for state office and candidates for Alabama's 3rd congressional district.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oanow.com/news/alabama-together-to-host-forum-thursday/article_9b02f096-a041-11e8-b4e1-effed7cbfc47.html|title=Alabama Together to host forum Thursday|last=Nelson|first=Carla|date=August 15, 2018|work=OANow.com|access-date=2018-08-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Democratic candidate for Congress, [[Mallory Hagan]], spoke at the event; incumbent Congressman [[Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)|Mike Rogers]] (R) refused to attend, citing unspecified scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.auburnvillager.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor-open-letter-to-mike-rogers-camp/article_918786c2-9b40-11e8-b158-a3d0de5856be.html|title=Letters to the editor: Open letter to Mike Rogers|last=Brodbeck|first=Shanna|date=August 8, 2018|work=The Auburn Villager|access-date=2018-08-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://opelikaobserver.com/alabama-together-to-host-candidate-forum-for-al-house-district-3/|title=Alabama Together to host candidate forum for AL House District 3|last=|first=|date=August 15, 2018|website=opelikaobserver.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to congressional candidate [[Mallory Hagan]], participating candidates included Nancy Carlton Bendinger (D), a candidate for [[Alabama Senate District 27]]; Mary Wynne Kling (D), a candidate for [[Alabama House District 79]]; Joe Lovvorn, a candidate for [[Alabama House District 79]] (R-incumbent); Jeremy Gray (D), a candidate for [[Alabama House District 83]]; and Michael Holden (R), a candidate for [[Alabama House District 83]].&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

In April 2017, Alabama Together also organized a civic forum and invited Congressman [[Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)|Mike Rogers]] (R).  At the time, Representative Rogers had not held a public forum in [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]] in over two years, even though it is home to approximately 140,000 of his constituents and to [[Auburn University]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Alabama Together spent months repeatedly reaching out to Representative Rogers, sending emails, writing letters, making calls, and leaving messages with his local and D.C. offices.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.annistonstar.com/columnists/phillip_tutor/phillip-tutor-want-to-talk-to-rep-rogers-good-luck/article_ca495126-2ba1-11e7-9eb1-477fb8ca5af7.html|title=Want to talk to Rep.

On April 7, 2013, CMLL celebrated the '''Arena Coliseo's 70th Anniversary Show''' with a special [[professional wrestling]] event that featured a number of veteran wrestlers that did not usually work for CMLL such as [[Negro Navarro]], [[Black Terry]], [[Villano IV]], [[Villano V|Ray Mendoza, Jr.]], [[Universo 2000]], [[Máscara Año 2000]], and [[Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.]] working with a number of CMLL wrestlers. The main event of the show saw [[Dragón Rojo, Jr.]] defend the [[CMLL World Middleweight Championship]] against [[NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship|NWA World Historic Welterweight Champion]] [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]]. The event commemorated the completion of [[Arena Coliseo]] on April 2, 1943, built by CMLL owner and founder [[Salvador Lutteroth]]. The show aired live on the Mexican television channel Terra.&lt;ref name=Live/&gt;

==Background==
The event featured six [[professional wrestling matches]], in which some wrestlers are involved in pre-existing [[script (recorded media)|scripted]] [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] or [[narrative thread|storylines]] and others are teamed up with no particular backstory leading up to the match. Wrestlers themselves portray either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] (referred to as "''Rudos''" in Mexico) or [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]] ("''Tecnicos''" in Mexico) as they compete in matches with pre-determined outcomes.

[[professional wrestling promotion|professional wrestling promoter]] [[Salvador Lutteroth]] began promoting wrestling, or ''Lucha libre'' events in [[Arena México|Arena Modelo]] in 1933 as he founded [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL).&lt;ref name=Lutteroth&gt;{{cite book|title=Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=Los Lutteroth / the Lutteroth|pages=20–27|isbn=968-6842-48-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/misccards.html|title=EMLL Debut show|date=September 21, 1933|accessdate=January 25, 2010|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building served as the main venue for Lutteroth's promotion from 1933 until the early 1940s when the success of ''Lucha Libre'' meant that Arena Model was becoming too small to accommodate the weekly shows. Lutteroth financed the building of a new arena with $40,000 that he had won in the national lottery. The building would sit on the location of ''República de Perú'' 77 in the [[Cuauhtémoc, D.F.|Cuauhtémoc]] and was designed by Architect Francisco Bullman. Upon its completion in 1943 it was the first sports building in Mexico to have built in Air Conditioning. The building would hold 8,863 spectators for wrestling or boxing events and quickly gained the nickname the "Lagunilla Funnel" due to the design of the spectators stands in regards to the ring in the middle. The venue began hosting Boxing events only a few months after opening and for years would run both wrestling and boxing events throughout the year.&lt;ref name="Lutteroth"/&gt; The venue served as the main building for EMLL, hosting their [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows|Anniversary shows]] starting with their [[EMLL 10th Anniversary Show|10th Anniversary show]] in 1943 through their [[EMLL 22nd Anniversary Show|22nd Anniversary show]] in 1955. From 1956 and forward Arena Coliseo became a secondary venue for EMLL, with the newly constructed [[Arena México]] taking over as the venue for all of EMLL's major shows. In 1979, for unknown reasons EMLL held their [[EMLL 46th Anniversary Show|46th Anniversary Show]] in Arena Coliseo instead of Arena México, marking the last major EMLL event held there.&lt;ref name=EMLL46&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/anniversary50.html#46|title=46th Anniversary Show|date=August 21, 1979|accessdate=September 27, 2012|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks leading up to the 70th anniversary of Arena Coliseo CMLL began promoting the history of the arena, detailing its rich history of both boxing and wrestling as well as its role in Women's wrestling in Mexico, the championship matches that had taken place in the arena over the years and the large number of ''[[Luchas de Apuestas]]'' matches that had taken place on the premises and finally the deaths of boxers and wrestlers in the actual arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmllgaceta.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/arena-coliseo-la-genuina-casa-del-boxeo-sus-triunfos-sus-muertes/|title=Arena Coliseo, La Genuina casa del Boxeo -Sus triunfos – sus muertes|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013|publisher=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] Gaceta|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmllgaceta.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/arena-coliseo-el-templo-de-la-lucha-femenil/|title=Arena Coliseo el templo de la Lucha feminil|date=March 29, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013|publisher=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] Gaceta|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ColiseoApuesta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2013/04/03/arena-coliseo-cementerio-de-mascaras-y-cabelleras|title=Arena Coliseo, cementerio de máscaras y cabelleras|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=April 5, 2013|publisher=[[MSN]]|work=Medio Tiempo|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main event of the show would see reigning [[CMLL World Middleweight Championship|CMLL World Middleweight Champion]] [[Dragón Rojo, Jr.]] defend his championship against challenger [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|Best two-out-of three falls match]]. The two wrestlers had faced off multiple times in the past, most recently on January 20, 2013 during a CMLL/[[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] co-promoted show in Japan called [[Fantastica Mania 2013#Fantastica Mania January 20, 2013|''Fantastica Mania'' 2013]]. During the show La Sombra won the [[NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship]] from Dragón Rojo, Jr.&lt;ref name=FantasticaMania2013N3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result.php?e=682|title=NJPW Presents CMLL Fantastica Mania 2013|accessdate=January 20, 2013|publisher=[[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2013/01/20/la-sombra-nuevo-campeon-mundial-historico-nwa-de-peso-medio/|title=La Sombra... ¡nuevo Campeón Mundial Histórico NWA de Peso Medio!|last=Mexicool|first=Rey|date=January 20, 2013|accessdate=January 20, 2013|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth and fifth match of the show featured matches contested under [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|best two-out-of-three falls six-man tag team]] rules and in each case featured one team representing CMLL and one team representing ''Los Independientes'', or the [[Independent circuit]] that were not under contract with CMLL. [[Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.]] had worked CMLL's 2013 ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2013)|Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' only a few weeks earlier, against [[Universo 2000]] and the two independent, "old school" wrestlers found themselves on opposite sides once again. Rayo teamed up with CMLL regulars [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] and [[Diamante Azul]] while Universo 2000 teamed up with his brother [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Villano V|Ray Mendoza, Jr.]] On February 21, 2013, CMLL held a press conference to officially announce that the ''Homenaje a Dos Leyendas'' would pay tribute to [[Rayo de Jalisco, Sr.|Rayo de Jalisco]] ("The Lighting from [[Jalisco]]") and brought out Rayo's son, [[Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.]], as part of the announcement. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. had not worked for CMLL since 2010 but made a special appearance due to the company honoring his father. During the press conference Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.'s long time rival [[Universo 2000]] interrupted Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. and the two ended up challenging each other to a match that would take place at the 2013 ''Homenaje a Dos Leyendas'', although the exact nature of the match was not announced at the time. The rivalry between the two wrestlers hailed back to at least 1997 where Universo 2000 defeated both [[Cien Caras]] and Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. to win the [[CMLL World Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=CMLLHeavy12&gt;{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: EMLL CMLL Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre heavyweight Title|page=395|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LaRazaMarch132009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1236925821.php|title=Viva La Raza!

In 2005 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. suffered another serious injury, he injured both his knees in a match against Universo 2000's brother [[Máscara Año 2000]], where his legs got caught on the ropes as he jumped out of the ring and he tore ligaments in both knees. The injury kept him out of the ring for almost half a year but in the end Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. was able to make a full recovery and return to the ring.&lt;ref name="FigurasRayoJr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Grandes Figuras de la Lucha Libre|work=Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.|location=Portales, Mexico|id=17|page=48|date=November 2008|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was used by several promoters as well as Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. himself to create more interest in matches between himself and Universo 2000, Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000.At the ''Homenaje a Dos Leyendas'' show Rayo de Jalisco, Jr., [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]], and [[Rush (wrestler)|Rush]] defeated the team of Universo 2000, [[Mr. Niebla]] and [[El Terrible]] by disqualification when Universo 2000 cheated.&lt;ref name=Yahoo2Leyendas13&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mx.deportes.yahoo.com/fotos/lucha-libre-función-15-de-marzo-de-2013-slideshow/|title=Lucha Libre: Función 15 de marzo de 2013|date=March 15, 2013|accessdate=March 16, 2013|first=Gonzalo|last=López|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Mendoza, Jr.'s appearance at the show was the subject of some controversy as he had held an official [[Villano V#Supposed retirement|Retirement show]] a few weeks before, only to show up at the special CMLL event. He later explained that his poorly attended retirement show had ended up costing him $38,000 of his own money and thus felt he was forced to work this match to make some of the money back that he had lost.&lt;ref name=RazaColiseo70&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/featured-articles/40946-feature-viva-la-raza-lucha-weekly-for-4-13-13|title=Viva la Raza!: Lucha Weekly|date=April 13, 2013|first=Josh|last=Boutwell|publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth match of the night would feature CMLL wrestlers [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]], [[Blue Panther]], and [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] team up to take on the "Old-school" team of [[Black Terry]], [[Negro Navarro]], and [[Villano IV]]. This match did not have a particular backstory, instead it paired up some CMLL wrestlers who were said to be working the classical mat style wrestling, especially Blue Panther, with three independent circuit workers who worked the same style of wrestling. The third match of the night was an all-female ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' elimination match where the last women in the ring would be awarded the ''Trofeo Arena Coliseo 70 Aniversario'' cup. The match had the ''tecnica'' team of [[Marcela (wrestler)|Marcela]], [[Estrellita (wrestler)|Estrellita]], [[Goya Kong]], [[Dalys La Caribeña]] and [[Silueta (wrestler)|Silueta]] take on the ''ruda'' team of [[La Amapola]], [[Princesa Sugey]], [[Princesa Blanca]], [[Zeuxis (wrestler)|Zeuxis]], [[Tiffany (luchadora)|Tiffany]]. Estrellita and La Amapola had been on opposite sides of a long running feud that led to a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match between the two at the 2013 ''Homenaje a Dos Leyendas'' show two weeks prior. The match was won by Estrellita and La Amapola was forced to have all her hair shaved off after the match. The Arena Coliseo 70th Anniversary Show marked the first time the two faced off since the ''Apuestas'' match. The second match of the night centered on the rivalry between [[Metálico]] and  [[El Hijo del Signo]] as they were on opposite sides of a six-man tag team match. Metálico teamed up with fellow ''tecnicos''[[Hombre Bala, Jr.]] and [[Super Halcón, Jr.]] while Hijo del Signo partnered up with [[Nosferatu (wrestler)|Nosferatu]] and [[Taurus (wrestler)|Taurus]] for the match. El Hijo del Signo had begun targeting the masked Metálico in the week prior to the show, playing up the brash, arrogant rookie character that he portrayed, stating that Metálico was simply too old and useless. During their matches against each other Hijo del Signo would often go out of his way to attack Metálico, often tearing Metálico's mask apart or using other underhanded tactics to win. The opening match was announced as rookie ''tecnicos'' [[Oro, Jr.]] and [[Soberano, Jr.]] would take on [[Espanto, Jr. (CMLL)|Espanto, Jr.]] and [[Guerrero Negro, Jr.]], with all four wrestlers being part of the ''Generacion'' 2012 class of wrestlers to graduate from the CMLL wrestling school.&lt;ref name=Generacion2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2012/08/27/conferencia-de-prensa-79-aniversario-del-cmll/|title=Confecencia de prensa 79 aniversario del CMLL|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=November 7, 2012|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
During the show CMLL officials gave an award to one of the fans in attendance as he had also attended the first Arena Coliseo show 70 years prior. Oro, Jr. was originally announced for the opening match, but was replaced by [[Metatrón (wrestler)|Metatrón]] later on without any explanation given. Metatrón and Soberano, Jr. defeated Espanto, Jr. and Guerrero Negro, Jr. two falls to one.&lt;ref name=70thShow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Official70Years/&gt; During the second match of the night the storyline between Hijo del Signo and Metálico took center stage as most of the action centered on the two. In the second fall Hijo del Signo pulled Metálico's mask off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a_a_3nNhiTw/UWPQ3OrD3AI/AAAAAAAAwuw/EWt2B0CErAQ/s320/4.JPG|title=image: Hijo del Signo unmasking Metálico|date=April 7, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013|publisher=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]|first=Alexis A.|last=Salazar López|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; hoping to use the distraction to gain a pinfall, but instead he was disqualified when the referee saw the blatant rulebreaking by El Hijo del Signo.&lt;ref name=70thShow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Official70Years/&gt;

The independent wrestlers were well received by the Arena Coliseo crowd, cheering especially for the portions of the match where Blue Panther and Negro Navarro wrestled against each other. The match ended when Averno forced Black Terry to submit and Blue Panther forced Villano IV to submit to win the third fall. Afterwards the fans showed their appreciation of the match by throwing money into the ring, causing both Panther and Navarro to actually go into the seats to collect more money after the match. Both Panther and Navarro teased that they were going to continue to fight, which drew a favorable response from the crowd.&lt;ref name=70thShow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Official70Years/&gt; Before the fifth match of the night Ray Mendoza, Jr. took the microphone and announced to the crowd that this would actually be his last match as a professional wrestler. Rayo de Jalisco and his team won both the second and third fall to win the entire match.&lt;ref name=70thShow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Official70Years/&gt; In the main event the challenger La Sombra and the champion Dragón Rojo, Jr. quickly split the first two falls between them, tied up at 1–1. The third fall was longer than both the previous falls combined and finally saw Dragón Rojo, Jr. successfully defend the championship when he forced La Sombra to submit.&lt;ref name=70thShow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Official70Years/&gt;

'''Australia Day Live''' was a [[concert]] on Federation Mall, the lawns of [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]], that was hosted each year on 25 January. The concert, first launched in 2004, featured music from [[Music of Australia|Australian]] artists and musicians. Australia Day Live was preceded by the [[Australian of the Year]] Awards. The name of the concert was changed in 2012 to 'Australia Celebrates Live'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/australiaday/bios.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia Celebrates Live concert ==
'''Australia Celebrates Live''' was a free concert held on the lawns of Parliament House in Canberra every Australia Day eve (25 January). It featured a line-up of Australian acts.

The concert included tributes to the outgoing Australians of the Year with songs chosen by the previous Australians of the Year. This was followed by the Australian of the Year Awards ceremony.

Once the Awards ceremony was complete, the concert continued with each artist performing a full set of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiaday.org.au/australia-day/australia-celebrates-live-2014/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430065510/http://www.australiaday.org.au/australia-day/australia-celebrates-live-2014/ |archivedate=30 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Casualties of Love: The "Long Island Lolita" Story''''' (1993) was the third made-for-television movie based on the story of [[Amy Fisher]] and [[Joey Buttafuoco]], written and directed by [[John Herzfeld]]. [[Alyssa Milano]] and [[Jack Scalia]] played the main characters in this movie for [[CBS]]. The movie aired the same night and time as ABC's movie, ''[[The Amy Fisher Story]]'', though ABC's movie was much higher rated in the TV ratings and critically praised.

[[Phyllis Lyons]], [[Leo Rossi]], and [[Lawrence Tierney]] portrayed Buttafuoco's relatives.

==Plot==
Set on [[Long Island]], the film opens with Joey Buttafuoco ([[Jack Scalia]]) playing [[drums]], driving under influence of cocaine, fleeing from the cops and visiting his mother's grave. At home, his wife Mary Jo ([[Phyllis Lyons]]) awaits his return, disappointed in his drug [[relapse|back lapse]]. After she threatens to leave him if he does not quit using drugs, Joey decides to enter [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. Six weeks later, he is a renewed man, promising his wife he is now the person again she fell in love with. Three years later, in the summer of 1991, he works in an auto repair shop, and meets 17-year-old Amy Fisher ([[Alyssa Milano]]), who begs Joey to repair her car without telling her parents. Joey agrees, even though he is a close acquaintance of her father Elliot (Jack Kehler). Amy frequently crashes her car, prompting her to make multiple visits to Joey. It does not take long before she starts coming on to him, making hints of her promiscuous past despite her young age. Even though he does not respond to her affection, Joey does not especially push her away and constantly pays her special attention.

One day at the carnival with her friend Lizzy ([[Georgia Emelin]]), Amy notices Joey and surprises him with a kiss. Joey is startled and immediately leaves.  After he is gone, Amy claims to Lizzy that she has been dating him for a while now. The next day, Joey finds out that Elliot has filed a complaint with the police after Amy has claimed that Joey gave her [[herpes]]. Joey sets out to the Fisher residence to set things straight, and Amy eventually admits that she lied about the situation. Joey is outraged, though does not inform his wife, fearing that it will affect their marriage. Later, at a cafe, Joey assures Amy that he has no interest in leaving his wife and children, and ignores her when she shows to him that she is wearing his car repair shop t-shirt. By now, Amy is madly in love with Joey and thinks that the only thing holding them apart is Mary Jo. She hires a [[contract killing|contract killer]] to kill Mary Jo - paying him $600 and allowing him to sleep with her - though the young man eventually chickens out.

Six months later, she shows up at the Buttafuoco residence once again and claims to Mary Jo that Joey is having an affair with her "16-year-old sister", showing him Joey's car repair shop t-shirt to "prove" her claim. When Mary Jo refuses to believe her, Amy takes out her gun and shoots Mary Jo in the head. Later at the hospital, Joey is informed that his wife's situation is critical and that she might be paralyzed for the rest of her life, if she does not die. Amy, meanwhile, sets out to her boyfriend Paul ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]), who is in a relationship with another woman, for comfort. Back in the hospital, a severely injured Mary Jo informs Joey and the detectives that her attacker owned his repair shop t-shirt. Joey then realizes Amy shot Mary Jo. Following her arrest, Amy claims that she and Joey both conspired to kill Mary Jo, enabling them to spend their life together. Joey denies any of Amy's claims, and swears to the cops that he was never involved with her. In the media, Joey is frequently mentioned as an adulterer and conspirer, causing even Mary Jo to question her husband.

Even though he is advised to not set out to the media, Joey decides to make an official report after the media releases a sex tape of Amy and an older man. It is claimed that Joey forced her into a life of [[prostitution]], and that the older man of the tape was one of her clients. In prison, Amy continues to make love claims to Joey, now through letters. During the court case, Amy's bail is set at $2 million, the highest in New York state history, and Joey is tarnished by reporters. He tries to stand by his wife, but Mary Jo is confused by all the "evidence" that's coming up in court, "proving" Joey is guilty. She blames him for not being able to protect her, though she does not leave him.

By August 1992, bail for Amy is made by a TV network working to adapt her story. Joey's life falls more apart when he is informed that the entire Buttafuoco family will lose the auto repair shop if it is proven that he had an affair with Amy (the pressure causes his father to have a [[heart attack]]). The Buttafuocos want to allow Amy to have a plea bargain, or else her attorney will destroy the family company. Even though Mary Jo objects to the situation, reminding her family that she is the victim here, Amy is allowed a deal in court: she will receive 5 to 15 years for "reckless assault". Pleas of "attempted murder" among others are dropped, so the D.A. can come after Joey Buttafuoco for [[statutory rape]]. Soon after, a video tape is released in which Amy brags about her plea, and asks Paul to marry her. The tape allows the Buttafuocos to clear their name, while Amy receives the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.

==Production==
By the time the film was first aired, ''Casualties of Love'' received a fair share of media attention, due to the film being one of three about Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco to be aired on the same night by three different TV networks. Filming took place in November and December 1992, and the film was promoted as the TV version that told Joey Buttafuoco's side of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Due to the popularity of its story, the film had a much higher budget.&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;

The film was known for being [[Alyssa Milano]]'s first "adult role" which shed her "nice girl image" she gained from appearing in ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'' from 1984 to 1992. The producers cast her after seeing her portrayal as a teenage prostitute in the independent film ''[[Where the Day Takes You]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="intimate"&gt;{{Cite episode

Since then, we've learned that his version wasn't all true.

The film was shot between November 23 and December 16, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/415857/Casualties-of-Love-Long-Island-Lolita-Story/misc-notes.html MISCELLANEOUS NOTES] ''[[Turner Classic Movies]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fleadh2008-opening.jpg|250px|thumbnail|The opening parade of the 2008 Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in [[Tullamore]], [[County Offaly]]]]
The '''Fleadh Cheoil''' ({{IPA-ga|fʲlʲaː çoːlʲ}}, meaning "festival of music") is an [[Music of Ireland|Irish music]] competition run by [[Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann]] (CCÉ), a non-profit group.

There are various stages to the competition. In Ireland there are county and provincial competitions leading to the [[All-Ireland]] Fleadh. In Britain there are regional, then national stages of qualification for the All-Ireland. North America has two regional qualifying Fleadh Cheoil.  The [[Mid-Atlantic (US)|Mid-Atlantic]] Fleadh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cce-ma.com |title=CCE Mid-Atlantic Fleadh}}&lt;/ref&gt; covers the [[US Eastern Seaboard|Eastern Seaboard]], [[eastern Canada]] and [[the Maritimes]]. The [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] Fleadh&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwestfleadh.org midwestfleadh.org]&lt;/ref&gt; covers the rest of North America from Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta and Detroit to San Francisco.

Competitions are divided into the following age categories: under 12, 12–15, 15–18, and over 18 (senior).

==History==
The first national festival of [[Irish music#Traditional music|Irish traditional music]] was held in [[Mullingar]] in 1951.   At its inaugural meeting in September 1951, CCÉ came up with the title of Fleadh Cheoil, aiming to make this a great national festival of traditional music. The fleadh has been held [[List of venues for All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann|in many different venues]].

In the years that followed, the number of would-be competitors grew so large that qualifying stages had to be arranged at county and provincial levels. Since then, Fleadh Nua (the new fleadh), Fleadh na Breataine (an All-Britain fleadh) and regional fleadhanna in Britain, and two major fleadhanna in the USA have also become annual CCÉ events.

From its beginning, the goal of the Fleadh Cheoil was to establish standards in Irish traditional music through competition. The fleadh developed as a mainly competitive event, but it also included many concerts, {{lang|ga|[[céilí]]the}}, [[parades]], and [[Irish traditional music session|sessions]].

Today, nearly 55 years on, fleadhanna at each level provide a platform and a meeting place for the thousands of musicians, singers and dancers who carry on the tradition.  Around 20,000 performers compete in fleadhanna each year.

The largest fleadh to date was 2013 in [[Derry]], an event which attracted 430,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-23752870 |title=Derry Fleadh 'biggest ever' say organisers |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fleadh was notable as it was the first All-Ireland Fleadh to be staged in [[Northern Ireland]].

The 2008 festival was held in [[Tullamore]], [[County Offaly]] and attracted an estimated crowd of 250,000 people making it Ireland's largest festival, music or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offalyexpress.ie/fleadh-cheoil-na-heireann/Tullamore39s-Fleadhtrick.4430988.jp Tullamore's Fleadh-trick] Offaly Express, 27 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Fleadh came to [[Sligo]] in 2014 and 2015.

The 2016 festival was held in [[Ennis]], [[County Clare]] and attracted an estimated crowd of 400,000 people over the nine days from 14 to 22 August. Among the visitors to the 2016 Fleadh was President [[Michael D Higgins]], who went to school near Ennis. 10,000 musicians took part in 2016, with 6,000 of them participating in 180 All-Ireland competitions. An estimated €38 million was spent as 80,000 visitors were in Ennis at any one time. There were 28 concerts, with five held in the 2,000-seater Shannon Aerodome at Tim Smythe Park in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/records-broken-at-fleadh-cheoil-in-co-clare-1.2765028|title= Records broken at fleadh cheoil in Co Clare|date=23 August 2016|work=Irish Times|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 2017 Fleadh Cheoil returned to Ennis from 13 to 21 August. The 2017 festival was opened by [[Michael Flatley]], and over 450,000 people attended over nine days, peaking at 100,000 for the Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/festivals/flatley-shows-off-his-fluteplaying-skills-to-kickstart-fleadh-36028794.html|title= Flatley shows off his flute-playing skills to kick-start Fleadh|date=14 August 2017|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= http://clareherald.com/2017/08/ennis-records-highest-visitor-numbers-of-any-fleadh-70365/|title= Ennis records highest visitor numbers of any Fleadh|date=21 August 2017|work=Clare Herald|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition categories==
According to CCÉ's official rules for 2005:

: Solo competitions shall be held for the following instruments: fiddle; two-row accordion; [[concert flute]]; whistle; [[piano accordion]]; [[concertina]]; [[uilleann pipe]]s; harp; [[mouth organ]]; banjo; mandolin – excluding [[banjo-mandolin]]; piano; old-style [[melodeon (accordion)|melodeon]]; [[bodhrán]]; [[war pipes]]; miscellaneous such as three- and five-row [[button accordion]], [[piccolo]], [[chromatic harmonica|[chromatic] harmonica]] and other stringed instruments; [[céilí]] band drums; accompaniment – confined to piano, harp, guitar and [[bouzouki]]-type instruments; solo traditional singing in Irish and English; whistling; [[lilting]]; newly composed ballads and {{lang|ga|amhráin nua-cheaptha}} (newly composed songs in Irish).

: Solo competitions for slow airs shall be held in all age groups for the following instruments: (a) fiddle; (b) concert flute; (c) whistle; (d) [[uilleann pipe]]s; and (e) harp (as of 2010).

There are also competitions for the following ensembles: duet, trio, céilí band, instrumental group ({{lang|ga|grupaí cheoil}}), accordion band, pipe band, and miscellaneous ensemble.

The full rule set, which may change from year to year, is available from CCÉ web site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comhaltas.com |title=comhaltas.com |publisher=comhaltas.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Press Room section. Comhaltas has a constitution ({{lang|ga|{{linktext|bunreacht}}}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comhaltas.ie/press_room/detail/comhaltas_constitution_bunreacht/ |title= Comhaltas Constitution (Bunreacht) |publisher=Comhaltas.ie |date=2 May 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Irish language.

==Application==
Towns and cities wishing to host Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann must submit several applications to Ardchomhairle an Chomaltais – the highest committee within CCÉ. Certain members of the Ardchomhairle then inspect the applicant towns and the locations that have been proposed as competition venues, before coming to a final decision several weeks after the preceding fleadh, usually in September. Once a town has been chosen to host the Fleadh, it undertakes to host the festival for two consecutive years. However, Comhaltas has the right to deny any the successful town the Fleadh for the second year if poor venues, organisational problems, etc. are demonstrated on the town's first year of hosting. On 10 September 2011, the 2012 All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil was awarded to [[Cavan]], [[County Cavan]], for the third year in succession. The other towns who applied for the 2012 festival were [[Ennis]], [[County Clare]]; and [[Sligo]], [[County Sligo]]. The Fleadh was held in [[Derry]] in 2013, the first time that it was held in [[Northern Ireland]]. One of the primary reasons for holding the Fleadh in Derry was due to that city being awarded the [[UK City of Culture]] for 2013. In 2014, it was confirmed that the Fleadh Cheoil would be held in [[Sligo]] for 2014 and 2015. [[Ennis]] hosted the Fleadh in August 2016 and 2017, with [[Drogheda]] hosting in 2018 and 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishmirror.ie/whats-on/arts-culture-news/drogheda-host-fleadh-cheoil-2019-13110764 |title=Drogheda to host Fleadh Cheoil 2019 after 500,000 people descended upon Louth for hugely successful week long festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7325">'''The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse''' is a term for [[internet]] [[criminal]]s, or the [[image]]ry of internet criminals.

==Popular usage==
A play on [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], it refers to types of criminals who use the internet to facilitate crime and consequently jeopardize the rights of honest internet users. There does not appear to be an exact definition for who the Horsemen are, but they are usually described as [[Terrorism|terrorist]]s, [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]s, [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Other sources use slightly different descriptions but generally refer to the same types of criminals. The term was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Timothy C. May]] in 1988, who referred to them as "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{quotation|8.3.4. "How will privacy and anonymity be attacked?"
&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;
* Newspapers are complaining about the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse:

}}

The term seems to be used less often in discussions about online criminal activity, but more often in discussions about the negative, or [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effects]] such activity has had on regular users' daily experiences online.
It is also used frequently to describe the political tactic "[[Think of the children]]".  A message from the [[Cypherpunk|same]] mailing list states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quotation|How to get what you want in 4 easy stages:
# Have a target "thing" you wish to stop, yet lack any moral, or practical reasons for doing so?
# Pick a fear common to lots of people, something that will evoke a gut reaction: terrorists, pedophiles, serial killers.
# Scream loudly to the media that "thing" is being used by perpetrators.  (Don't worry if this is true, or common to all other things, or less common with "thing" than with other long established systems—payphones, paper mail, private hotel rooms, lack of bugs in all houses etc.)
# Say that the only way to stop perpetrators is to close down "thing", or to regulate it to death, or to have laws forcing en masse tapability of all private communications on "thing".  Don't worry if communicating on "thing" is a constitutionally protected right, if you have done a good job in choosing and publicising the horsemen in 2, no one will notice, they will be too busy clamouring for you to save them from the supposed evils.

The four supposed threats may be used all at once or individually, depending on the circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Examples==

In 2013, the director of the Safe Internet League (a voluntary [[Internet censorship in Russia|censorship group in Russia]]) claimed that pedophiles, perverts, drug dealers “and other creeps”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia’s FSB mulls ban on ‘Tor’ online anonymity network|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/russia-tor-anonymizer-ban-571/|website=Russia Today|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; were using the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] anonymity software, as a reason why the software should be outlawed.  This list did not mention terrorists or money-launderers directly, but did use the catch-all phrase "other creeps" that potentially includes them.

In 2015, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative party]] claimed that their proposed “new communications data legislation will strengthen our ability to disrupt terrorist plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming gangs”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gayle|first1=Damien|title=Right to privacy 'could be meaningless in 10 years under Tory and Labour plans'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/22/right-to-privacy-could-be-meaningless-in-10-years-under-tory-and-labour-plans|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc." quote of Timothy C. May.

Later in 2015, [[Gamma Group]] released a statement claiming that their surveillance technology is used "against terrorist threats, drug cartels, other major organised crime, and paedophile rings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nick Hopkins|author2=Jake Morris|title=UK firm's surveillance kit 'used to crush Uganda opposition'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34529237|website=BBC News|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as justification for concerns that it was being used to target opposition politicians and media groups in [[Uganda]].  With money-laundering treated as a major organised crime, this quote matches very closely with the list given in the Cypherpunk FAQ.

The "'''Great Moon Hoax'''" refers to a series of six articles that were published in ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a New York newspaper, beginning on August 25, 1835, about the supposed discovery of life and even civilization on the [[Moon]]. The discoveries were falsely attributed to Sir [[John Herschel]], one of the best-known [[astronomer]]s of that time.

The story was advertised on August 21, 1835, as an upcoming feature allegedly reprinted from ''[[Edinburgh Courant|The Edinburgh Courant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maliszewski, Paul. "Paper Moon," ''Wilson Quarterly''. Winter 2005. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The first in a series of six was published four days later on August 25.

==Article==
[[File:1836 the-great-moon-hoax-new-inhabitants-of-the-moon.png|thumb|right|220px|Portrait of a man-bat ("''Vespertilio-homo''"), from an edition of the Moon series published in [[Naples]]]]

The headline read:

{{cquote|
&lt;center&gt;GREAT ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;LATELY MADE&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;BY SIR JOHN HERSCHEL, L.L.D. F.R.S. &amp;c.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''At the [[Cape of Good Hope]]'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[From Supplement to the [[Edinburgh]] Journal of Science]&lt;/center&gt;
}}

The articles described fantastic animals on the Moon, including [[bison]], [[goats]], [[unicorn]]s, [[bipedal]] tail-less [[beavers]] and [[bat]]-like winged humanoids ("''Vespertilio-homo''") who built temples. There were trees, oceans and beaches. These discoveries were supposedly made with "an immense [[telescope]] of an entirely new principle."

The author of the narrative was ostensibly Dr. Andrew Grant, the travelling companion and [[amanuensis]] of Sir John Herschel, but Grant was fictitious.

Eventually, the authors announced that the observations had been terminated by the destruction of the telescope, by means of the [[Sun]] causing the lens to act as a "[[burning glass]]," setting fire to the observatory.&lt;ref name="AsimovGunn1975"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunn |first1=James E. |authorlink1=James Gunn (author) |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |authorlink2=Isaac Asimov |title=Alternate worlds: the illustrated history of science fiction |date=1975 |publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]] |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=0-89104-049-8 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Authorship of the article has been attributed to Richard Adams Locke (1800–1871),&lt;ref Name="Deseret"&gt;{{Cite news |title=They Formed A Pair |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xaZOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hkIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6760,5192821 |newspaper=[[Deseret News|The Deseret Weekly]] |publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company |location=Salt Lake City, UT |date=May 13, 1893 |page=665 |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/locke_richard_adams |title=Locke, Richard Adams |first1=John |last1=Clute |first2=John |last2=Eggeling |website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reporter who, in August 1835, was working for ''The Sun''. Locke publicly admitted to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper ''New World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=Matthew |date=2008 |title=The Sun and the Moon |location=New York |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |page=274 |isbn=978-0-465-00257-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, rumours persisted that others were involved. Two other men have been noted in connection with the [[hoax]]: [[Joseph Nicollet|Jean-Nicolas Nicollet]],&lt;ref Name="Deseret" /&gt; a French astronomer travelling in America at the time (though he was in Mississippi, not New York, when the Moon-hoax issues appeared), and [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', a literary magazine. However, there is no good evidence to indicate that anyone but Locke was the author of the hoax.

Assuming that Richard A. Locke was the author, his intentions were probably, first, to create a sensational story which would increase sales of ''The Sun'', and, second, to ridicule some of the more extravagant astronomical theories that had recently been published. For instance, in 1824, [[Franz von Gruithuisen|Franz von Paula Gruithuisen]], professor of Astronomy at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]], had published a paper titled "Discovery of Many Distinct Traces of Lunar Inhabitants, Especially of One of Their Colossal Buildings." Gruithuisen claimed to have observed various shades of color on the lunar surface, which he correlated with climate and vegetation zones. He also observed lines and geometrical shapes, which he felt indicated the existence of walls, roads, fortifications, and cities.

However, a more direct object of Locke's satire was Rev. [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Thomas Dick]], who was known as "The Christian Philosopher" after the title of his first book.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Rh4PAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=thomas+dick+christian+philosopher&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Christian Philosopher]''&lt;/ref&gt; Dick had computed that the [[Solar System]] contained 21,891,974,404,480 (21.9 trillion) inhabitants. In fact, the Moon alone, by his count, would contain 4,200,000,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dick |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Dick (scientist) |title=Celestial Scenery; or, The Wonders of the Planetary System Displayed: Illustrating the Perfections of Deity and a Plurality of Worlds |url=https://archive.org/download/celestialscener00dick/celestialscener00dick.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |origyear=First published London 1837; New York 1838 |date=1845 |publisher=Edward C. Biddle |location=Philadelphia |pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were enormously popular in the [[United States]], his fans including intellectual [[wikt:luminaries|luminaries]] such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

==Reaction and effect==
According to legend, ''The Sun''{{'}}s circulation increased dramatically because of the hoax and remained permanently greater than before, thereby establishing ''The Sun'' as a successful paper. However, the degree to which the hoax increased the paper's circulation has certainly been exaggerated in popular accounts of the event. It was not discovered to be a hoax for several weeks after its publication and, even then, the newspaper did not issue a retraction.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Doris V. "[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1972207.htm Thomas Low Nichols, Poe, and the 'Balloon Hoax'"] collected in ''Poe Studies'', vol. V, no. 2. December 1972. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel was initially amused by the hoax, noting that his own real observations could never be as exciting. He became annoyed later when he had to answer questions from people who believed the hoax was serious.

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] claimed the story was a plagiarism of his earlier work "[[The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall]]."  His editor at the time was Richard Adams Locke.  He later published "[[The Balloon-Hoax]]" in the same newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-great-moon-hoax-180-years-ago?linkId=16545579|title=The Great Moon Hoax – History in the Headlines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe had published his own Moon hoax in late June 1835, two months before the similar Locke Moon hoax, in the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' entitled "Hans Phaall – A Tale," later republished as "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall." The story was reprinted in the ''[[New York Transcript]]'' on September 2–5, 1835, under the headline "Lunar Discoveries, Extraordinary Aerial Voyage by Baron Hans Pfaall." Poe described a voyage to the Moon in a hot-air balloon, in which Pfaall lives for five years on the Moon with lunarians and sends back a lunarian to earth. The Poe Moon hoax was less successful because of the satiric and comical tone of the account. Locke was able to upstage Poe and to steal his thunder. In 1846, Poe would write a biographical sketch of Locke as part of his series "The Literati of New York City" which appeared in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]''.

The hoax, as well as Poe's "Hans Pfaall", are mentioned by characters in [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''.

Nate DiMeo's historical podcast ''[[The Memory Palace]]'' dedicated an episode to the Great Moon Hoax entitled "The Moon in the Sun."&lt;ref name="Episode 24: The Moon in the Sun"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://thememorypalace.us/2010/01/episode-24-the-moon-in-the-sun/ |title=Episode 24: The Moon in the Sun |website=The Memory Palace |publisher=[[WordPress]] |host=DiMeo, Nate |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hedley Nevile 'Bill' Fowler''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MC}} (8 June 1916 &amp;ndash; 26 March 1944) was a British [[Royal Air Force]] pilot who became a [[prisoner of war]] and successfully escaped from [[Oflag IV-C]] at [[Colditz]] during the [[Second World War]].

==Early life==

Fowler was born in London on 8 June 1916. He was educated at Rugby School. His father was a Paymaster-Commander in the [[Royal Navy]] and he was great-grandson of Sir [[Henry Ayers]], a Premier of South [[Australia]] for whom [[Uluru|Ayers Rock]] was named. Fowler's family moved to [[Adelaide]] in South Australia in 1920, before returning to the UK in 1924 so Fowler could attend [[Rugby School]]. He returned to Australia in 1933, before enlisting in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1936, and then transferring to the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Champ|first1=Jack|last2=Burgess|first2=Colin|title=The Diggers of Colditz|date=18 November 1985|isbn=978-0856138805|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighter pilot==

Fowler was granted a short-service commission in the RAF as a [[pilot officer]] on 19 February 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34376|date=2 March 1937 |page=1417 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was trained at No 6 Flying Training School at [[RAF Netheravon|Netheravon]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1937/1937%20-%200812.html&lt;/ref&gt; before being posted to [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|3 Squadron]] on 22 May 1937.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1937/1937%20-%201540.html&lt;/ref&gt; He then served as a [[fighter pilot]] with [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|615 Squadron]] commanded by [[Squadron Leader]] [[Joseph Kayll]], flying the [[Gloster Gladiator]]. He joined the Squadron in October 1939 before converting to [[Hawker Hurricane]]s in May 1940.

Fowler and 615 Squadron arrived in France in November 1939 as part of the Air Component of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|BEF]]. When the [[Battle of France|German invasion of the west]] commenced on 10 May 1940, the Squadron was still converting onto Hurricanes, although they were in action from the very start.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1995|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler made his first 'kill' on 12 May 1940 when he shot down a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]]. This was also the Squadron's first kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foreman|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: An enemy aircraft had been claimed damaged by F/O L Fredman on 10 May 1940, but Fowler's kill was the first aircraft destroyed.&lt;/ref&gt; He was credited with shooting down a [[Dornier Do 17]] on 14 May 1940 as well, followed by another Bf 109 the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foreman|2003|pp=42,44}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same engagement he was also shot down.&lt;ref&gt;'RAF Fighter Command Losses 1939-1941' by Norman Franks page 23&lt;/ref&gt; He bailed out and landed in the [[Ardennes]] Forest where he met some French soldiers retreating from the front line. However the next day, 16 May, the group was surrounded and forced to surrender. As a result, Fowler became a [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1995|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 3 September 1940 whilst in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34996|date=19 November 1940 |page=6633|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoner of war==

Fowler was sent to [[Dulag Luft]] transit camp at [[Oberursel]] before being transferred to [[Stalag Luft I]] at [[Barth, Germany|Barth]], arriving there on 5 July 1940.&lt;ref name="Those Who Dared page 115"&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1983|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalag Luft I and first escape===

By November 1941, Fowler was acting as a distributor of [[Red Cross]] parcels. During his time in captivity Fowler had been making a bogus German uniform out of various bits of material and a civilian suit, smuggling them into the parcel office which was outside the main prisoners' compound.&lt;ref name="Those Who Dared page 115"/&gt; On 5 November 1941, he dressed in his bogus German uniform from the parcel office and climbed over the lightly guarded perimeter fence. Outside the camp he changed into his civilian suit. He managed to reach [[Sassnitz]] and attempted to stow away on a Swedish ship; but whilst at the docks he was arrested by a German policeman. He was returned to [[Stalag Luft I]] and sentenced to 14 days solitary confinement, before being transferred to the 'escape proof' camp [[Oflag IV-C]] at [[Colditz Castle]], arriving on 1 December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;WO208/3282 Official Camp History SL1 - Chapter II para 17(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pete Tunstall]] claims that Fowler, whilst at Barth, was the first in WWII to use the term 'goons' to describe the guards, referencing a well-known comic strip.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2339}}  Tunstall claims the term caught like wildfire through all the prison camps in Germany. ''"Goons up"'' became a warning cry for approaching guards, ''"goon boxes"'' described the machine gun towers, any manmade uniforms used to escape were called ''"goon skins,"'' and their favourite recreation of winding the guards up become known as ''"[[goon baiting]]."''{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2339}}

===Colditz Castle and successful escape===
[[Image:Colditz Castle1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Colditz Castle]]
During his time at Colditz, Fowler took part in '[[goon baiting]]', which involved harassing and annoying the German guards as much as possible, under the able direction of [[Douglas Bader]]. For this, Fowler - as many others - spent time in solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1983|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During August 1942 an escape plan was prepared for a party of officers moving through a short tunnel which started in the German [[Stabsfeldwebel]]'s ([[sergeant major]]) office located near the prisoner's sick quarters. The starting location was chosen because it was a place unlikely to be thoroughly searched. Fowler was involved from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;'Colditz - The Full Story' by Pat Reid pages 162-165&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners picked the office's lock and over a few nights built a tunnel which led from under the Stabsfeldwebel's desk to a clothing store with access to the outside. The tunnel was partly constructed by Captain [[Pat Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;'The Colditz Story' by [[Pat Reid]] page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

From the clothing store the prisoners were to leave the castle disguised as a work party removing clothes from the store, four to be dressed as Polish orderlies, one disguised as a German officer, the other as a German [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]. The six officers were Fowler, Captain [[Lulu Lawton]] ([[British Army]]), Lieutenant [[Geoff Wardle]] ([[Royal Navy]]) and three [[Netherlands|Dutch]] officers, Lt Beitz, Lt Donkers and Lt [[Damiaen Joan van Doorninck]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;WO208/3288 Official Camp History O4C - Chapter II para 21(k)&lt;/ref&gt; The escape took place on 9 September 1942. All went well as the six escapers and two assistants entered the office during the previous evening and opened up the tunnel. However, around midnight there was an alarm and the Germans searched the castle. Fortunately for the prisoners, the office door had been relocked and this satisfied the searchers that nobody had entered the office.&lt;ref&gt;'The Colditz Story' by Pat Reid Page 179&lt;/ref&gt; After entering the clothing store the tunnel was sealed to allow later use (it was discovered the following day during the search for the missing officers). At 0730 the escape party left the store, timed to be shortly after the change of the German sentries; the idea being that the new sentries would be unaware of who had already entered the store. The party, led by van Doorninck (dressed as the German NCO), proceeded past several sentries and using a [[Forgery|forged]] pass, left the castle unaccosted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Outside the camp the party changed into civilian clothes and separated, Fowler travelling with van Doornick. They travelled on foot to [[Penig]] (about 31&amp;nbsp;km) and from there by train to [[Plauen]] via [[Zwickau]]. They caught the train to [[Stuttgart]] where they stayed overnight in a small hotel. The next day they caught a train to [[Tuttlingen]] and walked to the Swiss border. En route they were stopped by an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] policeman, but their forged papers were sufficient to pass inspection. They crossed into Switzerland at 0130 on 13 September 1942, and were taken to the British [[legation]] at [[Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;WO208/3288 Official Camp History O4C - Chapter X para 3&lt;/ref&gt; The other four escapers were recaptured close to Colditz.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Return to the UK ===

Fowler left Switzerland on 25 January 1943 and with [[Major]] [[Ronald B. Littledale]], who had escaped from Colditz with Pat Reid, travelled across [[Vichy France|unoccupied France]] into Spain on 30 January 1943. They were arrested by the Spanish authorities later the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1983|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were taken to a [[military prison]] at [[Figueras]] and held in filthy and cramped conditions until 22 February 1943. They were then taken to the British [[Consul]] in [[Barcelona]] from where they travelled to [[Gibraltar]], arriving on 25 March 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1983|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler returned to the UK shortly afterwards.

For his successful escape, Fowler was awarded the [[Military Cross]], which was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 14 December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36285|date=10 December 1943 |page=5438|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

On reaching the UK, Fowler was promoted to [[squadron leader]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36092|date=13 July 1943 |page=3206|supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and posted to the Armament Test Squadron at [[Boscombe Down]] to act as a [[test pilot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.testflyingmemorial.com/1940-45.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802110846/http://www.testflyingmemorial.com/1940-45.htm |archivedate=2 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed during an air test flying a [[Hawker Typhoon]] on 26 March 1944, and was buried at [[Durrington, Wiltshire|Durrington]] cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2709963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43086755]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Hindenburg'' disaster''' occurred on May 6, 1937, in [[Manchester Township, New Jersey|Manchester Township, New Jersey, United States]]. The German passenger airship [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|LZ 129 ''Hindenburg'']] caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its [[mooring mast]] at [[Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst|Naval Air Station Lakehurst]]. On board were 97 people (36 passengers and 61 crewmen); there were 36 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen, 1 worker on the ground).

The disaster was the subject of spectacular [[newsreel]] coverage, photographs, and [[Herbert Morrison (announcer)|Herbert Morrison]]'s recorded [[radio]] eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagoradioandmedia.com/multimedia/audio/571-wls-broadcast-of-the-hindenburg-disaster-1937 WLS Broadcast Of the Hindenburg Disaster 1937. Chicagoland Radio and Media] Retrieved May 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of hypotheses have been put forward for both the cause of [[Combustion|ignition]] and the initial [[fuel]] for the ensuing [[fire]]. The event shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid [[airship]] and marked the abrupt end of the [[airship era]].&lt;ref&gt;Craats 2009, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight==
After opening its 1937 season by completing a single round-trip passage to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, in late March, the ''Hindenburg'' departed from [[Frankfurt]], Germany, on the evening of May 3, on the first of 10 round trips between Europe and the United States that were scheduled for its second year of commercial service. [[American Airlines]] had contracted with the operators of the ''Hindenburg'' to shuttle the passengers from Lakehurst to Newark for connections to airplane flights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D12FC3D5E167B93C0A8178FD85F428385F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Newark+to+Lakehurst%2C+For+Hindenburg&amp;st=p "Airplane shuttle service to operate, Newark to Lakehurst, for Hindenburg."] ''The New York Times,'' April 12, 1936. p. XX5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for strong [[headwind]]s that slowed its progress, the Atlantic crossing of the ''Hindenburg'' was otherwise unremarkable until the airship attempted an early-evening landing at Lakehurst three days later on May 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tanaka, Shelley | title=The Disaster of the Hindenberg: The Last Flight of the Greatest Airship Ever Built | page=48 | date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although carrying only half its full capacity of passengers (36 of 70) and crewmen (61, including 21 crewman trainees) for the accident flight, the ''Hindenburg'' was fully booked for its return flight. Many of the passengers with tickets to Germany were planning to attend the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] in London the following week.
[[File:Hindenburg over New York 1937.jpg|thumb|The ''Hindenburg'' over Manhattan, New York on May 6, 1937, shortly before its demise]]
The airship was hours behind schedule when it passed over Boston on the morning of May 6, and its landing at Lakehurst was expected to be further delayed because of afternoon [[thunderstorm]]s. Advised of the poor weather conditions at Lakehurst, Captain [[Max Pruss]] charted a course over [[Manhattan Island]], causing a public spectacle as people rushed out into the street to catch sight of the airship. After passing over the field at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Captain Pruss took passengers on a tour over the seasides of [[New Jersey]] while waiting for the weather to clear. After finally being notified at 6:22&amp;nbsp;p.m. that the storms had passed, Pruss directed the airship back to Lakehurst to make its landing almost half a day late. However, as this would leave much less time than anticipated to service and prepare the airship for its scheduled departure back to Europe, the public was informed that they would not be permitted at the mooring location or be able to visit aboard the ''Hindenburg'' during its stay in port.

===Landing timeline===
Around 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, at an altitude of {{convert|650|ft}}, the ''Hindenburg'' made its final approach to the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. This was to be a high landing, known as a ''flying moor'', because the airship would drop its landing ropes and mooring cable at a high altitude, and then be winched down to the [[mooring mast]]. This type of landing maneuver would reduce the number of ground crewmen, but would require more time. Although the high landing was a common procedure for American airships, the ''Hindenburg'' had only performed this maneuver a few times in 1936 while landing in Lakehurst.

At 7:09, the airship made a sharp full-speed left turn to the west around the landing field because the ground crew was not ready. At 7:11, it turned back toward the landing field and valved gas. All engines idled ahead and the airship began to slow. Captain Pruss ordered aft engines full astern at 7:14 while at an altitude of {{convert|394|ft|m|abbr=on}}, to try to brake the airship.

At 7:17, the wind shifted direction from east to southwest, and Captain Pruss ordered a second sharp turn starboard, making an s-shaped flightpath towards the mooring mast. At 7:18, as the final turn progressed, Pruss ordered 300, 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;kg of water ballast in successive drops because the airship was stern-heavy. The forward gas cells were also valved. As these measures failed to bring the ship in trim, six men (three of whom were killed in the accident){{refn|Per an annotated ship's diagram submitted to the U.S. Commerce Department's Board of Inquiry into the disaster, there were 12 men in the forward section of the ship at the time of the fire: Ludwig Felber (apprentice "elevatorman"); Alfred Bernhardt (helmsman); Erich Spehl (rigger); Ernst Huchel (senior elevatorman); Rudi Bialas (engine mechanic); Alfred Stöckle (engine mechanic); Fritz Flackus (cook's assistant); Richard Müller (cook's assistant); Ludwig Knorr (chief rigger); Josef Leibrecht (electrician); Kurt Bauer (elevatorman); and Alfred Grözinger (cook). Of these, only Leibrecht, Bauer and Grözinger survived the fire. Examination of the unedited Board of Inquiry testimony transcripts (stored at the National Archives), combined with examination of the Landing Stations chart on page 212 of Harold Dick and Douglas Robinson's book ''Graf Zeppelin and Hindenburg'', indicates that the six off-watch men who were sent forward to trim the ship were Bialas, Stöckle, Flackus, Müller, Leibrecht and Grözinger. The other men were at their previously assigned landing stations. More recent research found that was not Bialas, but his colleague Walter Banholzer, who was sent forward along with the other five men.|group=Note}} were then sent to the bow to trim the airship.

At 7:21, while the ''Hindenburg'' was at an altitude of {{convert|295|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the mooring lines were dropped from the bow; the starboard line was dropped first, followed by the port line. The port line was overtightened as it was connected to the post of the ground winch. The starboard line had still not been connected. A light rain began to fall as the ground crew grabbed the mooring lines.

At 7:25&amp;nbsp;p.m., a few witnesses saw the fabric ahead of the upper fin flutter as if gas was leaking.&lt;ref name=Blackwell2007p311&gt;Blackwell 2007, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Others reported seeing a dim blue flame&amp;nbsp;– possibly [[static electricity]], or [[St Elmo's Fire]]&amp;nbsp;–  moments before the fire on top and in the back of the ship near the point where the flames first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann and Harkin 2002, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other eyewitness testimonies suggest that the first flame appeared on the port side just ahead of the port fin, and was followed by flames which burned on top. [[Charles Emery Rosendahl|Commander Rosendahl]] testified to the flames in front of the upper fin being "mushroom-shaped". One witness on the starboard side reported a fire beginning lower and behind the rudder on that side. On board, people heard a muffled detonation and those in the front of the ship felt a shock as the port trail rope overtightened; the officers in the control car initially thought the shock was caused by a broken rope.

===Disaster===
[[File:hindenburg burning.jpg|thumb|''Hindenburg'' begins to fall seconds after catching fire]]
At 7:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, the ''Hindenburg'' caught fire and quickly became engulfed in flames. Eyewitness statements disagree as to where the fire initially broke out; several witnesses on the port side saw yellow-red flames first jump forward of the top fin near the ventilation shaft of cells 4 and 5.&lt;ref name="Blackwell2007p311" /&gt; Other witnesses on the port side noted the fire actually began just ahead of the horizontal port fin, only then followed by flames in front of the upper fin. One, with views of the starboard side, saw flames beginning lower and farther aft, near cell 1 behind the rudders. Inside the airship, helmsman Helmut Lau, who was stationed in the lower fin, testified hearing a muffled detonation and looked up to see a bright reflection on the front bulkhead of gas cell 4, which "suddenly disappeared by the heat". As other gas cells started to catch fire, the fire spread more to the starboard side and the ship dropped rapidly. Although there were cameramen from four newsreel teams and at least one spectator known to be filming the landing, as well as numerous photographers at the scene, no known footage or photograph exists of the moment the fire started.

Wherever they started, the flames quickly spread forward first consuming cells 1 to 9, and the rear end of the structure imploded. Almost instantly, two tanks (it is disputed whether they contained water or fuel) burst out of the hull as a result of the shock of the blast. [[Buoyancy]] was lost on the stern of the ship, and the bow lurched upwards while the ship's back broke; the falling stern stayed in trim.

[[File:DLZ129 spar.jpg|thumb|A fire-damaged 9" [[duralumin]] cross brace from the frame of the ''Hindenburg'' salvaged in May 1937 from the crash site at [[Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst|NAS Lakehurst]], NJ. ]]
As the tail of the ''Hindenburg'' crashed into the ground, a burst of flame came out of the nose, killing nine of the 12 crew members in the bow. There was still gas in the bow section of the ship, so it continued to point upward as the stern collapsed down. The cell behind the passenger decks ignited as the side collapsed inward, and the scarlet lettering reading "Hindenburg" was erased by flames as the bow descended. The airship's gondola wheel touched the ground, causing the bow to bounce up slightly as one final gas cell burned away. At this point, most of the fabric on the hull had also burned away and the bow finally crashed to the ground. Although the [[hydrogen]] had finished burning, the ''Hindenburg'''s [[diesel fuel]] burned for several more hours.
[[File:Hindenburg disaster, 1937.jpg|thumb|The fire bursts out of the nose of the ''Hindenburg'', photographed by Murray Becker.]]
The time that it took from the first signs of disaster to the bow crashing to the ground is often reported as 32, 34 or 37 seconds. Since none of the newsreel cameras were filming the airship when the fire started, the time of the start can only be estimated from various eyewitness accounts and the duration of the longest footage of the crash. One careful analysis by [[NASA]]'s [[Addison Bain]] gives the flame front spread rate across the fabric skin as about {{convert|49|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at some points during the crash, which would have resulted in a total destruction time of about 16 seconds (245m/15&amp;nbsp;m/s=16.3 s).

Some of the [[duralumin]] framework of the airship was salvaged and shipped back to Germany, where it was recycled and used in the construction of military aircraft for the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', as were the frames of the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'']] and [[LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II|LZ 130 ''Graf Zeppelin II'']] when both were scrapped in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney 1972, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days after the disaster, an official board of inquiry was set up at Lakehurst to investigate the cause of the fire. The investigation by the US Commerce was headed by Colonel South Trimble Jr, while Dr. Hugo Eckener led the German commission.

===News coverage===
{{See also|Hindenburg disaster newsreel footage}}
[[File:1937-05-10 Special Release - Zeppelin Explodes Scores Dead.ogv|thumb|Universal Newsreel|thumbtime=6]]
The disaster was well-documented because of the combination of many news crews having been on site at the time of the airship exploding and the significant extent of [[newsreel]] coverage and photographs, as well as [[Herbert Morrison (announcer)|Herbert Morrison]]'s eyewitness radio report for station [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in [[Chicago]], which was broadcast the next day. Heavy publicity about the first transatlantic passenger flight of the year by Zeppelin to the [[United States]] attracted a large number of journalists to the landing. (The airship had already made one round trip from Germany to [[Vargas Era|Brazil]] that year.)

Morrison's broadcast remains one of the most famous in history. Parts of it were later dubbed onto [[newsreel]] footage, giving the impression that the words and film were recorded together. His plaintive, "Oh, the humanity!" has been widely used in popular culture.

The iconic newsreel footage was shot by four newsreel camera teams: [[Pathé News]], [[Movietone News]], Hearst [[News of the Day]], and [[Paramount News]]. Al Gold of Fox Movietone News later received a Presidential Citation for his work.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, Raymond "The American Newsreel: A Complete History, 1911–1967, 2d ed." Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Co., (2006) pp. 142–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"How Did They Ever Get That" Photoplay Magazine, October 1937, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most widely circulated photographs of the disaster (see photo at top of article), showing the airship crashing with the mooring mast in the foreground, was photographed by Sam Shere of International News Photos. When the fire started he did not have the time to put the camera to his eye and shot the photo "from the hip". Murray Becker of the Associated Press photographed the fire engulfing the airship while it was still on even keel using his 4 x 5 [[Speed Graphic]] camera. His next photograph (see right), shows flames bursting out of the nose as the bow telescoped upwards.  In addition to professional photographers, spectators also photographed the crash.  They were stationed in the spectators' area near Hangar No. 1, and had a side-rear view of the airship. Customs broker Arthur Cofod Jr. and 16 year-old Foo Chu both had Leica cameras with high speed film, allowing them to take a larger number of photographs than the press photographers. Nine of Cofod's photographs were printed in ''LIFE'' magazine &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 17, 1937|title=Life on the American Newsfront: Amateur Photographs of the Hindenburg's Last Landing|url=|journal=LIFE Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chu's photographs were shown in the ''New York Daily News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projektlz129.blogspot.ca/2015/05/hindenburg-crash-foo-chus-amateur-photo.html|title=Hindenburg Crash – Foo Chu’s Amateur Photo Sequence|last=Russell|first=Patrick|date=May 6, 2015|website=Projekt LZ 129|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hindenburg disaster (1).jpg|left|thumb|The Hindenburg disaster, photographed by Arthur Cofod Jr.]]

The newsreels and photographs, along with Morrison's passionate reporting shattered public and industry faith in airships and marked the end of the giant passenger-carrying airships. Also contributing to the downfall of Zeppelins was the arrival of international passenger air travel and [[Pan American Airlines]]. Heavier-than-air aircraft regularly crossed the Atlantic and Pacific much faster than the 130&amp;nbsp;km/h (80&amp;nbsp;mph) speed of the ''Hindenburg''. The one advantage that the ''Hindenburg'' had over such aircraft was the comfort that she afforded her passengers, much like that of an ocean liner.

In contrast to the media coverage in the United States, media coverage of the disaster in Germany was more subdued. Although some photographs of the disaster were published in newspapers, the newsreel footage was not released until after World War II. Additionally, German victims were memorialized in a similar manner to fallen war heroes, and grassroots movements to fund zeppelin construction (as the case with the ''LZ4'' crash in 1908)  was expressly forbidden by the [[Government of Nazi Germany|Nazi government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Airships in International Affairs, 1890–1940|last=Duggan|first=John|last2=Meyer|first2=Henry Cord|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2001|isbn=0333751280|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been a [[List of airship accidents|series of other airship accidents]] prior to the ''Hindenburg'' fire; many were caused by bad weather. The ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' had flown safely for more than 1.6 million kilometers (1.0 million miles), including the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe by an airship. The Zeppelin company's promotions had prominently featured the fact that no passenger had been injured on any of its airships.

===Death toll===
Despite the sheer ferocity of the colossal fire, many of the crew members and passengers survived, but the majority of them were severely burned. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crewmen, 13 passengers and 22 aircrewmen died. Also killed was one ground crewman, the civilian linesman Allen Hagaman.&lt;ref name=Hagaman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Patrick|title=Allen Orlando Hagaman (1885–1937)|url=http://projektlz129.blogspot.ca/2014/05/allen-orlando-hagaman-1885-1937.html|website=Projekt LZ129|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten passengers&lt;ref&gt;Birger Brinck, Burtis John Dolan, Edward Douglas, Emma Pannes, Ernst Rudolf Anders, Fritz Erdmann, Hermann Doehner, John Pannes, Moritz Feibusch, Otto Reichold.&lt;/ref&gt; and 16 crewmen&lt;ref&gt;Albert Holderried, mechanic; Alfred Stockle, engine mechanic; Alois Reisacher, mechanic; Emilie Imohof, hostess; Ernst Huchel, senior elevatorman; Ernst Schlapp, electrician; Franz Eichelmann, radio operator; Fritz Flackus, cook's assistant; Alfred Hitchcok, chief mechanic; Ludwig Knorr, chief rigger; Max Schulze, bar steward; Richard Muller, assistant chef; Robert Moser, mechanic; Rudi Bialas, engine mechanic; Wilhelm Dimmler, engineering officer; Willi Scheef, mechanic.&lt;/ref&gt; died in the crash or in the fire. The majority of the victims were burnt to death, while others died jumping from the airship at an excessive height, or as a consequence of either smoke inhalation or falling debris.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the 26 people listed as immediate victims may have actually died immediately after the disaster in the air station's infirmary, but being identified only after some time, along with the corpses of the victims who died in the fire.&lt;/ref&gt; Six other crewmembers,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Bernhardt, helmsman; Erich Spehl, rigger; Ernst August Lehmann, director of flight operations; Ludwig Felber, apprentice elevatorman; Walter Banholzer, engine mechanic; Willy Speck, chief radio operator.&lt;/ref&gt; three passengers&lt;ref&gt;Erich Knocher, Irene Doehner, and Otto Ernst.&lt;/ref&gt; and Allen Hagaman died in the following hours or days, mostly as a consequence of the burns.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Patrick B.

The majority of the crewmen who died were up inside the ship's hull, where they either did not have a clear escape route or else were close to the bow of the ship, which hung burning in the air for too long for most of them to escape death. Most of the crew in the bow died in the fire, although at least one was filmed falling from the bow to his death. Most of the passengers who died were trapped in the starboard side of the passenger deck. Not only was the wind blowing the fire toward the starboard side, but the ship also rolled slightly to starboard as it settled to the ground, with much of the upper hull on that part of the ship collapsing outboard of the starboard observation windows, thus cutting off the escape of many of the passengers on that side.{{refn|This is corroborated by the official testimonies and later recollections of several passenger survivors from the starboard passenger deck, including Nelson Morris, Leonhard Adelt and his wife Gertrud, Hans-Hugo Witt, Rolf von Heidenstam, and George Hirschfeld.|group=Note}} To make matters worse, the sliding door leading from the starboard passenger area to the central foyer and the gangway stairs (through which rescuers led a number of passengers to safety) jammed shut during the crash, further trapping those passengers on the starboard side.{{refn|Board of Inquiry testimony of Hans-Hugo Witt, a ''Luftwaffe'' military observer traveling as a passenger.|group=Note}} Nonetheless, some did manage to escape from the starboard passenger decks. By contrast, all but a few of the passengers on the port side of the ship survived the fire, with some of them escaping virtually unscathed. Although the most famous airship disaster, it was not the worst. Just over twice as many  (73 of 76 on board)  had perished when the helium-filled U.S. Navy scout airship {{USS|Akron}} crashed at sea off the New Jersey coast four years earlier on April 4, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grossman|first1=Dan|title=The Hindenburg Disaster|url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/disaster|website=Airships.net|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the survivors were saved by luck. Werner Franz, the 14-year-old cabin boy, was initially dazed by the 
realization that the ship was on fire. As he stood near the officer's mess where he had been putting away dishes moments before, a water tank holding ballast above him burst open, and he was suddenly soaked. This snapped him back to his senses, as he later told interviewers, and also put out the fire around him. He then made his way to a nearby hatch through which the kitchen had been loaded with provisions before the flight, and dropped through it just as the forward part of the ship was briefly rebounding into the air. He began to run toward the starboard side, but stopped and turned around and ran the other way, because the flames were being pushed by the wind in that direction. He made it clear of the wreck with no injuries, and was the last surviving crew member when he died at the age of 92 on August 13, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Bruce.

When the control car crashed onto the ground, most of the officers leapt through the windows, but became separated. First Officer Captain Albert Sammt found Captain Max Pruss trying to re-enter the wreckage to look for survivors. Pruss's face was badly burned, and he required months of hospitalization and reconstructive surgery, but he survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facesofthehindenburg.blogspot.com/2008/12/captain-max-pruss.html|title=Faces of the Hindenburg Captain Max Pruss|date=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[Ernst Lehmann]] escaped the crash with burns to his head and arms and severe burns across most of his back. He died at a nearby hospital the next day.&lt;ref name="Faces Lehmann"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Patrock|title=Captain Ernst A.

When passenger Joseph Späh, a [[vaudeville]] comic acrobat, saw the first sign of trouble he smashed the window with his movie camera with which he had been filming the landing (the film survived the disaster). As the ship neared the ground he lowered himself out the window and hung onto the window ledge, letting go when the ship was perhaps 20 feet above the ground. His acrobat's instincts kicked in, and Späh kept his feet under him and attempted to do a safety roll when he landed. He injured his ankle nonetheless, and was dazedly crawling away when a member of the ground crew came up, slung the diminutive Späh under one arm, and ran him clear of the fire.{{refn|Subsequent on-camera interviews with Späh and his letter to the Board of Inquiry corroborate this version of his escape. One or two more dramatic versions of his escape have appeared over the years, neither of which are supported by the newsreels of the crash, one of which shows a fairly close view of the portside passenger windows as passengers and stewards begin to drop through them.|group=Note}}

Of the 12 crewmen in the bow of the airship, only three survived. Four of these 12 men were standing on the mooring shelf, a platform up at the very tip of the bow from which the forwardmost landing ropes and the steel mooring cable were released to the ground crew, and which was directly at the forward end of the axial walkway and just ahead of gas cell #16. The rest were standing either along the lower keel walkway ahead of the control car, or else on platforms beside the stairway leading up the curve of the bow to the mooring shelf. During the fire the bow hung in the air at roughly a 45-degree angle and flames shot forward through the axial walkway, bursting through the bow (and the bow gas cells) like a blowtorch. The three men from the forward section who survived (elevatorman Kurt Bauer, cook Alfred Grözinger, and electrician Josef Leibrecht) were those furthest aft of the bow, and two of them (Bauer and Grözinger) happened to be standing near two large triangular air vents, through which cool air was being drawn by the fire. Neither of these men sustained more than superficial burns.{{refn|Board of Inquiry testimonies of Kurt Bauer and Alfred Grözinger|group=Note}} Most of the men standing along the bow stairway either fell aft into the fire, or tried to leap from the ship when it was still too high in the air. Three of the four men standing on the mooring shelf inside the very tip of the bow were actually taken from the wreck alive, though one (Erich Spehl, a rigger) died shortly afterwards in the Air Station's infirmary, and the other two (helmsman Alfred Bernhard and apprentice elevatorman Ludwig Felber) were reported by newspapers to have initially survived the fire, and then to subsequently have died at area hospitals during the night or early the following morning.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
 
Hydrogen fires are notable for being less destructive to immediate surroundings than [[gasoline]] explosions because of the buoyancy of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which causes heat of combustion to be released upwards more than circumferentially as the leaked mass ascends in the atmosphere; hydrogen fires are more survivable than fires of gasoline or wood.&lt;ref&gt;Werthmüller, Andreas.

==Cause of ignition==

===Sabotage hypothesis===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
At the time of the disaster, sabotage was commonly put forward as the cause of the fire, initially by [[Hugo Eckener]], former head of the Zeppelin Company and the "old man" of German airships. In initial reports, before inspecting the accident, Eckener mentioned the possibility of a shot as the cause of the disaster, because of threatening letters that had been received, but did not rule out other causes.&lt;ref name="press3"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19370507&amp;id=HFwbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-UwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1413,1872238 "Zeppelin plot a possibility, Eckener says."] ''The Pittsburgh Press,'' May 7, 1937, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckener later publicly endorsed the static spark hypothesis. At the time on a lecture tour in Austria, he was awakened at about 2:30 in the morning (8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Lakehurst time, or approximately an hour after the crash) by the ringing of his bedside telephone. It was a Berlin representative of the ''New York Times'' with news that the ''Hindenburg'' "exploded yesterday evening at 7&amp;nbsp;p.m. {{sic}} above the airfield at Lakehurst." By the time he left the hotel the next morning to travel to Berlin for a briefing on the disaster, the only answer that he had for the reporters waiting outside to question him was that based on what he knew, the ''Hindenburg'' had "exploded over the airfield"; sabotage might be a possibility. However, as he learned more about the disaster, particularly that the airship had burned rather than actually "exploded", he grew more and more convinced that static discharge, rather than sabotage, was the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Eckener, Hugo. ''My Zeppelins''. New York: Putnam &amp; Co. Ltd., 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}

Commander Charles Rosendahl, commander of the Naval Air Station at Lakehurst and the man in overall charge of the ground-based portion of the ''Hindenburg's'' landing maneuver, also came to believe that the ''Hindenburg'' had been sabotaged. He laid out a general case for sabotage in his 1938 book ''What About the Airship?'',&lt;ref&gt;Rosendahl, Commander C.E. ''What About The Airship?''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} which was as much an extended argument for the further development of the rigid airship as it was an historical overview of the airship concept.

Another proponent of the sabotage hypothesis was Max Pruss, commander of the ''Hindenburg'' throughout the airship's career. Pruss flew on nearly every flight of the ''Graf Zeppelin'' until the ''Hindenburg'' was ready. In a 1960 interview conducted by Kenneth Leish for Columbia University's Oral History Research Office, Pruss said early [[Airship|dirigible]] travel was safe, and therefore he strongly believed that sabotage was to blame. He stated that on trips to South America, which was a popular destination for German tourists, both airships passed through thunderstorms and were struck by lightning but remained unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fathom.com/feature/121907/ "Max Pruss."] ''Columbia University's Oral History Research Office interview.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608084511/http://www.fathom.com/feature/121907/ |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most members of the crew refused to believe that one of them would commit an act of sabotage, insisting only a passenger could have destroyed the airship. A suspect favored by Commander Rosendahl, Captain Pruss, and others among the ''Hindenburg's'' crew, was passenger Joseph Späh, a German acrobat who survived the fire. He brought with him a dog, a German shepherd named Ulla, as a surprise for his children (Ulla did not survive the crash). He reportedly made a number of unaccompanied visits to feed his dog, who was being kept in a freight room near the stern of the ship. Those who suspected Späh based their suspicions primarily on those trips into the ship's interior to feed his dog, that according to some of the stewards Späh had told anti-Nazi jokes during the flight, recollections by stewards that Späh had seemed agitated by the repeated delays in landing, and that he was an acrobat who could conceivably climb into the airship's rigging to plant a bomb.

In 1962, A. A. Hoehling published ''Who Destroyed the Hindenburg?'', in which he rejected all theories but sabotage, and named a crew member as the suspect. Eric Spehl, a rigger on the Hindenburg who died in the fire, was named as the saboteur. Ten years later, Michael MacDonald Mooney's book ''The Hindenburg'', which was based heavily on Hoehling's sabotage hypothesis, also identified Spehl as the saboteur; Mooney's book was made into the movie ''[[The Hindenburg (film)|The Hindenburg]],'' the producers of which were sued by Hoehling for plagiarism; but Hoehling lost because he had presented his sabotage hypothesis as historical fact, and one cannot claim ownership of historical facts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uconn.edu/homes/swilf/ip/cases/hoehling.htm "Hoehling."]''law.uconn.edu.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924180228/http://www.law.uconn.edu/homes/swilf/ip/cases/hoehling.htm |date=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoehling claimed the following in naming Spehl as the culprit:
* Spehl's girlfriend had communist beliefs and anti-Nazi connections.
* The fire's origin was near the catwalk running through Gas Cell 4, which was an area of the ship generally off-limits to anyone other than Spehl and his fellow riggers.
* Hoehling's claim that Chief Steward Heinrich Kubis told him the Chief Rigger Ludwig Knorr noticed damage of Cell 4 shortly before the disaster.
* Rumors that the [[Gestapo]] had investigated Spehl's possible involvement in 1938.
* Spehl's interest in amateur photography, making him familiar with flashbulbs that could have served as an igniter.
* The discovery by representatives of the NYPD Bomb Squad of a substance that was later determined to likely be "the insoluble residue from the depolarizing element of a small, dry battery." (Hoehling postulated that a dry cell battery could have powered a flashbulb in an incendiary device.)
* The discovery by FBI Agents of a yellow substance on the valve cap of the airship between cells 4 and 5 where the fire was first reported. Although initially suspected to be [[sulfur]], which can ignite hydrogen, it was later determined that the residue was actually from a [[fire extinguisher]].
* A flash or a bright reflection in gas cell 4, that crew members near the lower fin had seen just before the fire.

Hoehling's (and later Mooney's) hypothesis goes on to say that it is unlikely that Spehl wanted to kill people, and that he intended the airship to burn after the landing. However, with the ship already over 12 hours late, Spehl was unable to find an excuse to reset the timer on his bomb.

It has been suggested that [[Adolf Hitler]] himself ordered the ''Hindenburg'' to be destroyed in retaliation for Eckener's anti-Nazi opinions.&lt;ref name=Natgeo&gt;National Geographic 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of Hoehling's book, most airship historians, including Dr. Douglas Robinson, have dismissed Hoehling's sabotage hypothesis because no solid evidence was ever presented to support it. No pieces of a bomb were ever discovered (and there is no evidence in existing documentation that the sample collected from the wreckage, and determined to be residue from a dry cell battery, was found anywhere near the stern of the airship), and on closer examination, the evidence against Spehl and his girlfriend turned out to be rather weak. Additionally, it is unlikely that Rigger Knorr would not remain at cell 4 to further assess the purported damage claimed by Kubis. In an interview with the TV show [[Secrets &amp; Mysteries]], Hoehling himself asserted it was only his theory and also suggested a short-circuit could be another potential cause of the fire. Additionally, Mooney's book has been criticized as having numerous fictional elements, and it has been suggested that the plot was created for the then-upcoming 1975 film.&lt;ref name=Spehl&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Patrick|title=Erich Spehl|url=http://facesofthehindenburg.blogspot.ca/2009/04/erich-spehl.html|website=Faces of the Hindenburg|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mooney alleges that three ''Luftwaffe'' officers were aboard to investigate a potential bomb threat, there is no evidence they were on board to do so, and military observers were present on previous flights to study navigational techniques and weather forecasting practices of the airship crew.&lt;ref name=Erdmann&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Patrick|title=Colonel Fritz Erdmann|url=http://facesofthehindenburg.blogspot.ca/search/label/Col.%20Fritz%20Erdmann|website=Faces of the Hindenburg|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, opponents of the sabotage hypothesis argued that only speculation supported sabotage as a cause of the fire, and no credible evidence of sabotage was produced at any of the formal hearings. Eric Spehl died in the fire and was therefore unable to refute the accusations that surfaced a quarter of a century later. The FBI investigated Joseph Späh and reported finding no evidence of Späh having any connection to a sabotage plot. According to his wife, Evelyn, Späh was quite upset over the accusations&amp;nbsp;– she later recalled that her husband was outside their home cleaning windows when he first learned that he was suspected of sabotaging the ''Hindenburg,'' and was so shocked by the news that he almost fell off the ladder on which he was standing.&lt;ref name=Moondance&gt;''Hindenburg Disaster: Probable Cause''. Moondance Films (2001), also known as ''Revealed... The Hindenburg Mystery'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the German nor the American investigation endorsed any of the sabotage theories. Proponents of the sabotage hypothesis argue that any finding of sabotage would have been an embarrassment for the Nazi regime, and they speculate that such a finding by the German investigation was suppressed for political reasons. However, it has also been suggested that numerous crewmen subscribed to the sabotage hypothesis because they refused to accept any flaws with the airship or pilot error.&lt;ref name="Untold"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/hindenburg-the-untold-story/0/130593 "Hindenburg: The Untold Story."] ''Smithsonian Channel'', broadcast date: May 6, 2007 6.00 pm. Retrieved: April 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some more sensational newspapers claimed that a [[Luger pistol]] with one round fired was found among the wreckage and speculated that a person on board committed suicide or shot the airship.&lt;ref name="Archbold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toland 1972, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence suggesting an attempted suicide or official report confirming the presence of a Luger pistol.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Initially, before inspecting the scene himself, Eckener mentioned the possibility for a shot as the cause of the disaster, because of threatening letters they received.&lt;ref name="press3" /&gt; At the German enquiry Eckener discounted a shot&amp;nbsp;– among many possibilities&amp;nbsp;– as the cause as nearly impossible and highly improbable.&lt;ref name="press4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2293&amp;dat=19370523&amp;id=Jd4mAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WgIGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4447,5557565|title=Eckener gropes to solve blast|date=May 23, 1937|pages=6|author=The Sunday Morning Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Static spark hypothesis===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}
Hugo Eckener argued that the fire was started by an [[electric spark]] which was caused by a buildup of [[static electricity]] on the airship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/html/e3-about.html "Secrets of the Dead: PBS television documentary on the Hindenburg disaster."] ''pbs.org.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The spark ignited hydrogen on the outer skin.

Proponents of the static spark hypothesis point out that the airship's skin was not constructed in a way that allowed its charge to be distributed evenly throughout the craft. The skin was separated from the [[duralumin]] frame by non-conductive [[ramie]] cords which had been lightly covered in metal to improve conductivity but not very effectively, allowing a large difference in [[potential]] to form between the skin and the frame.

In order to make up for the delay of more than 12 hours in its transatlantic flight, the ''Hindenburg'' passed through a weather [[front (meteorology)|front]] of high humidity and high electrical charge. Although the mooring lines were not wet when they first hit the ground and ignition took place four minutes after, Eckener theorised that they may have become wet in these four minutes. When the ropes, which were connected to the frame, became wet, they would have grounded the frame but not the skin. This would have caused a sudden potential difference between skin and frame (and the airship itself with the overlying air masses) and would have set off an electrical discharge&amp;nbsp;– a spark. Seeking the quickest way to ground, the spark would have jumped from the skin onto the metal framework, igniting the leaking hydrogen.

In his 1964 book ''LZ-129 Hindenburg,'' Zeppelin historian Dr. Douglas Robinson points out that although ignition of free hydrogen by static discharge had become a favored hypothesis, no such discharge was seen by any of the witnesses who testified at the official investigation into the accident back in 1937. He goes on to write:

{{quote|But within the past year, I have located an observer, Professor Mark Heald of Princeton, New Jersey, who undoubtedly saw [[St. Elmo's Fire]] flickering along the airship's back a good minute before the fire broke out. Standing outside the main gate to the Naval Air Station, he watched, together with his wife and son, as the Zeppelin approached the mast and dropped her bow lines. A minute thereafter, by Mr. Heald's estimation, he first noticed a dim "blue flame" flickering along the backbone girder about one-quarter the length abaft the bow to the tail. There was time for him to remark to his wife, "Oh, heavens, the thing is afire," for her to reply, "Where?" and for him to answer, "Up along the top ridge"&amp;nbsp;– before there was a big burst of flaming hydrogen from a point he estimated to be about one-third the ship's length from the stern.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Douglas. ''LZ-129 Hindenburg.'' New York: Arco Publishing Co, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike other witnesses to the fire whose view of the port side of the ship had the light of the setting sun behind the ship, Professor Heald's view of the starboard side of the ship against a backdrop of the darkening eastern sky would have made the dim blue light of a static discharge on the top of the ship more easily visible.

Harold G. Dick was Goodyear Zeppelin's representative with Luftschiffbau Zeppelin during the mid-1930s. He flew on test flights of the ''Hindenburg'' and its sister ship, the ''Graf Zeppelin II.'' He also flew on numerous flights in the original ''Graf Zeppelin'' and ten round-trip crossings of the north and south Atlantic in the ''Hindenburg.'' In his book ''The Golden Age of the Great Passenger Airships Graf Zeppelin &amp; Hindenburg,'' he observes:

{{quote|There are two items not in common knowledge. When the outer cover of the LZ 130 [the ''Graf Zeppelin II''] was to be applied, the lacing cord was prestretched and run through dope as before but the dope for the LZ 130 contained [[graphite]] to make it conductive. This would hardly have been necessary if the static discharge hypothesis were mere cover-up. The use of graphite dope was not publicized and I doubt if its use was widely known at the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin.}}

In addition to Dick's observations is the fact that during the ''Graf Zeppelin II's'' early test flights, measurements were taken of the airship's static charge. It is clear that Dr. Ludwig Durr and the other engineers at Luftschiffbau Zeppelin took the static discharge hypothesis seriously and considered the insulation of the fabric from the frame to be a design flaw in the ''Hindenburg.'' Thus, the German Inquiry concluded that the insulation of the outer covering caused a spark to jump onto a nearby piece of metal, thereby igniting the hydrogen. In lab experiments, using the ''Hindenburg's'' outer covering and a static ignition, hydrogen was able to be ignited but with the covering of the LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin,'' nothing happened. These findings were not well-publicized and covered up, perhaps to avoid embarrassment of such an engineering flaw in the face of the Third Reich.

A variant of the static spark hypothesis, presented by [[Addison Bain]], is that a spark between inadequately grounded fabric cover segments of the ''Hindenburg'' itself started the fire, and that the spark had ignited the "highly flammable" outer skin. The ''Hindenburg'' had a cotton skin covered with a finish known as [[aircraft dope|"dope"]]. It is a common term for a [[plasticizer|plasticised]] [[lacquer]] that provides stiffness, protection, and a lightweight, airtight seal to woven fabrics. In its liquid forms, dope is highly flammable, but the flammability of dry dope depends upon its base constituents, with, for example, butyrate dope being far less flammable than [[cellulose nitrate]]. Proponents of this hypothesis claim that when the mooring line touched the ground, a resulting spark could have ignited the dope in the skin.

An episode of the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[Curiosity (TV series)|Curiosity]]'' entitled "What Destroyed the ''Hindenburg''?", which first aired in December 2012, investigated both the static spark theory and St. Elmo's Fire, as well as sabotage by bomb. The team, led by British aeronautical engineer [[Jem Stansfield]] and American airship historian Dan Grossman, concluded that the ignition took place above the hydrogen vent just forward of where Mark Heald saw St. Elmo's Fire, and that the ignited hydrogen was channelled down the vent where it created a more explosive detonation described by crew member Helmut Lau. "What Destroyed the ''Hindenburg''?" was aired as a standalone documentary on the UK's [[Channel 4]] in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2287608/Hindenburg-mystery-solved-76-years-historic-catastrophe-static-electricity-caused-airship-explode.html|title=Hindenburg mystery solved 76 years after historic catastrophe: static electricity caused the airship to explode|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=March 3, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lightning hypothesis===
A. J. Dessler, former director of the Space Science Laboratory at [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and a critic of the incendiary paint hypothesis (see below), favors a much simpler explanation for the conflagration: [[lightning]]. Like many other aircraft, the ''Hindenburg'' had been struck by lightning several times in its years of operation. This does not normally ignite a fire in hydrogen-filled airships due to the lack of oxygen. However, airship fires have been observed when lightning strikes the vehicle as it vents hydrogen as ballast in preparation for landing. The vented hydrogen mixes with the oxygen in the atmosphere, creating a [[Flammability limit|combustible mixture]]. The ''Hindenburg'' was venting hydrogen at the time of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~dziadeck/zf/LZ129fire.pdf|title=The Hindenburg Hydrogen Fire: Fatal Flaws in the Addison Bain Incendiary-Paint Theory|last=Dessler|first=A.

===Engine failure hypothesis===
On the 70th anniversary of the accident, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' carried an article&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/20070506_The_real_cause_of_the_Hindenburg_disaster_.html "The real cause of the Hindenburg disaster?"] ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', May 6, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134810/http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/20070506_The_real_cause_of_the_Hindenburg_disaster_.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with yet another hypothesis, based on an interview of ground crew member Robert Buchanan. He had been a young man on the crew manning the mooring lines.

As the airship was approaching the mooring mast, he noted that one of the engines, thrown into reverse for a hard turn, backfired, and a shower of sparks was emitted. After being interviewed by Addison Bain, Buchanan believed that the airship's outer skin was ignited by engine sparks. Another ground crewman, Robert Shaw, saw a blue ring behind the tail fin and had also seen sparks coming out of the engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balloonlife.com/publications/balloon_life/9801/0112/hindenburg0112.pdf "Hindenburg."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527192220/http://www.balloonlife.com/publications/balloon_life/9801/0112/hindenburg0112.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }} ''balloonlife.com.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw believed that the blue ring he saw was leaking hydrogen which was ignited by the engine sparks.

Dr. Eckener rejected the idea that hydrogen could have been ignited by an engine [[Back-fire|backfire]], postulating that the hydrogen could not have been ignited by any exhaust because the temperature is too low to ignite the hydrogen. The ignition temperature for hydrogen is {{convert|500|C}}, but the sparks from the exhaust only reach {{convert|250|C}}.&lt;ref name=Untold/&gt; The Zeppelin Company also carried out extensive tests and hydrogen had never ignited. Additionally, the fire was first seen at the top of the airship, not near the bottom of the hull.

==Fire's initial fuel==
Most current analyses of the fire assume ignition due to some form of electricity as the cause. However, there is still much controversy over whether the fabric skin of the airship, or the hydrogen used for buoyancy, was the initial fuel for the resulting fire.

===Incendiary paint hypothesis===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}
The incendiary paint theory (IPT) was proposed in 1996 by retired NASA scientist [[Addison Bain]], stating that the [[Aircraft dope|doping]] compound of the airship was the cause of the fire, and that the ''Hindenburg'' would have burned even if it were filled with helium. The hypothesis is limited to the source of ignition and to the flame front propagation, not to the source of most of the burning material, as once the fire started and spread the hydrogen clearly must have burned (although some proponents of the incendiary paint theory claim that hydrogen burned much later in the fire or that it otherwise did not contribute to the rapid spread of the fire). The incendiary paint hypothesis asserts that the major component in starting the fire and feeding its spread was the canvas skin because of the compound used on it.

Proponents of this hypothesis argue that the coatings on the fabric contained both iron oxide and aluminum-impregnated cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) which remain potentially reactive even after fully setting&lt;ref&gt;Bain, A., &amp; Van Vorst, W.D. (1999). The Hindenburg tragedy revisited: The fatal flaw found. ''International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 24''(5), 399-403. doi: 10.1016/S0360-3199(98)00176-1&lt;/ref&gt;. Iron oxide and aluminum can be used as components of [[solid rocket]] fuel or [[thermite]]. For example, the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Propellant|propellant for the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster]] includes both "aluminum (fuel, 16%), (and) iron oxide (a [[catalyst]], 0.4%)". The coating applied to the Hindenburg's covering did not have a sufficient quantity of any material capable of acting as an oxidizer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/disaster/myths#rocket "Discussion of dope applied to Hindenburg covering."] ''airships.net.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a necessary component of rocket fuel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/count2.htm "Description of rocket fuel."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728130300/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/count2.htm |date=July 28, 2009 }} ''nasa.gov.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; however, oxygen is also available from the air.

Bain received permission from the German government to search their archives and discovered evidence that, during the Nazi regime, German scientists concluded the dope on the ''Hindenburg's'' fabric skin was the cause of the conflagration. Bain interviewed the wife of the investigation's lead scientist Max Dieckmann, and she stated that her husband had told her about the conclusion and instructed her to tell no one, presumably because it would have embarrassed the Nazi government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/flash/hindenburgframe.html "What Happened to the Hindenburg?"] ''[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'', June 15, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Dieckmann concluded that it was the poor conductivity, not the flammability of the doping compound, that led to the ignition of hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Archbold&gt;Archbold 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, Otto Beyersdorff, an independent investigator hired by the Zeppelin Company, asserted that the outer skin itself was flammable. In several television shows, Bain attempted to prove the flammability of the fabric by igniting it with a [[Spark gap|Jacob's Ladder]]. Although Bain's fabric ignited, critics argue that Bain had to correctly position the fabric parallel to a machine with a continuous electric current inconsistent with atmospheric conditions. In response to this criticism, the IPT therefore postulates that a spark would need to be parallel to the surface, and that "panel-to-panel arcing" occurs, where the spark moves between panels of paint isolated from each other. A.J. Dessler, a critic of the IPT, points out a static spark does not have sufficient energy to ignite the doping compound, and that the insulating properties of the doping compound prevents a parallel spark path through it. Additionally, Dessler contends that the skin would also be electrically conductive in the wet and damp conditions before the fire.&lt;ref name=Dessler&gt;{{cite web| last1=Dessler| first1=A.J.|title=The Hindenburg Hydrogen Fire: Fatal Flaws in the Addison Bain Incendiary-Paint Theory| url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~dziadeck/zf/LZ129fire.pdf| accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also argue that port side witnesses on the field, as well as crew members stationed in the stern, saw a glow inside Cell 4 before any fire broke out of the skin, indicating that the fire began inside the airship or that after the hydrogen ignited, the invisible fire fed on the gas cell material. Newsreel footage clearly shows that the fire was burning inside the structure.&lt;ref name=Moondance/&gt;

Proponents of the paint hypothesis claim that the glow is actually the fire igniting on the starboard side, as seen by some other witnesses. From two eyewitness statements, Bain asserts the fire began near cell 1 behind the tail fins and spread forward before it was seen by witnesses on the port side. However, photographs of the early stages of the fire show the gas cells of the ''Hindenburg's'' entire aft section fully aflame, and no glow is seen through the areas where the fabric is still intact. Burning gas spewing upward from the top of the airship was causing low pressure inside, allowing atmospheric pressure to press the skin inwards.

[[File:Hindenburg wreckage 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|The wreckage of the ''Hindenburg'' the morning after the crash. Some fabric remains on the tail fins.]]

Occasionally the ''Hindenburg'''s varnish is incorrectly identified as, or stated being similar to, [[cellulose nitrate]] which, like most nitrates, burns very readily.&lt;ref name="Natgeo"/&gt; Instead, the cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) used to seal the zeppelin's skin is rated by the plastics industry as combustible but nonflammable. That is, it will burn if placed within a fire but is not readily ignited. It should also be noted that not all fabric on the Hindenburg burned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/disaster/myths#flammable-cover "Flammability of Hindenburg Covering."] ''airships.net.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fabric on the port and starboard tail fins was not completely consumed. That the fabric not near the hydrogen fire did not burn is not consistent with the "explosive" dope hypothesis.

The TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'' explored the incendiary paint hypothesis. Their findings indicated that the aluminum and iron oxide ratios in the Hindenburg's skin, while certainly flammable, were not enough on their own to destroy the zeppelin. Had the skin contained enough metal to produce pure thermite, the ''Hindenburg'' would have been too heavy to fly. The MythBusters team also discovered that the ''Hindenburg'''s coated skin had a higher ignition temperature than that of untreated material, and that it would initially burn slowly, but that after some time the fire would begin to accelerate considerably with some indication of a thermite reaction. From this, they concluded that those arguing against the incendiary paint theory may have been wrong about the airship's skin not forming thermite due to the compounds being separated in different layers. Despite this, the skin alone would burn too slowly to account for the rapid spread of the fire, as it would have taken four times the speed for the ship to burn. The MythBusters concluded that the paint may have contributed to the disaster, but that it was not the sole reason for such rapid combustion.&lt;ref name="MythBusters"&gt;[http://mythbustersresults.com/episode70 "MythBusters Episode 70."] ''Discovery Channel'', first broadcast, January 10, 2007. Retrieved: May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen hypothesis===
The theory that hydrogen was ignited by a static spark is the most widely accepted theory as determined by the official crash investigations. Offering support for the hypothesis that there was some sort of hydrogen leak prior to the fire is that the airship remained stern-heavy before landing, despite efforts to put the airship back in trim. This could have been caused by a leak of the gas, which started mixing with air, potentially creating a form of [[oxyhydrogen]] and filling up the space between the skin and the cells.&lt;ref name=Untold/&gt; A ground crew member, R.H. Ward, reported seeing the fabric cover of the upper port side of the airship fluttering, "as if gas was rising and escaping" from the cell. He said that the fire began there, but that no other disturbance occurred at the time when the fabric fluttered.&lt;ref name=Untold/&gt; Another man on the top of the mooring mast had also reported seeing a flutter in the fabric as well.&lt;ref name="botting"&gt;Botting 2001, pp. 249&amp;nbsp;–251.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures that show the fire burning along straight lines that coincide with the boundaries of gas cells suggest that the fire was not burning along the skin, which was continuous. Crew members stationed in the stern reported actually seeing the cells burning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepgoing.org/issue20_giant/thirtytwo_seconds.html "Thirty-two Seconds."] ''keepgoing.org.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main theories have been postulated as to how gas could have leaked. Dr. Eckener believed a snapped bracing wire had torn a gas cell open (see below), while others suggest that a maneuvering or automatic gas valve was stuck open and gas from cell 4 leaked through. During the airship's first flight to Rio, a gas cell was nearly emptied when an automatic valve was stuck open, and gas had to be transferred from other cells to maintain an even keel.&lt;ref name=Moondance/&gt; However, no other valve failures were reported during the ship's flight history, and on the final approach there was no indication in instruments that a valve had stuck open.&lt;ref&gt;Dick &amp; Robinson, 1985, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although proponents of the IPT claim that the hydrogen was odorized with garlic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-really-sparked-the-hindenburg-disaster-85867521/ smithsonianmag.com] paragraph&amp;nbsp;6;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Retrieved&amp;nbsp;October 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindenburg'';&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;by Marc Tyler Nobleman;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;page&amp;nbsp;38&lt;/ref&gt; it would have been detectable only in the area of a leak. Once the fire was underway, more powerful smells would have masked any garlic odor. There were no reports of anyone smelling garlic during the flight, but no official documents have been found to prove that the hydrogen was even odorized.

Opponents of this hypothesis note that the fire was reported as burning bright red, while pure hydrogen burns blue if it is visible at all,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1538-3881/130/2/626/204674.web.pdf?request-id=617e0292-9bc5-491d-a260-97437c319901 "Theory."] ''iop.com.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; although there were many other materials that were consumed by the fire which could have changed its hue.

Some of the airshipmen at the time, including Captain Pruss, asserted that the stern heaviness was normal, since aerodynamic pressure would push rainwater towards the stern of the airship. The stern heaviness was also noticed minutes before the airship made its sharp turns for its approach (ruling out the snapped wire theory as the cause of the stern heaviness), and some crew members stated that it was corrected as the ship stopped (after sending six men into the bow section of the ship). Additionally, the gas cells of the ship were not pressurized, and a leak would not cause the fluttering of the outer cover, which was not seen until seconds before the fire. However, reports of the amount of rain the ship had collected have been inconsistent. Several witnesses testified that there was no rain as the ship approached until a light rain fell minutes before the fire, while several crew members stated that before the approach the ship did encounter heavy rain. Albert Sammt, the ship's first officer who oversaw the measures to correct the stern-heaviness, initially attributed to fuel consumption and sending crewmen to their landing stations in the stern, though years later, he would assert that a leak of hydrogen had occurred. On its final approach the rainwater may have evaporated and may not completely account for the observed stern-heaviness, as the airship should have been in good trim ten minutes after passing through rain. Dr. Eckener noted that the stern heaviness was significant enough that 70,000 kilogram·meter (506,391 foot-pounds) of trimming was needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/disaster/commerce-department-report "Commerce Department Inquiry."] ''airships.net.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puncture hypothesis====
Although Captain Pruss believed that the ''Hindenburg'' could withstand tight turns without significant damage, proponents of the puncture hypothesis, including Hugo Eckener, question the airship's structural integrity after being repeatedly stressed over its flight record.

The airship did not receive much in the way of routine inspections even though there was evidence of at least some damage on previous flights. It is not known whether that damage was properly repaired or even whether all the failures had been found. During the ship's first return flight from Rio, ''Hindenburg'' had once lost an engine and almost drifted over Africa, where it could have crashed. Afterwards, Dr. Eckener ordered section chiefs to inspect the airship during flight. However, the complexity of the airship's structure would make it virtually impossible to detect all weaknesses in the structure. In March 1936, the ''Hindenburg'' and the ''Graf Zeppelin'' made [[LZ 129 Hindenburg#Die Deutschlandfahrt|three-day flights]] to drop leaflets and broadcast speeches via [[loudspeaker]]. Before the airship's takeoff on March 26, 1936, Ernst Lehmann chose to launch the ''Hindenburg'' with the wind blowing from behind the airship, instead of into the wind as per standard procedure. During the takeoff, the airship's tail struck the ground, and part of the lower fin was broken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/exhibits/haldick/images/hd-fins1.JPG "Exhibits."] ''specialcollections.wichita.edu.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although that damage was repaired, the force of the impact may have caused internal damage. Only six days before the disaster, it was planned to make the ''Hindenburg'' have a hook on her hull to carry aircraft in a similar way to what the US Navy did with the [[USS Akron|USS ''Akron'']] and the [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|USS ''Macon'']]. However, the trials were unsuccessful as the biplane hit the ''Hindenburg''{{'}}s trapeze several times. The structure of the airship may have been further affected by this incident.

Newsreels, as well as the map of the landing approach, show the ''Hindenburg'' made several sharp turns, first towards port and then starboard, just before the accident. Proponents posit that either of these turns could have weakened the structure near the vertical fins, causing a bracing wire to snap and puncture at least one of the internal gas cells. Additionally, some of the bracing wires may have even been substandard. One bracing wire tested after the crash broke at a mere 70% of its rated load.&lt;ref name=Moondance/&gt; A punctured cell would have freed hydrogen into the air and could have been ignited by a static discharge (see above), or it is also possible that the broken bracing wire struck a girder, causing sparks to ignite hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Moondance/&gt; When the fire started, people on board the airship reported hearing a muffled detonation, but outside, a ground crew member on the starboard side reported hearing a crack. Some speculate the sound was from a bracing wire snapping.&lt;ref name=Moondance/&gt;

Eckener concluded that the puncture hypothesis, due to pilot error, was the most likely explanation for the disaster. He held Captains Pruss and Lehmann, and Charles Rosendahl responsible for what he viewed as a rushed landing procedure with the airship badly out of trim under poor weather conditions. Pruss had made the sharp turn under Lehmann's pressure; while Rosendahl called the airship in for landing, believing the conditions were suitable. Eckener noted that a smaller storm front followed the thunderstorm front, creating conditions suitable for static sparks.

During the US inquiry, Eckener testified that he believed that the fire was caused by the ignition of hydrogen by a static spark:

{{quote|The ship proceeded in a sharp turn to approach for its landing. That generates extremely high tension in the after part of the ship, and especially in the center sections close to the stabilizing fins which are braced by shear wires. I can imagine that one of these shear wires parted and caused a rent in a gas cell. If we will assume this further, then what happened subsequently can be fitted in to what observers have testified to here: Gas escaped from the torn cell upwards and filled up the space between the outer cover and the cells in the rear part of the ship, and then this quantity of gas which we have assumed in the hypothesis was ignited by a static spark.

Under these conditions, naturally, the gas accumulated between the gas cells and the outer cover must have been a very rich gas. That means it was not an explosive mixture of hydrogen, but more of a pure hydrogen. The loss of gas must have been appreciable.

I would like to insert here, because the necessary trimming moments to keep the ship on an even keel were appreciable, and everything apparently happened in the last five or six minutes, that is, during the sharp turn preceding the landing maneuver, that therefore there must have been a rich gas mixture up there, or possibly pure gas, and such gas does not burn in the form of an explosion. It burns off slowly, particularly because it was in an enclosed space between outer cover and gas cells, and only in the moment when gas cells are burned by the burning off of this gas, then the gas escapes in greater volume, and then the explosions can occur, which have been reported to us at a later stage of the accident by so many witnesses.

The rest it is not necessary for me to explain, and in conclusion, I would like to state this appears to me to be a possible explanation, based on weighing all of the testimony that I have heard so far.&lt;ref name="Das verstehe"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Russell| first1=Patrick| title=Das ich nicht…|url=http://projektlz129.blogspot.ca/2013/01/das-verstehe-ich-nicht.html|website=Projekt LZ129|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the apparent stern heaviness during the landing approach was noticed thirty minutes before the landing approach, indicating that a gas leak resulting from a sharp turn did not cause the initial stern heaviness.&lt;ref name="Das verstehe"/&gt;

===Fuel leak===
The 2001 documentary ''Hindenburg Disaster: Probable Cause'' suggested that 16-year-old Bobby Rutan, who claimed that he had smelled "gasoline" when he was standing below the ''Hindenburg'''s aft port engine, had detected a diesel fuel leak. During the investigation, Commander Charles Rosendahl dismissed the boy's report. The day before the disaster, a fuel pump had broken during the flight, but the chief engineer testified that the pump had been replaced. The resulting vapor of a diesel leak, in addition to the engines being overheated, would have been highly flammable and could have self-combusted.

However, the documentary makes numerous mistakes into assuming that the fire began in the keel. First, it implies that the crewmen in the lower fin had seen the fire start in the keel and that Hans Freund and Helmut Lau looked towards the front of the airship to see the fire, when Freund was actually looking rearward when the fire started. Most witnesses on the ground reported seeing flames at the top of the ship, but the only location where a fuel leak could have a potential ignition source is the engines. Additionally, while investigators in the documentary suggest it is possible for a fire in the keel to go unnoticed until it breaks the top section, other investigators such as [[Greg Feith]] consider it unlikely because the only point diesel comes into contact with a hot surface is the engines.

==Rate of flame propagation==

[[File:Hindenburg fabric.jpg|thumb|Fabric of the ''Hindenburg'', held in the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]]]
Regardless of the source of ignition or the initial fuel for the fire, there remains the question of what caused the rapid spread of flames along the length of the airship. Here again the debate has centered on the fabric covering of the airship and the hydrogen used for buoyancy.

Proponents of both the incendiary paint hypothesis and the hydrogen hypothesis agree that the fabric coatings were probably responsible for the rapid spread of the fire. The combustion of hydrogen is not usually visible to the human eye in daylight, because most of its radiation is not in the visible portion of the spectrum but rather ultraviolet. Thus what can be seen burning in the photographs cannot be hydrogen. However, black-and-white photographic film of the era had a different light sensitivity spectrum than the human eye, and was sensitive farther out into the infrared and ultraviolet regions than the human eye. And while hydrogen tends to burn invisibly, the materials around it, if combustible, would change the color of the fire.

The motion picture films show the fire spreading downward along the skin of the airship. While fires generally tend to burn upward, especially including hydrogen fires, the enormous radiant heat from the blaze would have quickly spread fire over the entire surface of the airship, thus apparently explaining the downward propagation of the flames. Falling, burning debris would also appear as downward streaks of fire.

Those skeptical of the incendiary paint hypothesis cite recent technical papers which claim that even if the airship had been coated with actual rocket fuel, it would have taken many hours to burn&amp;nbsp;– not the 32 to 37 seconds that it actually took.&lt;ref name=LZ129fire&gt;[http://spot.colorado.edu/~dziadeck/zf/LZ129fire.htm "Hindenburg fire theories."] ''spot.colorado.edu.'' Retrieved: September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern experiments that recreated the fabric and coating materials of the ''Hindenburg'' seem to discredit the incendiary fabric hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sas.org/tcs/weeklyIssues/2004-12-17/project1/index.html "Citizen Scientist on the flammable coating (IPT)."] ''sas.org.''

J. Dessler, D.E. Overs, W.H. Appleby?}} However, these claims do not agree with the results the [[MythBusters]] achieved on the ''Hindenburg'' special of their TV show.

The most conclusive{{Clarify|date=March 2009|Who concludes this? Dessler? Appleby? Cite.}} proof against the fabric hypothesis is in the photographs of the actual accident as well as the many airships which were not doped with aluminum powder and still exploded violently. When a single gas cell explodes, it creates a shock wave and heat. The shock wave tends to rip nearby bags which then explode themselves. In the case of the Ahlhorn disaster on January 5, 1918, explosions of airships in one hangar caused the explosions of others in three adjoining hangars, wiping out all five Zeppelins at the base.{{Clarify|date=March 2009|explode in the sense of overpressure rupturing the bags or some hydrogen leaking and forming a combustible mixture with air and then igniting? Suspect the latter. Cite would be useful to clarify this.}}

The photos of the ''Hindenburg'' disaster clearly show that after the cells in the aft section of the airship exploded and the combustion products were vented out the top of the airship, the fabric on the rear section was still largely intact, and air pressure from the outside was acting upon it, caving the sides of the airship inward due to the reduction of pressure caused by the venting of combustion gases out the top.

The loss of lift at the rear caused the airship to nose up suddenly and the back to break in half (the airship was still in one piece), at that time the primary mode for the fire to spread was along the axial gangway which acted as a chimney, conducting fire which burst out the nose as the airship's tail touched the ground, and as seen in one of the most famous pictures of the disaster.

'''''Ireland's Own''''' is a family magazine published weekly in Ireland. It specialises in lightweight content, traditional stories, and uncontroversial family content, including puzzles and recipes. It was launched on 26 November 1902 by John M. Walshe of People Newspapers, and originally cost just [[penny|1d]].

For the first half of 2007, the magazine had an average circulation of 40,905, according to the [[Audited Bureau of Circulations]]. The People Newspaper Group (which also included the ''Wicklow People'', the ''Wexford People'' and the ''Waterford People'') is now owned by the Irish media giant [[Independent News and Media]].

==Original aim==
The magazine was designed to offer "wholesome Irish Catholic fare" to challenge the appearance of British newspapers in Ireland like the ''[[News of the World]]'' (which were denounced as "scandal-sheets" that lowered the moral tone of late 19th century/early 20th century Ireland). The magazine's appearance coincided with a broad stressing of Irish identity as a reaction to British imports. Among the other examples were the creation of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] to promote Gaelic games and to halt the growth of soccer and [[rugby football|rugby]] (1880s), the appearance of the [[Gaelic League]] to promote the [[Irish language]] (1893), and the growth in the ''Irish-Ireland'' movement reflected in the creation of the [[Abbey Theatre]] to promote Irish arts (1904) and the creation by [[Arthur Griffith]] in 1904 of [[Cumann na nGaedheal (1900)|Cumann na nGaedheal]] to protest at the visit of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and his queen, [[Mary of Teck]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffith's Cumann na nGaedheal was a different party to the later ''Cumann na nGaedheal'' formed by pro-Treaty Sinn Féin TDs under [[W. T. Cosgrave]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ireland's Own'' saw its role as projecting an image of Ireland free from "alien" influence, hence a content free from anything perceived as "scandalous" or "anti-Catholic". A critic described such magazines as offering "a formula for 'healthy fireside reading' combining patriotism, pietism and national news with a minimum of foreign coverage or intellectual speculation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070609195715/http://library.wit.ie/Journals/HistoricalIrishJournals/ Historical Irish Journals.]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of such a magazine is traced back to the series of pietistic family magazines launched by [[James Duffy (Irish publisher)|James Duffy]] in the mid-19th century.

==Editor's description==
Its current editor, Phil Murphy, on the occasion of its centenary, described it with the words:

:"Ireland's Own and contention are complete strangers to each other – and that would be a deliberate policy. It's not 'Dublin 4'&lt;ref&gt;"Dublin 4" is a trendy, upper-middle class liberal part of south Dublin. ''Dublin 4'' is often used as a code word to describe "trendy liberals".&lt;/ref&gt; and trendy 'liberalism' and that aspect of Ireland, which is pretty shallow and skin deep anyway. We're slightly old-fashioned in our ways, for which we make no apologies. We attract a lot of our readership from people who probably have a yearning for what they consider to be the 'good old days, when things were better' as they see them. We do not take a hard-faced attitude towards our journalism or our magazine. We accept the fact that people do have a yearning for the old days, and nostalgia is a significant part of the magazine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnvalley.ie/irelandsown/irelandsown.html Ireland's Own.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518010140/http://www.finnvalley.ie/irelandsown/irelandsown.html |date=18 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In terms of overall design and content, ''Ireland's Own'' is regularly described by critics as "outdated" and "old-fashioned", with its reliance on nostalgia that rarely reflects present realities. Its look and content has barely changed since the 1950s. Its demise has long been predicted, given its disproportionate appeal to the two segments presumed weakest to guarantee its future: elderly readers in rural Ireland, and those who have low disposable incomes. However, it remains a constant presence in the publishing market. One explanation for this is that the magazine taps into the younger nostalgia market who grew up with ''Ireland's Own'' and have a desire for familiarity and to rediscover a simpler Ireland in the face of monumental changes in Ireland. [citation needed]

==Examples of content==
Its Christmas 2003 edition contained a series of articles, both fact and fiction, on such topics as "Gathering the Holly",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnvalley.ie/christmas/irelandsown/holly.html "Gathering the Holly"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720220540/http://www.finnvalley.ie/christmas/irelandsown/holly.html |date=20 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Who is Father Christmas?",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnvalley.ie/christmas/irelandsown/santa.html "Who is Father Christmas?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711121613/http://www.finnvalley.ie/christmas/irelandsown/santa.html |date=11 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Christmas Fairy"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnvalley.ie/christmas/irelandsown/fairy.html "The Christmas Fairy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720220310/http://www.finnvalley.ie/christmas/irelandsown/fairy.html |date=20 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Christmas Long Ago".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnvalley.ie/christmas/irelandsown/longago.html "Christmas Long Ago"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404114935/http://www.finnvalley.ie/christmas/irelandsown/longago.html |date=4 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published in Wexford==

In contrast to most Irish magazines, ''Ireland's Own'' is not Dublin-based but is edited in [[Wexford]].

''Ireland's Own'' celebrated its centenary in 2002.

'''James Arthur Hogue''' (born October 22, 1959) is an American [[impostor]] who most famously entered [[Princeton University]] by posing as a [[self-taught]] [[orphan]].

==Early life==
Hogue was raised in a working-class family in [[Kansas City, Kansas]] and graduated from [[Kansas City, Kansas Public Schools|Washington High School]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/04/nyregion/tracing-a-devious-path-to-the-ivy-league.html|title=Tracing a Devious Path to the Ivy League|last=Farber|first=James Barron With M. A.|date=1991-03-04|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogue attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in the 1980s but left without a degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also attended community college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/rt-radio/the-almost-too-strange-to-be-true-story-of-alexi-santana|title=The Almost Too Strange to be True Story of Alexi Santana|date=2008-09-22|newspaper=Runner's World|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, he was a student at the [[University of Wyoming]] before dropping out when he didn't perform well on the cross country team.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Documentary-probes-life-of-Mystery-Boy-2863784.php|title=Documentary probes life of 'Mystery Boy' / Filmmaker and ex-classmate analyzes drifter who duped Palo Alto High, Princeton|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910301&amp;slug=1268952|title=Business {{!}} Marathon Hoax: Track Star, Liar, Ex-Princeton Student In Jail {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal career==
In September 1985, Hogue, now 25 years old, [[Identity theft|stole the identity]] of a deceased infant and enrolled as a student at [[Palo Alto High School]] as '''Jay Mitchell Huntsman''', a 16-year-old orphan from [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/09/03/the-runner|title=The Runner|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, 1985, Hogue entered the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] Invitational Cross Country Meet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hogue ran far ahead of the field and won the race, but did not report to the officials' table, arousing suspicion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jason Cole, a reporter covering the event for the now-defunct ''Peninsula Times-Tribune,'' uncovered Hogue's identity theft, and Hogue left town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2006/03/25/the-con-artist-next-door/|title=The con artist next door – The Denver Post|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Hogue applied to [[Princeton University]], using the alias '''Alexi Indris-Santana''', a self-taught orphan from [[Utah]], where he was then living. Hogue's application materials claimed that he had lived outdoors in the [[Grand Canyon]], raising sheep and reading philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thetab.com/us/princeton/2016/03/01/unbelievable-story-imposter-came-princeton-2710|title=The unbelievable story of the imposter who came to Princeton|date=2016-03-01|newspaper=The Tab Princeton|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton invited Hogue to attend Princeton in the fall of 1988, but he deferred admission for one year, telling Princeton his mother was dying.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In reality, Hogue had pled guilty to possessing stolen bicycle equipment, and had been sentenced to five years in prison.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Hogue served nine months before being paroled from [[Utah State Prison]] in March 1989.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Having also received a financial aid award from Princeton, he immediately left for Princeton, in violation of the terms of his parole.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For the next two years, he lived as Santana, was a member of the track team, and was admitted into the [[Ivy Club]], one of Princeton's most exclusive [[Eating clubs at Princeton University|eating clubs]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His real identity was exposed when Renee Pacheco, a former classmate from his days as "Jay Huntsman" at Palo Alto High School, recognized him. She contacted reporter Jason Cole, who exposed Hogue a second time.  On February 26, 1991, Hogue was arrested in class and charged with forgery, theft, and falsifying records.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/25/nyregion/princeton-student-gets-jail-sentence.html|title=Princeton 'Student' Gets Jail Sentence|date=1992-10-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1992, Hogue pled guilty to third-degree theft for taking more than $22,000 in scholarship money and was sentenced to nine months in jail.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hogue served 134 days in jail.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/us/bogus-princeton-student-held-in-new-crime.html|title=Bogus Princeton Student Held in New Crime|date=1993-05-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in 1992, Hogue was briefly employed by the [[Harvard Mineralogical Museum]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] as a part-time cataloguer.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; At the time, Hogue was taking a course in mineralogy at the [[Harvard Extension School]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In April 1993, the museum discovered that gems, mineral specimens, microscopes, and other items worth $50,000 had gone missing, and suspected Hogue as the result of a tip.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On May 10, 1993, police arrested Hogue in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] and charged him with grand larceny.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; On May 26, 1993, Harvard police returned to Hogue's Somerville apartment and recovered $600 in electronic equipment reported stolen from a New Jersey electronics firm where Hogue worked in the summer of 1992.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1993/6/7/student-indicted-for-stealing-gems-from/|title=Student Indicted for Stealing Gems From Harvard Museum {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1993, Hogue was charged with two counts of larceny and one count of receiving stolen property by the [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] District Attorney's Office.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Hogue's theft was one of the largest in the history of the [[Harvard University Police Department]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The '''Jeltoqsan''' ({{lang-kk|Желтоқсан көтерілісі, Jeltoqsan kóterilisi}}) or '''"December" of 1986''' were riots that took place in Alma-Ata (present-day [[Almaty]]), [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]], in response to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s dismissal of [[Dinmukhamed Kunaev]], the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and an [[ethnic Kazakh]], and his appointment of [[Gennady Kolbin]], an outsider from the [[Russian SFSR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a782006656&amp;db=all "Nationalist riots in Kazakhstan: Violent nationalist riots erupted in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, on 17 and 18 December 1986"], Informaworld&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HIMETHNICITY"/&gt; Some sources cite Kolbin's ethnicity as [[Russians|Russian]], others as [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]].

The events lasted from 16 December until 19 December 1986. The protests began in the morning of 17 December, as a [[student demonstration]] attracted thousands of participants as they marched through Brezhnev Square (present-day [[Republic Square, Almaty|Republic Square]]) across to the CPK Central Committee building. As the result, internal troops and [[OMON]] forces entered the city,&lt;ref name="TROOPS"/&gt; violence erupted throughout the city.&lt;ref name="HIMETHNICITY"&gt;"[http://countrystudies.us/kazakstan/6.htm Reform and Nationalist Conflict]", [[U.S. Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TROOPS"&gt;"[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0712F7395A0C728EDDAF0894D1484D81 Soviet Troops Enforce Kazakh City Curfew]", ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMPOSED"&gt;"[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50712FC3B5B0C7A8DDDAB0994DE484D81 Soviet Nationalities: Russians Rule, Others Fume]", ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEGREGATION"&gt;"[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40713FF35540C728DDDA80894DF484D81 Origins of Kazakhstan Rioting Are Described]", ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATIONWIDE"&gt;[http://inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&amp;id=147080 1986 "December events showed people’s striving for independence"] KAZINFORM&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, protests spread to [[Shymkent]], [[Taldykorgan]], and [[Karaganda]].

== Protests ==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
{{History of Kazakhstan}}
The primary reason for the peaceful student demonstrations that started in the early morning of 17 December was the dismissal of the long-serving First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]], [[Dinmukhamed Kunaev]] (1964–1986) on 16 December and the appointment of [[Gennady Kolbin]] (1986–1989) as the First Secretary. Kolbin was unpopular as he had not previously lived or worked in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=gorb330&gt;Mikhael Gorbachev, ''Memoirs'', New York: Doubleday, 1996, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gorbachev's memoir, after the 27th Party Congress of December 1986, he met with Kunaev and discussed Kunaev's resignation. Kunaev expressed his desire to retire and proposed the appointment of someone without previous links to the Kazakh Communist Party in his place to stop advancement of [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] (later and also the current [[President of Kazakhstan]]) in the party ranks.&lt;ref name=gorb330/&gt; Kunaev, in his own book, said that Gorbachev never asked him about his replacement and only said "a good comrade will be 'sent'".&lt;ref&gt;Dinmukhamed Kunaev, ''O Moem Vremeni'', Almaty: Dauir, 1992, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonstrations started in the morning of 17 December 1986 as 200–300 students gathered in front of the Central Committee building on Brezhnev Square to protest the decision of the CPSU to appoint Kolbin rather than an ethnic Kazakh. The number of protesters increased to 1,000–5,000 as students from universities and institutes joined the crowd on Brezhnev Square.

[[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] reported, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A group of students, incited by nationalistic elements, last evening and today took to the streets of Alma-Ata expressing disapproval of the decisions of the recent plenary meeting. Hooligans, parasites and other antisocial persons made use of this situation and resorted to unlawful actions against representatives of law and order. They set fire to a food store and to private cars and insulted townspeople.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meetings were held at factories, schools, and other institutions to condemn these actions.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-18/news/mn-4155_1 ''Los Angeles Times''], 18 December 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnesses reported that the rioters were given vodka, narcotics and leaflets, indicating that the riots were not spontaneous. They disagreed with the characterization of the riot as related to nationalism or independence; they said it was a protest over Gorbachev's appointing an outsider to head the state.&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Chronicle'', December 23, 1986; Retrieved March 27, 2010, from ProQuest Newsstand, .&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response, the CPK Central Committee ordered troops from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, ''druzhiniki'' (volunteers), cadets, policemen, and the KGB to cordon the square and videotape the participants. The situation escalated around 5&amp;nbsp;p.m., as troops were ordered to disperse the protesters. Clashes between the security forces and the demonstrators continued throughout the night in the square and in different parts of Almaty.

The second day, protests turned into civil unrest as clashes in the streets, universities and dormitories between troops, volunteers, and militia units, and Kazakh students turned into a wide-scale armed confrontation. The clashes were not controlled until the third day. The Almaty events were followed by smaller protests and demonstrations in [[Shymkent]], [[Pavlodar]], [[Karaganda]] and [[Taldykorgan]].

== Estimates of protesters ==
Estimates of the number of protesters vary.

Initial reports from Moscow said that about 200 people were involved in the riots. Later reports from the Kazakh SSR authorities estimated that the riots drew 3,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;"Soviet Riots Worse Than First Reported", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', February 19, 1987. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Other estimates are of at least 30,000 to 40,000 protesters, with 5,000 arrested and jailed, and an unknown number of casualties.&lt;ref name="MARKED"/&gt; Jeltoqsan leaders say over 60,000 [[Kazakhs]] participated in the protests nationwide.&lt;ref name="BLAME"&gt;"[http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/kazakhstan/hypermail/200204/0053.shtml "Jeltoqsan" Movement blames leader of Kazakh Communists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904060721/http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/kazakhstan/hypermail/200204/0053.shtml |date=2008-09-04 }}", EurasiaNet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MARKED"&gt;"[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/1B31A151-3C74-413B-909C-876E8F3020A9.html Kazakhstan: Jeltoqsan Protest Marked 20 Years Later]", ''RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Karaganda]], 54 students were excluded from the universities, and five students were prosecuted.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Loss of life ==
According to the Kazakh SSR government, there were two deaths during the riots, including a volunteer police worker and a student. Both of them had died from blows to the head. About 100 others were detained and several others were sentenced to terms in labor camps.&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Chronicle''. Retrieved March 27, 2010, from ProQuest Newsstand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources cited by the US [[Library of Congress]] claim that at least 200 people died or were [[summary execution|summarily executed]] soon after. Some accounts estimate [[casualties]] at more than 1,000.&lt;ref name="HIMETHNICITY"/&gt;

The writer [[Mukhtar Shakhanov]] claimed that a [[KGB]] officer testified that 168 protesters were killed.&lt;ref name="DEATHCOUNT_1"/&gt; The Jeltoqsan events formed the basis of the main platforms of the Azat and Alash political parties and the Jeltoqsan movement that developed in independent Kazakhstan.

Kazakh students [[Kayrat Ryskulbekov]] and [[Lazat Asanova]] were among the victims.&lt;ref name="HIMETHNICITY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEATHCOUNT_1"&gt;"[http://origin.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2006Dec16/0,4675,KazakhstanRememberingDecember,00.html  Kazakhs remembering uprising of 1986]", Associated Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Separation from the USSR ==
In the [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|March 1991 referendum]], the population of Kazakhstan overwhelmingly voted to preserve the Soviet system. 89.2% of the population participated in the vote, of which 94.1% voted in favour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qmN95fFocsMC&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=89.2+kazakhstan+march+1991&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=89.2%20kazakhstan%20march%201991&amp;f=false Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Volume 4| publisher= Europa Publications Limited]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|aborted coup d'état in August]], the Soviet government in Kazakhstan declared independence on 16 December 1991 as the last republic to declare independence. The Soviet Union itself disintegrated ten days later.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

On 18 September 2006, the Dawn of Liberty monument, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of Jeltoqsan, was opened with a solemn ceremony in Almaty. In the 21st century, Jeltoqsan has come to be regarded as the symbol of Kazakhstan's struggle for independence. The monument has three-parts: two [[Pylon (architecture)|pylons]] of intricate shapes symbolizing the breach and conflict of past and future, the explosion of the nation's consciousness and downfall of ideological canons, and the triumph of liberty and independence of the state.&lt;ref name="ceremony"&gt;"[http://inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&amp;id=144658 The Head of the State unveiled a monument in Almaty]", ''KAZINFORM''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aspiration"&gt;"[http://inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&amp;id=147080 1986 December events showed people's striving for independence]", ''KAZINFORM''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dinmukhamed Kunaev]] died in 1993 at the age of 82. An avenue and an institute in Almaty were named after him, as well as an avenue in the city centre of [[Astana]], designated as the capital in 1997.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Kalpataru Day''' also called '''Kalpataru Diwas''' or '''Kalpataru Utsav''' is an annual religious festival observed by monks of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] monastic order of [[Hinduism]] and lay followers of the associated [[Ramakrishna Mission]], as well as the worldwide  [[Vedanta Society|Vedanta Societies]].  These organizations follow the teachings of [[Ramakrishna]], the 19th century Indian mystic and figure in the [[Hindu Renaissance]].

The event commemorates the day on January 1, 1886, when his followers believe that Ramakrishna revealed himself to be an [[Avatar]], or God [[Incarnation|incarnate]] on earth.  It is held each January 1.  Although the observances are held in many locations, the most significant celebration takes place at Cossipore Garden House or  Udyanbati near [[Kolkata]] (then called Calcutta), present Ramakrishna Math, a branch of Ramakrishna Order, the place where Ramakrishna spent last days of his life.  It is classified as one of the "Lord's special festivals" by followers of Ramakrishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The first Kalpataru Day, January 1, 1886, was "an event of unusual consequence and meaning" in the life of Ramakrishna and his followers.&lt;ref name=Kali&gt;{{Cite book

He and his closest followers had moved to a garden house in the northern Calcutta neighbourhood of [[Cossipore#Culture|Cossipore]]. January 1 was a relatively good day for him, and he took a walk in the garden.  There, he asked one of his followers, Girish, a question he had often asked before, "Who do you say that I am?" &lt;ref name=Kali/&gt;  Girish responded that he believed that Ramakrishna was "God incarnate, come to Earth out of mercy for humankind".&lt;ref name=Kali/&gt;  Ramakrishna replied, "What more shall I say?  May you be awakened."&lt;ref name=Kali/&gt;  Ramakrishna then entered an "ecstatic state" and began touching all of his followers.  Those he touched reported experiencing a variety of new states of consciousness, including vivid visions.  For one, Vaikuntha, the visions persisted and interfered with daily life, so that he feared that he might be going insane.

One disciple, Ramachandra Dutta, explained that Ramakrishna had, in effect become [[Kalpataru]] (also called ''Kalpavriksha''), the "wish-fulfilling tree" of [[Sanskrit]] literature and Hindu mythology.&lt;ref name=Kali/&gt; Dutta named the commemoration of this mystical event "Kalpataru Day" as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

None of Ramakrishna's monastic disciples were present during this event. Most having spent the night in meditation and keeping watch over the ailing Ramakrishna were taking rest, while others took the opportunity to clean Ramakrishna's room, bedding, etc. One of these disciples was Saratchandra Chakravarty, later known as Swami Saradananda. Having witnessed the day's event from the rooftop of Ramakrishna's residence, Saradananda later commented that "Kalpataru Day" is a misnomer, since the mythological wish-fulfilling tree (Kalpataru) grants anything, good or bad, and Ramakrishna gave only what was spiritually beneficial . Saradananda rather referred to the event as "the bestowal of freedom from fear on all devotees by revealing himself" {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The '''[[United Nations Security Council]]''' ('''UNSC''') is the organ of the [[United Nations]] charged with maintaining [[peace]] and [[security]] among [[nation]]s. While other organs of the United Nations only make recommendations to member [[government]]s, the Security Council has the power to make decisions which member governments are obliged to carry out under the [[United Nations Charter]]. The decisions of the Council are known as [[United Nations Security Council Resolution]]s.

There have been three major events in Iraq's history for which the UN has passed numerous resolutions: the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], and the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] leading up to and following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3021">The '''London Six-Power Conference''' in 1948 was held between the three [[Allied-occupied Germany|Western occupation forces]] in Germany after the World War II ([[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]]) and the [[Benelux]] countries. The aim of the conference was to pave the way for Germany's participation in the international community through the creation of a democratic and federal government in the area of the U.S., British and French sectors of the country. The conference was held in two sessions, the first from 23 February to 6 March, the second from 20 April to 2 June 1948.

The reason for summoning the conference was that the [[Council of Foreign Ministers|Foreign Secretary Conference]] 15 December 1947 between the four victorious nations United States, Britain, France and the [[Soviet Union]] had ended without result in the German question. The recent Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia made it urgent for the western allies to help create a democratic (West) Germany.
The Soviet Union was not invited to the London Conference.

The conference conclusions were later called London recommendations. The three western military governors in Germany were assigned to make recommendations to the Minister Presidents in western Germany about how the new state should be established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/themen/B3GTPK,0,0,Von_den_Londoner_Empfehlungen_zum_Grundgesetz.html Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Minister Presidents should convene a constitutional Assembly (Parliamentary Council) to found a free and democratic state. The Military Governors recommendations were called the [[Herrenchiemsee convention|Frankfurt Documents]] after the place where the German Minister Presidents met.

Conditions were made that Germany should not have weapons of mass destruction and other similar weapons, and that the country should not be able to invade the Soviet occupation zone.

France voted for the merger of the three western occupation zones on conditions that the [[Saarland]] was financially merged with France and that the [[Ruhr]] area became subject to [[Occupation of Ruhr|international control]].

USSR ended its efforts in the [[Allied Control Council]] as a consequence of the London Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller|first=Roger Gene|title=To Save a City: The Berlin Airlift, 1948–1949|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-89096-967-1}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7784">'''[[Urban legend]]s''' about the fast-food chain '''[[McDonald's]]''' abound. These legends include claims about the food and allegations of discrimination by the company.

==Terrorist funding==

In the late 1980s, rumours persisted in the [[United Kingdom]] that McDonald's was covertly funding the [[Provisional IRA]] via [[NORAID]].  The source of these rumours was eventually traced to a [[CNN]] talkshow in which the company was praised for its generosity in providing funding for employees via [[Individual Retirement Account]]s, or IRAs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/30/opinion/topics-of-the-times-the-ira-you-say.html "Topics of the Times - The IRA you say"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unusual ingredients==
Large companies have been the subject of rumors that they substitute unusual or [[unethical]] substances in their products, usually to decrease costs. McDonald's is not immune to such claims.

===Earthworms===
Dating back to at least 1978, this rumor claims that McDonald's restaurants use earthworms in their hamburgers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/horrors/food/wormburg.asp Snopes: ''McSquirmies'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fooddrink/a/wormburgers.htm Urban legends: ''Worms as 'Filler' in Fast Food'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cow eyeballs===
One belief is that McDonald's uses cow eyeballs in its products, permitting it to brand them as "100% beef".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/horrors/food/coweyes.asp Snopes:''Cow Eyeballs'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] mandates that all beef by-products, including cow eyeballs, be appropriately labeled. McDonald's, has asserted that its products contain "100% pure USDA inspected beef; no additives, no fillers, no extenders." In addition, cow eyeballs are actually more expensive than the more commonly eaten cow parts, due to demand from scientific institutions for experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa103000a.htm "McEyeballs"]. Retrieved January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related claim is that McDonald's buys its meat from a company called "100% beef", making it possible for McDonald's to call beef by-products and soy products "100% beef".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/business/market/allbeef.asp Snopes:''100 % beef"]&lt;/ref&gt;. During the [[McLibel case]] it was found that once imported beef was cleared by the authorities it lost its country of origin identity and gained the status of "U.S. graded beef", so this claim may have emerged from the lack of effective country of origin labelling in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/verdict_jud1d.html |title=McLibel Verdict |author=Chief Justice Bell |date=June 19, 1997 |website= www.mcspotlight.org |access-date=June 15, 2018 |quote="Dr Nations' and Mr Shane's understanding of U.S. beef labelling laws appeared to be the same as Mr Secrett's. They thought that a problem arose because under U.S. law once imported beef was cleared by the authorities it lost its import identity and gained the status of U.S. graded beef. Thus if the meat was purchased by a broker for resale, the next or final buyer only knew the U.S. grade of the product and not necessarily the country of origin. Efforts by some U.S. environmentalists to have Congress enact a labelling law designating beef's country of origin had been unsuccessful."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutant laboratory meat===
Around  March–April, 2000, an Internet rumor spread via e-mail in [[Brazil]] claimed that McDonald's meat was actually made from a genetically modified animal maintained in a laboratory. The e-mail stated that "the few who saw it assure it is a very unpleasant sight: they have no limbs or horns, no bones (undeveloped cartilage instead), no eyes, no tail and no fur; its head is about the size of a Baseball; they are fed through tubes connected directly into their stomach".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quatrocantos.com/lendas/22_coisas_mcdonald.htm "If you think you're eating something natural"]. Portuguese article, contains the original e-mail.&lt;/ref&gt;

The e-mail carries on saying that "some irreversible health damage can be done by eating this meat, resulting in diseases who manifest themselves in a way similar to [[AIDS]], and have symptoms related to [[Alzheimer's Disease]]" and ends encouraging the reader to boycott McDonald's until it sells actual beef.  The urban legend has also been attributed to other fast-food chains and animal products, such as [[KFC]] and mutant chickens.

This rumor is a plot point of the science fiction novel ''[[The Space Merchants]]'', by [[Frederik Pohl]] (w/[[CM Kornbluth]]).

===Pig fat===
This rumor is that McDonald's uses [[lard|pig fat]] in its milkshakes, ice cream, and fried potatoes. McDonald's provides complete ingredient lists for all of its products on each of its regional websites: this includes unidentified fats within the ice cream used to make soft serve cones and sundaes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Ruth (Apr. 20, 2004).[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/19/1082357114662.html?from=storyrhs "McSalads bring back health"]. ''www.smh.com.au''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanghera, Sathnam (Dec. 16, 2005). [http://firstnews.com.ua/en/food/food.html?id=139121 "McDonald's bid to sugar its image will do it a fat lot of good"]. ''FirsTnews''.&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's Australia, however, specifically mentions that "there is definitely no lard or pig fat in the McDonald's Soft Serve."&lt;ref&gt;Top FAQs section of [http://makeupyourownmind.com.au/ http://makeupyourownmind.com.au/]. Retrieved January 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This rumor should not be confused with the fact that McDonald's has in the past used [[Tallow|beef tallow]] as its frying oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=McDonald's To Settle Suits On Beef Tallow In French Fries|date=9 March 2002|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choko pie===
There is a rumor in Australia that McDonald's Apple Pies were made of [[Chayote|choko]], not apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyripper.com/2004/12/17/we-must-never-forget-choko/ |title=‘We must never forget choko’ |date=December 17, 2004 |work=The Daily Ripper |accessdate=3 September 2010 |location=Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204111610/http://www.dailyripper.com/2004/12/17/we-must-never-forget-choko/ |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led them to emphasize the fact that real [[Granny Smith apple]]s are used in McDonald's pies.

==Racism==
{{main|Seriously McDonalds}}
Rumors in 2011 proclaimed an image shows a McDonald's sign announcing a $1.50 surcharge for African-American customers. This was proven to be a hoax.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news |title= McDonald's racist Twitter message was hoax
|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/15/earlyshow/leisure/gamesgadgetsgizmos/main20071227.shtml|publisher= [[CBS News]]|date= 15 June 2011|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drugs==
[[Fake news website]]s since 2015 have purported that McDonald's restaurants in Colorado are converting children's playgrounds to lounges for on-premises [[cannabis consumption]]. The story has been disavowed by a McDonald's spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Associated Press|title=NOT REAL NEWS: McDonald's not adding pot-smoking centers|date=April 17, 2018|url=https://apnews.com/0780444bcc40456aa31b43a6f471f0da/NOT-REAL-NEWS:-McDonald's-not-adding-pot-smoking-centers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falls had been stopped by police in over 20 states during his life but did not incur any serious criminal charges.&lt;ref name=koin /&gt;


==Death and Discovery==
After entering Saul's residence, Falls held her at gunpoint. Saul describes the struggle that ensued as follows: "When he strangled me, I grabbed my rake, and when he laid the gun down to get the rake out of my hands, I shot him...I grabbed the gun and shot behind me."&lt;ref name=koin/&gt; Falls died at the scene.

Four sets of handcuffs were retrieved from his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wtvr.com/2015/07/27/possible-serial-killer-neal-falls-gunned-down-by-victim/|title=Police: Woman saved lives by shooting possible serial killer in the head|date=2015-07-27|website=WTVR.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When police officers searched the inside of his car, they allegedly found a machete, axes, knives, a shovel, a sledgehammer, bleach, plastic trash bags, bulletproof vests, clean white socks and underwear.&lt;ref name=koin/&gt;

Police are now investigating whether Falls could possibly be connected to the murder or disappearance of ten women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowktv.com/story/29687448/video-possible-serial-killer-neal-falls-pulled-over-before-being-shot-dead-by-potential-victim|title=Possible serial killer, Neal Falls, pulled over 11 days before being shot dead by potential victim|first1=Jessie|last1=Shafer|date=August 1, 2015|website=wowktv.com|publisher=WOWK-TV|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; across eight states including [[Ohio]], [[Illinois]], and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/07/sex-worker-in-west-virginia-shoots-dead-serial-killer/|title=Sex worker in West Virginia shoots dead 'serial killer' - The Guardian Nigeria|work=The Guardian Nigeria|date=July 31, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the alleged female victims were documented escorts, most of whom advertised online.

Evidence linking Falls to multiple homicides includes an item found with dismembered bodies outside of [[Las Vegas]], where Falls is rumoured to have resided while working on the [[Hoover Dam]].&lt;ref name=killer /&gt; This is similar to an item found in his car.

The '''New Theatre Royal''' is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Grade II* listed theatre in the heart of [[Portsmouth]], England, with a capacity of 667.  The theatre building was constructed in 1854 as Landport Hall. It was converted to a theatre two years later. It was rebuilt in 1884 by [[Charles J. Phipps]] and again in 1900 by [[Frank Matcham]].

The Theatre reopened in October 2015 after a £4.7M refurbishment project.

==History==
===Dickens and early theatre in Portsmouth===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The present site was built to replace a theatre located in the High Street (now designated "old Portsmouth". The theatre features in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]''. A popular music hall, it hosted performances by [[Niccolò Paganini]] and [[Franz Liszt]] and Mr Keane the leading actor manager of the early nineteenth century. It closed in 1854 and was demolished in 1856 with a number of other buildings to allow for the construction of a military establishment, the Cambridge Barracks. This building now houses [[Portsmouth Grammar School]], a fee paying independent school. The three-arch entrance to the school occupies the location of the theatre. The city archives contain an 1824 poster/playbill of a performance of The Merchant of Venice starring Mr Keane and paintings of the exterior and interior of the theatre. These show the theatre to have been a low building with no windows and a door with a Grecian portico typical of larger houses of the era.The interior was rectangular with two tiers of boxes along each wall and standing in the pit. It would have had a smaller audience capacity than the theatre which replaced it. The illustration of the Portsmouth Theatre by Phiz in Nicholas Nickleby is true to reality though not to scale.

Extract from 'Nicholas Nickleby'

"They groped their way through a dark passage, and, descending a step or two, threaded a little maze of canvas screens and paintpots, and emerged upon the stage of the Portsmouth Theatre.
'Here we are,' said Mr Crummles.
It was not very light, but Nicholas found himself close to the first entrance on the prompt side, among bare walls, dusty scenes, mildewed clouds, heavily daubed draperies, and dirty floors. He looked about him; ceiling, pit, boxes, gallery, orchestra, fittings, and decorations of every kind,--all looked coarse, cold, gloomy, and wretched.
'Is this a theatre?' whispered Smike, in amazement; 'I thought it was a blaze of light and finery.'
'Why, so it is,' replied Nicholas, hardly less surprised; 'but not by day, Smike—not by day.' "
[[File:Facade New Theatre Royal.jpg|thumb|Newly painted]]
Nicholas Nickleby Charles Dickens 1838–39

====Did Dickens perform at the Portsmouth Theatre?====
Dickens was born in Portsmouth and visited the theatre in 1838 to research Nicholas Nickleby.  He was not only a brilliant writer but a consummate performer and would-be actor. His readings were legendary and made him a 19th-century celebrity. There is a belief that he may have performed at the Portsmouth Theatre but this is unlikely. His descriptions in Nicholas Nickleby show that in addition to the auditorium he visited the stage and back stage but his career as a public performer began some ten years into his literary success and long after its publication. He is known to have performed in Portsmouth later but at St Peter's Hall. Sadly, he did not perform at the current theatre and there is no evidence of his visiting it though it is possible.

===Henry Rutley and the Portsmouth Theatres Company===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
In the same year the old theatre was demolished, Mr Henry Rutley opened a new venue on the present site. Rutley (born Newcastle 1816) was an impresario and circus proprietor who had arrived in Portsmouth in 1854 and purchased the Swan Tavern in Commercial Road and the adjoining Landport Hall, a raquet court. He converted the hall to accommodate equestrian displays and applied to the magistrates for permission to construct a new theatre on the site. The magistrates, believing theatres places of ill-repute, granted a licence for a limited period with the condition that there was no direct access from the tavern. A door to the hall, bricked in during building, was temporarily uncovered during renovation work in 2004. The Theatre Royal opened on 29 September 1856 with a production entitled 'A New Way to Pay Old Debts'. Rutley managed the venue with J W Boughton as his assistant and was highly successful. In a typical week the theatre would host two plays a night with matinees at the weekend. Rutley died of 'dropsy'in 1874. His grave can be seen in Highland Road Cemetery in Southsea. Boughton became manager of the theatre in 1876 and, after the death of Rutley's successor J C Hughes, took over control of the Portsmouth Theatres Company in 1882. Rutley's widow eventually sold the theatre to him.

==Architects ==
===C J Phipps===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
Boughton decided on a major rebuild demolishing and replacing the theatre with the present building which re-opened on 4 August 1884 with Gilbert and Sullivan's "Princess Ida".  He engaged the most famous theatre architect of the day, C J Phipps, who had earlier built London’s Gaiety, Theatre Royal and Haymarket theatres among others. The new building had a four tier auditorium (stalls or pit, dress circle, upper circle and gods). The theatre reflected the rigid social distinctions of the day. The 6-door frontage led to the dress circle to accommodate the wealthy. Patrons in the other floors entered by single doors to the side of the main foyer. Seating capacity was under 1000 but there was space for standing patrons with refreshment bars on each level. The stage was 40&amp;nbsp;ft deep with a 30&amp;nbsp;ft proscenium, fly tower and traps.

Phipps also designed the Empire Theatre (aka Empire Palace Theatre) in Edinburgh Road, built by Corke of Fratton, which opened in 1891.  A two-tiered music hall with a small stage, it was a milestone in design for public safety. Phipps' Exeter Theatre Royal had been destroyed in a fire shortly after opening in 1886. The Empire was a radical improvement in build quality and design. The Empire struggled to compete with the Royal, Princes and Kings.  A plan in the early 1900s to build a 'super theatre' on the site today occupied by the "Zurich" offices was rejected by magistrates and the Empire was extensively redecorated and reopened with Marie Lloyd in 1913. It continued to stage variety shows, even when the other venues converted to screening films, but the quality of these declined to the extent that it ended staging "We never clothe 'em" shows, soft core striptease. The Empire was demolished to make way for a supermarket in 1958. It is said that the Empire Company applied unsuccessfully to lease the Theatre Royal.

===Frank Matcham===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The continued success of the theatre led Boughton to decide to enlarge the stage and he engaged Frank Matcham to renovate the building and build a 65&amp;nbsp;ft stage in 1900.

Matcham was arguably the greatest theatre architect in UK history. His buildings are loved by a variety of artistes as the ideal place to perform. He built over a hundred and fifty theatres across the country including the Tower Ballroom Blackpool, Sadlers Wells and the London Palladium, his greatest success. (The exact number is not known as much of the Matcham archive was destroyed in the WW2 bombing of London.) A brilliant and innovative architect, Matcham perfected increasingly larger floors of seating without supporting pillars, shaped to allow full view of the stage from all seats. He developed 'raked' stages (built at an incline toward the audience) to improve vision from the upper circle and gods, and decorative mouldings and shaped frontage to the balcony fronts that encouraged better acoustics. Matcham constructed the stage and auditorium area to form a natural bell chamber to project and amplify. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck has said of the Palladium that you can "feel the sound roll around the theatre". Matcham's genius was to create palaces of entertainment which were not only opulent and beautiful but efficient and intimate both for audience and performer.

Matcham enlarged the Theatre Royal stage, rebuilt the dress circle and modified the upper circle and added a cast iron conservatory to the front of the building to allow more patrons into the dress and upper circle bars. The Theatre Royal stage featured a "run-on" or "stage-roller", a large treadmill that allowed horses and vehicles to appear to move on stage. It was a feature of the annual pantomime and it is believed that two racing chariots appeared in a production of Ben Hur shortly after the renovation.

Boughton's success led him to engage Matcham to build two more theatres in Portsmouth, the Prince's Theatre in Lake Road and Kings Theatre in Southsea. The Kings opened in 1907 and is still operating. The Princes Theatre was of a similar structure to the Theatre Royal with a similar cast iron conservatory. It was destroyed in a daylight bombing raid on the city in 1942 during a children's cinema matinee.  The three theatres constituted the Portsmouth Theatres Company with a common repertory troupe.

Other surviving Phipps-Matcham theatres include the Tivoli Aberdeen,

==Famous Performers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
Most of the famous performers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries appeared at the Theatre Royal. Sir Henry Irving and his leading lady and mistress, Ellen Terry, appeared many times both individually and together. Sarah Bernhardt performed there on several occasions, including her legendary appearances in later life when in a wheelchair. She left her signature on the wall of the dressing rooms (it was retrieved after the fire in 1972). Marie Lloyd was also a regular. Laurel and Hardy appeared before fame in Hollywood and Oliver Hardy chose the theatre as the venue for his birthday party in 1954. Similarly Morecombe and Wise were among many twentieth-century variety stars who appeared early in their career. Irving died on tour in a Bradford hotel in 1905 but his last complete set of performances was completed two weeks earlier at the Theatre Royal Portsmouth. Ellen Terry was appearing there the week he died. During some of performances his private secretary and theatre manager, Abraham ('Bram') Stoker - author of his biography and of the classic Gothic novel ''[[Dracula]]'' - worked in the offices backstage.

==Theatre Programming==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
At its height from the Victorian to pre-WW2 eras, theatres provided a dynamic programme of entertainment to the communities they served typically, boasting "two shows nightly" with weekend matinees. Like cinemas, the evening programme ran a major and supporting show. As the Victorian wealthy liked to dine late after a trip to the theatre, the main performance started at 7.30 and the support (shorter and usually less demanding such as a light drama or farce) opened afterwards. Audiences could pay to attend either or both performances. With three venues in Portsmouth from the 1900s to the second world war, the city had a stunning level of entertainment choice and provision.

Programming also provides an insight into the talent and workload of the acting profession. In most weeks, the performances would change with as many as three distinct programmes of shows. Posters from the 1860s show an actor taking the lead in Hamlet followed by the lead in a farce at the start of the week, and the lead role in different plays at the weekend, a formidable memory load.

==Theatre Royal and New Theatre Royal==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
From Shakespeare's time onward, theatre was subject to control and censorship partially out of its moral reputation and partially through recognition of its influence as the world's first form of mass communication. In the eighteenth century legislation insisted that drama could only be performed by theatres that had been granted a royal charter or licence (1737) making them 'patent' theatres. This dispensation entitled them to be known as "Theatre Royal" and display a royal insignia.  This accounts for the fact that this is the most common name for 19th-century theatres across the UK. The original 'Portsmouth Theatre was not patented when Dickens wrote Nicholas Nickleby but gained authorisation at some point thereafter. The patent and title passed to Rutley's theatre in 1856 probably because he reassured the local magistrates that his theatre would be unlike the several 'dubious' places of entertainment then in the city and designed for "middle class families".

There is no clear evidence of when or why people began to refer to the theatre as 'New'. From 1856 to 1976 the theatre was official the Theatre Royal. At some point the 'New' was informally added. Evidence from local newspapers held in the theatres archive at the Victoria and Albert Museum confirm that this was in use by the middle of the century and either began when Rutley's building replaced the one in the High Street or when the CJ Phipps building replaced Rutley's. The frontage of the theatre says both "Theatre Royal" and "New Theatre Royal" indicating that the name was in use by the time CJ Phipps was contracted to design the present building. Archived material indicates that each name was used on material such as programmes.

The Theatre Royal officially became New Theatre Royal when the present trust was incorporated in 1976.

==Decline==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
By the 1920s, radio and cinema led to the decline in attendances and, coupled with economic depression and war costs, theatres began to close or convert to film screening. These including the Prince's and Kings. The Theatre Royal was home to a repertory company, The Denville Players, until 1932 when it too had a projection room installed and became a cinema. Portsmouth was subject to extensive damage during the WW2 blitz. The neighbouring Guildhall was gutted by fire and the Prince's destroyed by a direct hit during an afternoon matinee for children but the Royal escaped unharmed. It continued as a cinema until 1948 when it reverted to a variety theatre. According to local academic and musician David Allen, the theatre was the venue for the first live rock 'n' roll performance in the UK in 1954.

Additional competition from television continued to force closures across the country and the Theatre Royal was eventually forced to shut in 1955. In 1956 Bernard Delfont's  'Brilliant Summer Revue' starring David Nixon was in the Theatre Royal for a Summer Season. In 1957 it opened as a repertory theatre under local impresario Hector Ross but this was short lived and from 1960 it operated only as a bingo hall and a venue for wrestling. For a brief period a young Australian, Robert Stigwood, was Ross's assistant. In the 1960s Stigwood would become one of the leading impresarios in popular music.

In 1966 the owners of the theatre, Portsmouth Theatres Company, sought permission from the council to over-ride its 'listed' status and demolish it. The council agreed, describing the theatre as "an eyesore in the centre of our fine city." A pressure group was formed to oppose this, leading to a council decision in which the proposal was beaten by only one vote!

The empty building began to attract vandals. In 1968 squatters occupied it and valuable brass fittings and roof lead were stolen. The continuing decay and damage led to the formation of the Theatre Royal Society which pressured to defend and preserve the building. This campaign included the locally born actor Brian Murphy who had starred in 'The Boyfriend' and is now a patron of the theatre. The society became the New Theatre Royal trust in 1976.

==The Boyfriend==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
In 1971 the controversial director, Ken Russell chose the theatre as the location for a film version of the hit musical "The Boyfriend". The play written by Sandy Wilson had been a stage hit in the UK and USA. A love story set on the Riviera in the 1920s, it uses Shakespearean techniques of false identity and final revelation. Russell, who wanted to make a parody of the work of Busby Berkley, added a story twist by setting it amongst a run-down repertory company with the love story on stage mirrored in one off.  He chose the ballet dancer Christopher Gable and the model Twiggy for the lead roles backed by an ensemble cast of experienced stage actors including Barbara Windsor, Brian Murphy, Murray Melvin, Georgina Hale and dancer Tommy Tune. Vladek Sheybal played a visiting impresario and there was a cameo role for Glenda Jackson (not listed in the credits). A young composer, [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], adapted the score.

Russell (who would go on to produce a film version of The Who album "Tommy" in Portsmouth) shot most of the film on location in the empty theatre and adjoining streets giving it an eerie sense of period and reality.  It was to be the Victorian theatre's last performance.

==The Fire==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The following year, 1972, children entered the theatre and lit fireworks setting the stage on fire. A member of the public alerted a patrolling policeman to the smoke but by the time the fire brigade arrived the rear of the theatre was ablaze. Early in the fire the ropes of the safety curtain burned through causing it to fall into place saving the auditorium. (Ironically, the curtain had been faulty and temperamental for many years and regularly refused to operate.) The stage, fly tower and the entire building behind the proscenium arch was destroyed.

Once again, demolition was proposed but the Theatre Royal Society was there to oppose the plan. Amongst those who campaigned to save the theatre was the actor Brian Murphy who had appeared in "The Boyfriend". Murphy was born on the Isle of Wight and spent his childhood in Portsmouth.

In 1975, volunteers were allowed back into the building to start the long process of repair and renovation and a trust was formally established to care for the theatre. The New Theatre Royal (Portsmouth) Limited was registered in 1976 with a subsidiary trading company, NTR Trading Limited, as regulations did not allow charities to retail. The Theatre Royal was finally officially the New Theatre Royal. Leading figures in the restoration and rebirth included local teacher John Offord and Jean Salisbury who was made a "Cultural Champion" by the Minister for Sport and Culture in 2010.

The theatre was gradually repaired, largely by volunteers, and slowly came back into operation. In 1984 a small temporary stage was built over the orchestra pit in front of the proscenium arch. Productions were largely restricted to amateur performances.

==Memorabilia==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
Damage to the theatre extended beyond the fire in 1972. Thieves stole valuable brass fittings and other artefacts in the 60's. In the 70's thieves with a van stole auditorium doors which had been removed for renovation whilst volunteers worked in the theatre. In the early 70's artefacts, papers and records including a large collection of posters were moved from the managers office for safekeeping. (The offices and dressing rooms along with the Strand lighting unit were situated to the 'audience' left of the stage behind the White Swan and survived the fire. They were demolished in 1980.) These records were transferred too an empty shop nearby in Guildhall Walk. Two years later, the entire content of the shop were found to have disappeared. Neither the volunteers or the owner of the shop had authorised or knew of their removal. These items were never retrieved.

Sarah Bernhardt left her signature on the wall of the dressing room. This was retrieved after the fire and is now in the possession of the trust.

In the early 'noughties', builders renovating a house in Southsea found a number of posters from the Rutley theatre under floorboards. Most dated from the 1860s. They were sold to Langford Antiques in Albert Road Southsea where they were framed and sold. Several were purchased for the theatre trust.

==Fundraising==
===Boyden Report and Onyx Funding===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
In 2003, faced with on-going financial stringency, the Board of Trustees commissioned the Boyden Report which advised a short closure and re-launch and the appointment of an experienced professional director. Shortly after this appointment, the Project Director of a local social enterprise (The Portsmouth and SE Hampshire Partnership) which had been entrusted with finding suitable projects for £1m from the Onyx environmental trust, added the NTR as a last minute addition to the shortlist. The theatre was awarded £440,000, the largest single grant given by the Onyx Trust. With additional funding, the Matcham cast iron portico was renovated, central heating and a new pit bar installed, and original vintage seating in the stalls which had previously been used on the set of Baz Luhrmann's ''Moulin Rouge''. A larger stage was built in front of the proscenium. To accommodate this, the frontage of the lower boxes had to be removed. Investigation revealed that these were prefabricated and fitted using large bolts. They were stored beneath the stage until eventually reinstatement when the new stage house was built. An external lighting rig was erected over the open stage.

The renovation led to a dynamic programme development endorsed by the trust board. Drama, stand up comedy, music and dance became features of each season whilst work with local schools and community groups was expanded. The trust developed links with the university of Portsmouth, a funder with the city council. The New Theatre Royal gained prominence on the cultural scene of the city. However, performances were still restricted by the lack of a proper stage and get-in and limited seating capacity. Inevitably, lack of operating finance became problematic again necessitating a period known as "NTR Lite" with less risky but less exciting programing.

Shortly after the recruitment of a new executive (artistic) director, the trust embarked upon the most challenging an exciting period since the remodelling by Matcham.

==="Let's Make It Great"===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The board of trustees appointed a sub-committee to investigate and advise on the options for capitalising on its vacant "back lot". The outcome was a plan to rebuild the stage and back stage accommodation in addition to teaching facilities for the university. In 2009, London-based architects Peynore and Prasad were contracted to design the building and a professional fundraiser was appointed to raise the estimated £4m cost to the trust. A fund raising programme "Let's Make It Great" began at the opening of 2010 with a weekend finishing with a gala performance MC'd by comedian and broadcaster [[Sandi Toksvig]] and headlined by the actor Sheila Hancock, chancellor of the university. Broadcaster and musician Paul Jones and actor Christopher Timothy were among the cast list which included popular and classical music, comedy, opera and dance. At the end of the evening, Sheila Hancock accepted the invitation to become the patron of the theatre.

In May 2010, the theatre hosted the first screening in nearly three decades of "The Boyfriend", an honour it shared in the same week with the Verona Film Festival. The screening was preceded by an interview with the director Ken Russell and cast members Twiggy, Brian Murphy, Georgina Hale and Murray Melvin and the score composer Sir Peter Maxwell Davis, former Master of the Queens Music. The interview was hosted by local television personality Sally Taylor.  Following this event, Twiggy, Sir Peter and Brian Murphy agreed to join Sheila Hancock as patrons.

[[File:Open Source Day Conference logo.png|thumbnail|right|Open Source Day Conference logo]]
'''Open Source Day''' is an international conference gathering fans of open solutions from [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. Mission of the event is to introduce [[open source]] solutions to Polish public and business institutions and popularize it as a secure, efficient, cost saving alternative to proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;Idea of Open Source Day, opensourceday.pl, 2012 http://archiwum.opensourceday.pl/en/13,idea,of,open,source,day&lt;/ref&gt; The conference has taken place in [[Warsaw]] since its beginning in 2007. Participants are mainly managers, developers, technical officers of public, banking, and insurance industries.

The conference has become a platform for exchanging experience, contacts and use cases of open source solutions in fields of: [[virtualization]], [[cloud computing]], [[database]], [[big data]], [[Information security]].

== Promotion of Open Source software ==
Founders of the conference believe that by making open software popular they might initialize local communities as well as give start to small businesses in Poland which would provide support and develop open source solutions locally. Due to its role in promoting Open Source software in wider business and public applications, the Open Source Day Conference won support from public administration and were operated under the auspices of: Ministry of Education, Ministry of Administration and Digitization,&lt;ref&gt;Patronages of Ministry of Administration and Digitization https://mac.gov.pl/patronaty-mac&lt;/ref&gt; Ministry of Economy&lt;ref&gt;Dziennik Internautów, 2014-04-26 http://di.com.pl/news/49812,0,Zbliza_sie_Open_Source_Day_2014.html&lt;/ref&gt; and European Commission as well.

'''Operation Bramble Bush''' was an [[Israel]]i plan to assassinate the then president of Iraq, [[Saddam Hussein]], in 1992. It was described in full in December 2003 by the Israeli newspaper ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=129003&amp;page=1 Israel's Secret Plan to Kill Saddam] ABC News, Jan. 11, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; though news reports had circulated about the plot since January 1999.&lt;ref name=times&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/9977/report-says-israel-dumped-plan-to-assassinate-saddam/ Report says Israel dumped plan to assassinate Saddam]&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was conceived as retaliation for Iraqi [[Scud missile]] attacks during the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=defence&gt;[http://www.defencetalk.com/israel-reveals-post-gulf-war-plan-to-assassinate-shelved-after-drill-blunder-2074/ Israel reveals post Gulf war plan to assassinate, shelved after drill blunder]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Saddam's uncle, [[Khairallah Talfah]], was discovered to be terminally ill, the Israelis investigated the possibility of using a commando team to ambush the [[funeral|funeral party]]. A commando team from the Israeli Army's elite [[Sayeret Matkal]] special forces unit was to be inserted into Iraq from Jordan, where they would travel to the funeral near [[Tikrit]] and kill Saddam with TV-guided "Midras" missiles.&lt;ref name=harnden&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1449688/Israelis-dropped-assassination-plan-after-practice-run-ended-in-disaster.html "Israelis dropped assassination plan after practice run ended in disaster"] by [[Toby Harnden]], Telegraph.

A rehearsal for the operation took place on November 5, 1992 in the [[Negev]] desert.&lt;ref name=mossad/&gt; The operation's execution was just two days away. However, in the rehearsal, Israeli commandos accidentally fired live rounds into a convoy simulating the target, killing five of their fellow Sayeret Matkal commandos and wounding six more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/secret-protocols-reveal-yitzhak-rabin-approved-an-israeli-operation-to-kill-saddam-hussein.premium-1.476854 Secret protocols reveal: Yitzhak Rabin approved an Israeli operation to kill Saddam Hussein]&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the IDF, [[Ehud Barak]], had been watching the rehearsal at the time.&lt;ref name=defence/&gt;

The plan was cancelled. Israeli press reports described the incident as a "training accident."&lt;ref&gt;"Five Soldiers Killed, Six Injured In Training Mishap." The Associated Press, November 5, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli censors tried to prevent Israeli newspapers from publishing the fact that the head of military intelligence, [[Uri Sagi]], had witnessed the accident, but the censors relented a few weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;"Censor lifts ban on general's role in accident." UPI, November 23, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, the American newspaper ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' reported that the soldiers involved in the accident had been rehearsing a plan to kill [[Hezbollah]] leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotem, Michael. "US PAPER: TZE'ELIM EXERCISE WAS PRELUDE TO NASRALLAH KILLING." ''The Jerusalem Post'', November 25, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' also reported on the apparent attempt against Nasrallah, and the Israeli military censor complained the reporters from all newspapers involved had violated censorship laws.&lt;ref&gt;"Israel's Censor Upbraids 4 Foreign Reporters." ''The New York Times'', November 26, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years later, Operation Bramble Bush II once again targeted Saddam. [[Mossad]] agents had scouted locations in Iraq for the ambush of the Iraqi leader. However, as before, the plan was scrapped, this time due to both the U.S. and Britain's [[Operation Desert Fox]] and concerns that the assassination could harm the Israeli-Arab peace process.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afio.com/sections/wins/1999/notes0599.html MOSSAD PLAN TO ASSASSINATE SADDAM LEAKED]&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland's '''Hempstalk Festival''' is an annual event in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] advocating [[decriminalization]] of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for [[Medical cannabis|medicinal]], [[industry|industrial]], and [[Recreational drug use|recreational]] use. Founded in 2005, the festival often takes place the weekend after [[Labor Day]] and features food vendors, live music, and information booths. The event has always been free to attend.

According to Paul Stanford, founder and director of the event:

{{quote|Hempstalk is about the many uses of industrial [[hemp]] fiber, [[hemp oil|oil]], [[protein]], [[fuel]] and [[medical cannabis|medicine]]. We are working to end adult [[cannabis prohibition]], allow adults to grow their own and license the legal sale of [[psychoactive]] cannabis to adults. We believe that hemp will save the [[Earth]]'s [[biosphere]] with the adoption of hemp seed for [[bio-diesel]] fuel, which will solve the [[energy crisis|energy]] and [[world hunger]] problems, and stop [[deforestation]] when hemp fiber is used for [[paper]] and building materials. We support the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act of 2010, to implement this. We shall overcome!}}

== History ==
The Portland Hempstalk Festival is an annual, two-day event. Hempstalk was first held in Portland, Oregon's [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]] in downtown Portland in 2005 and 2006, with about 10,000 visitors each of the first two years.

In 2007, nearly 20,000 people attended the third annual Hempstalk festival at [[Sellwood Riverfront Park]]. While organizers insisted smoking would not be tolerated, the smell of marijuana lingered in the air and some festival goers chose to consume various forms of [[cannabis foods]].&lt;ref name="WWHempstalk"&gt;{{cite web

Hempstalk officials deny these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 22, 2008|url=http://www.hempstalk.org/about.php|publisher=Hempstalk|title=About Hempstalk|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213123837/http://hempstalk.org/about.php|archive-date=2009-02-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limited space, officials had doubts about hosting the event at Sellwood Riverfront Park in the future.&lt;ref name=HempstalkPleasesPatrons/&gt;

In 2008, the festival was held in Eastbank Festival Plaza, organized by Paul Stanford of The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation (THCF). In addition to the usual events and activities featured, the two-day event offered educational panels to inform attendants about industrial hemp, the legal use of marijuana, and answer any other questions they may have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 22, 2008|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/september142008/hempstalk_091108.php|title=HempStalk 2008 Gives Legalization Activists a Voice|date=September 14, 2008|last=King|first=Bonnie|work=Salem-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12–13, 2009, the Portland Hempstalk Festival moved to [[Kelley Point Park]], in the far Northwest corner of Portland, Oregon, at the confluence of the [[Columbia River]] and the [[Willamette River]]. 40,000 people attended over two days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hempstalk.org/downloads/hempstalk2009-white-8x11.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music was performed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[political activist]], [[poet]] and [[songwriter]] [[John Trudell]] and his band, Bad Dog, [[Folk Uke]] (Amy Nelson and Cathy Guthrie, daughters of [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]]), the Herbivores, Rocker T, the Human Revolution, Binghi &amp; the Seventh Seal, State of Jefferson, Marquee, Pass Margo and Tim Pate. Speakers included famed [[author]] and [[activist]], [[Jack Herer]], making his fifth Hempstalk appearance. Herer had a [[heart attack]] and collapsed moments after giving a speech on Saturday, September 12. He was in critical condition in a Portland area hospital for a month and moved to a Eugene, Oregon nursing home in early October 2009 for further recovery.

'''Railway spine''' was a nineteenth-century diagnosis for the post-traumatic symptoms of passengers involved in [[train wreck|railroad accidents]].

The first full length medical study of the condition was [[John Eric Erichsen]]'s classic book, ''On Railway and Other Injuries of the Nervous System''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, railway spine is often known as '''Erichsen's disease'''.

Railway collisions were a frequent occurrence in the early 19th century.  Exacerbating the problem was the fact that railway cars were flimsy, wooden structures with no protection for the occupants.

Soon a group of people started coming forward who claimed that they had been injured in train crashes, but had no obvious evidence of injury. The railroads rejected these claims as fake.

The nature of symptoms caused by "railway spine" was hotly debated in the late 19th century, notably at the meetings of the (Austrian) Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna, 1886. Germany's leading neurologist, [[Hermann Oppenheim]], claimed that all railway spine symptoms were due to physical damage to the spine or brain, whereas French and British scholars, notably [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and Herbert Page, insisted that some symptoms could be caused by [[male hysteria|hysteria]] (now known as [[conversion disorder]]).&lt;ref&gt;

Erichsen observed that those most likely to be injured in a railway crash were those sitting with their backs to the acceleration. This is the same injury mechanism found in [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]]. As with automobile accidents, railway and airplane accidents are now known to cause [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and other [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] symptoms in addition to physical trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Gaza blockade}}
'''Reactions to the Gaza flotilla raid''' on 31 May 2010 ranged from fierce condemnation to strong support for Israel.

Israel expressed regret over loss of life in the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], yet stated that the operation was a "clear case of self defense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/Spokesman/2010/06/spokehatshara010610.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605042336/http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/Spokesman/2010/06/spokehatshara010610.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 5 June 2010 |title=Statement by PM Netanyahu Regarding Flotilla to Gaza |publisher=Prime Minister's Office, Israel |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologised for the incident in March 2013, which he said was necessitated by the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Herb Keinon |date=24 March 2013 |title='Syria crisis necessitated Turkey apology' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Syria-crisis-necessitated-Turkey-apology-307535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident also drew attention to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, which was condemned.&lt;ref name="NYT Gaza-Bound"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bronner|first=Ethan|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Israeli Military Boards Gaza-Bound Aid Ship|date=5 June 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/world/middleeast/06flotilla.html|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] called for a full investigation and urged Israel to provide a full explanation. Many countries called for an international investigation and civilian protests erupted around the world.
Four countries downgraded their diplomatic relations with Israel and/or withdrew ambassadors: Ecuador, Nicaragua, [[South Africa–Israel relations|South Africa]], and [[Turkey–Israel relations|Turkey]].

* [[Amnesty International]] accused Israel of using excessive force, and claimed that the level of lethal force used was out of proportion to any threat that could have been posed by the activists. Amnesty International called on Israel to make public the rules of engagement used by the commandos, and to launch an "immediate, credible and independent investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/israeli-killings-gaza-ship-activists-must-be-investigated-2010-05-31 |title=Israeli killings of Gaza ship activists must be investigated |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International also called for an international inquiry, and called on Israel to invite UN experts to examine the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/israeli-authorities-urged-commission-international-inquiry-2010-06-10 |title=Working to Protect Human Rights |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Foreign Press Association]], which represents hundreds of journalists in Israel and the Palestinian territories, has complained the Israeli military seized video and equipment from dozens of reporters on board the main ship.

* [[Human Rights Watch]] called for a "full, impartial investigation" into the incident, and for the international community to make sure that any inquiries meet basic international standards, and that any wrongdoers were brought to justice.

The journalists who were on the flotilla to cover the humanitarian operation were put in harm's way by this disproportionate reaction.

=== Israeli and Jewish organizations ===
The [[Australian Jewish Democratic Society]] said, "Unless the Israeli government can convincingly back up its claims that the Gaza aid convoy was not a project for delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza, but in reality a front for violent action, it invites the condemnation of everyone who supports negotiated conflict resolution and reinforces the view that Israel's professed support for human rights is a sham."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajds.org.au/node/256 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605192452/http://ajds.org.au/node/256 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 5 June 2010 |title=AJDS Statement on Israeli action against the Gaza Convoy |publisher=Australian Jewish Democratic Society |date= |accessdate=2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B'Tselem]] demanded that an independent and effective investigation conducted by non-military officials be launched immediately. B'Tselem stated that among the issues that needed investigating are whether proportionate force was used, whether the soldiers were trained and equipped to cope with this type of event, what open-fire regulations were given to soldiers, and whether alternative options were considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.btselem.org/English/Press_Releases/20100531.asp |date=31 May 2010 |title=Open an immediate investigation into the action to gain control of the flotilla to Gaza |publisher=[[B'Tselem]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jews for Justice for Palestinians]] said, "Jews For Justice For Palestinians (the largest alternative voice of Jews in the UK or Europe) utterly condemns Israel's aggressive military interception of the peaceful Free Gaza aid flotilla.

Rabbi Dovid Feldman of [[Neturei Karta]] said: "Authentic [[Orthodox Jew]]ry worldwide decries unequivocally the cold-blooded slaughter carried out by the Zionist occupational forces against innocent, peaceful and freedom-loving noble activists committed to peace and human rights. This brutal attack took place in international waters on ships bearing humanitarian aid for our brethren, the Palestinian residents in the besieged Gaza Strip. It was an explicitly illegal act which breaches, in a serious manner, basic G-dly human rights, justice and law. This kind of behavior is, unfortunately, only to be expected from the Zionists. Their state's entire existence was built from the very start on Heresy, robbery and murder. They oppressed, murdered and expelled an entire people from its land." Adding, "We find it imperative to clearly declare that the State of 'Israel' does not represent the Jewish people, and certainly not the Jewish religion. They have no right to speak in our name, nor in the name of the holy Torah. They profane the Holy Land with their abominations, slaughters and countless other actions that emanate from this illegitimate State. Furthermore, the actual existence of this State is illegitimate as the holy Torah strictly and explicitly forbids any Jewish rule over the Holy Land." Neturei Karta protests took place in Ottawa, Montral, Washington, D.C., New York City, Jerusalem and London. Neturei Karta Rabbis visited the injured in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/activities/Press/20100603Flotilla.cfm "Neturei Karta Condemns Israeli Attack on Flotilla"]. [[Neturei Karta]].

* The [[International Chamber of Shipping]] (ICS), an association that represents 75 percent of the world's merchant fleet, has expressed "deep concern" over the boarding by Israeli forces in international waters. "The fundamental principles of international law, safe passage and freedom of navigation in international waters, must always be upheld by all of the world's nations," the organization said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Reuters]] |last=Saul|first=Jonathan|title=Q&amp;A: Is Israel's naval blockade of Gaza legal?|date=3 June 2010|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65133D20100602|accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious leaders ===
*Imam [[Fethullah Gülen]], a U.S.-based Turkish cleric, criticized the flotilla for trying to deliver aid without Israel's consent.

* David Hatchwell Altaras, vice president of the 10,000 member Jewish community in Madrid, criticized the Spanish government's "knee-jerk" reaction to slam Israel's seizure of the Gaza flotilla.

On 7 June 2010, approximately 200 mostly Muslim students threw stones at a group of Israelis while chanting "Murderers", and subsequently broke the window of the police car that they took refuge in. One of the Israelis was injured. The incident occurred at the start of the Spain-Israel Chamber of Commerce's conference at Madrid's Autonomous University. Following the violence, the university called off the conference due to safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/06/08/2739502/madrid-protesters-attack-israeli-businessmen "Madrid protesters attack Israeli businessmen"], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] (JTA), 8 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spanish media, the organizers had changed the conference's venue at the last minute due to concerns about potential violence but the protestors discovered the new location and stormed in while chanting, "Murderers, murderers.

===Polls===

A [[Rasmussen Reports]] national telephone poll in the United States of 1000 voters found that 49% of respondents blame pro-Palestinian activists on the Gaza bound aid ships for the deaths that resulted. 19% blamed Israel and 32% were not sure. 51% of those polled thought that Israel should allow an international investigation into the incident, while 25% agreed with Israel's refusal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/israel_the_middle_east/49_say_pro_palestinian_activists_to_blame_in_gaza_ship_incident "49% Say Pro-Palestinian Activists To Blame in Gaza Ship Incident"] – [[Rasmussen Reports]] (7 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Yougov]] survey found that 55% of the Britons polled believed Israel had overreacted, 27% didn't know and 18% thought they'd acted in self-defence. When asked about an international investigation, an overwhelming 74% believed it should be conducted by an international group. 4% thought it should be led by Israel, 12% didn't know, and 11% thought an inquiry shouldn't be held as it was a distraction from peace negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/YG-Archives-Pol-Sun-Israel-010610.pdf "Survey Report"].

===United Nations Security Council===
The [[United Nations Security Council]] convened an emergency meeting at the request of Turkey, during which the [[Ahmet Davutoglu|Turkish foreign minister]] stated "Israel must be held accountable for its crimes" (prior to the meeting, the [[Riyad Mansour|Palestinian ambassador to the UN]] called for an independent Security Council investigation). While the [[Mark Lyall Grant|British ambassador]] said Israel should end the Gaza blockade and take steps for an investigation, the [[Alejandro Wolff|US deputy permanent representative]] supported the Israeli position that humanitarian aid should have gone by "accepted international mechanisms", and the [[Daniel Carmon|Israeli deputy permanent representative]] said the flotilla was not humanitarian but had a mission of breaking the blockade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/05/31/un.security.council.gaza/index.html?hpt=T1 "U.N.

The United States directly intervened to prevent the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s statement, which requested an "impartial" investigation of the deaths and condemned those "acts" that led to it, from resembling that drafted by Turkey, the Palestinians and Arab states, which called for condemnation "in the strongest terms" and an independent international inquiry.&lt;ref name="Turkey demands Israel be 'punished' over Gaza raid"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Naughton, Philippe |author2=Evans, Judith |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Turkey demands Israel be 'punished' over Gaza raid|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=1 June 2010|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7141783.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 hours of negotiations were required to come up with a statement that suited all.&lt;ref name="Turkey demands Israel be 'punished' over Gaza raid"/&gt;

As a result of the emergency meeting that went into the early hours of the morning, the council agreed condemn the acts that resulted in the deaths and injuries aboard the ''Mavi Marmara''. They also called for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards. This was different from what Turkey and the Arab states were demanded – an independent international investigation—leaving open the possibility of who would conduct the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/europe/UN-Security-Council-Calls-for-Impartial-Credible-Investigation-of-Israeli-Boat-Raid-95297034.html |title=UN Security Council Calls for Impartial, Credible Investigation of Israeli Boat Raid |publisher=[[Voice of America News]] |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-06-01-un-israel-censure_N.htm |title=U.N. condemns Israeli flotilla raid, calls for investigation |work=[[USA Today]] |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTUNSC&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/world/middleeast/02nations.html "U.N.

==Plot==

===Respect: Part I===
Smithy is called to the Jasmine Allen Estate where he discovers a dying teenager, identified as Liam Martin, who has been stabbed by gang members. Investigations into his murder lead the team to Jasmine Harris ([[Faye Daveney]]), a previous informant of [[Detective Constable|DC]] Mickey Webb ([[Chris Simmons]]). Investigations reveal that she lured Liam to where he was killed and she is arrested. In interview, Jasmine leads officers to Carlos Miller (Lewis Chase), who is arrested and claims that he killed Liam in self-defence. Jasmine is released on bail, against the advice of DC Webb, who believes that she is in danger from other gang members. Upon her return to the estate, a gang of boys forces Jasmine into a warehouse, where she is beaten and [[gang rape]]d. A gunshot is heard, and the episode concludes with police arriving at the scene.&lt;ref name="Kilkelly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s20/the-bill/interviews/a265721/tim-key-series-producer-the-bill.html|title=Interview – Tim Key (Series Producer, 'The Bill')|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=22 August 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]]|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respect: Part II===

Following the murder of Liam Martin and the gang-rape of Jasmine Harris for talking to the police, uniformed officers arrive at the flat of Gary Wilson (Darragh Mortell), where they arrest him and Colin Simmons (Jumayne Hunte). As Meadows and [[Detective Inspector]] [[Neil Manson]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]) question the suspects, Smithy visits Jasmine in hospital, where she refuses to give a statement and prosecute. Due to a lack of evidence, the team are forced to release Simmons, Wilson and Carlos Miller. Jasmine is discharged from hospital, and still refuses to give a statement. However, as the team sees fit to give up, much to the anger of Mickey, CSE Eddie Olosunje (Jason Barnett) discovers that the gunshot fired at the end of the previous episode was fired upwards, and so possibly to alert passers-by, and to stop the gang-rape. Due to CCTV footage, the officers believe that gang member, Derek Bailey (Femi Wilhelm) fired the shot, and set out to find him as a potential witness. They pull in courier, Ruby Collier (Shahnequa Duprey). She initially refuses to help them, but sends Mickey a text message that leads uniform to Bailey's location. Sergeant Stone ([[Sam Callis]]) ascends to the top storey, where he discovers Bailey dying from a gunshot wound, inflicted by Gary Wilson, who holds Stone at gunpoint, when he attempts to help Bailey. Armed police officers arrive, and prepare to fire at Stone, who tussels with Wilson. A gunshot is heard, but nobody is harmed. Bailey is taken to hospital, and Wilson is arrested. After talking to Smithy and Mickey, Jasmine finally agrees to a statement, which helps to convict Wilson and the others of gang-rape. However, Jack is able to elicit a confession to Liam Martin's murder from Gary Wilson.

====Conclusion====
"Respect" concludes at a press conference, at which Meadows briefs reporters on the investigation and Wilson's confession. He finishes and rises to leave, before changing his mind and giving an impromptu speech on respect. He tells the assembled reporters and police officers that "somewhere along the line, someone changed the meaning. You earn respect these days through violence. Power. Fear. Money. The blade of a knife."&lt;ref name="Wollaston"/&gt; He goes on to praise his team, Smith and Stone in particular, concluding that "today was one of the good days".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23872708-fans-mourn-passing-of-the-bill-after-26-years.do |title=Fans mourn passing of The Bill after 26 years |date=1 September 2010 |work=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=5 September 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910011423/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23872708-fans-mourn-passing-of-the-bill-after-26-years.do |archivedate=10 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene changes to a walkthough Sun Hill with Mickey handing witness statements to Stevie, then he and Terry pinch Eddie's bag of crisps.

After lying to Max about going to the pub, Jo, Roger, Ben, and Leon bring in a stag party from the Bellcot Arms. As the two depart, Smithy has the last ever line, "Yeah, come on.

==Production==

To "sign off" the series, the producers considered that they could "blow everything up" but ruled that out because they wanted to do something that "celebrated what The Bill has always been about which is ordinary people wearing a uniform and taking responsibility for society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=05:35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers decided that they wanted to symbolise that "life goes on" and end the series with "their heads held high".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=05:42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the finale, [[Callum Stone]] ([[Sam Callis]]) has to chase a suspect using one of the [[panda cars]] whilst [[Dale Smith (The Bill)|Inspector Smith]] ([[Alex Walkinshaw]]) follows on foot.  The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by [[stuntman]] Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=07:10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when he finds [[hostage]] Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the [[firearm|armed]] criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by "men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a [[gun]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=22:34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the [[Metropolitan Police]] although they are incapable of firing any shots.  To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=26:07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the series finale came after research showed that [[rape]] is used to punish girl [[gang]] members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=18:47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series Producer Tim Key says "That is what ''The Bill'' has always done. It's held a mirror up to modern society and we wanted it to be like that right up until the final shot."

The final [[location shoot]] for the finale was carried out at a [[Abandoned property|derelict]] estate in London which is due to be demolished.  ''The Bill'' was always filmed on location in London whenever possible, "to keep the show authentic".  Executive Producer Johnathan Young says "We feel that London is a part of the show, it's a character within the show and we've really encouraged directors to look for graphic locations that give you a real sense of being part of a big [[metropolis]]".  Examples of these would include police chases by boat along the [[River Thames]] and helicopters aiding searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=22:04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police uniforms used in ''The Bill'' are [[Authenticity (reenactment)|authentic]] so when not in use they are locked away.  The uniforms were originally bought from the police who agreed to buy the uniforms back when the series ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=28:21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final scene was a [[long take]], filmed using a hand-held camera and featured 70 people in total.  Of the final scene, Keys said that the producers knew they had to do "something special" but also wanted to show that "life goes on".  To film the final scene, the [[cameraman]] had to keep the camera steady when following the characters going through the police station and then outside into the rear yard of the station where he stepped into a crane which then lifts to reveal the front of Sun Hill station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=34:41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shows producers were also included in the final scene, and played the part of journalists at the press conference hosted by Jack Meadows which Keys described as being "eerie" because "you were sat there on the front row listening to Simon making a very moving speech that sums up the show and his time in it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Farewell The Bill |series=[[The Bill]] |credits=Narration: [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]], Executive Producer: John Comerford, Producer and Director: Kim Duke |network=[[ITV Network|ITV]] |airdate=31 August 2010 |minutes=35:03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Critics were generally impressed with "Respect". ''[[The Belfast Telegraph]]'' called it "hard-hitting and poignant&amp;mdash;a gritty two-parter that ensured the much-loved show went out with a bang."&lt;ref name="Belfast"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/last-bill-and-testament-14930447.html|title=Last Bill and testament|date=1 September 2010|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Independent News and Media]]|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer went on to suggest that the episode was "a subtle [[V sign as an insult|two-fingers salute]] to the men in suits"&lt;ref name="Belfast"/&gt; at [[ITV plc|ITV]] who made the decision to cancel ''The Bill'',&lt;ref name="Belfast"/&gt; a sentiment shared by Sam Wollaston of ''[[The Guardian]]'', who suggested that the Superintendent [[Jack Meadows (The Bill)|Jack Meadows]]' final speech, on the subject of respect, may have been partly directed at the "ITV top brass".&lt;ref name="Wollaston"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/01/the-bill-tv-review|title=TV review: The Bill, The Deep and Natureshock: Killer Squid Invasion|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|date=1 September 2010|work=The Guardian|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benji Wilson, writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', compared ''The Bill'' to "the pensioner who still turns up for work",&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; saying that viewers "tend to appreciate ''The Bill'' simply for staggering on and on, rather than for the quality of its output",&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7968652/Youre-nicked-The-Bill-bows-out-in-style.html|title=You’re nicked!

'''''Runaways''''' is a musical which was written, composed, choreographed and directed by [[Elizabeth Swados]], about the lives of children who run away from home and live on the city streets.  The characters were taken from workshops conducted by Swados with real-life runaways in the late 1970s.

==Background==
Swados took her idea for a musical with the theme of running away "from home, from a boyfriend, from a predator,... from yourself" to [[Joseph Papp]], who agreed to produce it. She looked for the children who would be in the musical in various places in New York City, such as a community center, and "little by little, we built a world where runaways came together, told their stories, and acted out the hardships they endured."&lt;ref&gt;Swados, Elizabeth.  ''At play: Teaching Teenagers Theater'', Macmillan, 2006, {{ISBN|0-571-21120-8}},  pp.xxix- xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Swados did research for her project as she gathered the cast, and some in the cast were actual runaways. The show was done in a series of songs, monologues, scenes, poems, and dances.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Gussow, Mel. "Stage:Inspired 'Runaways' ", ''The New York Times'', March 10, 1978, p. C3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
The musical premiered [[off-Broadway]] on February 21, 1978 at the [[Public Theater]] Cabaret as presented by the New York Shakespeare Festival. It moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Plymouth Theatre]] on May 13, 1978 and closed on December 31st, 1978 after 12 previews and 274 performances. The director and choreographer was Elizabeth Swados, with scenic design by Douglas W. Schmidt and Woods Mackintosh, costume design by Hilary Rosenfeld, and lighting design by [[Jennifer Tipton]]. In 2007, a re-worked concert version of the show produced by [[Jamie McGonnigal]] and directed by Rodney Hicks played  at [[Joe's Pub]].&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/article/runaways-in-concert-presented-march-25-com-139537# " 'Runaways' in Concert presented March 25"] Playbill, March 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The orchestra consisted of Piano and Toy Piano, String Bass, Congas, Timbales, Bongos, Bell Sirens and Others, Trap Set, Triangle, Glass and Ratchet, Saxophone and Flutes, and Guitar (played by Elizabeth Swados).

The musical was presented in 2016 as part of [[New York City Center]]'s [[Encores!|Encores! Off-Center]]'s concert series. It was done under the artistic direction of [[Jeanine Tesori]] and the direction of Sam Pinkleton. It was performed July 6 to 9, with a cast of 25 young performers between the ages of 12-20: Frenie Acoba, Sumaya Bouhbal, Kenneth Cabral, Maxwell Cabral, Taylor Caldwell, Sophia Anne Caruso, Xavier Casimir, Joshua DeJesus, Adleesa Edwards, Aidan Gemme, Reyna Guerra, Matthew Gumley, Christina Jimenez, Kylie McNeill, Cele Pahucki, Sam Poon, Siena Rafter, Claudia Ramirez, Ren, [[Mj Rodriguez]], Deandre Sevon, Jeremy Shinder, Ripley Sobo, Chris Sumpter and Maxwell Vice. Elizabeth Swados was supposed to have been involved with this production, had she not died earlier in 2016. Tesori said: "Since we can’t do 'Runaways' with her, we’ll now do it for her."&lt;ref&gt;Clement, Olivia.

Through songs, monologues and poems the children examine and explain why they are runaways. They are abused, come from broken families, or are in an orphanage. The children show a range of emotions, and are seen as victims but also "perpetrators". They "plead with their families and society 'Let Me Be A Kid Again.'"&lt;ref&gt;Filichia, Peter.

==Response==
According to Cecil A. Smith, "It was a novel show, even for a period of musical theatre that sought novelty. Angry, disturbing, and ultimately too prosaic for sustained musical flight, it was complete proof that Elizabeth Swados had new plans for the musical and that she had the talent to realize them.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Cecil A. ''Musical Comedy in America:From The Black Crook to South Pacific, From The King &amp; I to Sweeney Todd'', Routledge, 1987, {{ISBN|0-87830-564-5}}, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Clurman]] wrote: "Though the show offers a number of attractive features, only a few of them are actually congruent with its theme...There are...a few charming numbers: one of them is called 'Enterprise' derisive of our national fetish...The Swados music is utilitarian rather than lyrically or dramatically expressive-it is employed, as in the Japanese or Chinese theatres, as sound to call attention to signal moments...Even if I had liked more of the numbers than I did, I would still have thought 'too much show!' ".&lt;ref&gt;Clurman, Harold. ''The Collected Works of Harold Clurman'', Hal Leonard Corporation, 1994, {{ISBN|1-55783-132-7}}, pp. 902-903&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reviewer wrote of the [[Public Theater]] production that the show was an "inspired musical collage... [it] takes a harsh and uncompromising look at the world of runaways, but it is written and performed with great compassion." The music is "disco, salsa, country and western and blues...Not just the songs, but the soliloquies and poems - some of them contributed by members of the cast - are also deeply personal...In all aspects 'Runaways' is a triumph."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

'''SIEV 36''' ([[Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel]] 36) was a vessel from Indonesia that exploded and sank off [[Ashmore Reef]], Australia on 16 April 2009. The vessel, carrying 47 refugees and two crew, was intercepted by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] patrol boat {{HMAS|Albany|ACPB 86|6}} early on 15 April. A boarding party secured the vessel, but failed to locate two canisters of petrol. Although it was intended to take the crew and passengers to [[Christmas Island]] for processing, a notice informing the crew that their vessel may be returned to Indonesia was presented, and the passengers were kept in the dark about their destination. While waiting for transportation to arrive, ''Albany'' and SIEV 36 sailed in a holding pattern, with the Indonesian boat taken in tow overnight. A second patrol boat, {{HMAS|Childers|ACPB 93|6}}, arrived that evening, and was directed to provide a boarding party and take care of the vessel starting at 06:00 on 16 April.

''Childers''{{'}} boarding party arrived aboard SIEV 36 at 06:15. Shortly after, the passengers found the notice, and, assuming that they would be sent back to Indonesia, became agitated. Salt was poured into the boat's diesel engine, stalling it, and one of the petrol canisters was spread on the deck. Reinforcements were sent from ''Childers'' to restore control, and boarded shortly before the petrol was ignited; the resulting explosion tore the boat apart. RHIBs from the two patrol boats focused on recovering the nine [[Australian Defence Force]] personnel first, then began recovering others. Five passengers were killed, and many of the survivors were heavily burned; the two patrol boats sailed to the tanker ''Front Puffin'', from where the wounded were heli-lifted to hospitals ashore.

An investigation by the [[Northern Territory Police]] concluded in October 2009, finding that one or more of the refugees had spread and ignited the petrol, but charges could not be laid as there was no enough evidence to identify the individuals responsible. A separate investigation by the Northern Territory Coroner criticised the RAN for not finding the petrol canisters, failing to confiscate ignition sources, and the lack of information provided about the refugee's destination, although praised the actions of several Australian personnel in the aftermath of the explosion. The coroner found the crew as the cause of the sabotaged engine and the passengers as starting the fire, but was unable to identify individuals because of collusion by those involved to hide the information from the inquiry. [[Australian commendations|Commendations]] were issued to all military personnel involved in the incident. One refugee was charged with obstructing the actions of two sailors trying to confiscate a lighter from him shortly before the explosion, and the two Indonesian crew were imprisoned for five years on people-smuggling charges.

===Leadup===
Early on 15 April, the RAN patrol boat {{HMAS|Albany|ACPB 86|6}} intercepted the {{convert|25|m|adj=on}} diesel-powered fishing boat off Ashmore Reef.&lt;ref name=Marr182&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; A boarding party was sent at 09:43, and boarded the vessel, designated "[[Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel]] 36" (the 36th vessel to enter Australian waters while carrying [[asylum seekers]] or other [[unauthorised arrival]]s since the 2001 [[Tampa Affair]]), without incident.&lt;ref name=Marr182/&gt; The boat was carrying 46 Afghans, an Iraqi, and two Indonesian crew: all male adults.&lt;ref name=Marr183&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; One of the passengers was able to serve as an interpreter, and spent the day helping the Australians by translating instructions and directions, and explaining the actions of the navy boarders.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', pp. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; Although sabotage was a risk with SIEVs (in previous incidents, unauthorised arrivals had damaged their vessels or threatened to do so in an attempt to force authorities to take them to Australia), the passengers were allowed to keep cigarette lighters and matches, as removing peoples' ability to smoke would cause unnecessary agitation.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', pgs 183, 185&lt;/ref&gt; The boarding party searched the vessel, but failed to identify a petrol-fuelled [[bilge pump]] and its fuel can, or a spare petrol canister in the bow hold.&lt;ref name=Marr183/&gt;

The leader of the boarding party gave one of the Indonesian crew a K-6-4 notice, a mandatory notice stating the penalties for [[people smuggling]], and which included text advising the crew to "consider immediately returning to Indonesia with your passengers".&lt;ref name="Marr, Panic, pp. 183-4"&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', pp. 183-4&lt;/ref&gt; Although the passengers were to be taken to [[Christmas Island]] for processing, standard procedure was to only tell them that they would be taken to "Australian authorities".&lt;ref name=Marr184&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; ''Albany''{{'}}s commander was advised that the amphibious warfare ship {{HMAS|Tobruk|L 50|6}} would arrive to collect those aboard SIEV 36 in about three days; anchoring the two vessels in Ashmore Lagoon or using the patrol boat to deliver them to Christmas Island were both ruled out, so a [[steaming party]] was embarked and the two vessels began sailing in a holding pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', pp. 184-5&lt;/ref&gt; That evening, SIEV 36 was taken in tow by ''Albany'', in order to provide better surveillance and support during the night.&lt;ref name="Marr, Panic, pp. 183-4"/&gt; Around the same time, {{HMAS|Childers|ACPB 93|6}} arrived to provide support: the two captains agreed that ''Childers'' would spend the night on anti-fishing patrols, then return around 06:00 to relieve ''Albany'' on close surveillance of SIEV 36.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The handover occurred on schedule, although officers aboard ''Childers'' were concerned that this was occurring almost two hours before sunrise.&lt;ref name=Marr186&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement boarding party reached SIEV 36 at 06:15, and by 07:10, the towline to ''Albany'' had been dropped, and the vessel was following ''Childers'' under its own power.&lt;ref name=Marr186/&gt; Although the leader of the new boarding party had been informed that there was an interpreter aboard, he did not use the man to relay directions or explain actions.&lt;ref name=Marr186/&gt;

===Explosion===
{{expand section|date=July 2012|Contains information about the immediate leadup to the explosion, but not the explosion itself}}
Shortly after the ''Childers'' boarding party arrived, the interpreter found the K-6-4 notice and told the others that this meant they would be forced back to Indonesia.&lt;ref name=Marr187&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; The situation quickly deteriorated, with passengers shouting abuse at the Indonesian crew and the Australian steaming party.&lt;ref name=Marr187/&gt; The military personnel aboard began indicating that SIEV 36 would be heading to Christmas Island, not Indonesia, but a few minutes later, the boat's engine stopped.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', pp. 187-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-01-25/boat-blast-lives-could-have-been-saved/307654 |title=Boat blast lives could have been saved |last=Gibson |first=Jano |date=25 January 2010 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the engine died the head of the boarding party began to smell petrol, and at 07:29, he radioed ''Childers'' for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', pp. 186-7&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the engine stopped, one of the passengers took the petrol canister from the forward hold and spread its contents over the deck.&lt;ref name=Marr187&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Another passenger began waving a cigarette lighter around, and two Australians grabbed him.&lt;ref name=Marr187/&gt; A reinforcement boarding party arrived from ''Childers'' at 07:44, bringing the number of Australian personnel aboard SIEV 36 to nine.&lt;ref name=Marr188&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescue===
Shortly after the explosion, ''Childers'' began dropping life rafts and flotation devices into the water, and lowered nets to assist anyone climbing aboard.&lt;ref name=Marr188/&gt; However, most of the passengers were unable to swim the short distance to the floats or the patrol boat, and stayed on the burning wreck until one of the Australians began urging them into the water.&lt;ref name=Marr188/&gt;

In the water, the [[RHIB]]s' priority were the Australian military personnel, to the point where while trying to pull a Royal Australian Air Force medic from the water, a member of the boat crew kicked at an Afghani man to stop him from preventing her rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', pp. 188-9&lt;/ref&gt; By 07:58, all nine personnel had been recovered.&lt;ref name=Marr189&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Both Indonesian crew were rescued, along with 42 of the passengers.&lt;ref name=Marr189/&gt; Three bodies were recovered, with another two never found.&lt;ref name=Marr189/&gt;

At 09:58, ''Childers'' left the scene to transport the worst-burned survivors to Darwin.&lt;ref name=Marr192&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the ship was told to divert to ''Front Puffin'', a tanker permanently moored in the Timor Sea as a gas processing platform, where helicopters would relay the wounded to hospitals ashore: cutting a 25-hour voyage down to 4 hours.&lt;ref name=Marr192/&gt; The patrol boat reached ''Front Puffin'' at 14:14, with the first burn victims lifted aboard the tanker about 20 minutes later, a helicopter bearing eight doctors arriving around sunset.&lt;ref name=Marr192/&gt; ''Albany'', which had remained at the explosion site for another hour before departing, arrived later.&lt;ref name=Marr192/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The 42 surviving passengers were all found to be legitimate asylum seekers, and granted [[permanent protection visa]]s in October 2009.&lt;ref name=Nicholson&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/afghan-refugees-to-get-protection-visas-20091011-gsf6.html |title=Afghan refugees to get protection visas |last=Nicholson |first=Brendan |date=12 October 2009 |work=The Age |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 2009, the Commander Joint Operations, Lieutenant General Mark Evans, AO, DSC, appointed Brigadier Don Higgins, AM, as an Inquiry Officer, pursuant to the provisions of the ''Defence (Inquiry) Regulations 1985'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00477&lt;/ref&gt; to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the arrival, apprehension and boarding of SIEV 36, and the response of ADF personnel to the explosion in SIEV 36 (but not the cause or circumstances of the explosion itself). Brigadier Higgins was assisted by two Assistant Inquiry Officers, Commander Bob Heffey, CSM, RAN, the then Commanding Officer, HMAS CAIRNS, who had significant patrol boat experience, and Lieutenant Commander Paul W. Kerr, RANR, a Navy legal officer with significant inquiry experience. Brigadier Higgins' Report contained nine Findings and 59 Recommendations, including recommendations for recognition of particular personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Inquiry Officer's Report into Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel 36 dated June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defence.gov.au/siev36/inquiryofficer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The Report concluded:

:The rapid response by ADF personnel to the mass SOLAS situation caused by an explosion and fire onboard SIEV 36 also demonstrated compassion and concern for the sanctity of human life. That there was not a greater loss of life is a direct consequence of this skilful, determined and compassionate response b the ADF personnel at the scent, in particular the ASSAIL TWO and ARDENT FOUR crews, and their attached personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 8.4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northern Territory Police]] investigation concluded in October 2009.&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; They concluded that one or more of the passengers spread petrol and ignited it, causing the explosion.&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; Charges could not be laid because there was not enough evidence to identify individuals, with the possibility that the perpetrator(s) were among those killed, or alternately, those who knew the truth were concealing it.&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; The two Indonesian crew were sentenced to five years imprisonment on people-smuggling charges, while the passenger who fought with the Australians trying to confiscate his lighter was charged with obstructing the sailors' actions.

Most of the passengers denied or made claims of forgetfulness about what they had told the police shortly after the incident, hampering the efforts of the following inquiry.&lt;ref name=Marr187/&gt; The Northern Territory Coroner concluded that the Australian personnel failed in their duties on several counts, by not finding and securing the petrol canisters, not confiscating ignition sources, and not informing the passengers of their intended destination.&lt;ref name=Marr193&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the K-6-4 notice was inflammatory, and its presentation was inappropriate in the situation (despite it being mandated for all SIEVs).&lt;ref name=Marr193/&gt; The inquiry found that those aboard the SIEV had planned to incapacitate the boat: the crew by pouring salt into the diesel engine, and the passengers by spreading and igniting petrol, but the coroner was unable to identify individuals responsible for the petrol ignition because the passengers "colluded with each other and decided as a group to lie to this Inquest".&lt;ref name=Marr193/&gt; The coroner recommended that three of the Australian personnel be recognised for their actions during the explosion's aftermath and the voyage to ''Front Puffin''; the Australian Defence Force took it a step further, with six personnel awarded individual [[Australian Commendations|commendations]], and both ships' companies receiving group commendations.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, ''Panic'', pp. 193-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/siev36/honourroll.htm |title=Honour Roll |work=SIEV 36|publisher=Department of Defence |accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spaceballs: The Animated Series''''', also known as '''''Spaceballs: The Series''''', is an [[animated]] [[television]] series that premiered in 2008 on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] and [[Canada]]'s [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]], and is loosely based on the [[parody]] [[science fiction]] film ''[[Spaceballs]]''.&lt;ref name="Super Channel"&gt;[http://www.superchannel.ca/series/view/756/ Super Channel]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to how the original film parodied the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' films]] and the [[Star Trek Universe|''Star Trek'' universe]], each episode of the series parodies a different film or other aspect of [[popular culture]], such as the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', or the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' [[video games]].

==Production==

Production began in early 2005 under the supervision of Brooksfilms, [[MGM]] and Berliner Film Company. [[Mel Brooks]] not only directed the writing, but also voiced two characters, President Skroob and Yogurt, both of whom he played in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-spaceballsseriesg4,0,217489.story | title = 'Spaceballs' Series Enters G4's Orbit | work = Zap2it}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daphne Zuniga]] and [[Joan Rivers]] also reprise their roles from the film, while [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Rick Moranis]] do not. Those roles are filled by [[Rino Romano]] and [[Dee Bradley Baker]], respectively. [[Tino Insana]] replaces [[John Candy]], who died in 1994, as "Barf," and [[Rudy De Luca]] also supplied his voice talents.

==Delayed series premiere==

Some promotional items on the series were seen at the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] and a total of 13 episodes were planned to debut during the fall of 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/733/733914p1.html IGN: Spaceballs: The Cartoon!]&lt;/ref&gt; although this "deadline" passed by with no sign of the show on G4's schedule. A start date of June 1, 2008 was later reported,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2008-03-24-G4-network_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=G4 network tries a new game plan to get more guys | first=Gary | last=Levin | date=March 24, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the series was delayed once again. Despite the lack of information in the United States, the series premiered on [[Canada]]'s [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]].&lt;ref name="Super Channel"/&gt; and remained absent from G4 in America until its eventual series premiere on September 21, 2008. The first two episodes of the series were shown following an airing of the original film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g4tv.com/spaceballs/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222713/http://www.g4tv.com/spaceballs/index.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian weekly journal '''''Sur-e Esrafil''''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: صور اسراقیل; [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|DMG]]: Ṣūr-e Esrāfīl; [[English language|English]]: “Trumpet of Esrafil“) was published between May 1907 and March 1909. The first 32 issues were published by the founder of the journal, [[Mirza Jahangir Khan |Mirza Jahangir Khan (1870-1908)]], an Iranian author and journalist. With its liberal as well as revolutionary orientation ''Sur-e Esrafil'' contributed significantly to support the [[Constitutional Revolution]]. The editor published articles criticising strongly the high-class and the social situation of the country that time and discussing controversial between conservatives and modern religion.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Christl Catanzaro: "Leserbriefe in Ṣûr-e Esrâfîl und Rûḥ ul-Qods als Forum des Informationsaustausches für die Intelligenzija der Mašrûṭîyat-Zeit“. In: Herzog, Christoph, Raoul Monika und Anja Pastor-Hatam (Hgg.): Presse und Öffentlichkeit im Nahen Osten. Heidelberg 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But the journal became well-known and famous due to its literary satirical elements. [[Ali Akbar Dehkhoda]] (1879-1956) was responsible for the satirical articles of the column „Charand-o Parand“ („Nonsense“). He had a simple linguistic style in contrast to the rather literary style addressing the educated people. In this way he wanted to reach the majority of the population and to address the daily problems of the common people.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Browne: The Press and Poetry of Modern Persia. Cambridge 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the repressions and on the command of [[Mohammad Ali Shah]] the journal was finally suspended in June 1908. Mirza Jahangir Khan was arrested and executed. In January 1909 ''Sur-e Esrafil'' was revived under Dekhoda who published further 3 issues of the journal from [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Christl Catanzaro: "Leserbriefe in Ṣûr-e Esrâfîl und Rûḥ ul-Qods als Forum des Informationsaustausches für die Intelligenzija der Mašrûṭîyat-Zeit“. In: Herzog, Christoph, Raoul Monika und Anja Pastor-Hatam (Hgg.): Presse und Öffentlichkeit im Nahen Osten. Heidelberg 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Brooklyn Hip-Hop Festival''' (BHF) is an annual celebration of Hip-Hop music and culture. It is produced  The Bodega Agency a wholly owned subsidiary of Brooklyn Bodega, Inc.

==Overview==
According to the official BHF website, "Our aim is to highlight Hip-Hop’s legacy as an agent of artistic progression, community building and social change." &lt;ref name="BB BHF"&gt;[http://www.brooklynbodega.com/about Brooklyn Bodega: About the Brooklyn Hip-Hop Festival] Official Site, Retrieved January 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is held during July at the [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]], which is situated on the shores of the East River and is accessible by multiple subway and bus lines, the thruway and New York Water Taxi service.

Established in 2005, BHF has grown from a parking lot in Williamsburg to the largest hip hop event in New York City. The Festival's format centers around its Hip-Hop Performance Day and includes a variety of affiliated hip hop cultural events that occur in the days leading up to the festival. Besides its music programming, the festival also features a "Family Day" segment that has music, performances, demonstrations and seminars from a host of family centric organizations.

In 2012, the Festival continued its new format of programming with “Busta &amp; Friends” and topped Festival history with a record-breaking 30,000+ in attendance (20,000 on its Performance Day). [[Busta Rhymes]] &amp; Friends would feature classic hits performed with Spliff Star and a surprise line-up that included [[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]] of [[Black Moon (group)|Black Moon]], [[Smif –N-Wessun]], Lil’ Fame of [[M.O.P.]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Reek Da Villain]]. The icing on the cake was a [[Leaders Of The New School]] reunion with Charlie Brown and Dinco D which was 19 years in the making. The night ended with L.O.N.S performing “Scenario” and bringing [[Phife]] and [[Q-Tip (musician)]] out just as the cops killed the power.

According to [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]], "(The BHF is) (d)ifferent from the bigger hip-hop packages like Rock the Bells that will be touring the U.S. all summer, this is a show that seems purely for New York, and it affords an opportunity for the artists to give back... Local businesses also showed their support, with booths ranging from [[Brooklyn Brewery]] to FLUD Watches and Hoodman Clothing." &lt;ref name="Time Out BHF"&gt;[http://www3.timeoutny.com/newyork/thevolume/2009/06/brooklyn-hip-hop-festival-2009/#ixzz0e8fkHpay Time Out New York: Video from the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival 2009] Official Site, Retrieved January 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[NY1]] interviewed Hip-Hop artist [[Torae]] who said "It's just awesome, you know, for new, upcoming artists like myself to be out here and perform with legends and get to touch people from young to old, every race." [[Steele (rapper)]] of the hip-hop duo [[Smif-N-Wessun]] added "It's packed -- no violence -- so it dispels all the myths that hip-hop brings violence and stuff. It's beautiful out there, it's young kids out there, it's older people out there. It's people from all walks." &lt;ref name="Good Vibes Through DUMBO"&gt;[http://brooklyn.ny1.com/content/top_stories/121870/annual-hip-hop-festival-sends-good-vibes-through-dumbo NY1: Annual Hip-Hop Festival Sends Good Vibes Through DUMBO] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023230423/http://brooklyn.ny1.com/content/top_stories/121870/annual-hip-hop-festival-sends-good-vibes-through-dumbo |date=2010-10-23 }} Official Site, Retrieved January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The BHF is owned by Brooklyn Bodega, which uses the proceeds from the festival to support year-round cultural programming including but not limited to: the blogazine and online home BrooklynBodega.com, and most recently The Bodega Agency, our boutique marketing and branding operation.&lt;ref name="BB BB"&gt;[http://www.brooklynbodega.com/about-the-bodega/ Brooklyn Bodega: About the Bodega] Official Site, Retrieved January 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cat in the Hat''''' is an American [[animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[television special]] first aired on [[CBS]] on July 4, 1971, based on the 1957 [[Dr. Seuss]] [[children's book]] [[The Cat in the Hat|of the same name]], and produced by [[DePatie–Freleng Enterprises]]. With voices by [[Allan Sherman]] and prolific vocal performer [[Daws Butler]], this half-hour special is a loose adaptation with added musical sequences.

==Plot==
As the story opens, it is too rainy and cold to play outside, so Sally and Conrad sit bored and look out the window. Their mom announces her departure, tells them to have fun, and says she'll return at 3:30 sharp. While their mom is out at a job interview, they have no other choice but to wish they had something to do.

The mysterious, quirky Cat in the Hat suddenly enters with a bump and fools around a bit. The family goldfish named "Karlos K. Krinklebine", demands that he must leave, but instead the Cat plays a game which he calls "Up, Up, Up, With a Fish", placing the fishbowl on top of a stack of bubbles. The children notice that the Cat is making the house a little untidy, and Conrad recalls their mom's projected return at 3:30. Noting their objections, the Cat bows to the voice of the majority and dejectedly states he's going to [[Siberia]]. Immediately after leaving, however, the Cat bursts back in claiming that his "moss-covered three-handled family gredunza" has been stolen. The Cat accuses Karlos of being the thief, and sings a ballad about the loss of his treasured keepsake.

The Cat then leads the kids on a search for the missing gredunza using his method of "[[process of elimination|Calculatus Eliminatus]]," in which random numbers and letters are drawn anywhere the gredunza should be to mark that they have already checked there. This makes a mess of everything, and Karlos once again demands that the Cat must leave. Ostensibly to gain sympathy, the Cat sings a pessimistic song to convey his low self-esteem, then puts Karlos to sleep by singing a lullaby. Having made a miraculous recovery from his bout of depression, the Cat brings out Thing One and Thing Two to aid in the search for the gredunza, singing to the kids that they can find "anything under the sun." Instead of being productive, however, the Things play a variety of sports using Karlos's fishbowl, noting that every house they visit has a pessimistic fish who "always tries to flatten the fun". Karlos becomes angry and accuses the Cat of not being a real cat, and his hat of not being a real hat. But the Cat indignantly asserts his legitimacy by singing his name in several languages, some real and some fictional. The tune becomes so catchy that everyone, even Karlos, joins in and contributes, telling the Cat that in Russian he is a "chapka in a shlyapa". (An interesting point to note is that in the Russian portion of the song, the Cat describes himself as a "chapka in a shlyapa", which translates to "''hat'' in a hat"; in Russian, the most common word for "cat" is "koschka".)

As the song ends, Karlos spots Mom coming home. The Cat exits, leaving behind an extremely messy house. He quickly returns, however, using a motorized vehicle to tidy things up. He then departs, hinting that he may return someday. Just as he departs through the back door, Mom walks in through the front door; she asks the kids how their day was, and then tells them that she just saw a cat in a hat "going down the street with a moss-covered three-handled family gredunza". The exact identity of the item has never been revealed, but this indicates that the gredunza was never really lost, and the Cat simply wanted an excuse to have more fun. Sally and Conrad look out the window much as they did at the beginning of the special, and watch as the Cat walks off to his next adventure.

==Differences with the book==
The plot of the special differs significantly from the original book. Among the many deviations, the sequence in the book where the Cat balances all sorts of objects while standing on a ball, only to overdo it and come crashing down, is left out. The closest equivalent is the fishbowl and bubbles sequences.

Also differing is the role of Thing 1 and Thing 2; in the original book, they were simply things the Cat brought along to demonstrate fun, but in this special, they are commissioned to help find the cat's "[[MacGuffin|moss-covered three-handled family gredunza.]]" The vocabulary used in the special is also of a higher level than the book, though still in Seuss' trademark rhyme.

==Home video releases==
The special was originally released as a [[VHS]] [[videocassette]] on the [[CBS/Fox Video]] label's [[Playhouse Video]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] in 1989. It was later released as part of the ''Dr. Seuss Sing-Along Classics'' release from [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] with [[CBS/Fox Video|CBS Video]] and [[Fox Kids]] Video in the mid 90's. It was later released on [[DVD]] by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] on October 7, 2003. [[Warner Home Video]] released the special on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on August 7, 2012.

==The Cat in other TV specials and series==
Although the original book's sequel ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]'' did not receive an animated adaptation, the character went on to appear in several more Dr. Seuss specials. In 1973, there came ''[[Dr. Seuss on the Loose]]'', where Sherman reprised his role as The Cat in the Hat. Here, The Cat in the Hat appeared in bridging sequences where he introduced animated adaptations of three other Dr. Seuss stories: ''[[The Sneetches and Other Stories|The Sneetches]]'', ''[[The Sneetches and Other Stories|The Zax]]'' and ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]''. In 1982's ''[[The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat]]'', the character, now voiced by [[Mason Adams]] (Sherman had died shortly after ''Dr. Seuss on the Loose'' finished production), meets the title character of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' and sets out to reform his new green adversary. In 1995, the Cat appeared again, this time with the voice of [[Henry Gibson]], to narrate ''[[Daisy-Head Mayzie]]'', a special based on a posthumously published Dr. Seuss book. In 1997, a [[puppet]] version of the Cat starred in ''[[The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss]]'', where he was voiced by [[Bruce Lanoil]] and [[Martin P. Robinson]]. ''[[The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!]]'', an educational animated series based on the ''Random House Library'' series, premiered in September 2010; the Cat is voiced by [[Martin Short]].

==Cast==

* [[Allan Sherman]] as [[The Cat in the Hat]]/Narrator
* [[Daws Butler]] as Karlos K. Krinklebine
* Tony Frazier as Conrad
* [[Pamelyn Ferdin]] as Sally
* Gloria Camacho as Mother
* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as Thing One
* Lewis Morford as Thing Two

==Production==
The production began at Chuck Jones' [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|MGM Animation Studio]] in the late 1960s after the studio had finished ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' and another Dr. Seuss special, ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''. After MGM stopped animation production and closed down its animation department for good in 1970, production was moved to [[DePatie–Freleng Enterprises]] (marking the company's first Dr. Seuss television special), which was run by Jones' fellow [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] alumnus [[Friz Freleng]] and WB's last original production executive [[David H. DePatie|David DePatie]].

Although Chuck Jones and his staff were retained by DePatie–Freleng in the production of the special, Jones left the studio and did not work on any other Seuss projects after ''The Cat in the Hat''. Other staff members that have worked with Jones such as [[Dean Elliott]] and [[Maurice Noble]] eventually stopped working on Seuss projects also. DePatie and Freleng were credited together as executive producers, while Jones was credited as producer with Seuss (under his actual name). For the next three Dr. Seuss animation specials, Freleng and Seuss (again using his real name) were credited as producers, although separately.

DePatie–Freleng animated a new Cat in the Hat Productions logo for this special, which would be used in the next three specials. The pace and rhyming sequences of several of the songs (particularly "Calculatus Eliminatus") led many to believe that they were composed by Sherman, since they closely resemble his earlier song parodies, however only Seuss is credited.

"'''Tomorrow'''" is a song by Australian [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Silverchair]] which was released on 16 September 1994 on their debut [[extended play]] album, also titled '''''Tomorrow'''''.  The song also appeared on the band's first full-length album, ''[[Frogstomp]]'' (27 March 1995). It won the 1995 [[ARIA Music Awards of 1995|ARIA Music Award]] for Single of the Year and Highest Selling Single. The track was written by the band's [[Singing|lead vocalist]], [[lead guitar]]ist and front man, [[Daniel Johns]], and their [[drum kit|drummer]]-[[percussion instrument|percussionist]], [[Ben Gillies]]. It was [[Record producer|produced]] and [[Audio engineer|engineered]] by [[Phil McKellar]] at national radio station, [[Triple J]]'s studios for [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS-TV]]'s show, ''Nomad'', which aired on 16 June 1994. After the broadcast the band were signed to the [[Murmur (record label)|Murmur]] label – a [[Sony Music]] subsidiary – which subsequently issued the ''Tomorrow'' EP.

"Tomorrow" became a breakthrough hit for Silverchair when it reached number one on the [[ARIA Chart|ARIA Singles Chart]] in October and remained at the top position for six weeks. In the United States a re-recorded version was issued in the following year and also peaked at number one on both the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] and the [[Album Rock Tracks]] charts; it made No.&amp;nbsp;28 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Airplay chart. In the United Kingdom, the song made No.&amp;nbsp;59 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in September 1995. At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1995]], "Tomorrow" won three awards in the categories 'Single of the Year', 'Highest Selling Single' and 'Breakthrough Artist – Single'; they won two further awards for ''Frogstomp''.

==History==
[[Ben Gillies]] (on [[drum kit|drums]] and [[percussion instrument|percussion]]) and [[Daniel Johns]] (on [[Singing|lead vocals]] and [[lead guitar]]) co-wrote "Tomorrow" when they were performing with [[Chris Joannou]] (on [[bass guitar]]) as Innocent Criminals.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;McFarlane, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040419064908/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=371 'silverchair'] entry.

It cost about $75. We weren't in there for more than an hour. The version we entered went for about six minutes".&lt;ref name="Blum"/&gt;

In April 1994, the band won a national band competition called Pick Me, using their demo of "Tomorrow".&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MABio"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/62OWDELG1?url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-NAMO~1626 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-NAMO~1626 | title = Silverchair | publisher = [[Music Australia]].

In 1995, a re-recorded version of "Tomorrow" (and a new music video) was made for the United States market, becoming the most played song on US modern rock radio that year.&lt;ref name="AMGBio" /&gt; In the US it peaked at number&amp;nbsp;one on both the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] and the [[Album Rock Tracks]] charts; it made No.&amp;nbsp;28 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Airplay chart.&lt;ref name=AMGSingles/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2004). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 571.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
When asked about where the inspiration for "Tomorrow" came from, Johns said: &lt;blockquote&gt; That was on a TV show. There was this poor guy taking a rich guy through a hotel to experience the losses of the less fortunate than him. The rich guy is just complaining because he just wants to get out and the poor guy is saying you have to wait till tomorrow to get out. That's one of our least serious songs but it still has meaning to it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chairpage.com/press_releases/item/128/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Music videos==
Two different [[music video]]s were released to promote "Tomorrow". The original version was directed by [[Robert Hambling]] for SBS-TV show ''Nomad'',&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; which was produced and directed from 1992 to 1994 by Kerry Negara.&lt;ref name="FilmVic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.filmmelbournedirectory.com/permalink/negara-film-and-television/ | title = Negara Film and Television | publisher = [[Film Victoria]]. [[Australian Film Institute]] | date = 27 November 2009 | accessdate = 29 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was broadcast on 16 June 1994 as part of the group's prize for winning the Pick Me competition.

The second version was shown in the US and is directed by [[Mark Pellington]]. This video has been described as similar to the music video for the [[Pearl Jam]] song "[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]", also directed by Pellington. Like the "Jeremy" video, the US "Tomorrow" video includes: harsh lighting, especially on the face; various disturbing images, such as a pig eating money and shots of a spider-like creature; quick shifting between random images; and handwritten notes. The US version of "Tomorrow" received high rotation on [[MTV]], which "led to an abundance of radio requests".&lt;ref name="Blum"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.chairpage.com/press_releases/item/6/ | title = Silverchair Enjoys Success Despite Adult Criticism | last = Blum | first = Kim | work = [[The Daily Egyptian]] | date = 8 December 1995 | location = [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale, Il]] | accessdate = 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the United Kingdom, the song made No.&amp;nbsp;59 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in September 1995.&lt;ref name=UKCharts&gt;{{Cite book | year = 2006 | editor-last = Roberts | editor-first = David | title = [[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums|British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]] | edition = 19th | publisher = [[HIT Entertainment]] | isbn = 1-904994-10-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ARIA Music Awards===
On 20 October 1995, at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1995|ARIA Music Awards]], "Tomorrow" won three categories: 'Single of the Year', 'Highest Selling Single' and 'Breakthrough Artist – Single'; the group won two further awards for their work on the related album, ''Frogstomp''.&lt;ref name="ARIAList"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARIA1995"/&gt; At the ceremony they performed a cover version of [[Radio Birdman]]'s "New Race" with [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]] (of [[You Am I]]) joining them on stage.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2"&gt;{{cite book | title = Molly Meldrum Presents 50 Years of Rock in Australia | last1 = Jenkins | first1 = Jeff | last2 = Meldrum | first2 = Ian | authorlink = Molly Meldrum | page = 231 | year = 2007 | publisher = Wilkinson Publishing | location = Melbourne, Vic | isbn = 978-1-921332-11-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their trophies were collected by Josh Shirley, the young son of ''Frogstomp''{{'}}s producer, [[Kevin Shirley]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins2"/&gt;

===Critical response===
[[Allmusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] described the "angst-ridden single" as "from the standard grunge formula".&lt;ref name="AMGBio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMGFrogs"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/frogstomp-mw0000173614 | title = ''Frogstomp'' – Silverchair | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | authorlink = Stephen Thomas Erlewine | publisher = [[Allmusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]] | accessdate = 29 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004 Australian rock musician [[Scott Owen]] of [[The Living End]] was asked for "the most influential Australian music release" and answered that it was Silverchair's "Tomorrow", he explained "it taught kids that if you give it a go you have the chance to take on the world".&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/44131/20051122-0000/www.amo.org.au/qa_interview9068.html | url = http://www.amo.org.au/qa_interview9068.html | title = The Living End Are Back!!! | last = Owen | first = Scott | authorlink = Scott Owen | publisher = [[Australian Music Online]] | archivedate = 22 November 2005 | date = 23 February 2004 | accessdate = 29 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
On 9 December 1995 "Tomorrow" and "Pure Massacre" were performed by Silverchair on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', hosted by [[David Alan Grier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://snlarc.jt.org/ep.php?i=199512098 | title = Episode: December 9, 1995 | publisher = SNL Archives | accessdate = 29 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack appearances==
"Tomorrow" was used in "The Mystery of Morning Wood", an episode on season six of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.&lt;ref name="Beavis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tv.com/shows/beavis-and-butthead/the-mystery-of-morning-wood-58309/ | title = ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' – Season 6, Episode 2: 'The Mystery of Morning Wood' | publisher = [[TV.com]] | accessdate = 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the episode the two main characters are singing [[Boston (band)|Boston]]'s "[[More Than a Feeling]]", then concluded that the song was stupid and ended by stating how the video fails to disturb them.

The song is a downloadable track on ''[[Rock Band]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]''.

The song "Stoned" from the Australian single release features in the 1995 film ''[[Mallrats]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/soundtrack&lt;/ref&gt; A re-recorded version of "Blind" was in the 1996 movie ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' along with its soundtrack.

==Parody==
Australian band [[Silverpram]] released a parody version of "Tomorrow", titled "Frogstamp", in 1995.  The lyrics of the parody were centred around the young age of the Silverchair band members at the time, with the chorus lyrics changed to "I turn four tomorrow."  The single peaked at #72 on the Australian [[ARIA Charts|ARIA]] singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/70nH8AH.jpg|title=The ARIA Australian Top 100 Singles Chart – Week Ending 12 Nov 1995|publisher=Imgur.com|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Toronto International Dragon Boat Race Festival''' (TIDBRF), is an annual [[dragon boat]] [[regatta]], first held in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] in 1988. It developed from the [[Canadian International Dragon Boat Festival]] held in [[Vancouver, BC]]. An associated festival highlights Asian and other culture in Toronto.

== Venue ==
Races were originally held at the [[Ontario Place West Channel]] at [[Ontario Place]], and since 2007 races take place in the Main Channel at Centre Island, one of the [[Toronto Islands]]. The Main Channel race course is 500 m long and six lanes wide.

&lt;!-- For 2007, pre-race events are planned for the [http://www.toronto.ca/toronto_international/watercourse.htm Western Beaches Watercourse] which hosted the [http://www.2006ccwc.com/ 2006 Club Crew World Championships].  This statement appears to be outdated. --&gt;

== Format and Rules ==
Races occur over two days. Once separated into Community and Corporate categories, races were combined into the following categories for the 18th (2006) festival:
* Premier Mixed (at least 8 women)
* Premier Women (all women)
* Junior Mixed (at least 8 girls)

In addition to divisional finals seeded by aggregate time from two heats, there are also industry finals for teams representing groups in certain categories. In 2006, these were:
* Community groups
* Non-profit groups and charities
* Universities
* Other education groups
* Hospitals
* Industries
* Breast cancer survivors
* Technology &amp; Communications companies
* Pharmaceutical companies

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8423">'''Unlawful assembly''' is a [[Law|legal]] term to describe a group of people with the mutual intent of deliberate disturbance of the peace. If the group is about to start the act of disturbance, it is termed a [[rout]]; if the disturbance is commenced, it is then termed a [[riot]]. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the offence was abolished in 1986.

==United Kingdom==
By the 19th century, ''unlawful assembly'' was the term used in [[English law]] for an assembly of three or more persons with intent to commit a crime by force, or to carry out a common purpose (whether lawful or unlawful), in such a manner or in such circumstances as would in the opinion of firm and rational men endanger the public peace or create fear of immediate danger to the tranquillity of the neighborhood. In the Year Book of the third year of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s reign assemblies were referred to as not punishable unless ''in terrorem populi domini regis''. It was suggested{{efn|Criminal Code Commission, 1879}} that legislation first became necessary at a time when it was usual for those [[Landed property|landed proprietors]] who were on bad terms with one another to go to market at the head of bands of armed retainers.{{efn|Statute of Northampton, 1328, 2 Edw. III. c. 3}} An assembly, otherwise lawful, was not made unlawful if those who take part in it know beforehand that there will probably be organized opposition to it, and that it may cause a [[breach of the peace]].{{efn|''Beatty v. Gillbanks'', 1882, 9 Q. B. D. 308}} All persons may, and must if called upon to do so, assist in dispersing an unlawful assembly.{{efn|''Redford v. Birley'', 1822, 1 St. Tr. n.s. 1215; ''R. v. Pinney'', 1831, 3 St. Tr. n.s. 11}} An assembly which was lawful could not be rendered unlawful by proclamation unless the proclamation was one authorized by statute.{{efn|''R. v. Fursey'', 1833, 3 St. Tr. n.s. 543, 567; ''R. v. O'Connell'', 1831, 2 St. Tr. n.s. 629, 656; see also the Prevention of Crimes [Ireland] Act 1887}} Meetings for training or drilling, or military movements, were unlawful assemblies unless held under lawful authority from [[the Crown]], the [[Lord-lieutenant]], or two [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]].{{efn|Unlawful Drilling Act 1820, s. 11}}

An unlawful assembly which has made a motion towards its common purpose was termed a ''rout'', and if the unlawful assembly should proceed to carry out its purpose, e.g. begin to demolish a particular enclosure, it became a ''riot''. All three offences were misdemeanors in English law, punishable by fine and imprisonment. The offence was abolished by the [[Public Order Act 1986]].

The common law as to unlawful assembly extended to [[Ireland]], subject to special legislation. The law of [[Scotland]] included unlawful assembly under the same head as rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Assembly, Unlawful|volume=1|page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bangladesh ==
'''Section 144''' is a section of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prohibits assembly of five or more persons, holding of public meetings, and carrying of firearms and can be invoked for up to two months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1237.html Bangladesh Criminal Justice] Based on the Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisr-irb.gc.ca/en/research/publications/index_e.htm?docid=124&amp;cid=30&amp;sec=CH02&amp;version=printable&amp;disclaimer=show Code of Criminal Procedure:  Issue Paper on Bangladesh State Protection] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

==Canada==
Under Part II of the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] (Offences Against Public Order), Unlawful Assemblies and Riots is when the assembly of three or more persons who cause fear and on reasonable grounds disturb peace in the neighborhood is against the law.

==Hong Kong==
The '''Public Order Ordinance''' (chapter 245 of the [[Law of Hong Kong|laws]] of [[Hong Kong]]) defines "unlawful assembly" (§18) as an assembly of three or more persons conducting themselves in a "disorderly, intimidating, insulting or provocative manner intended or likely to cause a person reasonably to fear that the persons so assembled will conduct a breach of the peace or will by such conduct provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace". Persons taking part in unlawful assemblies can be punished with up to five years' [[imprisonment]] (if [[indictment|indicted]]) or a level 2 fine (HK$5000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/CurAllEngDoc/CF2DC70EAB6C97C7C82564830029D317?OpenDocument|title=Criminal Procedure Ordinance Levels of Fines for offences|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and imprisonment for two years (on [[summary conviction]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/14B03C325D4C1827482575EE0052311E/$FILE/CAP_245_e_b5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
'''Section 144''' of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure (India)|Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)]] of 1973 empowers an executive magistrate to prohibit an assembly of more than four persons in an area. According to 141-149 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC), the maximum punishment for engaging in rioting is rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and/or fine. Every member of an unlawful assembly can be held responsible for a crime committed by the group. Obstructing an officer trying to disperse an unlawful assembly may attract further punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Section 144 in The Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 | url = http://indiankanoon.org/doc/930621/ | accessdate = 2014-03-01  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 1861,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Shovon |title=KNOW YOUR LAWS : CrPC, Section 144, ‘Prohibition of Assembly’ |url= https://shovonc.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/know-your-laws-crpc-section-144-prohibition-of-assembly/ |website=India Update |accessdate=6 August 2016 |date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officer Raj-Ratna E.F. Deboo IPS was the designer and architect of section 144, which reduced overall crime in that time in the [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Baroda State|Baroda]]. He was recognized for his initiative and awarded a gold medal by the Maharaja [[Gaekwad]] of Baroda for putting Section 144 in place and reducing overall crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manatelanganaa.in/section144-warangal-india-to-dayton-usa-connection/ |title=Section 144 – Warangal, India to Dayton, USA connection|website=www.manatelanganaa.in|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.manatelanganaa.in/section144-warangal-india-to-dayton-usa-connection/ |title=Section 144 – Warangal, India to Dayton, USA connection |website=www.manatelanganaa.in |access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section was used for the first time in 1861 by the [[British Raj]], and thereafter became an important tool to stop all nationalist protests during the [[Indian independence movement]], and its use in independent India remains controversial as little has changed. It is often used to prevent freedom of expression by peaceful protests or demonstrations, even the law does not use the terms, though it does mention "riot". Section 144 applies during riots and election proceeding after the declaration of election.

The '''Joan Gerard Youth Awards''' were established in 1989 by the [[World Bridge Federation]] to celebrate the sportsmanship of competitive youth [[contract bridge]] players. They were originally called the '''WBF Youth Award''' and were awarded biennially to four competitive bridge players under the age of 26. From 1995 to 2006, this coincided with the World Junior Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbridge.org/competitions/the-other-wbf-events/world-junior-camp/|title=The World Junior Camp -  World Bridge Federation|website=www.worldbridge.org|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were discontinued in 2007 at the same time as the discontinuation of the camps but reinstated in 2013 in a new form, being awarded annually at the [[World Junior Teams Championship|Youth Bridge Teams Championships]] to a Junior, a Youngster, a Girl, and starting in 2015, a Kid. After the passing of Joan Gerard, they were renamed in her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth.worldbridge.org/the-wbf-youth-awards/|title=The WBF Youth Awards - Youth World Bridge|website=youth.worldbridge.org|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yhyаkh''' ([[Yakut language|Yakut]]: ''Ыhыах'') is the New Year holiday in [[Sakha Republic]].

== Celebration ==
[[Yakuts|Sakha people]] celebrate the New Year twice a year – in winter with the rest of citizens of [[Russia]], and in summer – according to the ancient traditions. Yakutia is the largest region of [[Russia]]. The winter temperatures sometimes reach −60&amp;nbsp;°C, while the summer is very short, lasting only three months. The holiday is celebrated in the middle of June, at the beginning of summer.

The Sakha Yhyakh festival (literally meaning "abundance") is related to a cult of a solar deity, with a fertility cult. Before the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] it was held on 22 June, the longest day of the year. Hoever, after 1941, as the date of Yhyakh had coincided with the beginning of [[Operation Barbarossa]], it began to be celebrated in the period between 10 and 25 June.

Ancient Sakha celebrated the New Year at the Yhyаkh festival. Its traditions include women and children decorating trees and tethering posts with "salama" (nine bunches of horse hair hung on horse-hair ropes). The oldest man, wearing white, opens the holiday. He starts the ritual by sprinkling [[kumis|kymys]] on the ground, feeding the fire. He prays to the Ai-ii spirits for the well-being of the people who depend on them and asks the spirits to bless all the people gathered.

Afterwards, people sing and dance ''Ohuakhai'' (see below), play national games, eat national dishes, and drink kymys.

During years of stagnation, the traditional ceremony was almost forgotten. Nevertheless, the 21st century saw a revival of Sakha culture, including Yhyakh. Until 1990, when the first Yhyakh was held in Yakutsk, traditionally accurate celebrations were only held in a few regions of the republic.

The Ohuokhai (Оhуохай) dance has its roots in the period when the Sakha people lived further south and were cattle-breeders, termed "sun worshippers".{{clarify|date=September 2017}} It is a native dance that combines three forms of art: dancing, singing and poetry. The Sakha word for "dance", ''yungkyu'' (Yңкүү) comes from the verb ''ungk'' (Yң, "to worship").

The Ohuokhai is a simultaneous round dance and song. Dancers form a circle and dance, arm in arm, hand in hand, with the left foot put forward, while making rhythmical, graceful movements with their bodies, legs, feet and arms. A lead singer improvises the lyrics and the other dancers repeat them. This Ohuokhai leader has a special talent not only for singing but also, what is more important, for poetic improvisation. There song leaders compete at the national Yhyakh festival for the best poetic expression, best song and biggest circle.

Poetic improvisation of the Ohuokhai represents one of the richest and oldest genres of Sakha folklore.

The melody of the Ohuokhai is put to many types of music, from marching tunes to operas. Kylyhakh is the special singing technique of vocal cord vibration. This technique gives a unique national Sakha colouring highly appreciated by experts in "throat singing". The Ohuokhai plays an important role in the development of the musical and choreographic arts.

A famous folk singer, poet and composer, Sergey Zverev from the Suntarsky region added many new elements in the expressiveness of the movements.
