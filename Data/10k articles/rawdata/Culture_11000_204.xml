The '''Agate Bowl''' ({{lang-de|Achatschale}}) is a bowl cut out of a single piece of [[agate]] in the fourth century at the court of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], and now displayed in the [[Imperial Treasury (Vienna)|Imperial Treasury]] at the [[Hofburg Palace]] in [[Vienna]], Austria.&lt;ref name="leithe"&gt;Leithe-Jasper 2004, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries it was widely regarded as the "greatest masterpiece" and the "best and most important piece" in the collection.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunst"&gt;Kunsthistorisches Museum 1991, pp. 111–14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1564, Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian II]] and his brothers declared it by deed to be an "inalienable heirloom of the house of Austria".&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt; They valued this ancient precious stone carving, not just for its craftsmanship, but for a "natural miracle" in the stone itself that reveals a mysterious inscription—the name ''XRISTO'' (''Christ'') at the bottom of the bowl within the grain of the stone.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt; It is now generally believed that the inscription inspired the legend that the bowl was the [[Holy Grail]]. The Agate Bowl is the largest carved stone bowl in the world.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunst"/&gt;

==Description==
The Agate Bowl is 76 cm (30 in) wide including the handles.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt; The bowl is cut from a single, massive block of [[agate]], the largest carved stone bowl in the world.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunst"/&gt;

==History==
The Agate Bowl dates from the fourth century and is believed to have been created at the court of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]. Its first documented reference is in a deed from 1564 written by Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian II]] and his brothers, declaring the bowl to be an "inalienable heirloom of the house of Austria",&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunst"/&gt; to be owned by the entire [[House of Habsburg]]. In 1619, an inventory of the estate of Holy Roman Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] records, "the word KRISTO is to be seen in quite large letters in the nature of the stone".&lt;ref name="kunst"/&gt;

From the seventeenth to the twentieth century, documented descriptions of an inscription ''B.XRISTO.RI.XXPP'' was seen as a reference to [[Jesus Christ]]. Because the writing seemed to be neither painted nor carved in the bowl, but appeared in the natural veining of the stone itself, the Agate Bowl was regarded a relic, even considered to be the [[Holy Grail]].

In 1951, after the relic was [[Antiques restoration|restored]], the inscription was reinterpreted by art historian Rudolf Egger to read ''ARISTO'', the name of the stone cutter. Others believe the inscription is in fact an optical illusion.

[[Metal]]s used for [[Architecture|architectural]] purposes include [[lead (metal)|lead]], for [[water pipes]], [[roofing material|roofing]], and windows; [[tin]], formed into [[tinplate]]; [[zinc]], [[copper]] and [[aluminium]], in a range of applications including roofing and decoration; and [[iron]], which has structural and other uses in the form of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]], or made into [[steel]]. Metal [[alloy]]s used in building include [[bronze]] (mainly copper and tin); [[brass]] (copper and zinc); [[monel metal]] and [[nickel silver]], mainly consisting of nickel and copper; and [[stainless steel]], with important components of nickel and [[chromium]].

== Metal types ==

=== Lead ===
The low [[melting point]] of lead permitted its use on a wide scale throughout human history. [[Water pipes]] were frequently constructed of lead, until its health hazards were publicised in the late 19th century.

Lead has been a popular [[roofing material]] for centuries, being used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, and conductor heads. Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep roofs experienced creep. Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the [[mid-Atlantic states]], experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a roofing material called “[[terne]]” or “terneplate” was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin [[alloy]]. It is frequently confused with [[tinplate]].&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead [[came]] was also frequently used for window panes in skylights and stained glass. It was also used for small pieces of sculpture and garden ornamentation. Lead was frequently added to paint, with red lead used as an anti-corrosive pigment for iron, and white lead used as paint for wooden houses. [[Lead-based paint]] was one of the most durable materials developed as a protective exterior coating. The use of lead paint has been restricted on most buildings, due to concerns of [[lead poisoning]].

=== Tin ===
The principal architectural uses of [[tin]] fall into two categories: the alloying of tin with other metals such as [[copper]] to form [[bronze]], and the coating of tin on harder metals, such as tinplated iron or steel. Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90% copper and 10% tin, although the content may vary widely. The term “tin ceiling” is a misnomer, as these decorative sheets were never tinned; they were almost always painted sheet iron or steel.

[[Tinplate]] was a type of architectural material consisting of sheet iron coated with tin. “Tin roofs,” a type of tinplate, was originally used for armor but eventually as a roofing material. Tinplate was also used for decoration, such as ornamental windows, door lintels. Although tinplate is still available today for roofing and flashing, it is generally considered expensive since the initial cost is more than that for common modern roofing types such as [[asphalt]] shingles or built-up roofs. A well-maintained tinplate roof typically lasts several times longer than either of these types of roofing, and is more economical when the longer lifespan is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zinc ===
Pure [[zinc]] was used for roofing in Belgium, France and Germany, where it replaced more expensive copper and lead in roofing. Starting in the 1820s, Belgian sheet zinc was imported in America, used by builders in New York City and elsewhere. Pure zinc is subject to creep at ordinary temperatures.

Zinc-coated metals were first [[patented]] in 1837, separately by M. Sorel in France and H. W. Crawford in England. The methods employed a “hot dipping” process to coat sheet iron with zinc. By 1839 “galvanized” sheet iron roofing was being used in New York City. The Merchant's Exchange in Manhattan was one of the first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters. Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs, a popular technique in the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 15-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinc was also cast for sculptures and decorative elements in Germany and Austria as early as 1832. Decorative architectural elements were frequently cast in zinc, since it molded readily, was inexpensive compared to stone, and could be painted to imitate more expensive metals.

[[Zinc oxide]] paints were nontoxic and resistant to [[pollution]]. They became commercially successful and readily available in America in about 1850 and used widely starting around the 1870s. They had the added benefit of being good rust inhibitors on iron and steel.

During the early decades of the 20th century, the use of pure zinc roofing and ornament decreased in use in the US. It is now gaining popularity in its pure form (99.95%)for building materials. Typically, architectural grade zinc is 99.995 percent pure zinc with trace amounts of titanium, to reduce coefficient of thermal expansion and improve tensile strength and hardness, and copper to improve workability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Layne|title=Architectural Zinc: From Gray to Green|url=http://construction.com/CE/articles/0712rheinzink-2.asp|website=construction.com|publisher=McGraw Hill Construction|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact alloy composition is subject to manufacturer and is a color determinant in zinc's final [[patina]].  Over time, zinc develops its distinctive patina, transforming from a shiny silver to a matte bluish-grey.  Pre patinated finishes are available from certain manufacturers to expedite the natural patination process.  Zinc is still used in alloys such as [[brass]] and [[nickel silver]], and in the [[electroplating]] of steel as well. Today, [[galvanized steel]] and pure zinc material, usually Double Locked Standing Seam panels, are used for roofing a variety of buildings. Creep has been reduced by the introduction of [[titanium]] in most architectural zinc available in North America. Galvanized nails and sheet metal ducts are also common.

Architectural grade zinc is 90 to 95% recycled.  Replacement costs are negligible with a long lifetime of 80 to 100 years for zinc roofing and 200 to 300 years for wall systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zinc|url=http://www.metaltech-usa.com/zinc.html|website=www.metaltech-usa.com|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This long-life durability is a key component in durability.  At the end of its service life, zinc building products can be recycled indefinitely without loss to chemical or physical properties.  The use of architectural grade zinc can help building qualify for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification due to its high recycled content and sustainability.

=== Copper and its alloys ===
{{Main article|Copper in architecture}}

[[Copper]] is a very durable metal, withstanding [[corrosion]] when forming a bluish-green [[patina]] that variably consists of copper [[carbonates]], [[sulfates]], [[sulfides]], and [[chloride]]s. Sheet copper used as roofing is lighter than wooden shingles and much lighter than slate, tile, or lead. Roofing copper can be folded readily into waterproof seams, or shaped over curved frameworks for [[cupolas]] and domes.

The initial cost of copper was traditionally high, but its length of service more than compensated for the price. Copper could also be shaped to the bends and angles around chimneys and at roof edges and dormers. All nails, screws, bolts, and cleats used with sheet copper must be made of copper or a copper alloy, otherwise galvanic action between the dissimilar metals would occur, causing deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 22-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper was also used for decorative purposes, including architectural ornaments or sculptures. One famous example is the [[Statue of Liberty]].

Copper alloys used in architecture include [[bronze]], an alloy of copper and tin, and [[brass]], an alloy of copper and zinc.

=== Nickel and its alloys ===
Although somewhat rare, [[nickel]] has been used for plating architectural details. Nickel is most frequently used for building components in the form of alloys: [[nickel silver]], [[Monel metal]], and [[stainless steel]].

Nickel silver was originally called “German Silver,” until World War I. It has been called “white brass” but probably should be termed “nickel brass,” because it generally contains 75% copper, 20% nickel, and 5% zinc. Different percentages result in a range of colors, including silvery-white, yellow, slight blue, green or pink. Nickel silver hardware was popular in the US during the [[Art Deco]] and Depression Modern periods. Architects and designers preferred nickel silver because it could take and retain appropriate finishes, and it resisted corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monel metal is an alloy of approximately two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It is similar to platinum in color. Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] Terminal in New York City in 1909. In 1936, the copper roof on the [[New York City Public Library]] at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a Monel metal roof. Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be brazed, welded, or soldered in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced. Following the war, stainless steel and aluminium replaced Monel because of lower production costs.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 35-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron and its alloys ===
Iron has become an important architectural building component. It has been used in four common forms: wrought iron, cast iron, sheet iron, and steel.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 42-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wrought iron]] was used for minor structural and decorative elements starting in the 18th century. Until the mid-19th century, the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as tie rods, straps, nails, and hardware, or to decorative ironwork in balconies, railings fences and gates. Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to roll rails, bulb-tees, and eventually I-beams. It was also used for decorative purposes, such as ornamental balconies or hardware. Since wrought iron is handmade, no two pieces are identical.

[[Cast iron]] was a major 19th century building material of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Although brittle, it is remarkably strong in compression. It was frequently used for structural purposes, such as columns, building fronts, domes and light courts. Decorative uses have included stairs, elevators, lintels, grilles, verandas, balconies, railings, fences, streetlights, and tombs. The [[Bradbury Building]] is an example of extensive decorative cast iron. Today, cast iron is used for plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction, and its structural and decorative use is used occasionally through historic preservation practices.

Sheet iron can be subject to rapid corrosion, forming rust. Sheet iron was used throughout the 19th century, although it is not clear how widespread sheet iron roofs became. Pressed decorative sheet iron used for ceilings was frequently called a “tin ceiling,” although tin was generally not used indoors.

[[Steel]] was introduced to the construction industry at the end of the 19th century. The development of structural steel in the mid-19th century allowed construction of tall buildings. Builders and manufacturers turned to steel, which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension. When the [[Bessemer process]] was developed in England in 1856, and the open-hearth process was invented, steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical. Bridges, railroad companies, and skyscrapers were among the first large-scale uses of structural steel. Although iron and steel are not combustible, they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat. Almost all structural steel must be “fireproofed” in some manner, utilizing a cladding of [[terra-cotta]], tile, plaster-poured concrete, sprayed concrete, or sprayed [[Building insulation|insulation]]. Ferro concrete, also called [[reinforced concrete]], was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete.

Decorative steels used in buildings include:
* [[Stainless steel]], a chromium-nickel steel, developed between 1903 and 1912. Its most important property is its resistance to corrosion. It contains about 18% chromium and 8-12% nickel. Stainless steel is expensive, so it was used primarily as a nonstructural metal or where there is a high potential for corrosion. One of the most extensive early uses of stainless steel was in the [[Chrysler Building]].
* Copper-bearing steels, containing from .15% to .25% copper, develop increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion, when compared to ordinary steel, by forming a protective oxide coating, having a uniform deep brown color and texture. [[Eero Saarinen]] experimented with the material in the [[Deere and Company]] building in 1964.

=== Aluminium ===
Much like copper, [[Aluminium]] is highly resistant to [[corrosion]]. It also has the added benefit of being a third lighter than steel with comparable strength. Aluminium can also be easily and repeatedly recycled. It has been estimated that of the estimated 900 million tonnes of aluminium produced since 1880, three quarters is still in productive use, 35% of which is in building construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://recycling.world-aluminium.org/review/global-metal-flow.html|title = Global Metal Flow|date = |accessdate = 2014-08-15|website = Aluminium for Future Generations|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminum|Aluminium]] was unavailable at reasonable cost or in sufficient quantities for general architectural use until after the beginning of the 20th century. Architectural use of aluminum increased in the 1920s, mainly for decorative detailing. It was used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, wall panels, and spandrels. Art Deco designs frequently used aluminum for ornamental features. The first extensive use of aluminum in construction was the [[Empire State Building]], where the entire tower portion is aluminum, as well as many decorative features, such as the entrances, elevator doors, ornamental trim, and some 6,000 window [[spandrels]]. Today, aluminum is used frequently in construction except major structural members.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 84-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Educational Psychologists''' is a [[trade union]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The [[British Psychological Society]] represented [[educational psychologist]]s until 1962, when it received [[Chartered (professional)|chartered]] status.  Those members who wished to remain part of a body able to negotiate on their behalf formed the "Association of Educational Psychologists", although it delegated the actual negotiations to the [[National Union of Teachers (UK)|National Union of Teachers]] and the [[Ulster Teachers Union]].&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, ''Historical Directory of Trade Unions'', p.410&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the organisation took over negotiation duties from the National Union of Teachers, and in 1999, it affiliated to the [[Trades Union Congress]].  It only began accepting members in Scotland in 2003.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''Baltistics''' is a multidisciplinary study of language and culture (history, literature, folklore, mythology) of the [[Balts|Baltic nations]]. Baltistics by its subject splits into Lithuanistics, Latvistics, Prussistics, etc. Special attention is paid to the language studies, especially to the Baltic protolanguage.
Currently there are about 30 centres of Baltistics, most of them based in Europe, the [[Vilnius University|University of Vilnius]] considered to be the most active centre.

[[File:LT-2014-10litų-Baltistika-b.png|thumb|200px|right|A commemorative [[Lithuanian litas]] coin, dedicated to Baltistics, depicts an [[amber]] disk from the [[Neolithic]] era]]

First signs of researching and comparing of the [[Baltic languages]] – [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] – were seen in the writings of the grammar creators ([[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]], ''Grammatica Litvanica'' 1653, [[Gotthard Friedrich Stender]], ''Lettische Grammatik'' 1783). For the first time, scientifically Baltic languages were researched and compared with other [[Indo-European languages]] in the 19th century, when [[Franz Bopp]] in 1816 laid the ground for [[comparative linguistics]]. In his ''Vergleichende Grammatik'', published in 1833, Lithuanian was included. [[Prussian language]] was researched by [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] (''Die Sprache der alten Preussen an ihren Ueberresten erlaeutert'', 1845) and [[Erich Berneker]] (''Die preussische Sprache'', 1896). It was Nesselmann who first suggested the term "Baltic languages".

From 1718 to 1944, a seminar for the study of the Lithuanian language took place in the [[University of Königsberg]].

{{History of Western art music}}'''Baroque music''' ({{IPAc-en|US|b|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|k}}) is a period or style of Western [[art music]] composed from approximately 1600 to 1750.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}} This era followed the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance music era]], and was followed in turn by the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. Baroque music forms a major portion of the "[[Western art music|classical music]]" [[Western canon|canon]], and is now widely studied, performed, and listened to. Key composers of the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Tomaso Albinoni]], [[François Couperin]], [[Giuseppe Tartini]], [[Heinrich Schütz]],  [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], and [[Johann Pachelbel]].&lt;!--At 19 names, this list is already too long for a list of "key" composers. If you must add a name you think is more important than one of those already in the list, please delete a less-important name.--&gt;

The Baroque period saw the creation of [[Common practice period|common-practice]] [[tonality]], an approach to writing music in which a song or piece is written in a particular [[Key (music)|key]]; this kind of arrangement has continued to be used in almost all Western [[popular music]]. During the Baroque era, professional musicians were expected to be accomplished [[music improvisation|improvisers]] of both solo melodic lines and [[accompaniment]] parts. Baroque concerts were typically accompanied by a [[basso continuo]] group (comprising chord-playing instrumentalists such as [[harpsichord]]ists and [[lute]] players improvising chords from a [[figured bass]] part) while a group of bass instruments—[[viol]], [[cello]], [[double bass]]—played the [[bassline]]. A characteristic Baroque form was the [[Suite (music)#Dance suite|dance suite]]. While the pieces in a dance suite were inspired by actual dance music, dance suites were designed purely for listening, not for accompanying dancers.

During the period, composers and performers used more elaborate{{Clarify|reason=More elaborate than what? Than the ornamentation in the [[Faenza Codex]] (ca.1400)? Than Renaissance virtuosos like [[Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego]], [[Diego Ortiz]], or [[Girolamo Della Casa]]?|date=August 2016}} [[musical ornamentation]] (typically improvised by performers), made changes in musical notation (the development of figured bass as a quick way to notate the [[chord progression]] of a song or piece), and developed new instrumental playing techniques. Baroque music expanded the size, range, and complexity of instrumental performance, and also established the mixed vocal/instrumental forms of [[opera]], [[cantata]] and [[oratorio]] and the instrumental forms of the solo [[concerto]] and [[sonata]] as musical genres. Many musical terms and concepts from this era, such as [[toccata]], [[fugue]] and [[concerto grosso]] are {{As of|2018|alt=still in use in the 2010s}}. Dense, complex [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music, in which multiple independent melody lines were performed simultaneously (a popular example of this is the [[fugue]]), was an important part of many Baroque choral and instrumental works.

The term "[[baroque]]" comes from the Portuguese word ''barroco'', meaning "[[baroque pearl|misshapen pearl]]".{{sfn|Mackay and Romanec|2007}} Negative connotations of the term first occurred in 1734, in a criticism of an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau, and later (1750) in a description by [[Charles de Brosses]] of the ornate and heavily ornamented architecture of the [[Palazzo Pamphilj|Pamphili Palace]] in Rome. Although the term continued to be applied to architecture and art criticism through the 19th century, it was not until the 20th century that the term "baroque" was adopted from [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s art-history vocabulary to designate a historical period in music.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Sebastian Bach]], 1748]]

The term "baroque" is generally used by music historians to describe a broad range of styles from a wide geographic region, mostly in Europe, composed over a period of approximately 150 years.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}} Although it was long thought that the word as a critical term was first applied to architecture, in fact it appears earlier in reference to music, in an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau's ''Hippolyte et Aricie,'' printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734. The critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.{{sfn|Palisca|1989|pp=7–8}}

The systematic application by historians of the term "baroque" to music of this period is a relatively recent development. In 1919, [[Curt Sachs]] became the first to apply the five characteristics of [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s theory of the Baroque systematically to music.{{sfn|Sachs|1919|pp=7–15}} Critics were quick to question the attempt to transpose Wölfflin's categories to music, however, and in the second quarter of the 20th century independent attempts were made by [[Manfred Bukofzer]] (in Germany and, after his immigration, in America) and by Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune (in Belgium) to use autonomous, technical analysis rather than comparative abstractions, in order to avoid the adaptation of theories based on the plastic arts and literature to music. All of these efforts resulted in appreciable disagreement about time boundaries of the period, especially concerning when it began. In English the term acquired currency only in the 1940s, in the writings of Bukofzer and [[Paul Henry Lang]].{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}

As late as 1960, there was still considerable dispute in academic circles, particularly in France and Britain, whether it was meaningful to lump together music as diverse as that of [[Jacopo Peri]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] under a single rubric. Nevertheless, the term has become widely used and accepted for this broad range of music.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}} It may be helpful to distinguish the Baroque from both the preceding (Renaissance) and following ([[Classical music|Classical]]) periods of musical history.

==History==
The Baroque period is divided into three major phases: early, middle, and late. Although they overlap in time, they are conventionally dated from  1580 to 1630, from 1630 to 1680, and from 1680 to 1730.{{sfn|Bukofzer|1947|pp=17}}

===Early baroque music (1580–1630)===
{{details|Transition from Renaissance to Baroque in instrumental music}}
[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|[[Claudio Monteverdi]] in 1640]]

The [[Florentine Camerata]] was a group of humanists, musicians, poets and intellectuals in late Renaissance Florence who gathered under the patronage of Count [[Giovanni de' Bardi]] to discuss and guide trends in the arts, especially music and [[drama]]. In reference to music, they based their ideals on a perception of Classical (especially [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]) musical drama that valued discourse and oration.{{sfn|Nuti|2007|p=14}} As such, they rejected their contemporaries' use of [[polyphony]] (multiple, independent melodic lines) and instrumental music, and discussed such ancient Greek music devices as [[monody]], which consisted of a solo singing accompanied by a [[kithara]] (an ancient strummed string instrument).{{sfn|Wallechinsky|2007|p=445}} The early realizations of these ideas, including [[Jacopo Peri]]'s ''[[Dafne]]'' and ''[[Euridice (Peri)|L'Euridice]]'', marked the beginning of opera,{{sfn|Chua|2001|p=26}} which were a catalyst for Baroque music.{{sfn|Wainwright and Holman|2005|p=4}}

Concerning music theory, the more widespread use of ''[[figured bass]]'' (also known as ''thorough bass'') represents the developing importance of [[harmony]] as the linear underpinnings of polyphony.{{sfn|Clarke|1898|pp=147–48}} Harmony is the end result of [[counterpoint]], and figured bass is a visual representation of those harmonies commonly employed in musical performance. With figured bass, numbers, accidentals or symbols were placed above the [[bassline]] that was read by [[keyboard instrument]] players such as [[harpsichord]] players or [[pipe organ]]ists (or [[lute]]nists). The numbers, accidentals or symbols indicated to the keyboard player what intervals she should play above each bass note. The keyboard player would [[music improvisation|improvise]] a [[chord voicing]] for each bass note.{{sfn|Haagmans|1916|p=vi}} Composers began concerning themselves with [[Chord progression|harmonic progressions]],{{sfn|York|1909|p=109}} and also employed the [[tritone]], perceived as an unstable interval,{{sfn|Donington|1974|p=156}} to create dissonance (it was used in the [[dominant seventh]] chord and the [[Diminished triad|diminished chord]]. An interest in harmony had also existed among certain composers in the Renaissance, notably [[Carlo Gesualdo]];{{sfn|Watkins|1991|p=103}} However, the use of harmony directed towards tonality (a focus on a musical [[key (music)|key]] that becomes the "home note" of a piece), rather than [[Mode (music)|modality]], marks the shift from the Renaissance into the Baroque period.{{sfn|Norton|1984|p=24}} This led to the idea that certain sequences of chords, rather than just notes, could provide a sense of [[Cadence (music)|closure at the end of a piece]]—one of the fundamental ideas that became known as [[tonality]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

By incorporating these new aspects of composition, [[Claudio Monteverdi]] furthered the transition from the Renaissance style of music to that of the Baroque period. He developed two individual styles of composition—the heritage of Renaissance polyphony ([[prima pratica]]) and the new [[basso continuo]] technique of the Baroque ([[seconda pratica]]). With basso continuo, a small group of musicians would play the [[bassline]] and the chords which formed the accompaniment for a [[melody]]. The basso continuo group would typically use one or more keyboard players and a [[lute]] player who would play the bassline and improvise the chords and several bass instruments (e.g., [[bass viol]], [[cello]], [[double bass]]) which would play the bassline. With the writing of the operas ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'' among others, Monteverdi brought considerable attention to this new genre.{{sfn|Carter and Chew|2013}}

===Middle baroque music (1630–1680)===
The rise of the centralized court is one of the economic and political features of what is often labelled the [[Absolutism (European history)|Age of Absolutism]], personified by [[Louis XIV]] of France. The style of palace, and the court system of manners and arts he fostered became the model for the rest of Europe. The realities of rising church and state patronage created the demand for organized public music, as the increasing availability of instruments created the demand for [[chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble of instrumentalists.{{sfn|Sadie |2013}}

[[File:Paul Mignard - Jean-Baptiste Lully.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] by [[Paul Mignard]]]]

The middle Baroque period in Italy is defined by the emergence of the vocal styles of [[cantata]], [[oratorio]], and [[opera]] during the 1630s, and a new concept of melody and harmony that elevated the status of the music to one of equality with the words, which formerly had been regarded as pre-eminent. The florid, coloratura monody of the early Baroque gave way to a simpler, more polished melodic style. These melodies were built from short, cadentially delimited ideas often based on stylized dance patterns drawn from the [[sarabande]] or the [[courante]]. The harmonies, too, might be simpler{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Under what conditions would they be simpler, and why might they not be?--&gt; than in the early Baroque monody, and the accompanying bass lines were more integrated with the melody, producing a contrapuntal equivalence of the parts that later led to the device of an initial bass anticipation of the aria melody. This harmonic simplification also led to a new formal device of the differentiation of [[recitative]] (a more spoken part of opera) and [[aria]] (a part of opera that used sung melodies). The most important innovators of this style were the Romans [[Luigi Rossi]] and [[Giacomo Carissimi]], who were primarily composers of cantatas and oratorios, respectively, and the Venetian [[Francesco Cavalli]], who was principally an opera composer. Later important practitioners of this style include [[Antonio Cesti]], [[Giovanni Legrenzi]], and [[Alessandro Stradella]].{{sfn|Bukofzer|1947|pp=118–21}}

The middle Baroque had absolutely no bearing on the theoretical work of [[Johann Fux]], who systematized the strict counterpoint characteristic of earlier ages in his ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' (1725).{{sfn|White and Hochradner|2013}}{{Clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--What is the point of this remark, and why does it mention middle Baroque music in particular?--&gt;

One pre-eminent example of a court style composer is [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. He purchased patents from the monarchy to be the sole composer of operas for the French king and to prevent others from having operas staged. He completed 15 lyric tragedies and left unfinished ''Achille et Polyxène''.{{sfn|La Gorce|2001}} Lully was an early example of a [[conducting|conductor]]; he would beat the time with a large staff to keep his ensembles together.

Musically, he did not establish the string-dominated norm for orchestras, which was inherited from the Italian opera, and the characteristically [[Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi|French five-part disposition]] (violins, violas—in hautes-contre, tailles and quintes sizes—and [[bass violin]]s) had been used in the ballet from the time of Louis XIII. He did, however, introduce this ensemble to the lyric theatre, with the upper parts often doubled by recorders, flutes, and oboes, and the bass by bassoons. Trumpets and [[kettledrum]]s were frequently added for heroic scenes.{{sfn|La Gorce|2001}}

[[File:arcangelo corelli.jpg|thumb|[[Arcangelo Corelli]]|left|upright=0.7]][[Arcangelo Corelli]] is remembered as influential for his achievements on the other side of musical technique—as a violinist who organized violin technique and pedagogy—and in purely instrumental music, particularly his advocacy and development of the [[concerto grosso]].{{sfn|Talbot|2001a}} Whereas Lully was ensconced at court, Corelli was one of the first composers to publish widely and have his music performed all over Europe. As with Lully's stylization and organization of the opera, the concerto grosso is built on strong contrasts—sections alternate between those played by the full orchestra, and those played by a smaller group. Dynamics were "terraced", that is with a sharp transition from loud to soft and back again. Fast sections and slow sections were juxtaposed against each other. Numbered among his students is [[Antonio Vivaldi]], who later composed hundreds of works based on the principles in Corelli's [[trio sonata]]s and concerti.{{sfn|Talbot|2001a}}

In contrast to these composers, [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] was not a creature of court but instead was church musician, holding the posts of organist and Werkmeister at the Marienkirche at Lübeck. His duties as Werkmeister involved acting as the secretary, treasurer, and business manager of the church, while his position as organist included playing for all the main services, sometimes in collaboration with other instrumentalists or vocalists, who were also paid by the church. Entirely outside of his official church duties, he organised and directed a concert series known as the [[Abendmusik]]en, which included performances of sacred dramatic works regarded by his contemporaries as the equivalent of operas.{{sfn|Snyder|2001}}

===Late baroque music (1680–1730)===
[[File:Retrato de Handel.jpg|thumb|[[George Frideric Handel]]]]{{Expand section|date=July 2014}}

The work of George Frideric Handel, Johann Sebastian Bach and their contemporaries, including Domenico Scarlatti, Antonio Vivaldi, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Georg Philipp Telemann, and others advanced the Baroque era to its climax.{{sfn|Sadie|2002}} Through the work of [[Johann Fux]], the Renaissance style of polyphony was made the basis for the study of composition for future musical eras. The composers of the late baroque had established their feats of composition long before the works of Johann Fux.{{sfn|White and Hochradner|2013}}

A continuous worker, Handel borrowed from other composers and often "recycled" his own material. He was also known for reworking pieces such as the famous ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', which premiered in 1742, for available singers and musicians.{{sfn|Burrows|1991|page=22}}

A characteristic of the Baroque form was the [[Suite (music)#Dance suite|dance suite]]. Some [[Bach Suites|dance suites by Bach]] are called [[partita]]s, although this term is also used for other collections of pieces. While the pieces in a dance suite were inspired by actual dance music, dance suites were designed for listening, not for accompanying dancers. Composers used a variety of different dance movements in their dance suites. A dance suite often consists of the following [[movement (music)|movements]]:
* [[French overture|Overture]]&amp;nbsp;– The Baroque suite often began with a French overture ("Ouverture" in French), a slow movement which was followed by a succession of dances of different types, principally the following four:
* [[Allemande]]&amp;nbsp;– Often the first dance of an instrumental [[suite (music)|suite]], the allemande was a very popular dance that had its origins in the German [[Renaissance]] era. The allemande was played at a moderate [[tempo]] and could start on any beat of the bar.{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}{{sfn|Estrella|2012}}
* [[Courante]]&amp;nbsp;– The second dance is the courante, a lively, French dance in [[triple meter]]. The Italian version is called the corrente.{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}{{sfn|Estrella|2012}}
* [[Sarabande]]&amp;nbsp;– The sarabande, a Spanish dance, is the third of the four basic dances, and is one of the slowest of the baroque dances. It is also in triple meter and can start on any beat of the bar, although there is an emphasis on the second beat, creating the characteristic 'halting', or iambic rhythm of the sarabande.{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}{{sfn|Estrella|2012}}
* [[Gigue]]&amp;nbsp;– The gigue is an upbeat and lively baroque dance in compound meter, typically the concluding movement of an instrumental suite, and the fourth of its basic dance types. The gigue can start on any beat of the bar and is easily recognized by its rhythmic feel. The gigue originated in the [[British Isles]]. Its counterpart in [[folk music]] is the [[jig]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}{{sfn|Estrella|2012}}

These four dance types (allemande, courante, sarabande, and gigue) make up the majority of 17th-century suites; later suites interpolate one or more additional dances between the sarabande and gigue:
* [[Gavotte]]&amp;nbsp;– The gavotte can be identified by a variety of features; it is in {{music|time|4|4}} time and always starts on the third beat of the bar, although this may sound like the first beat in some cases, as the first and third beats are the strong beats in quadruple time. The gavotte is played at a moderate tempo, although in some cases it may be played faster.{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}
* [[Bourrée]]&amp;nbsp;– The bourrée is similar to the gavotte as it is in {{music|time|2|2}} time, although it starts on the second half of the last beat of the bar, creating a different feel to the dance. The bourrée is commonly played at a moderate tempo, although for some composers, such as Handel, it can be taken at a much faster tempo.{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}{{sfn|Mackay and Romanec|2007}}
* [[Minuet]]&amp;nbsp;– The minuet is perhaps the best-known of the baroque dances in triple meter. It can start on any beat of the bar. In some suites there may be a Minuet I and II, played in succession, with the Minuet I repeated.{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}
* [[Passepied]]&amp;nbsp;– The passepied is a fast dance in binary form and triple meter that originated as a court dance in [[Brittany]].{{sfn|Little|2001a}} Examples can be found in later suites such as those of Bach and Handel.{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}
* [[Rigaudon]]&amp;nbsp;– The rigaudon is a lively French dance in duple meter, similar to the bourrée, but rhythmically simpler. It originated as a family of closely related southern-French folk dances, traditionally associated with the provinces of Vavarais, [[Languedoc]], [[Dauphiné]], and [[Provence]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1997}}{{sfn|Little|2001b}}

Additionally, there are numerous other dance forms as well as other pieces that could be included in a suite, such as [[Polonaise]], [[Loure]], [[Scherzo]], [[Air]], etc.

===Other features===
* ''[[Prelude (music)|Prelude]]''&amp;nbsp;– a suite might be started by a prelude, a slow piece written in an improvisatory style. Some Baroque preludes were not fully written out; instead, a sequence of chords were indicated, with the expectation that the instrumentalist would be able to improvise a melodic part using the indicated harmonic framework. The prelude was not based on a type of dance.
* ''[[Entrée (ballet)|Entrée]]''&amp;nbsp;– Sometimes an entrée is composed as part of a suite; but there it is purely instrumental music and no dance is performed. It is an introduction, a march-like piece played during the entrance of a dancing group, or played before a ballet. Usually in {{music|time|4|4}} time. It is related to the Italian 'intrada'.
* ''[[Basso continuo]]''&amp;nbsp;– a kind of continuous accompaniment notated with a new music notation system, [[figured bass]], usually for one or more sustaining bass instruments (e.g., [[cello]]) and one or more chord-playing instruments (e.g., keyboard instruments such as [[harpsichord]], [[pipe organ]] or [[lute]])
* The [[concerto]] (a solo piece with orchestral accompaniment) and [[concerto grosso]]
* [[Monody]]&amp;nbsp;– an outgrowth of song{{sfn|Dorak|2008}}
* [[Homophony]]&amp;nbsp;– music with one melodic voice and rhythmically similar (and subordinate) chordal accompaniment (this and monody are contrasted with the typical Renaissance [[texture (music)|texture]], [[polyphony]]){{sfn|Hyer|2013}}
* Dramatic musical forms like opera, ''[[dramma per musica]]''{{sfn|Dorak|2008}}{{sfn|Shotwell|2002}}

'''Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle''' ({{IPA-fr|fɔ̃tənɛl|lang}}; 11 February 1657{{spaced ndash}}9 January 1757),&lt;ref&gt;{{DSB |first=Suzanne | last=Delorme | title=Fontenelle, Bernard Le Bouyer (or Bovier) De | volume=5 | pages=57–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''Bernard Le Bouyer de Fontenelle''', was a French author and an influential member of three of the academies of the [[Institut de France]], noted especially for his accessible treatment of scientific topics during the unfolding of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Biography==
Fontenelle was born in [[Rouen]], France (then the capital of [[Normandy]]) and died in Paris just one month before his 100th birthday.  His mother was the sister of great French dramatists [[Pierre Corneille|Pierre]] and [[Thomas Corneille]]. His father, François le Bovier de Fontenelle, was a lawyer who worked in the provincial court of Rouen and came from a family of lawyers from Alençon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fontenelle biography|url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Fontenelle.html|website = www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained in the law but gave up after one case, devoting his life to writing about [[philosophers]] and scientists, especially defending the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] tradition.&lt;ref name="MadameGeoffrin"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlYvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Fontenelle+Madame+Helvetius&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html |title='&amp;#39;Madame Geoffrin'&amp;#39; by Janet Aldis |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the undoubted merit and value of his writings, both to the laity and the scientific community, there is no question of his being a primary contributor to the field. He was a commentator and explicator and occasionally a passionate, though generally good-humoured, controversialist.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;Grégoire François. Le dernier défenseur des tourbillons : Fontenelle.. In: Revue d'histoire des sciences et de leurs applications,
tome 7, n°3, 1954. pp. 220-246. doi : 10.3406/rhs.1954.3438 http://www.persee.fr/doc/rhs_0048-7996_1954_num_7_3_343&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at the college of the [[Jesuits]], the ''[[Lycée Pierre Corneille (Rouen)|Lycée Pierre Corneille]]'' (although it did not adopt the name of his uncle (Pierre Corneille) until 1873, about 200 years later).&lt;ref name="LyCo6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/spip.php?article6 |title=Lycée Pierre Corneille de Rouen – History |publisher=Lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr |date=19 April 1944 |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Lycée he showed a preference for literature and distinguished himself.

==Early work==
He began as a poet, writing a poem in Latin at the age of 13 and more than once competed for prizes of the [[Académie française]], but he never won anything. He visited Paris from time to time and became friendly with the [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre|abbé de Saint-Pierre]], the abbé [[Réné-Aubert Vertot|Vertot]] and the mathematician [[Pierre Varignon]]. He witnessed, in 1680, the total failure of his [[tragedy]] ''Aspar''.  Fontenelle afterwards acknowledged the public verdict by burning his unfortunate drama. His libretto for Pascal Collasse's ''[[Thétis et Pélée]]'' ("[[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]]"), which premiered at the Opéra de Paris in January, 1689, was received with great acclaim. 
{{French literature sidebar}}
His ''Lettres galantes du chevalier d'Her ...'', published anonymously in 1685, was a collection of letters portraying worldly society of the time.  It immediately made its mark. In 1686 his famous allegory of Rome and [[Geneva]], slightly disguised as the rival princesses Mreo and Eenegu, in the ''Relation de l'île de Bornéo'', gave proof of his daring in religious matters. But it was by his ''Nouveaux Dialogues des morts'' (1683) that Fontenelle established a genuine claim to high literary rank; and that claim was enhanced three years later by what has been summarised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

He wrote extensively on the nature of the [[universe]]: ''Behold a universe so immense that I am lost in it. I no longer know where I am. I am just nothing at all. Our world is terrifying in its insignificance.''

==Later work==
[[Image:Fontenelle - Élements de la geometrie de l'infini, 1727 - 1520530.jpg |thumb|''Éléments de la géométrie de l'infini'', 1727]]

Fontenelle had made his home in [[Rouen]], but in 1687 he moved to Paris; and in the same year he published his ''Histoire des oracles'', a book which made a considerable stir in theological and philosophical circles. It consisted of two essays, the first of which was designed to prove that oracles were not given by the supernatural agency of demons, and the second that they did not cease with the birth of Jesus. It excited the suspicion of the Church, and a [[Jesuit]], by name [[Jean-François Baltus]], published a ponderous refutation of it; but the peace-loving disposition of its author impelled him to leave his opponent unanswered. To the following year (1688) belongs his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'', in which he took the modern side in the controversy then raging; his ''Doutes sur le système physique des causes occasionnelles'' (against [[Nicolas Malebranche]]) appeared shortly afterwards.

He remained influential in his older years and when a then unknown [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] met him in 1742, when Fontenelle was 85, he passed on the advice he gave all young writers that came to him: "You must courageously offer your brow to laurel wreaths and your nose to blows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jean-Jacques Roussea: Restless Genius|author=Leo Damrosch|year=2007|publisher=Mariner Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noted [[gourmand]], he attributed his longevity to eating [[strawberries]]. At ninety-two one woman wrote that he was as lively as a man of twenty-two.&lt;ref name="MadameGeoffrin"/&gt; When, in his late nineties he met the beautiful [[Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, Madame Helvétius|Madame Helvétius]], he reportedly told her, "Ah Madame, if only I were eighty again!"&lt;ref name="80 again"&gt;{{cite book |title=Franklin of Philadelphia |page=327 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8njwnBl-QsC&amp;pg=PA327 |first=Esmond |last=Wright |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1988 |isbn=9780674318106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of the French Academy==
In 1691 he was received into the [[French Academy]] in spite of the determined efforts of the partisans of the "ancients", especially [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], who on four previous occasions had ensured his rejection. He was thus a member both of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|Academy of Inscriptions]] and of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]]; and in 1697 he became perpetual secretary to the latter, an office he held for forty-two years; and it was in this official capacity that he wrote the ''Histoire du renouvellement de l'Académie des Sciences'' (Paris, 3 vols., 1708, 1717, 1722) containing extracts and analyses of the proceedings, and also the ''éloges'' of the members, written with great simplicity and delicacy. Perhaps the best known of his ''éloges'', of which there are sixty-nine in all, is that of his uncle [[Pierre Corneille]]. This was first printed in the ''Nouvelles de la republique des lettres'' (January 1685) and, as ''Vie de Corneille'', was included in all the editions of Fontenelle's ''Œuvres.'' The other important works of Fontenelle are his ''Éléments de la géometrie de l'infini'' (1727) and his ''Théorie des tourbillons'' (1752). In the latter he supported the views of [[René Descartes]] concerning gravitation, material that by that time had effectively been superseded by the work of [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name="GF"/&gt;

He is noted for the accessibility of his work – particularly its novelistic style. This allowed non-scientists to appreciate scientific development in a time where this was unusual, and scientists to benefit from the thoughts of the greater society. If his writing is often seen as trying to popularize the astronomical theories of Descartes, whose greatest exponent he is sometimes considered, it also appealed to the literate society of the day to become more involved in "natural philosophy," thus enriching the work of [[17th century philosophy|early-Enlightenment]] scientists. In spite of the inarguable value and quality of his writings, he had no serious pretensions to original scientific or mathematical work, but did not let that stop him from outspoken support for Descartes' proposed conceptions of the roles of vortices in physics.&lt;ref name="GF"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Fontenelle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Portrait by [[Nicolas de Largillière]]]]
Fontenelle was a popular figure in the educated French society of his period, holding a position of esteem comparable only to that of [[Voltaire]]. Unlike Voltaire however, Fontenelle avoided making important enemies.  He balanced his penchant for universal critical thought with liberal doses of flattery and praise to the appropriate individuals in aristocratic society.

Fontenelle forms a link between two very widely different periods of French literature, that of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] on the one hand, and that of Voltaire, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] and [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] on the other. It is not in virtue of his great age alone that this can be said of him; he actually had much in common with the ''beaux esprits'' of the 17th century, as well as with the ''philosophes'' of the 18th. But it is to the latter rather than to the former period that he properly belongs.
According to [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], he deserves a place "''dans la classe des esprits infiniment distingués''"—distinguished, however, it ought to be added by intelligence rather than by intellect, and less by the power of saying much than by the power of saying a little well.
There have been several collected editions of Fontenelle's works, the first being printed in 3 vols. at [[the Hague]] in 1728–1729. The best is that of Paris, in 8 vols., 1790. Some of his separate works have been frequently reprinted and also translated. The ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds|Pluralité des mondes]]'' was translated into [[Greek language|modern Greek]] in 1794. [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] has an interesting essay on Fontenelle, with several useful references, in the ''Causeries du lundi'', vol. iii. See also [[Abel-Francois Villemain|Villemain]], ''Tableau de la littérature française au XVIIIe siècle''; the abbé Trublet, ''Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de la vie et des ouvrages de M. de Fontenelle'' (1759); A Laborde-Milaà, ''Fontenelle'' (1905), in the "''Grands écrivains français''" series; and L. Maigron, ''Fontenelle, l'homme, l'œuvre, l'influence'' (Paris, 1906).

His ''[[:fr:Dialogue des morts (Fontenelle)|Dialogues of the dead]]'' show both his erudition and wit, by presenting invented – but plausible – dialogues between dead ancients, dead moderns and a whole book devoted to dialogues between an ancient and a modern. To [[Montaigne]] asking him if some centuries had more wise men than other, [[Socrates]] answers sadly that "The general order of natures seems very constant". In one of the books [[Roxelane]] and [[Anne Boleyn]] discuss about politics and the way for a woman to decide a man to marry her. The dialog between [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] and [[Hernán Cortés|Cortez]] allows the former to dismiss some myths about the wisdom in ancient Greece by quoting some counter-examples.

In 1935, the [[lunar crater]] [[Fontenelle (crater)|Fontenelle]] was named after him.

'''Chaîne opératoire''' ([[French language|French]] for “operational chain” or “operational sequence”) is a term used throughout anthropological discourse, but is most commonly used in [[archaeology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]]. It functions as a methodological tool for analysing the technical processes and [[Social actions|social acts]] involved in the step-by-step [[Handicraft|production]], use, and eventual disposal of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], such as [[lithic reduction]] (the making of [[stone tool]]s) or [[pottery]].&lt;ref name=oxford_def&gt;{{cite web |title=Chaîne opératoire, definition from Answers.com |author=Timothy Darvill |date=2002|accessdate=2011-10-22 |work=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] and [[Answers.com]] |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/cha-ne-op-ratoire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 'chaîne opératoire' approach to lithic analysis |author=Roger Grace |year=1997 |accessdate=2011-10-22 |work=Stone Age Reference Collection |publisher=Institute of Archaeology, [[University of Oslo]], [[Norway]] |url=http://www3.hf.uio.no/sarc/iakh/lithic/opchainpaper.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225054001/http://www3.hf.uio.no/sarc/iakh/lithic/opchainpaper.html |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gosselain1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gosselain |first1=Oliver |year=1992 |title=Technology and Style: Potters and Pottery Among Bafia of Cameroon |journal=Man |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=559–586 |jstor=2803929 |doi=10.2307/2803929}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of technology as the science of human activities was first proposed by [[French people|French]] [[archaeologist]], [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and later by the [[History of science|historian of science]], André-Georges Haudricourt.&lt;ref name=oxford_def/&gt;&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soressi |first1=Marie |last2=Geneste |first2=Jean-Michel |year=2011 |title=Special Issue: Reduction Sequence, ''Chaîne Opératoire'', and Other Methods: The Epistemologies of Different Approaches to Lithic Analysis; The History and Efficacy of the ''Chaîne Opératoire'' Approach to Lithic Analysis: Studying Techniques to Reveal Past Societies in an Evolutionary Perspective |journal=PaleoAnthropology |page=336 |doi=10.4207/PA.2011.ART63 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 8, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both were students of [[Marcel Mauss]] who had earlier recognised that societies could be understood through its techniques by virtue of the fact that operational sequences are steps organised according to an internal logic specific to a society.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coupaye_440&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coupaye |first1=Ludovic |year=2009 |title=Ways of Enchanting: Chaînes Opératoires and Yam Cultivation in Nyamikum Village, Maprik, Papua New Guinea |journal=Journal of Material Culture |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=440 |doi=10.1177/1359183509345945}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 28, 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaîne opératoire was born out of the need to explicitly describe the methodology of [[lithic analysis]] in archaeological scholarship. It allows archaeologists to reconstruct the techniques used and the chronological ordering of the different steps required to produce an artifact.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; By understanding the processes and construction of tools, archaeologists can better determine the evolution of tool technology and the development of ancient cultures and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Forestier H, Zeitoun V, Winayalai C and Métais C 2013. The open-air site of Huai Hin (Northwestern Thailand): Chronological perspectives for the Hoabinhian. Comptes Rendus Palevol 12(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
Artifact analysis has undergone several changes throughout its history, shifting from an orientation as a natural science of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] humans to a social and cultural anthropology of the production techniques of prehistoric societies.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; From this perspective, a chaîne opératoire can be understood as a [[Social artifact|social product]], as it calls for an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach to artifact analysis (the integration of associated disciplines: [[archaeology]], [[sociocultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], and [[anthropological linguistics]]), which offers a multidimensional view of a society, and demonstrates how chaînes opératoires cannot operate independently of the society that produces it.&lt;ref name=Gosselain1/&gt; Consequently, the study of the technique - or chaîne opératoire - enables one to better understand not only the society in which the technique originated, but also the social context, actions, and [[cognition]] that accompanied the production of an object.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; 

==Criticism of chaîne opératoire==

Critics of chaîne opératoire argue that it is subjective because it is based upon the analyst's personal experience and intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monnier|first1=Gilliane F.|last2=Missal|first2=Kele|title=Another Mousterian Debate? Bordian facies, chaîne opératoire technocomplexes, and patterns of lithic variability in the western European Middle and Upper Pleistocene|journal=Quaternary International|date=November 2014|volume=350|pages=59–83|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2014.06.053}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They further claim that it is not a replicable or quantifiable approach to data collection. A second objection is that chaîne opératoire claims to be able to identify the intentions and goals of prehistoric knappers, including the "desired endproducts" of knapping sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar‐Yosef|first1=Ofer|last2=Van Peer|first2=Philip|title=The Chaîne Opératoire Approach in Middle Paleolithic Archaeology|journal=Current Anthropology|date=February 2009|volume=50|issue=1|pages=103–131|doi=10.1086/592234|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2960197/Bar-Yosef_ChaineOperatoireApproach.pdf?sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, what archaeologists select from an assemblage as 'end products' may not match what people in the past thought worthwhile to select for transport and subsequent use elsewhere in the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turq|first1=Alain|last2=Roebroeks|first2=Wil|last3=Bourguignon|first3=Laurence|last4=Faivre|first4=Jean-Philippe|title=The fragmented character of Middle Palaeolithic stone tool technology|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=November 2013|volume=65|issue=5|pages=641–655|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.07.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third major problem with the chaîne opératoire approach is that there is severe inconsistency in the application of definitions by lithic analysts. For example, since the publication of Boëda's definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boëda|first1=Eric|title=Le débitage Discoïde et le débitage Levallois récurrent centripète|journal=Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique Française,|date=1993|volume=90|page=392–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; of six nondisassociable criteria for Discoidal debitage,  numerous variants have been proposed, and many authors have argued for the presence of Levallois concept even when those six criteria were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draily|first1=C.|title=La Grotte Walou à Trooz (Belgique): Fouilles de 1996 à 2004 L'Archéologie.

The '''Citywide Educational Coalition''' (CWEC), is a tax-exempt, non-profit educational reform organization whose goal is to provide reliable and objective information on the Boston Public Schools to parents and citizens, enabling citizens to participate in policy making directly and through their school committee and increasing support for public education in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Boston City Archives"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spalding|first1=Sheila|title=Desegregation-era Records Collection|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/Guide%20to%20the%20Desegregation-era%20Records%20collection_tcm3-23340.PDF|publisher=Boston City Archives|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Citywide Education Coalition was created in Boston, Massachusetts in order to create a community agenda for the [[Boston Public Schools]]. Incorporated in 1973 with the mission of circulating clear and accurate information regarding education reform, the Coalition was actively involved in a number of major decisions influencing the Boston School System, including the desegregation of Boston Public Schools.

==Background==

The CWEC was formed in 1972 by Mary Ellen Smith, who brought together parents and concerned citizens from across Boston who felt a need for involvement in the selection of a new superintendent of Boston Public Schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote&gt;{{cite web|last1=Citywide Educational Coalition|title=Citywide Educational Coalition: Historical Note|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m130findbioghist.htm|website=Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group, composed of parents, teachers, school administrators, church groups, community groups and concerned individuals came together around several major issues facing the Boston Public Schools: the search for superintendent, the need to improve quality of education in public schools, the desegregation crisis in Boston and the lack of reliable and accurate information about schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; Since its founding, the CWEC has focused its energy on monitoring the implementation of the desegregation order, community organizing around educational issues, representing citizens in areas of educational decision making and on research and public information activities.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt;

==Desegregation of Boston Public Schools==
In the 1954 landmark case, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the legal basis for segregation within public schools is dismantled. The ruling declared that racial segregation violates the rights of United States citizens according to the Constitution, which guarantees equal protection of laws for all American citizens.

Eighteen years later, in 1972, de facto segregation still existed in the Boston Public School System as a result of school districting practices by geographical location, which remained largely segregated within the city. A class action suit was filed on behalf of fifteen parents and forty-three children, with Tallulah Morgan as lead plaintiff, in the case that would come to be known as Morgan v. Hennigan. At that time sixty-eight schools in Boston were racially imbalanced and 30,000 Boston students used public transportation to get to school. In 1974, [[Wendell Arthur Garrity Jr.|Judge W. Arthur Garrity]] sided with the plaintiffs in Morgan vs. Hennigan and stated Boston School Committee had engaged in segregation. Garrity then ordered the school committee to implement the State Board of Education's Racial Imbalance plan until they produced a plan of their own for desegregation. September 12, 1974 marked the first day of school under this new program. The anti-desegregation group Restore our Alienated Rights (ROAR) called for a two-week boycott of schools, which caused a violent reaction, especially in South Boston, and left eighteen school buses damaged citywide.&lt;ref name="Boston City Archives"/&gt;

During this time, members of the Citywide Educational Coalition (CWEC) shifted focus to support the needs of the Boston school system, as well as its students and parents during this unstable period. By disseminating accurate information to parents through the Rumor Control Center and its newsletters, reports and parent guides, the Coalition actively participated in the desegregation of Boston schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; Throughout this volatile process, the Coalition developed safety procedures in the schools and along the bus routes, worked with students, parents, teachers and school administrators to improve the educational experience.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; The CWEC developed a mailing list of over 3,000 people in neighborhoods across the city of racial and ethnic groups and also mobilized over 500 parent volunteers who worked to promote calm and diffuse violence in neighborhoods throughout the city, in the process gathering supporters with a continuing interest in bettering the school system as a whole.

By stepping into the space created by the failure of the Boston School Department and the city to distribute credible information on the desegregation of public schools, the CWEC continued to build its constituency. This expanding support, in combination with the unprecedented focus on public schools as a result of the desegregation orders created the perfect environment for the CWEC to use segregation related issues as a vehicle for pursuing broader educational reform.

==Projects==

The Citywide Educational Coalition (CWEC) has produced and widely circulated five major publications: Parents’ Guide to Magnet Schools (1977), Magnet School in Boston: A Guide for Parents and Students (1978), Survey of Magnet Schools in Three Cities (1978), Boston Public Schools: A Guide for Parents and Students (1979) and The Basic Skills Improvement Program: What Parents Should Expect (1979).&lt;ref name=Magnet&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelber|first1=Scott|title="The crux and the magic": The Political History of Boston Magnet Schools, 1968–1989|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=453–466|doi=10.1080/10665680802397632|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10665680802397632#.VFvOqvnF92W|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWEC has also recruited and trained a number of parent researchers to assist the Boston School Department in their production of the 1980 Guide to Elementary and Magnet Schools as well as publishing annual analyses of the Boston Public School Budget.&lt;ref name=Magnet/&gt;
These publications attempt to increase parent and citizen participation by providing clear, concise, objective information that is free of jargon and encourages parents and concerned citizens to act toward improving their child’s school and schools throughout the city.

Beginning in August 1974, the CWEC published a monthly newsletter first known as “Coalition” and later as “Common Ground.” Nearly 20,000 copies were distributed each month with the help of volunteers to households throughout the city of Boston.

One of CWEC’s major projects was the creation of BPS Watch, a program that requires the Coalition decide upon a single issue facing the Boston Public Schools, such as reading competency, and research it in depth. The goal is to find ways in which this specific issue can be addressed by both the school and the community to improve its function within the school system.

CWEC acts also in an advisory capacity and technical assistant to the School Department. Members have become focused on basic skill competency and have examined vocational/occupational education planning with Boston schools.

The Ottoman women's [[magazine]] '''''Demet''''' ("floral bouquet") was founded in 1908 in [[Istanbul]], two weeks after the proclamation of the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. Altogether, seven issues exist, they were published once a week.&lt;ref&gt;Demet, 1st volume, 1324.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Editor-in-chief]] and publisher was Celāl Sāhir (1883–1935). Even though the magazine was aimed at women, the editorial team of the first two issues was made up exclusively of men, such as [[Mehmet Akif Ersoy]] (1873–1936), Selim Sırrı (Tarcan) (1874–1957), and Enis Avni (1886-1958). Among the female writers were later [[Halide Edip Adıvar|Halide Salih Hanımlar]] (Halide Edip, 1884–1964), Nigar Bint-i Osman (1862–1918), and İsmet Hakkı Hanım. In addition to literary and scientific articles, what interested the female readers most were political publications.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Ruth Haerkötter: Maḥāsin. Ein Beispiel für die osmanische Frauenpresse der Zweiten konstitutionellen Periode, Wiesbaden 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Kadınlar Dünyası (1913–1921), Maḥāsin (1908–1910), and Kadın (1908–1910), &lt;ref&gt;Demet&lt;/ref&gt; is considered one of the first and most important women's magazines in the Second Constitutional Era.

'''Sir Edward Burnett Tylor''' (2 October 1832 – 2 January 1917) was an English [[anthropologist]], the founder of [[cultural anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Tylor, Edward Burnett|magazine= Who's Who|year= 1907|volume= 59|page= 1785|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor's ideas typify 19th-century [[unilineal evolution|cultural evolutionism]]. In his works ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) and ''Anthropology'' (1881), he defined the context of the scientific study of anthropology, based on the evolutionary theories{{which|date=February 2017}} of [[Charles Lyell]]. He believed that there was a functional basis for the development of society and religion, which he determined was universal. Tylor maintained that all societies passed through three basic stages of development: from [[Wild man|savagery]], through [[barbarian|barbarism]] to [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Long|first1= Heather|title= Social Evolutionism|url= http://www.anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Social%20Evolutionism|website= University of Alabama Department of Anthropology|accessdate= 6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor is a founding figure of the science of social anthropology, and his scholarly works helped to build the discipline of anthropology in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul Bohannan, ''Social Anthropology'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that "research into the history and [[prehistory]] of man... could be used as a basis for the reform of [[British society]]."&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Herbert S | year = 1998 | title = The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 716–731 | jstor=682051 | doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.3.716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor reintroduced the term ''[[animism]]'' (faith in the individual [[soul]] or ''anima'' of all things and [[nature|natural]] manifestations) into common use.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=animism "Animism"], ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', accessed 2 October 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;
He regarded animism as the first phase of development of religions.

==Early life and education==
He was born in 1832, in [[Camberwell]], [[London]], and was the son of Joseph Tylor and Harriet Skipper, part of a family of wealthy [[Quakers]] who owned a London brass factory. His elder brother, [[Alfred Tylor]], became a geologist.

He was educated at [[Grove House School]], [[Tottenham]], but due to the deaths of Tylor's parents during his early adulthood he never gained a university degree.&lt;ref name="Lowrie, Robert H. 1917 pp. 262–268"&gt;Lowrie, Robert H. (1917). "Edward B. Tylor", ''American Anthropologist,'' New Series Vol. 19, No. 2. (Apr. – Jun. 1917), pp. 262–268.&lt;/ref&gt; After his parents' deaths, he prepared to help manage the family business, but had to set this plan aside when he developed symptoms consistent with the onset of [[tuberculosis]] (TB). Following advice to spend time in warmer climes, Tylor left England in 1855, travelling to [[Mexico]]. The experience proved to be an important and formative one, sparking his lifelong interest in studying unfamiliar cultures.

During his travels, Tylor met [[Henry Christy]], a fellow [[Quaker]], [[ethnologist]] and [[archaeologist]]. Tylor's association with Christy greatly stimulated his awakening interest in anthropology, and helped broaden his inquiries to include prehistoric studies.

==Professional career==
[[File:E. B. Tylor portrait. Folk-Lore, vol. 28.png|thumb|upright|Portrait of the aged Tylor not long before his death; from ''Folk-Lore'', 1917.]]
Tylor's first publication was a result of his 1856 trip to Mexico with Christy.  His notes on the beliefs and practices of the people he encountered were the basis of his work ''Anahuac: Or Mexico and the Mexicans, Ancient and Modern'' (1861), published after his return to England. Tylor continued to study the customs and beliefs of tribal communities, both existing and prehistoric (based on archaeological finds). He published his second work, ''Researches into the Early History of Mankind and the Development of Civilization'', in 1865. Following this came his most influential work, ''Primitive Culture'' (1871). This was important not only for its thorough study of human civilisation and contributions to the emergent field of anthropology, but for its undeniable influence on a handful of young scholars, such as [[J. G. Frazer]], who were to become Tylor's disciples and contribute greatly to the scientific study of [[anthropology]] in later years.

Tylor was appointed Keeper of the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|University Museum]] at Oxford in 1883, and, as well as serving as a lecturer, held the title of the first "Reader in Anthropology" from 1884 to 1895. In 1896 he was appointed the first Professor of Anthropology at Oxford University. He was involved in the early history of the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], although to a debatable extent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.prm.ox.ac.uk/collector_tylor.html "Edward Burnett Tylor: biography"], Pitt Rivers Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor acted as anthropological consultant on the first edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqvNTSuoH1EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ogilvie+words&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8luiq5LjbAhWELnwKHQHWDTAQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tylor&amp;f=false|title=Words of the World: A Global History of the Oxford English Dictionary|last=Ogilvie|first=Sarah|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107021839|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and achievements==
* 1871 Elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].
* 1875 Honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Laws from the [[University of Oxford]].

===Classification and criticisms===
[[File:Picture of Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|upright|Herbert Spencer, evolutionist par excellence.]]
The word evolution is forever associated in the popular mind with [[Charles Darwin]]’s [[Introduction to evolution|Theory of Evolution]], which professes, among other things, that man as a species developed diachronically from some ancestor among the [[Primate]]s who was also ancestor to the [[Hominidae|Great Apes]], as they are popularly termed, and yet this term was not a [[neologism]] of Darwin’s. He took it from the cultural milieu, where it meant etymologically “unfolding” of something heterogeneous and complex from something simpler and more homogeneous. [[Herbert Spencer]], a contemporary of Darwin, applied the term to the universe, including philosophy and what Tylor would later call culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenweiser|1922|pp=50–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of the universe was generally termed evolutionism, while its exponents were evolutionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Evolution | encyclopedia=The American Educator | volume=Volume 3 | year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Tylor published ''Primitive Culture'', becoming the originator of [[cultural anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;The first sentence of Chapter 1 states the founding definition of culture: "Culture, or Civilization, ... is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."&lt;/ref&gt; His methods were comparative and historical ethnography. He believed that a “uniformity” was manifest in culture, which was the result of “uniform action of uniform causes.” He regarded his instances of parallel ethnographic concepts and practices as indicative of “laws of human thought and action.” He was an evolutionist. The task of cultural anthropology therefore is to discover “stages of development or evolution.”

Evolutionism was distinguished from another creed, [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusionism]], postulating the spread of items of culture from regions of innovation. A given apparent parallelism thus had at least two explanations: the instances descend from an evolutionary ancestor, or they are alike because one diffused into the culture from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenweiser|1922|pp=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two views are exactly parallel to the [[tree model]] and [[wave model]] of historical linguistics, which are instances of evolutionism and diffusionism, language features being instances of culture.

Two other classifications were proposed in 1993 by Upadhyay and Pandey,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Upadhyay|Pandey|1993|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Evolutionary School and Neo Evolutionary School, the Classical to be divided into British, American, and German. The Classical British Evolutionary School, primarily at Oxford University, divided society into two evolutionary stages, savagery and civilization, based on the archaeology of [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury]]. Upadhyay and Pandey list its adherents as  [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], [[John Ferguson McLennan]], and [[James George Frazer]], as well as Tylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Upadhyay|Pandey|1993|pp=33–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marett was the last man standing, dying in 1943. By the time of his death, Lubbock’s archaeology had been updated. The American School, beginning with [[Lewis Henry Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Upadhyay|Pandey|1993|pp=53–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; was likewise superseded, both being replaced by the [[Neoevolutionism|Neoevolutionist]] School, beginning with [[V. Gordon Childe]]. It brought the archaeology up-to-date and tended to omit the intervening society names, such as savagery; for example, Neolithic is both a tool tradition and a form of society.

There are some other classifications. Theorists of each classification each have their own criticisms of the Classical/Neo Evolutionary lines, which despite them remains the dominant view. Some criticisms are in brief as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Upadhyay|Pandey|1993|pp=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is really no universality; that is, the apparent parallels are accidental, on which the theorist has imposed a model that does not really fit. There is no uniform causality, but different causes might produce similar results. All cultural groups do not have the same stages of development. The theorists are arm-chair anthropologists; their data is insufficient to form realistic abstractions. They overlooked cultural diffusion. They overlooked cultural innovation. None of the critics claim definitive proof that their criticisms are less subjective or interpretive than the models they criticise.

===Basic concepts===
====Culture====
Tylor's notion is best described in his most famous work, the two-volume ''Primitive Culture''. The first volume, The ''Origins of Culture'', deals with ethnography including social evolution, linguistics, and myth. The second volume, ''Religion in Primitive Culture'', deals mainly with his interpretation of [[animism]].

On the first page of ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor provides a definition which is one of his most widely recognised contributions to anthropology and the study of religion:&lt;ref&gt;[[Giulio Angioni]], ''L'antropologia evoluzionistica di Edward B. Tylor'' in ''Tre saggi...'' cit. in ''Related Studies''{{when|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Culture or Civilization, taken in its wide ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.|Tylor&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, Edward. 1871. ''Primitive Culture: Research into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custum''. London: John Murray. Volume 1, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Also, the first chapter of the work gives an outline of a new discipline, [[science of culture]], later known as culturology.&lt;ref name="Leslie"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Culturology | author=Leslie A. White | journal=Science |series=New Series | date= 21 November 1958| volume=128 | issue=3334 |page=1246 | jstor=1754562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Universals====
Unlike many of his predecessors and contemporaries, Tylor asserts that the human mind and its capabilities are the same globally, despite a particular society’s stage in social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Stringer, Martin D. (1999). "Rethinking Animism: Thoughts from the Infancy of Our Discipline", ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,'' Vol. 5, No. 4. (December 1999), pp. 541–555.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a hunter-gatherer society would possess the same amount of intelligence as an advanced industrial society.  The difference, Tylor asserts, is education, which he considers the cumulative knowledge and methodology that takes thousands of years to acquire.  Tylor often likens primitive cultures to “children”, and sees culture and the mind of humans as progressive. His work was a refutation of the theory of social [[degeneration]], which was popular at the time.&lt;ref name="Lowrie, Robert H. 1917 pp. 262–268"/&gt; At the end of ''Primitive Culture,'' Tylor writes, "The science of culture is essentially a reformers' science."&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, Edward. 1920 [1871]. ''Primitive Culture''. New York: J. P. Putnam’s Sons, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tylor's evolutionism===
In 1881 Tylor published a work he called ''Anthropology'', one of the first under that name. In the first chapter he uttered what would become a sort of constitutional statement for the new field, which he could not know and did not intend at the time:

{{quote|"History, so far as it reaches back, shows arts, sciences, and political institutions beginning in ruder states, and becoming in the course of ages, more intelligent, more systematic, more perfectly arranged or organized, to answer their purposes."|{{harvnb|Tylor|1881|p=15}}}}

The view was a restatement of ideas first innovated in the early 1860s. The theorist perhaps most influential on Tylor was [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury]], innovator of the terminology, “Paleolithic” and “Neolithic.” A prominent banker and British liberal Parliamentarian, he was imbued with a passion for archaeology. The initial concepts of prehistory were his. Lubbock’s works featured prominently in Tylor’s lectures and in the Pitt Rivers Museum subsequently.

====Survivals====
A term ascribed to Tylor was his theory of "survivals". His definition of survivals is

{{quote|processes, customs, and opinions, and so forth, which have been carried on by force of habit into a new state of society different from that in which they had their original home, and they thus remain as proofs and examples of an older condition of culture out of which a newer has been evolved.|Tylor&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, Edward. 1920 [1871]. ''Primitive Culture''. New York: J. P. Putnam’s Sons. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Survivals" can include outdated practices, such as the European practice of [[bloodletting]], which lasted long after the medical theories on which it was based had faded from use and been replaced by more modern techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Willi and Russel T. McCutcheon, eds. 2000. ''Guide to the Study of Religion''. London: Continuum. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argued that he identified the term but provided an insufficient reason as to why survivals continue. Tylor’s [[meme]]-like concept of survivals explains the characteristics of a culture that are linked to earlier stages of human culture.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jerry D. "Edward Tylor: The Evolution of Culture," ''Visions of Culture: an Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists'', Walnut Creek, California: Altamira, 1997. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying survivals assists ethnographers in reconstructing earlier cultural characteristics and possibly reconstructing the evolution of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jerry D. "Edward Tylor: The Evolution of Culture." Visions of Culture: an Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists. Walnut Creek: Altamira, 1997. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution of religion====
Tylor argued that people had used religion to explain things that occurred in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Strenski, Ivan. "The Shock of the 'Savage': Edward Burnett Tylor, Evolution, and Spirits," ''Thinking About Religion: An Historical Introduction to Theories of Religion''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2006. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw that it was important for religions to have the ability to explain why and for what reason things occurred in the world.&lt;ref name="Strenski, Ivan 2006"&gt;Strenski (2006), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, God (or the divine) gave us sun to keep us warm and give us light. Tylor argued that animism is the true natural religion that is the essence of religion; it answers the questions of which religion came first and which religion is essentially the most basic and foundation of all religions.&lt;ref name="Strenski, Ivan 2006"/&gt; For him, animism was the best answer to these questions, so it must be the true foundation of all religions. Animism is described as the belief in spirits inhabiting and animating beings, or souls existing in things.&lt;ref name="Strenski, Ivan 2006"/&gt; To Tylor, the fact that modern religious practitioners continued to believe in spirits showed that these people were no more advanced than primitive societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Strenski (2006), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; For him, this implied that modern religious practitioners do not understand the ways of the universe and how life truly works because they have excluded science from their understanding of the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By excluding scientific explanation in their understanding of why and how things occur, he asserts modern religious practitioners are rudimentary. Tylor perceived the modern religious belief in God as a “survival” of primitive ignorance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, Tylor did not believe that [[atheism]] was the logical end of cultural and religious development, but instead a highly minimalist form of [[monotheism|monotheist]] [[deism]]. Tylor thus posited an anthropological description of "the gradual elimination of paganism" and [[disenchantment]], but not [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Ideas and quote from {{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 99 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Eugene England, Jr.''' (22 July 1933 – 17 August 2001), usually credited as '''Eugene England''',  was a [[Mormon]] writer, teacher, and scholar.  He founded ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', the oldest independent journal in [[Mormon Studies]], with [[G. Wesley Johnson]], [[Paul G. Salisbury]], [[Joseph H. Jeppson]], and [[Frances Menlove]] in 1966, and cofounded the [[Association for Mormon Letters]] in 1976. He is also widely known in the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] for his many essays about [[Mormon culture]] and thought.  From 1977–1998, England taught [[Mormon Literature]] at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene England at Mormon Literature &amp; Creative Arts Database|url=http://mormonarts.lib.byu.edu/people/eugene-england|website=mormonarts.lib.byu.edu|publisher=BYU|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  England described the ideal modern Mormon scholar as "critical and innovative as his gifts from God require but conscious of and loyal to his own unique heritage and nurturing community and thus able to exercise those gifts without harm to others or himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=England|first1=Eugene|title=Dialogues with Myself|date=1984|publisher=[[Orion Books]]|location=[[Midvale, Utah]]|isbn=0-941214-21-4|accessdate=19 September 2017|chapter=Author’s Foreword|chapter-url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/dialogues-with-myself/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
England was born 22 July 1933 in [[Logan, Utah]] to George Eugene England and Dora Rose Hartvigsen England. He grew up in [[Downey, Idaho]], where his father owned a wheat farm. At age 20, he married the former Charlotte Hawkins, with whom he was soon called to serve an [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS mission]] to [[Samoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eugeneengland.org/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/2000_e_001.pdf article by England on David O. McKay]&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving as a captain in the [[U.S. Air Force]], England entered graduate school at [[Stanford University]], where he was both influenced by the 60s-era campus movement and the LDS Church as an active member and a leader in his student ward. While at Stanford, England met Wesley Johnson and together the two men conceived of and announced the formation of an academic journal on Mormon culture, ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]''.

Leaving Stanford, England taught at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Minnesota]], while completing work on his [[Ph.D.]], awarded in 1974. But he was forced to leave when some of his students expressed interest in Mormonism and their parents complained. He then taught at the [[University of Utah]]'s LDS [[Institute of Religion]] for two years, before receiving a professorship at [[Brigham Young University]].

At BYU, England was able to teach classes in Mormon literature and in 1976 he helped found the [[Association for Mormon Letters]] in order to raise the visibility of the study of Mormon literature. He also explored religious themes in important literary works. During his years at BYU England was at his most prolific, writing books of essays such as ''Dialogues with Myself'' and "Why the Church Is as True as the Gospel,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=England|first1=Eugene|title=Why the Church Is As True As the Gospel|url=http://www.eugeneengland.org/why-the-church-is-as-true-as-the-gospel|website=www.eugeneengland.org|publisher=Eugene England Foundation|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; poetry, a biography and numerous articles. In 1981 England received a letter from Apostle [[Bruce R. McConkie]] chastising him for publicly advocating the view that God continues to learn new things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneengland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BRM-to-EE-Feb-80-Combined.pdf |title=Bruce R. McConkie 1981 Letter to Eugene England}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Claudia Bushman]], "the McConkie-England disagreement revealed the division between theological conservatives and liberals within the believing camp and, in a larger sense, the tensions between authoritarian control versus free expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bushman |first = Claudia L. |authorlink= Claudia Lauper Bushman |year= 2006 |title= Contemporary Mormonism: Latter-day Saints in Modern America |location= Westport, Connecticut |publisher= [[Praeger Publishers]] |isbn= 0-275-98933-X |oclc= 61178156 |url= http://www.abc-clio.com/product.aspx?isbn=9780275989330 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=tGF7LdsbatoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA149,M1 149] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade of his life, England felt increasingly under fire for his work, which led him to retire from BYU in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  He was then offered the position of writer in residence at [[Utah Valley University|Utah Valley State College]] in [[Orem, Utah]]. There he started the [[Center for the Study of Mormon Culture]], as part of the college's religious studies program. Before England could fully develop the Center, he suffered a debilitating case of [[brain cancer]].  Despite an operation that removed two [[golf ball|golf-ball]] sized [[cysts]] and a portion of a [[tumor]], he died on 17 August 2001.&lt;ref name="MormonNews Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonstoday.com/010824/A2EEngland02.shtml |title="Remembering England" Obituary on Mormon News, August 25, 2001 |accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other positions held in the LDS Church at various times England served as both a [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishop]] and as a [[stake president]].

==Accolades==
Despite a lukewarm reaction by viewers, critics appreciated the innovative perspective on the classic Greek tragedy of [[Orpheus and Eurydice]] and noted the originality of Nikolaidis' artistic techniques. It is characteristic that Nikolaidis himself believed ''Evrydiki BA 2O37'' to be his best film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatsgreece.com/info/culture-performing-arts-cinema-Nikos-Nikolaidis|title=Nikolaidis Nikos|website=That's Greece: Culture, Performing Arts, Cinema|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012125800/http://www.thatsgreece.com/info/culture-performing-arts-cinema-Nikos-Nikolaidis|archivedate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André Z. Labarrére and Olivier Labarrére, authors of ''Atlas du cinéma'', wrote that the film was one of the "New [[cinema of Greece|Greek Cinema]]" films that "radically transformed the panorama."&lt;ref&gt;Labarrére, André Z., y Labarrére, Olivier (2009). ''Atlas del cine'' (Título original: ''Atlas du cinéma''. Paris: Librairie Générale Française, 2002). Madrid: [[Ediciones Akal]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ThcBFxqXKTEC&amp;pg=PA275 275]. {{ISBN|8446021501}}. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this film, Nikolaidis won the Best Director Award, the Greek National Ministry of Culture Award, as well as the [[Athens]] Film Critics Association Best Picture Award at the [[Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema]] in September [[1975 in film|1975]], where Marie-Louise Bartholomew, who was involved in the production of the film, also won the Best Set Designer Award, and Andreas Andreadakis, who was involved in the editing of the film, also won the Best Editor Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiff.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;page=971&amp;year=1975|script-title=el:Γενικά 1975: 16ο Φεστιβάλ Ελληνικού Κινηματογράφου|website=[[Thessaloniki International Film Festival|Διεθνές Φεστιβάλ Κινηματογράφου Θεσσαλονίκης (Πληροφορίες: Βραβεία)]]|accessdate=5 December 2014|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Mel (1979).

'''''Final Fantasy VIII'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy VIII'''''|ファイナルファンタジーVIII|Fainaru Fantajī Eito}}&lt;!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --&gt;}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation]] console. Released in 1999, it is the eighth main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Set on an unnamed fantasy world with science fiction elements, the game follows a group of young mercenaries, led by [[Squall Leonhart]], as they are drawn into a conflict sparked by Ultimecia, a sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time. During the quest to defeat Ultimecia, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of his comrades, [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Rinoa Heartilly|Rinoa Heartilly]].

Development began in 1997, during the English localization of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. The game builds on the visual changes brought to the series by ''Final Fantasy VII'', including the use of [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] and [[pre-rendering|pre-rendered backgrounds]], while also departing from many [[recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series|''Final Fantasy'' traditions]]. It is the first ''Final Fantasy'' to use realistically proportioned characters consistently, feature a [[Eyes on Me (Faye Wong song)|vocal piece as its theme music]], and forego the use of [[magic points]] for spellcasting.

''Final Fantasy VIII'' was mostly well received by critics, who praised its originality and visuals while criticizing some of its gameplay elements. It was voted the 22nd-best game of all time in 2006 by readers of the Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''. The game was a commercial success; it earned more than US$50 million in sales during its first 13 weeks of release, making it the fastest-selling ''Final Fantasy'' title until ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', a multi-platform release. A [[Microsoft Windows]] post followed in 2000, with the addition of the ''[[Chocobo World]]'' minigame. ''Final Fantasy VIII'' was re-released worldwide as a PSOne Classic on the [[PlayStation Store]] in 2009, for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]], with support for [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2012. It was re-released via Steam in 2013 and in Japan in 2014. As of December 2013, it has sold more than 8.5 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=Dec2013Sales&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.na.square-enix.com/releases/167/final-fantasy-viii-pc-digital-download-out-today |title=Final Fantasy VIII sales in December 2013 |publisher=Square Enix North America |date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Like the ''Final Fantasy'' games before it, ''Final Fantasy VIII'' consists of three main modes of play: the [[overworld|world map]], the field map, and the battle screen. The world map is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] display in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world. Characters travel across the world map in a variety of ways, including by foot, car, [[Chocobo]], train, and [[List of Final Fantasy airships#Final Fantasy VIII|airship]]. The field map consists of controllable 3D characters overlaid on one or more [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds, which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests. The battle screen is a 3D model of a location such as a street or room, where turn-based fights between playable characters and [[central processing unit|CPU]]-controlled enemies take place. The interface is menu-driven, as in previous titles, but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present, such as the Junction system. Also featured is a collectible card-based [[minigame]] called "[[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Triple Triad|Triple Triad]]".&lt;ref name="guidecite"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VIII North American instruction manual | pages=20, 24, 36 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts  | id=SLUS-00892GH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Final Fantasy VIII'', [[Hiroyuki Ito]] designed a battle system based on summoned monsters, called "Guardian Forces", abbreviated in-game as "GF". Assigning ("junctioning") a GF onto a character allows the player to use battle commands beyond ''Attack'' with the main weapon, such as Magic, GF (to have a junctioned GF perform an action), and Item. Previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles provided each character with a limited pool of [[magic point]]s that were consumed by each spell; in ''Final Fantasy VIII'', spells are acquired ("drawn") either from enemies in battle, Draw Points distributed throughout the environments, or by refining items and cards. Spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory (up to 100 per spell and limited to 32 distinct spells per character) and are consumed one by one when used. Characters can also junction (equip) these spells onto their [[attribute (role-playing games)|statistics]]—such as Strength, Vitality, and Luck—for various bonuses, provided the character has junctioned a Guardian Force.&lt;ref name="guidecite2"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VIII North American instruction manual | pages=28, 33–35 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts  | id=SLUS-00892GH}}&lt;/ref&gt; The junction system's flexibility affords the player a wide range of customization.

These expanded mechanics for summons were a departure for the series; in previous titles, summons were relegated to a single action during battle. The junction system also acts as a substitute for armor and accessories, which were used in earlier games to modify character statistics. Moreover, where earlier titles required weapons to be equipped and tailored to the character, each major character in ''Final Fantasy VIII'' features a unique weapon which can be upgraded, affecting its appearance, power, and Limit Break.&lt;ref name="stratguidecite"&gt;{{cite book | author=Cassady, David | year=1999 | title=Final Fantasy VIII Official Strategy Guide | page=4 | publisher=BradyGAMES Publishing | isbn=1-56686-903-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in ''Final Fantasy VII'', characters in ''Final Fantasy VIII'' have unique abilities called "Limit Breaks", which range from powerful attacks to support spells. While the characters in ''Final Fantasy VII'' receive Limit Breaks after incurring significant damage, in ''Final Fantasy VIII'', Limit Breaks become available only at low health ([[health (gaming)|hit points]]) under normal circumstances. The magic spell ''Aura'' increases the probability of Limit Breaks appearing, regardless of a character's remaining hit points, while various status afflictions can prevent Limit Breaks. They are similar to the Desperation Attacks of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', albeit more frequent.&lt;ref name="specialarts"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania | page=64 | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | language=Japanese | isbn=4-925075-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Final Fantasy VIII'' also introduced interactive elements to complement Limit Break animations. These interactive sequences, which vary between character, weapon, and Limit Break, range from randomly selected magic spells to [[Quick time event|precisely timed button inputs]]. Successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the potency of the Limit Break.&lt;ref name="stratguidecite2"&gt;{{cite book | author=Cassady, David | year=1999 | title=Final Fantasy VIII Official Strategy Guide | pages=6, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18–19 | publisher=BradyGAMES Publishing  | isbn=1-56686-903-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FFVIIInavigation.png|thumb|right|An example of navigation on the field map|alt=An overhead shot of three figures running through a jungle-like setting; a metal door and wire fences are visible above them.]]
''Final Fantasy VIII'' features an [[experience point]] (EXP) system quite different from previous titles.  The essentials remain unchanged: characters gain EXP after defeating enemies, which are typically encountered randomly throughout the game's environments. Earning a set amount of EXP causes the character to gain a level, which increases their overall statistics. While previous titles feature an EXP curve that increases with each level (e.g. getting to level 2 requires 200 EXP, level 3 requires 400, etc.), characters in ''Final Fantasy VIII'' gain a level after accumulating a flat rate of 1000 points.  Enemy levels are based on the party's average level; in most RPGs, enemy levels remain stagnant. Some bosses have level caps to prevent the main quest from becoming too difficult. Higher-level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage, may have additional special attacks, and carry additional magic spells, allowing for Junctioning bonuses which themselves far exceed the bonuses imparted by level-gain. The game's unique EXP and level system allows a player to [[Grinding (gaming)|grind]] to maximum Level 100 before even beginning the plot, though this will result in far more powerful enemies.

In addition to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, as is the case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely, and use additional battle commands.&lt;ref name="stratguidecite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guidecite3"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VIII North American instruction manual | pages=28–35 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts  | id=SLUS-00892GH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

===Setting and characters===
{{Main|Characters of Final Fantasy VIII}}
Most of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' is set on an unnamed fantasy world. The setting is highly [[Europe]]an in design and features a blend of modern and futuristic locales. The planet contains five major landmasses, with Esthar, the largest, covering most of the eastern portion of the map.&lt;ref name="FF8World"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/ff8/world.html |title=Final Fantasy VIII&amp;nbsp;– World |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |accessdate=2007-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142226/http://na.square-enix.com/games/ff8/world.html |archivedate=March 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Galbadia, the second-largest continent, lies to the west,&lt;ref name="FF8World"/&gt; and contains many of the game's locations. The northernmost landmass is Trabia, an Arctic region. Positioned roughly in the middle of the world map lies Balamb, the smallest continent,&lt;ref name="FF8World"/&gt; the island on which the game begins. The remaining landmass is small and mostly desolate, riddled with rough, rocky terrain caused by the impact of a "Lunar Cry", an event where monsters from the moon fall to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VIII |developer=Square Co. |publisher=Square EA |date=1999-09-09 |platform=PlayStation|quote='''Centra Civilization''' - A civilization in Centra 4000 years ago.

Centra was destroyed 80 years ago by the Lunar Cry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania | page=40 | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | language=Japanese | isbn=4-925075-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southernmost landmass includes an [[archipelago]] of broken sections of land that have drifted apart. Islands and marine structures flesh out the game world, and a handful of off-world locations round out the playable areas.

The six main protagonists of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' are: [[Squall Leonhart]], a loner who avoids vulnerability by focusing on his duty; [[Rinoa Heartilly]], an outspoken and passionate young woman who follows her heart; [[Quistis Trepe]], an instructor with a serious, patient attitude; [[Zell Dincht]], an energetic [[martial arts|martial artist]] with a fondness for hot dogs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VIII |developer=Square Co. |publisher=Square EA |date=1999-09-09 |platform=PlayStation|quote='''Scan description: Zell Dincht''' - Loves the hot dogs sold in the Garden cafeteria.

Can use specialized bullets to attack enemies. Doesn't perform very well under pressure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All but Rinoa are members of "SeeD", an elite military force based out of futuristic installations called Gardens. Temporarily playable characters include [[Laguna Loire]], [[Kiros Seagill]], and [[Ward Zabac]], who appear in "flashback" sequences; SeeD cadet-turned-antagonist [[Seifer Almasy]], and sorceress [[Edea Kramer]]. The main antagonist is [[Ultimecia]], a sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time.

===Plot===
Squall and Seifer scar each other while training outside Balamb Garden. Meanwhile, the Republic of Galbadia invades the Dollet Dukedom, forcing Dollet to hire SeeD. The school uses the mission as a [[final exam]] for its cadets;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VIII |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=1999-09-09 |platform=PlayStation|quote='''Xu:''' Our client for this mission is the Dollet Dukedom Parliament.

Dollet has been under attack by the G-Army since about 72 hours ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of his instructor, Quistis, Squall passes the mission's prerequisite and is grouped with Seifer and Zell. Selphie replaces Seifer mid-mission when the latter disobeys orders and abandons his team. SeeD halts the Galbadian advance; Squall, Zell, and Selphie graduate to SeeD status, but Seifer is disciplined for his disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VIII |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=1999-09-09 |platform=PlayStation|quote='''Headmaster Cid:''' Seifer.

This has always been my dream.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edea survives the attempt, stabs Squall in the shoulder with an ice shard, and detains the party.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt;

After Squall's party escapes, Edea destroys Trabia Garden in a retaliatory missile strike and prepares to attack Balamb Garden.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt; Selphie delays the launch while Squall's team returns to Balamb Garden and activates its mobile functions to evade the missiles. Garden cannot be controlled, however, and it crashes into the docks at Fishermans' Horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VIII |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=1999-09-09 |platform=PlayStation|level=Fishermans' Horizon|quote='''Squall''': I'm terribly sorry.

Squall and his comrades learn that they, along with Seifer and Ellone, were all raised (except for Rinoa) in an orphanage run by Edea;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt; after eventual separation, they later developed amnesia due to their use of Guardian Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VIII |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=1999-09-09 |platform=PlayStation|quote='''Squall''': ...Why is it that we forgot?

While Rinoa is being treated on Esthar's space station, Ultimecia uses her to free Adel from an orbital prison.

Development of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' began in 1997, during the English-language translation of ''Final Fantasy VII''.&lt;ref name="development"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Nomura, Kitase and Naora |url=http://playstationjapan.tripod.com/ff8iview2.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiLPkaDV?url=http://playstationjapan.tripod.com/ff8iview2.html |archivedate=2011-02-23 |date=1998-06-05 |work=[[Famitsu|Shūkan Famitsu]] |accessdate=2011-02-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with much of the production of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', series creator and veteran [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] served as the [[executive producer]], working primarily on the development of ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' and leaving direction of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' to [[Yoshinori Kitase]].&lt;ref name="development2"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff |date=5 June 1998|others=Coxon, Sachi (translator) | script-title=ja:インタビュー 坂口 博信 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Interview with Hironobu Sakaguchi | url=http://members.tripod.com/PlayStationJapan/Sakaguchi.html | journal=[[Famitsu Weekly]] | accessdate=2006-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shinji Hashimoto]] was assigned to be the producer in Sakaguchi's place, while the game and battle system were designed by Kitase and [[Hiroyuki Ito]], respectively.&lt;ref name="development" /&gt;&lt;ref name="credits"&gt;{{cite video game |title=Final Fantasy VIII |developer=[[Square Co., Ltd.]] |publisher=[[Square Electronic Arts L.L.C.]] |date=1999-09-09 |scene=staff credits}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the development difficulties encountered was having three real-time characters exploring an environment at the same time.&lt;ref name="PromoInfo"/&gt; The card game Triple Triad was conceived and implemented by programmer Kentarow Yasui.&lt;ref name="battle team"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania | pages=74–75 | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | language=Japanese | isbn=4-925075-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was derived from [[trading card]]s which is a popular hobby in some parts of Japan.&lt;ref name="development3"/&gt; Triple Triad was meant to keep the player's interest during long stretches without cutscenes. Originally, it was simply about collecting cards but Yasui considered this too disconnected from the main game and "begged" for the inclusion of an ability to transform cards into items.&lt;ref name="battle team" /&gt; The game's total development costs were approximately [[Japanese yen|¥]]3 billion, which equated to around [[United States dollar|$]]16 million without inflation. The staff consisted of about 180 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nowgamer.com/why-is-the-final-fantasy-8-promo-site-still-alive/|title=Why Is The Final Fantasy 8 Promo Site Still Alive?|publisher=NowGamer|date=2015-11-10|accessdate=2016-01-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221112019/http://www.nowgamer.com/why-is-the-final-fantasy-8-promo-site-still-alive/|archivedate=2016-02-21|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; American localization specialist Alexander O. Smith stated due to a lack of communication with the development team, they were surprised that an IT employee used a [[GameShark]] to access text files for localizing to Western audiences.

===Visual design===
[[File:FFVIIIgirls.jpg|thumb|From left, Tetsuya Nomura's designs of Selphie, Rinoa and Quistis]]
From the beginning, Kitase knew he wanted a thematic combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters who appeared to be ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director [[Tetsuya Nomura]] and art director [[Yusuke Naora]] strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters—a departure from the [[super deformed]] designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game,&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; and the use of [[motion capture]] technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's [[full motion video]] sequences.&lt;ref name="development3"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Official UK PlayStation Magazine]] |title=Final Fantasy VIII Kitase, Nojima, Naora and Nomura Interview |date=February 2001 |issue=71 |url=http://www.ffshrine.org/ff8/ff8_interview.php |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in ''VII''.&lt;ref name="PromoInfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/11/06/1999-final-fantasy-8-promo-website-somehow-still-active-awesome/|title=1999 Final Fantasy 8 promo website somehow still active, awesome|author=Hillier, Brenna|publisher=[[VG247]]|date=2015-11-06|accessdate=2016-01-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207083248/http://www.vg247.com/2015/11/06/1999-final-fantasy-8-promo-website-somehow-still-active-awesome/|archivedate=2016-12-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Motion capture]] was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of ''VII'', and the aim for more realistic characters.&lt;ref name="development3"/&gt; A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.&lt;ref name="PromoInfo"/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Famitsu]]'', Naora described that the game was generally designed to be a "bright, fresh ''Final Fantasy''."&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; The main reason was that the team had dealt extensively with dark and "weird" imagery with ''VII''.&lt;ref name="development3"/&gt; The designers felt a need to invert the atmosphere of previous games in the series, which had feelings of "light emerging from darkness".&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; This decision was easy for the developers to make, because most of them had worked on ''Final Fantasy VII'' and felt that a new direction was acceptable.&lt;ref name="development3"/&gt; The world designs were also developed with the knowledge that most of the staff were now used to [[computer graphics]], which was not the case with ''Final Fantasy VII''.&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; The developers also noted that with ''Final Fantasy VIII'', they attempted to "mix future, real life and fantasy."&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; As part of a theme desired by Kitase to give the game a foreign atmosphere, various designs were given to its locations using the style of internationally familiar places, while also maintaining a [[fantasy]] atmosphere. Inspiration ranged from [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|ancient Egyptian]] and [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek architecture]], to the city of Paris, France, to an idealized futuristic European society. Flags were also given to some factions, their designs based on the group's history and culture.&lt;ref name="sheila"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania | pages=354–355 | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | language=Japanese | isbn=4-925075-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maintain a foreign atmosphere, the characters of the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first ''Final Fantasy VIII'' character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize his role as the central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]]. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional [[revolver]]–[[sword]] hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism,&lt;ref name="gunblade"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania | page=43 | publisher=DigiCube/SquareEnix | language=Japanese | isbn=4-925075-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to a vibroblade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samoon |first=Evan |date=July 2008 |title=Gun Show: A real military expert takes aim at videogame weaponry to reveal the good, the bad, and the just plain silly |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=230 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers.&lt;ref name="sheila"/&gt; Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a ''Final Fantasy'' game, were incorporated into ''Final Fantasy VIII''. These were the designs of Edea, [[Fujin (Final Fantasy VIII)|Fujin]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Raijin|Raijin]]. The latter two had originally been designed for use in ''Final Fantasy VII'', but with the inclusion of the [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Turks|Turks]] characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of ''Final Fantasy VII'', based on the style of [[Yoshitaka Amano]].&lt;ref name="sheila"/&gt; For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a [[game demo]]. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.&lt;ref name="sheila"/&gt;

===Story development===
The plot of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' was conceived by Kitase, with the stories for the characters provided by Nomura and the actual scenario written by Nojima.&lt;ref name="development" /&gt;&lt;ref name="credits" /&gt; During the game's pre-production, Nomura suggested the game be given a "school days" feel. Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age; their ideas meshed, taking form as the "Garden" military academies. Nojima planned that the two playable parties featured in the game (Squall's present day group and Laguna's group from the past) would be highly contrasted with one another. This idea was conveyed through the age and experience of Laguna's group, versus the youth and naïveté of Squall's group.&lt;ref name="sheila"/&gt; Nojima has expressed that the dynamic of players' relationships with the protagonist is important to him. Both ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Final Fantasy VIII'' feature reserved, quiet protagonists in the form of [[Cloud Strife]] and Squall. With ''Final Fantasy VIII'', however, Nojima worked to give players actual insight into what the character was thinking; a direct contrast with his handling of ''Final Fantasy VII'', which encouraged the player to speculate.&lt;ref name="interviews"&gt;{{cite web|year=2001 |title=Behind The Game The Creators |url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1 |publisher=Square Enix North America |accessdate=2006-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209085217/http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html |archivedate=February 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
In March 1999, one month after the game's release, ''[[Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania]]'' was published, a book that features an in-depth guide to ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and interviews with the [[video game developer|developers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | language=Japanese | isbn=4-925075-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[origami]] book was released in November 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square | title=Final Fantasy VIII Origami Book | publisher=DigiCube | language=Japanese | isbn=4-925075-59-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 1999, a [[CD-ROM]] titled ''Final Fantasy VIII Desktop Accessories'' was released. It contains [[icon (computing)|desktop icons]], [[computer wallpaper]]s, [[screensaver]]s, and an [[e-mail]] application. It additionally features a stand-alone edition of the Triple Triad minigame, which allowed players to compete against one another via a [[local area network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Sato, Yukiyoshi Ike| title=New FFVIII CD-ROM Announced |date=1999-09-01 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy8/news.html?sid=2448835 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916205827/http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy8/news.html?sid=2448835 | archivedate=2006-09-16 | website=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Final Fantasy VIII}}
Regular series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] wrote the soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy VIII''. He tried to base the songs off of the emotional content of when they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desires is more important than improving skills: "I think it will be a shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!"&lt;ref name="lim"&gt;Maeda, Yoshitake (1999). ''Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack (Limited Edition)''. [[DigiCube]].&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game".&lt;ref name="IGNUEMATSUinterview"/&gt; The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of ''Final Fantasy VI'' and ''Final Fantasy VII'' ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a "highlight" in the game, but he found ''Final Fantasy VIII'' only focused on Squall Leonhart and [[Angelo (Final Fantasy VIII)|Rinoa Heartilly]] as a couple, resulting in the "Eyes on Me" theme.&lt;ref name="IGNUEMATSUinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/741/741101p1.html |title=Twelve Days of Final Fantasy XII: Nobuo Uematsu Interview |work=IGN |accessdate=2007-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207213918/http://music.ign.com/articles/741/741101p1.html |archivedate=2006-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original soundtrack was released on four [[compact disc]]s by [[DigiCube]] in Japan on March 10, 1999, and by [[Square EA]] in North America as ''Final Fantasy VIII Music Collection'' in January 2000.&lt;ref name="RPGFMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff8music/index.html |title=Final Fantasy VIII Music Collection |website=[[RPGFan]] |date=2000-06-23 |accessdate=2007-03-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817170655/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff8music/index.html |archivedate=2013-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was republished worldwide by Square Enix on May 10, 2004.&lt;ref name="RPGFFF8OST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff8ost/index.html |title=Final Fantasy VIII OST |last=Schweitzer |first=Ben |date=2006-06-17 |website=RPGFan |accessdate=2009-10-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901222731/http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff8ost/index.html |archivedate=2009-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An album of [[orchestra]]l [[arrangement]]s of selected tracks from the game was released under the title ''Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII'' on November 19, 1999, by DigiCube, and subsequently published on July 22, 2004, by [[Square Enix]].

The score is best known for two songs: "Liberi Fatali", a [[Latin]] [[choir|choral]] piece that is played during the introduction to the game, and "Eyes On Me", a [[popular music|pop song]] serving as the game's theme, performed by Chinese singer [[Faye Wong]]. Near the end of the production of ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers suggested to use a singer, but abandoned the idea due to a lack of reasoning based on the game's theme and storyline.&lt;ref name="DitL_interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Day in the Life of Final Fantasy's Nobuo Uematsu |last=Mielke |first=James |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3166165 |website=[[1UP.com]] |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2008-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716121043/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3166165 |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nobuo Uematsu thought a [[ballad]] would closely relate to the theme and characters of ''Final Fantasy VIII''. This resulted in the game's developers sharing "countless" artists, eventually deciding on Wong. Uematsu claims "her voice and mood seem to match my image of the song exactly", and that her ethnicity "fits the international image of Final Fantasy". After negotiations were made, "Eyes on Me" was recorded in Hong Kong with an orchestra.&lt;ref name="lim"/&gt; The song was released as a [[CD single]] in Japan and sold over 400,000 copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Staff | title=Nobuo Uematsu's Profile | url=http://na.square-enix.com/uematsu/profile/index.html | publisher=Square Enix USA | accessdate=2009-12-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601114456/http://na.square-enix.com/uematsu/profile/index.html|archivedate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting the record for highest-selling [[video game music]] disc ever released in that country at the time.

Reviews of the gameplay have been mixed.

In general, ''Final Fantasy VIII'' has been compared favorably to its predecessors. Though questioning the game's lack of voice overs for its characters, Game Revolution praised its storyline and ending.&lt;ref name="gamerevolution"&gt;{{cite web|author=Liu, Johnny |year=1999 |title=Game Revolution Review Page&amp;nbsp;– Final Fantasy VIII |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/final-fantasy-viii |website=[[Game Revolution]] |accessdate=2006-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129112607/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/final-fantasy-viii |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For their part, ''Edge'' labeled ''Final Fantasy VIII'' "a far more accomplished game than ''FFVII''". On the other hand, the magazine also felt that the game's length left its story unable to "offer consistently strong dialogue and sub-plots". Additionally, it found some of the story's plot twists "not... suitably manipulated and prepared", leaving it "hard not to greet such... moments with anything but indifference". Overall, ''Edge'' considered ''Final Fantasy VIII'' to be "yet another outstanding edition of SquareSoft's far-from-final fantasies", summarizing it as "aesthetically astonishing, rarely less than compelling, and near peerless in scope and execution".&lt;ref name="EDGE"/&gt; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' offered similar comments, stating that the game's character development "is the best of any RPG's" and that "''Final Fantasy VIII'' is the pinnacle of its genre."&lt;ref name="egmreview"/&gt; UGO.com stated that while no other game in the series had stirred the controversy that ''Final Fantasy VIII'' had and that it was flawed, ''Final Fantasy VIII'' was a "daring, groundbreaking game [...] decidedly the most original console-style RPG ever created".&lt;ref name="UGO"/&gt; In 2002, IGN named it the seventh best title for the PlayStation, placing higher on the list than ''Final Fantasy VII''; the publication felt that ''Final Fantasy VIII'' improved on the strengths of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="IGN-25"/&gt;

The PC port received mixed reception.

The national '''flag of [[Oman]]''' ({{lang-ar|علم عُمان}}) consists of three stripes (white, green and red) with a red bar on the left that contains the [[national emblem of Oman]] (Dagger and two swords).

Until 1975, Oman used the plain red banner of the indigenous people.  In 1970, the Sultan introduced a complete new set of national flags.{{what|date=July 2017}} Bands of green and white were added to the fly, and the national emblem, the badge of the Albusaidi Dynasty, was placed in the canton. This depicts crossed swords over a ''[[khanjar]]'', a traditional curved dagger. White has been associated historically with the Imam, the religious leader of Oman, and at times the political rival to the ruling Sultan. It also symbolizes peace. Green is traditionally associated with the [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jabal al-Akdar]], or "Green Mountains," which lie toward the north of the country. Red is a common color in Gulf state flags. The national emblem is said to date back to the 18th century. A curved dagger is fastened over a pair of crossed swords. An ornate horsebit links the weapons.

Between 1970 and 1995, the size of the middle band of the triband was slimmer than the other two, making up approximately one fifth of its height, the other bands two-fifths.

The [[naval ensign]] shows an ''azure'' (blue) field, with the Oman in the [[canton (heraldry)|canton]] or top-left quarter and the naval service emblem in the [[glossary of vexillology|fly]].

The standard of the Sultan of Oman shows a red fly, with a green border whose width is about one-sixth of the height of the flag, surrounded by a red border of about the same width. It bears the country's emblem as a charge in the center, colored gold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22408">In [[formal language|formal language theory]], a '''grammar''' (when the context is not given, often called a '''formal grammar''' for clarity) is a set of [[Production (computer science)|production  rule]]s for [[String (computer science)|strings]] in a [[formal language]]. The rules describe how to form strings from the language's [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] that are valid according to the language's [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. A grammar does not describe the [[semantics|meaning of the strings]] or what can be done with them in whatever context—only their form.

[[Formal language theory]], the discipline that studies formal grammars and languages, is a branch of [[applied mathematics]].  Its applications are found in [[theoretical computer science]], [[theoretical linguistics]], [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]], [[mathematical logic]], and other areas.

A formal grammar is a set of rules for rewriting strings, along with a "start symbol" from which rewriting starts. Therefore, a grammar is usually thought of as a language generator. However, it can also sometimes be used as the basis for a "[[recognizer]]"&amp;mdash;a function in computing that determines whether a given string belongs to the language or is grammatically incorrect. To describe such recognizers, formal language theory uses separate formalisms, known as [[automata theory]]. One of the interesting results of automata theory is that it is not possible to design a recognizer for certain formal languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Formal Languages and Computation: Models and Their Applications|first=Alexander|last=Meduna|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781466513457|page=233|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJ-NAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA233}}. For more on this subject, see [[undecidable problem]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Parsing]] is the process of recognizing an utterance (a string in natural languages) by breaking it down to a set of symbols and analyzing each one against the grammar of the language.  Most languages have the meanings of their utterances structured according to their syntax&amp;mdash;a practice known as [[compositional semantics]]. As a result, the first step to describing the meaning of an utterance in language is to break it down part by part and look at its analyzed form (known as its [[parse tree]] in computer science, and as its [[deep structure and surface structure|deep structure]] in [[generative grammar]]).

==History==
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}
{{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}}'s treatise ''Astadyayi'' gives formal production rules and definitions to describe the formal grammar of [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panini biography|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Panini.html|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introductory example ==

A grammar mainly consists of a set of rules for transforming strings. (If it ''only'' consisted of these rules, it would be a [[semi-Thue system]].)  To generate a string in the language, one begins with a string consisting of only a single ''start symbol''. The ''[[Production (computer science)|production rules]]'' are then applied in any order, until a string that contains neither the start symbol nor designated ''nonterminal symbols'' is produced. A production rule is applied to a string by replacing one occurrence of the production rule's left-hand side in the string by that production rule's right-hand side (''cf.'' the operation of the theoretical [[Turing machine]]). The language formed by the grammar consists of all distinct strings that can be generated in this manner. Any particular sequence of production rules on the start symbol yields a distinct string in the language. If there are essentially different ways of generating the same single string, the grammar is said to be [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]].

For example, assume the alphabet consists of ''a'' and ''b'', the start symbol is ''S'', and we have the following production rules:

: 1. &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow aSb&lt;/math&gt;
: 2. &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow ba&lt;/math&gt;

then we start with ''S'', and can choose a rule to apply to it. If we choose rule 1, we obtain the string ''aSb''. If we then choose rule 1 again, we replace ''S'' with ''aSb'' and obtain the string ''aaSbb''. If we now choose rule 2, we replace ''S'' with ''ba'' and obtain the string ''aababb'', and are done. We can write this series of choices more briefly, using symbols: &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow aSb \Rightarrow aaSbb \Rightarrow aababb&lt;/math&gt;. The language of the grammar is then the infinite set &lt;math&gt;\{a^nbab^n \mid n \geq 0 \} = \{ba, abab, aababb, aaababbb, \dotsc \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a^k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; repeated &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; times (and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in particular represents the number of times production rule 1 has been applied).

=== The syntax of grammars ===
In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Chomsky1956"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chomsky  | first = Noam  | authorlink = | title = Three models for the description of language | journal = [[IRE Transactions on Information Theory]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 113–124 | date = Sep 1956 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/18/22738/01056813.pdf?isnumber=22738&amp;prod=STD&amp;arnumber=1056813&amp;arnumber=1056813&amp;arSt=+113&amp;ared=+124&amp;arAuthor=+Chomsky%2C+N. | archiveurl = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/195609--.pdf | archivedate = 2013-10-18 | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 | id =  | accessdate = 2007-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky1957"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grammar ''G'' consists of the following components:
* A finite set ''N'' of ''[[nonterminal symbol]]s'', that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] with the strings formed from ''G''.
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''[[terminal symbol]]s'' that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from ''N''.
* A finite set ''P'' of ''production rules'', each rule of the form
:: &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma \cup N)^{*} N (\Sigma \cup N)^{*} \rightarrow (\Sigma \cup N)^{*} &lt;/math&gt; 
:where &lt;math&gt;{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kleene star]] operator and &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[union (set theory)|set union]]. That is, each production rule maps from one string of symbols to another, where the first string (the "head") contains an arbitrary number of symbols provided at least one of them is a nonterminal. In the case that the second string (the "body") consists solely of the [[empty string]]&amp;mdash;i.e., that it contains no symbols at all&amp;mdash;it may be denoted with a special notation (often &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, ''e'' or &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) in order to avoid confusion.
* A distinguished symbol &lt;math&gt;S \in N&lt;/math&gt; that is the ''start symbol'', also called the ''sentence symbol''.
A grammar is formally defined as the [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(N, \Sigma, P, S)&lt;/math&gt;. Such a formal grammar is often called a [[rewriting system]] or a [[phrase structure grammar]] in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Seymour|last=Ginsburg|authorlink=Seymour Ginsburg|title=Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages|publisher=North-Holland|pages=8–9|year=1975|isbn=978-0-7204-2506-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Michael A.|authorlink=Michael A. Harrison|title=Introduction to Formal Language Theory|year=1978|pages=13|isbn=978-0-201-02955-0|location=Reading, Mass.|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The semantics of grammars ===

The operation of a grammar can be defined in terms of relations on strings:
* Given a grammar &lt;math&gt;G = (N, \Sigma, P, S)&lt;/math&gt;, the binary relation &lt;math&gt;\underset G \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced as  "G derives in one step") on strings in &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma \cup N)^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
*:&lt;math&gt;x \underset G \Rightarrow y \iff \exists u, v, p, q \in (\Sigma \cup N)^*: (x = upv) \wedge (p \rightarrow q \in P) \wedge (y = uqv)&lt;/math&gt;
* the relation &lt;math&gt;\overset * {\underset G \Rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced as ''G derives in zero or more steps'') is defined as the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\underset G \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* a {{anchor|sentential-form}}''sentential form'' is a member of &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma \cup N)^*&lt;/math&gt; that can be derived in a finite number of steps from the start symbol &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; that is, a sentential form is a member of &lt;math&gt;\left\{ w \in (\Sigma \cup N)^* \mid S \overset * {\underset G \Rightarrow} w \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. A sentential form that contains no nonterminal symbols (i.e. is a member of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;) is called a ''sentence''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cit596/notes/dave/cfg7.html Sentential Forms], Context-Free Grammars, David Matuszek&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ''language'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as all those sentences that can be derived in a finite number of steps from the start symbol &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid S \overset * {\underset G \Rightarrow} w \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the grammar &lt;math&gt;G = (N, \Sigma, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; is effectively the [[semi-Thue system]] &lt;math&gt;(N \cup \Sigma, P)&lt;/math&gt;, rewriting strings in exactly the same way; the only difference is in that we distinguish specific ''nonterminal'' symbols, which must be rewritten in rewrite rules, and are only interested in rewritings from the designated start symbol &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to strings without nonterminal symbols.

=== Example ===
''For these examples, formal languages are specified using [[set-builder notation]].''

Consider the grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N = \left \{S, B\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \left \{a, b, c\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the start symbol, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; consists of the following production rules:

: 1. &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow aBSc&lt;/math&gt;
: 2. &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow abc&lt;/math&gt;
: 3. &lt;math&gt;Ba \rightarrow aB&lt;/math&gt;
: 4. &lt;math&gt;Bb \rightarrow bb &lt;/math&gt;

This grammar defines the language &lt;math&gt;L(G) = \left \{ a^{n}b^{n}c^{n} \mid n \ge 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a string of ''n'' consecutive &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'s. Thus, the language is the set of strings that consist of 1 or more &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'s, followed by the same number of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;'s, followed by the same number of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'s.

Some examples of the derivation of strings in &lt;math&gt;L(G)&lt;/math&gt; are: 
{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|
* &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S} \underset 2 \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{abc}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \boldsymbol{S} &amp; \underset 1 \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{aBSc} \\
&amp; \underset 2 \Rightarrow aB\boldsymbol{abc}c \\
&amp; \underset 3 \Rightarrow a\boldsymbol{aB}bcc \\
&amp; \underset 4 \Rightarrow aa\boldsymbol{bb}cc 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{S} &amp; \underset 1 \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{aBSc} \underset 1 \Rightarrow aB\boldsymbol{aBSc}c \\
&amp; \underset 2 \Rightarrow aBaB\boldsymbol{abc}cc \\ 
&amp; \underset 3 \Rightarrow a\boldsymbol{aB}Babccc \underset 3 \Rightarrow aaB\boldsymbol{aB}bccc \underset 3 \Rightarrow aa\boldsymbol{aB}Bbccc \\
&amp; \underset 4 \Rightarrow aaaB\boldsymbol{bb}ccc \underset 4 \Rightarrow aaa\boldsymbol{bb}bccc \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
}}
:(Note on notation: &lt;math&gt;P \underset i \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; reads "String {{mvar|P}} generates string {{mvar|Q}} by means of production {{mvar|i}}", and the generated part is each time indicated in bold type.)

== The Chomsky hierarchy ==
{{main|Chomsky hierarchy}} &lt;!-- for me THIS article is BETTER, but for wiki structure the whole article is bigger than a section --&gt;
When [[Noam Chomsky]] first formalized generative grammars in 1956,&lt;ref name="Chomsky1956"/&gt; he classified them into types now known as the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].  The difference between these types is that they have increasingly strict production rules and can therefore express fewer formal languages. Two important types are ''[[context-free grammar]]s'' (Type 2) and ''[[regular grammar]]s'' (Type 3). The languages that can be described with such a grammar are called ''[[context-free language]]s'' and ''[[regular language]]s'', respectively. Although much less powerful than [[unrestricted grammar]]s (Type 0), which can in fact express any language that can be accepted by a [[Turing machine]], these two restricted types of grammars are most often used because parsers for them can be efficiently implemented.&lt;ref name="Grune&amp;Jacobs1990"&gt;Grune, Dick &amp; Jacobs, Ceriel H., ''Parsing Techniques &amp;ndash; A Practical Guide'', Ellis Horwood, England, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all regular languages can be recognized by a [[finite state machine]], and for useful subsets of context-free grammars there are well-known algorithms to generate efficient [[LL parser]]s and [[LR parser]]s to recognize the corresponding languages those grammars generate.

=== Context-free grammars ===
A ''[[context-free grammar]]'' is a grammar in which the left-hand side of each production rule consists of only a single nonterminal symbol. This restriction is non-trivial; not all languages can be generated by context-free grammars. Those that can are called ''context-free languages''.

The language &lt;math&gt;L(G) = \left \{ a^{n}b^{n}c^{n} \mid n \ge 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt; defined above is not a context-free language, and this can be strictly proven using the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]], but for example the language &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a^{n}b^{n} \mid n \ge 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt; (at least 1 &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; followed by the same number of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;'s) is context-free, as it can be defined by the grammar &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N=\left \{S\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\left \{a,b\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the start symbol, and the following production rules:

: 1. &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow aSb&lt;/math&gt;
: 2. &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow ab&lt;/math&gt;

A context-free language can be recognized in &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; time (''see'' [[Big O notation]]) by an algorithm such as [[Earley's algorithm]]. That is, for every context-free language, a machine can be built that takes a string as input and determines in &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; time whether the string is a member of the language, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the string.&lt;ref name="Earley1970"&gt;Earley, Jay, "[http://ra.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/home/anon/usr/ftp/scan/CMU-CS-68-earley.pdf An Efficient Context-Free Parsing Algorithm]," ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 13 No. 2, pp. 94-102, February 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deterministic context-free language]]s is a subset of context-free languages that can be recognized in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = D. E. | authorlink = Donald Knuth | title = On the translation of languages from left to right | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90426-2 | journal = Information and Control | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–639 | date=July 1965 | url = http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs48/mxcom/doc/knuth65.pdf | accessdate=29 May 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist various algorithms that target either this set of languages or some subset of it.

=== Regular grammars ===
In [[regular grammar]]s, the left hand side is again only a single nonterminal symbol, but now the right-hand side is also restricted. The right side may be the empty string, or a single terminal symbol, or a single terminal symbol followed by a nonterminal symbol, but nothing else. (Sometimes a broader definition is used: one can allow longer strings of terminals or single nonterminals without anything else, making languages [[syntactic sugar|easier to denote]] while still defining the same class of languages.)

The language &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a^{n}b^{n} \mid n \ge 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt; defined above is not regular, but the language &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a^{n}b^{m} \mid m,n \ge 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt; (at least 1 &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; followed by at least 1 &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, where the numbers may be different) is, as it can be defined by the grammar &lt;math&gt;G_3&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N=\left \{S, A,B\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\left \{a,b\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the start symbol, and the following production rules:

:# &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow aA&lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow aA&lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow bB&lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt;B \rightarrow bB&lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt;B \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

All languages generated by a regular grammar can be recognized in &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time by a [[finite state machine]]. Although, in practice, regular grammars are commonly expressed using [[regular expression]]s, some forms of regular expression used in practice do not strictly generate the regular languages and do not show linear recognitional performance due to those deviations.

=== Other forms of generative grammars ===
Many extensions and variations on Chomsky's original hierarchy of formal grammars have been developed, both by linguists and by computer scientists, usually either in order to increase their expressive power or in order to make them easier to analyze or parse. Some forms of grammars developed include:

* [[Tree-adjoining grammar]]s increase the expressiveness of conventional generative grammars by allowing rewrite rules to operate on [[parse tree]]s instead of just strings.&lt;ref name="JoshiEtAl1975"&gt;Joshi, Aravind K., ''et al.'', "Tree Adjunct Grammars," ''Journal of Computer Systems Science'', Vol. 10 No. 1, pp. 136-163, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Affix grammar]]s&lt;ref name="Koster1971"&gt;Koster , Cornelis H. A., "Affix Grammars," in ''ALGOL 68 Implementation'', North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, p. 95-109, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[attribute grammar]]s&lt;ref name="Knuth1968"&gt;Knuth, Donald E., "[https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/331/fall16/01/resources/papers/Knuth67AG.pdf Semantics of Context-Free Languages]," ''Mathematical Systems Theory'', Vol. 2 No. 2, pp. 127-145, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knuth1971"&gt;Knuth, Donald E., "Semantics of Context-Free Languages (correction)," ''Mathematical Systems Theory'', Vol. 5 No. 1, pp 95-96, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; allow rewrite rules to be augmented with semantic attributes and operations, useful both for increasing grammar expressiveness and for constructing practical language translation tools.

=== Recursive grammars ===
{{distinguish|Recursive language}}
A recursive grammar is a grammar that contains production rules that are [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]]. For example, a  grammar for a [[context-free language]] is [[left recursion|left-recursive]] if there exists a non-terminal symbol ''A'' that can be put through the production rules to produce a string with ''A'' as the leftmost symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.may.ie/~jpower/Courses/parsing/parsing.pdf#search='indirect%20left%20recursion'  Notes on Formal Language Theory and Parsing], James Power, Department of Computer Science National University of Ireland, Maynooth Maynooth, Co. Kildare, Ireland.[[JPR02]]&lt;/ref&gt;
All types of grammars in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] can be recursive.

== Analytic grammars ==

Though there is a tremendous body of literature on [[parsing algorithm]]s, most of these algorithms assume that the language to be parsed is initially ''described'' by means of a ''generative'' formal grammar, and that the goal is to transform this generative grammar into a working parser. Strictly speaking, a generative grammar does not in any way correspond to the algorithm used to parse a language, and various algorithms have different restrictions on the form of production rules that are considered well-formed.

An alternative approach is to formalize the language in terms of an analytic grammar in the first place, which more directly corresponds to the structure and semantics of a parser for the language. Examples of analytic grammar formalisms include the following:
* [http://languagemachine.sourceforge.net/ The Language Machine] directly implements unrestricted analytic grammars. Substitution rules are used to transform an input to produce outputs and behaviour. The system can also produce [http://languagemachine.sourceforge.net/picturebook.html the lm-diagram], which shows what happens when the rules of an unrestricted analytic grammar are being applied.
* [[Top-down parsing language]] (TDPL): a highly minimalist analytic grammar formalism developed in the early 1970s to study the behavior of [[Top-down parsing|top-down parsers]].&lt;ref name="Birman1970"&gt;Birman, Alexander, ''[http://bford.info/packrat/ref/birman70tmg.pdf The TMG Recognition Schema]'', Doctoral thesis, Princeton University, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, February 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Link grammar]]s: a form of analytic grammar designed for [[linguistics]], which derives syntactic structure by examining the positional relationships between pairs of words.&lt;ref name="Sleater&amp;Temperly1991"&gt;Sleator, Daniel D. &amp; Temperly, Davy, "[https://arxiv.org/pdf/cmp-lg/9508004 Parsing English with a Link Grammar]," Technical Report CMU-CS-91-196, Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sleater&amp;Temperly1993"&gt;Sleator, Daniel D. &amp; Temperly, Davy, "Parsing English with a Link Grammar," ''Third International Workshop on Parsing Technologies'', 1993. (Revised version of above report.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Parsing expression grammar]]s (PEGs): a more recent generalization of TDPL designed around the practical [[Expressivity (computer science)|expressiveness]] needs of [[programming language]] and [[compiler]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Bryan, ''[https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/87310/51972156-MIT.pdf;sequence=2 Packrat Parsing: a Practical Linear-Time Algorithm with Backtracking]'', Master’s thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sept. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Foul Play (novel) 1868.jpg|thumb|First edition title page]]
'''''Foul Play''''' is an 1869 [[melodramatic]] or [[Sensation novel|sensation]] novel by the British writer [[Charles Reade]]. In [[Victorian Britain]] a clergyman is wrongly convicted of a crime and [[transported]] to Australia. He is shipwrecked with an aristocratic woman on the hitherto uncharted "Godsend Island" in the South Pacific. Eventually he is rescued and vindicated of his crime.

==Adaptations==
In 1914 it served as the basis for the American ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (1914 film)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]''. In 1920 the novel was adapted into a silent film ''[[Foul Play (1920 film)|Foul Play]]'' directed by [[Edwin J. Collins]] and starring [[Renee Kelly]] and [[Henry Hallett]].

"'''Future-Drama'''" is the fifteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 16)|sixteenth season]]. The 350th episode overall, it originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on April 17, 2005.&lt;ref name="officialsite"/&gt; In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] stumble into [[Professor Frink]]'s basement, and he gives them a look into their future as teenagers as they get ready for their [[high school]] graduation. [[Matt Selman]] wrote the episode, and [[Mike B. Anderson]] served as director. [[Amy Poehler]] and [[John DiMaggio]] guest-starred as the characters of Jenda and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] respectively.

==Plot==
In the midst of one of their arguments, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] fall into [[Professor Frink]]'s basement. Frink uses an [[astrology]]-based machine to [[Fortune-telling|show the kids their future]] as teenagers.

Eight years in the future (2013), Bart and Lisa are getting ready for their [[Secondary education in the United States#High school|high school]] [[Academic graduation by country#United States of America|graduation]] and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have separated after Homer blew the family savings on an [[Underwater habitat|undersea home]]. Lisa is graduating two years early and has a scholarship to [[Yale University]], while dating a muscular [[Milhouse van Houten|Milhouse]] and Bart dates a skateboarder named Jenda. He also shows them a picture of Lisa at age 12 (2009) after she was saved by Milhouse from a fire (which she later learns that he started). After the prom, Jenda wants to have sex with Bart, but Bart has no plans for the future and wants Jenda to marry him and live an aimless life, so she breaks up with him.

Bart unsuccessfully seeks advice from Homer on dating. He then shows Lisa a [[hologram]] of the prom, and tells her love can be painful; she agrees, noting she broke up with Milhouse and he had an [[Incredible Hulk]]-style meltdown. Lisa suggests that to get Jenda back, he must show her he can provide for her. Bart decides to take Lisa's advice and gets a job at the [[Kwik-E-Mart]]. While delivering groceries to an elderly Mr. Burns, he rescues him from a robbery by [[Snake Jailbird]]. As a reward, Burns gives Lisa's scholarship to Bart. He accepts it, seeing it as a way to get Jenda back. He then tells Lisa about the scholarship causing present and future Lisa to both get angry at Bart. Bart reconciles with Jenda, and now has a good future. That night, Jenda again wants to have sex with Bart, but then he goes into Professor Frink's basement and sees Lisa's bleak future with Milhouse on Frink's machine. Jenda is furious at Bart (she notes she never had any problems sparking romance with Todd Flanders), and gives him an ultimatum: leave and they are finished. Bart does head out and saves Lisa from accepting Milhouse's dismal proposal, then tells his sister he is giving her scholarship back and will find a woman who loves him for himself. Professor Frink then tells present Bart he will get one at age 83, then die one minute later, and his brain would be buried in a pauper's grave.

Meanwhile, Marge has dumped [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] and reunites with Homer in the underwater home. During the credits, Bart is shown to find the sequence boring, and instead watches [[Cletus Spuckler]]'s future as the [[Vice President of the United States]] on his way to a funeral for the [[Sultan of Brunei]].

==Production==
[[File:Matt Selman by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|Matt Selman was inspired to write the episode after asking himself what if people saw Lisa and Bart as teenagers.]]

The episode was written by [[Matt Selman]], his thirteenth writing credit for ''The Simpsons''. The episode was the third season sixteen episode that [[Mike B. Anderson]] directed, following "[[Fat Man and Little Boy (The Simpsons)|Fat Man and Little Boy]]" and "[[Pranksta Rap]]". It was the third future-themed episode of ''The Simpsons'', following the season six episode "[[Lisa's Wedding]]" and the season eleven episode "[[Bart to the Future]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halpern|first=Paul|title=What's Science Ever Done For Us?: What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-11460-5|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yXhRxHApuwC&amp;dq=%22Bart+to+the+Future%22&amp;q=%22bart+to+the+future%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22bart%20to%20the%20future%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Childs&gt;{{cite news|last=Childs|first=Hayden|title='Holidays Of Future Passed'|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/holidays-of-future-passed,66387/|accessdate=2011-12-12|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though this is the 350th episode broadcast on FOX, the 350th in production order is "[[The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star]]" (which was temporarily shelved following Pope John Paul II's death, and was originally supposed to air after "[[Don't Fear the Roofer]]").

In an interview, Selman stated that the story of the episode originated when he asked himself what if people saw Bart and Lisa grow up as "ugly teenagers".&lt;ref name="amc"&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707110851/http://blogs.amctv.com/scifi-scanner/2008/11/matt-selman-interview.php AMC - Blogs - SciFi Scanner - ''Simpsons'' Scribe Matt Selman Shares His ''Mad Men'' Inspiration.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

The episode's title is a parody of the TV series ''[[Futurama]]'', which was also created by ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]].&lt;ref name="futurama"&gt;[http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/episodes/future-drama Future-Drama (GABF12) episode guide&amp;nbsp;— Simpsons Crazy]&lt;/ref&gt; The character [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] makes a cameo appearance when Homer and Bart pass through a [[Quantum tunneling|quantum tunnel]]; voice actor [[John DiMaggio]] reprised his role voicing Bender.&lt;ref name="futurama"/&gt; The song playing while Homer and Bart cruise through the former's hovercar is "[[I.G.Y. (What a Beautiful World)|I.G.Y.]]" by [[Donald Fagen]]. The songs "[[Take On Me]]" by [[a-ha]], "[[Bizarre Love Triangle]]" by [[New Order (band)|New Order]], "[[Incense and Peppermints (song)|Incense and Peppermints]]" by [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]], and "[[True (Spandau Ballet song)|True]]" by [[Spandau Ballet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3996 True by Spandau Ballet songfacts]&lt;/ref&gt; are played during Bart and Lisa's prom. "[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]]" by [[Phil Phillips]] plays while Homer and Marge kiss in the former's aquatic home. "Lenny's Super Pet" bears a strong resemblance to [[Superman]]'s pet dog, [[Krypto the Superdog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/future-drama/episode/383730/trivia.html TV.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919173554/http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/future-drama/episode/383730/trivia.html |date=2010-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "Future-Drama" garnered roughly 8.3 million viewers. The show finished third in its original timeslot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonschannel.com/2005/04/ratings-future-drama |title=Ratings: Future-Drama |publisher=SimpsonsChannel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924194608/http://www.simpsonschannel.com/2005/04/ratings-future-drama/ |archivedate=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode has garnered positive reviews from critics. Hayden Childs of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote in 2011 that the episode was "full of sweetness and funny", but he thought "[[Holidays of Future Passed]]" was better.&lt;ref name="Childs"/&gt;

The episode was also nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (July 15, 2005). "Emmy nominees". The Star-Ledger: p. 060.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it lost to South Park's "[[Best Friends Forever (South Park)|Best Friends Forever]]", its first Emmy win.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10123">The '''Golden Goose Award''' is a United States award established in 2012 that officially recognizes [[scientist]]s whose federally funded [[basic research]] has led to innovations or inventions which have a significant impact on humanity or society. The results have been significant health and economic benefits. The award has bi-partisan support in Congress and is sponsored by a number of notable organizations and legislators.

The burgeoning research has often had odd-sounding names. Since the 1970s such titles were the subject of ridicule by the late Senator [[William Proxmire]] and his monthly [[Golden Fleece Awards]]. For example, with his first Golden Fleece Award in March 1975, Senator Proxmire directly ridiculed a [[National Science Foundation]] study on why people fall in love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Another study entitled "''Acoustic Trauma in the Guinea Pig Cochlea''" has resulted in a treatment for hearing loss in infants. Other research funded by U.S. federal agencies have led to widely used technologies such as laser technology, the internet, [[fiber optics]], the [[Global Positioning System]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), computer touch screens and lithium-ion batteries.&lt;ref name=pin&gt;

Recipients receive the award in a ceremony during the fall each year on [[Capitol Hill]] in Washington D.C.

==Purpose==
In the face of pressure to cut wasteful spending in the U.S. federal budget, along with the need to underscore the significance of basic research, and as a counter to Proxmire's awards, this award was created. Awardees include Nobel Prize winners. The purpose of the awards is to "demonstrate the human and economic benefits of federally funded research by highlighting examples of seemingly obscure or unusual studies that have led to major breakthroughs and have had a significant impact on society".&lt;ref name=awardees&gt;

The purpose of the award has also been described as follows:

"Such innovation has been critically important to economic growth in the United States, and will be even more so as global scientific research becomes increasingly competitive".&lt;ref name=lemp/&gt;

"Ever since the days of the Golden Fleece Awards, spearheaded by the late Senator [[William Proxmire]], some policymakers have delighted in turning quirky or unusual research titles into a punch line".&lt;ref name=pin/&gt;&lt;ref name=coop/&gt;

"The United States may now risk falling behind in scientific discoveries as other countries increase their science funding. We need to get serious about science".&lt;ref name=coop/&gt;

==Historical examples==
The bi-partisan group of legislators that back the Golden Goose award and the founding organizations cite odd-titled research of the past which led to widely used scientific advances. The first cited example is when [[Alexander Fleming]] published ''Anti-Bacterial Substance in Filtrates of Broth'' in 1926 which has become known as [[penicillin]]. Second, [[X-ray]]s probably sounded odd in 1895 after [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] named such phenomena that caused a glow in a nearby chemically coated screen. Third, studies on the excretion of urine in dogs and the excretion of [[insulin]] by [[Dogfish sharks|dog fish]] ultimately led to advancements in understanding [[diabetes]] which earned the [[National Medal of Science]].

==Founding Organizations==
Some of the founding organizations for this award are the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS), the [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU), the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities]] (A۰P۰L۰U), the [[Breakthrough Institute]], the [[Progressive Policy Institute]] (PPI), and [[The Science Coalition]] (TSC) &lt;ref name=awardees/&gt;

'''Herbert George Wells'''&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;
[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/wells_h_g "Wells, H. G."]. Revised 20 May 2015. ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (sf-encyclopedia.com). Retrieved 2015-08-22. Entry by 'JC/BS', [[John Clute]] and [[Brian Stableford]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Parrinder/&gt; (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, writing dozens of novels, short stories, and works of social commentary, satire, biography, and autobiography, including even two books on war games. He is now best remembered for his [[science fiction]] novels and is often called a "father of science fiction", along with [[Jules Verne]] and [[Hugo Gernsback]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Charles Roberts (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRw_MIPjnXwC&amp;pg=PA48 "The History of Science Fiction", page 48]. In ''Science Fiction'', Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-19204-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Siegel| first= Mark Richard| authorlink= | year=1988 | title=Hugo Gernsback, Father of Modern Science Fiction: With Essays on Frank Herbert and Bram Stoker | publisher=Borgo Pr | location= | isbn=0-89370-174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=sfhof}}

During his own lifetime, however, he was most prominent as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. A [[futurist]], he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HG Wells: A visionary who should be remembered for his social predictions, not just his scientific ones|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/hg-wells-a-visionary-who-should-be-remembered-for-his-social-predictions-not-just-his-scientific-a7320486.html|publisher=The Independent|date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, and biological engineering. [[Brian Aldiss]] referred to Wells as the "Shakespeare of science fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagar|first1=W. Warren|title=H.G. Wells: Traversing Time|date=2004|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most notable science fiction works include ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'' (1896), ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' (1897), ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) and the military science fiction ''[[The War in the Air]]'' (1907). Wells was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] four times.&lt;ref name="Nobel nominations"/&gt;

Wells's earliest specialised training was in [[biology]], and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] context.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Philmus and David Y. Hughes, ed., ''H. G. Wells: Early Writings in Science and Science Fiction'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1975), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also from an early date an outspoken [[socialism|socialist]], often (but not always, as at the beginning of the [[First World War]]) sympathising with [[pacifism|pacifist]] views. His later works became increasingly political and [[didacticism|didactic]], and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Brome, ''H. G. Wells: A Biography'' (London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt; Novels such as ''[[Kipps]]'' and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'', which describe lower-middle-class life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Brome, ''H. G. Wells: A Biography'' (London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green, 1951), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in ''[[Tono-Bungay]]'' (1909), a diagnosis of [[English society]] as a whole. A diabetic, Wells co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (known today as [[Diabetes UK]]) in 1934.

==Life==
===Early life===
Herbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 162 High Street in [[Bromley]], [[Kent]],&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=H. G. |authorlink=H. G. Wells |editor1-last=Claeys |editor1-first=Gregory |editor2-last=Parrinder |editor2-first=Patrick |others=Gregory Claeys, Francis Wheen, Andy Sawyer |title=A Modern Utopia |origyear=1905 |date=2005 |publisher=Penguin Classics |isbn=978-0-14-144112-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 September 1866.&lt;ref name=Parrinder&gt;{{cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Patrick |title=''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called "Bertie" in the family, he was the fourth and last child of [[Joseph Wells (cricketer)|Joseph Wells]] (a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional [[cricket]]er) and his wife, Sarah Neal (a former [[domestic worker|domestic servant]]). An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing [[Amateur and professional cricketers|professional cricket]] for the [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent county team]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, David C. (1986) ''H. G. Wells: Desperately mortal. A biography.'' Yale University Press, New Haven and London {{ISBN|0-300-03672-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards, or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played.

A defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg.&lt;ref name=Parrinder/&gt; To pass the time he began to read books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a [[private school]] founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing [[Copperplate script|copperplate handwriting]] and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, suffered a fractured thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sep. 21, 1866: Wells Springs Forth|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/0921hg-wells-birthday/|publisher=Wired|date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uppark-Sfront-01.jpg|thumb|left|Wells spent the winter of 1887/88 convalescing at [[Uppark]], where his mother, Sarah, was housekeeper.&lt;ref name=Pevsner&gt;{{cite book |last=Nairn |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Nairn |author2=Pevsner, Nikolaus |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner  |title=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]]: Sussex |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth |year=1965 |isbn=0-14-071028-0 |pages=358–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
No longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as [[apprenticeship|apprentice]]s in various occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HG Wells: prophet of free love|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/11/hg-wells-david-lodge|publisher=The Guardian|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a [[draper]] at the [[Southsea]] Drapery Emporium, Hyde's.&lt;ref name="GHW1925" /&gt; His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices,&lt;ref name="Francis"/&gt; later inspired his novels ''[[The Wheels of Chance]]'', ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'', and ''[[Kipps]]'', which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Batchelor |first=John |title=H. G. Wells |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |year=1985 |page=2|isbn=0-521-27804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells's parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother's being a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and his father's being a [[Freethought|freethinker]]. When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at [[Uppark]], a [[English country house|country house]] in [[Sussex]]), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. However, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', and the works of [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref name="McFarland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilkington|first1=Ace G.|title=Science Fiction and Futurism: Their Terms and Ideas|date=2017|publisher=McFarland|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the beginning of Wells's venture into literature.

===Teacher===
[[File:H. G. Wells, c.1890.jpg|thumb|Wells studying in London {{Circa}} 1890]]

In October 1879, Wells's mother arranged through a distant relative, Arthur Williams, for him to join the [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] at [[Wookey]] in Somerset as a pupil–teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children.&lt;ref name="GHW1925"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=Geoffrey H.|title=The Works of H. G. Wells|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1925|page=xvi|oclc=458934085|isbn=0-86012-096-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby [[Midhurst]] and an even shorter stay as a boarder at [[Midhurst Grammar School]], he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's. In 1883, Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil–teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name="GHW1925" /&gt;

The years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point, but his good fortune at securing a position at Midhurst Grammar School meant that Wells could continue his self-education in earnest.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The following year, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the [[Royal College of Science]] in [[South Kensington]], now part of [[Imperial College London]]) in London, studying [[biology]] under [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref name="Wells school"/&gt; As an alumnus, he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he became the first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887, with a weekly allowance of 21 [[shilling]]s (a [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]) thanks to his scholarship. This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many [[working class]] families had "round about a pound a week" as their entire household income)&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, M.S. ''Round About a Pound a Week''. New York: Garland Pub., 1980. {{ISBN|0-8240-0119-2}}. Some of the text is available online.&lt;/ref&gt; yet in his ''Experiment in Autobiography'', Wells speaks of constantly being hungry, and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brome|first1=Vincent|title=H. G. Wells|date=2008|publisher=House of Stratus|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:H G Wells - Sandgate - Project Gutenberg eText 13715.png|thumbnail|left|upright|H. G. Wells in 1907 at the door of his house at [[Sandgate, Kent|Sandgate]]]]
He soon entered the Debating Society of the school. These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society. At first approaching the subject through Plato's ''Republic'', he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed [[Fabian Society]] and free lectures delivered at [[Kelmscott House]], the home of [[William Morris]]. He was also among the founders of ''The Science School Journal'', a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as trying his hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'' was published in the journal under the title ''[[The Chronic Argonauts]]''. The school year 1886–87 was the last year of his studies.&lt;ref name="Wells school"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batchelor|first1=John|title=H. G. Wells|date=1985|publisher=CUP Archive|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1888, Wells stayed in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], living in [[Basford, Staffordshire|Basford]]. The unique environment of [[The Potteries]] was certainly an inspiration. He wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that "the district made an immense impression on me." The inspiration for some of his descriptions in ''The War of the Worlds'' is thought to have come from his short time spent here, seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city, shooting huge red light into the skies. His stay in The Potteries also resulted in the macabre short story "[[The Cone]]" (1895, contemporaneous with his famous ''The Time Machine''), set in the north of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John R.|last=Hammond|title=A Preface to H G Wells|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1sSBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|date=22 July 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-87701-1|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After teaching for some time, he was briefly on the staff of [[Holt, Wrexham County Borough|Holt]] Academy in Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2016-10-03|title=Teaching spell near Wrexham inspired one of the nation's greatest science fiction writers|first=Jamie|last=Bowman|work=[[The Leader (Welsh newspaper)|The Leader]]|location=Wrexham|accessdate=2018-05-13|url=http://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/15956789.Teaching_spell_near_Wrexham_inspired_one_of_the_nation_s_greatest_science_fiction_writers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the College of Preceptors ([[College of Teachers]]). He later received his Licentiate and Fellowship [[College of Teachers|FCP]] diplomas from the College. It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in [[zoology]] from the [[University of London External System|University of London External Programme]]. In 1889–90, he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School, where he taught [[A. A. Milne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22657 | year = 1989 | title = Hampstead: Education | journal = A History of the County of Middlesex | volume = 9 | pages = 159–169 | accessdate =9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/aamilne.htm |title=A.

Wells Under Revision: Proceedings of the International H.G. Wells Symposium, London, July 1986|date=1990|publisher=Associated University Presse|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon leaving the Normal School of Science, Wells was left without a source of income. His aunt Mary—his father's sister-in-law—invited him to stay with her for a while, which solved his immediate problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's residence, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel. He would later go on to court her. To earn money, he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', later collecting these in volume form as ''[[Select Conversations with an Uncle]]'' (1895) and ''[[Certain Personal Matters]]'' (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C Smith, "Most of Wells's occasional pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so ... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It is obvious that many early Wells items have been lost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = David C Smith | year = 1986 | title = H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | page = 35 | isbn = 0300036728}}&lt;/ref&gt; His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, ''[[The Time Machine]]'', in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=John R.|year=2004|title=H.

===Personal life===

In 1891, Wells [[cousin marriage|married his cousin]] Isabel Mary Wells. The couple agreed to separate in 1894 when he fell in love with one of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins (later known as Jane), with whom he moved to [[Woking]], Surrey in May 1895.

In the run-up to the 143rd anniversary of Wells's birth, [[Google]] published a cartoon riddle series with the solution being the coordinates of Woking's nearby Horsell Common—the location of the Martian landings in ''The War Of The Worlds''—described in newspaper article by {{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/sep/21/google-hgwells-doodle-mystery |title=HG Wells – Google reveals answer to teaser doodles |last=Schofield |first=Jack |date=21 September 2009 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late summer 1896, Wells and Jane moved to a larger house in [[Worcester Park]], near [[Kingston upon Thames]], for two years; this lasted until his poor health took them to Sandgate, near [[Folkestone]], where he constructed a large family home, [[Spade House]], in 1901. He had two sons with Jane: [[G. P. Wells|George Philip]] (known as "Gip"; 1901–1985) and Frank Richard (1903–1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wager|first1=Warren W.|title=H.G. Wells: Traversing Time|date=2004|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways that Wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches. One common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries, and they covered a wide variety of topics, from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests. During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, he drew a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments on their marriage. During this period, he called these pictures "picshuas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/06/0531wells.html |title=H. G.

The book is a seminal depiction of a conflict between mankind and an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] race.]]

Some of his early novels, called "[[scientific romance]]s", invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as ''[[The Time Machine]]'', ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[The Sleeper Awakes|When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', and ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''. He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including ''[[Kipps]]'' and a critique of English culture during the Edwardian period, ''[[Tono-Bungay]]''. Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, including, "The Flowering of the Strange Orchid", which helped bring the full impact of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public, and was followed by many later successes such as "[[The Country of the Blind]]" (1904).&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10359900&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0007087416000352 "British Journal for the History of Science"]. Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 17 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[James E. Gunn (writer)|James Gunn]], one of Wells's major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his "new system of ideas".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfcenter.ku.edu/tomorrow.htm The Man Who Invented Tomorrow] In 1902, when [[Arnold Bennett]] was writing a long article for ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' about Wells as a serious writer, Wells expressed his hope that Bennett would stress his "new system of ideas". Wells developed a theory to justify the way he wrote (he was fond of theories), and these theories helped others write in similar ways.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as "the plausible impossible" and "[[suspension of disbelief]]". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.&lt;ref name="McFarland"/&gt; He explained that while writing ''The Time Machine'', he realized that "the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the [[Time travel|Time Traveller]] were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writework.com/book-guides/the-time-machine-h-g-wells/scientists-and-gentlemen|title=The Time Machine - Scientists and Gentlemen   - WriteWork|website=www.writework.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the "law" appears in his introduction to ''The Scientific Romances of H.G. Wells'' (1933),

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real. Touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis. Any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D.

[[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Dr. Griffin / The Invisible Man]] is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a method of invisibility, but finds himself unable to reverse the process. An enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in [[horror fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Fiction and the Fiction of Science: Collected Essays on SF Storytelling and the Gnostic Imagination|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|pages=41, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Island of Doctor Moreau'' sees a shipwrecked man left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a [[mad scientist]] who creates [[Human–animal hybrid|human-like hybrid beings]] from animals via vivisection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novels: The Island of Doctor Moreau|url=http://academic.depauw.edu/aevans_web/HONR101-02/WebPages/Spring2006/Schmid(Todd)/wells.html|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest depiction of [[Uplift (science fiction)|uplift]], the novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-island-of-doctor-moreau-h-g-wells/1120353655?ean=9781499744446|title=The Island of Doctor Moreau: Original and Unabridged|author=Barnes &amp; Noble|work=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''Tono-Bungay'' is not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it. Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914). This book contains what is surely his biggest prophetic "hit", with the first description of a [[nuclear weapon]].&lt;ref name="Nuclear"/&gt; Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of [[radium]] releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years. The ''rate'' of release is too slow to have practical utility, but the ''total amount'' released is huge. Wells's novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosives—but which "continue to explode" for days on end. "Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century", he wrote, "than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible&amp;nbsp;... [but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands".&lt;ref name="Nuclear"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Herbert George|title=The Last War: A World Set Free|date=2001|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|page=XIX}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, the physicist and conceiver of [[nuclear chain reaction]] [[Leó Szilárd]] read ''The World Set Free'' (the same year Sir [[James Chadwick]] discovered the [[neutron]]), a book which he said made a great impression on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Richard Rhodes]] | year = 1986 | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | page = 24 | isbn = 0-684-81378-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells also wrote non-fiction. His first non-fiction [[bestseller]] was ''[[Anticipations|Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought]]'' (1901). When originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled, "An Experiment in Prophecy", and is considered his most explicitly [[future|futuristic]] work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German [[militarism]], and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful [[aircraft]] before 1950, and averred that "my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanityplus.org/learn/about-us/wells |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520001844/http://humanityplus.org/learn/about-us/wells |archivedate=20 May 2009 |title=Annual HG Wells Award for Outstanding Contributions to Transhumanism |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Frank Miller|title=Contesting Cultural Authority: Essays in Victorian Intellectual Life|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-37257-7|pages=219–20|chapter=Public Science in Britain 1880–1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His bestselling two-volume work, ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1920), began a new era of popularised world history. It received a mixed critical response from professional historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~tdoyle/hgwells/outline_hist.shtml |title=The Outline of History—H. G.

Many other authors followed with "Outlines" of their own in other subjects. He reprised his ''Outline'' in 1922 with a much shorter popular work, ''[[A Short History of the World (H. G.

[[File:H. G. Wells Daily Mirror.jpg|thumb|upright|H. G. Wells {{Circa}} 1918|right]]
From quite early in Wells's career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of [[Utopia]]n novels. The first of these was ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with "no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all";&lt;ref&gt;''A Modern Utopia''&lt;/ref&gt; two travellers from our world fall into its [[alternate history]]. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a [[comet]] causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (''[[In the Days of the Comet]]'' (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 [[Alexander Korda]] film, ''[[Things to Come]]''). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending [[World War II|World War]], with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of [[fascism|fascist]] dictators in ''The Autocracy of Mr Parham'' (1930) and ''The Holy Terror'' (1939). ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the critic [[Malcolm Cowley]] stated: "by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer".&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Malcolm. "Outline of Wells's History." ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (pp. 22–23).&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells contemplates the ideas of [[nature and nurture]] and questions humanity in books such as ''The Island of Doctor Moreau''. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'' (1899, rewritten as ''The Sleeper Awakes'', 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers.&lt;ref&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 153, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Island of Doctor Moreau'' is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like [[Gulliver's Travels|Gulliver]] on his return from the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.&lt;ref name="Moreau"&gt;Wells, H. G. (2005). ''The Island of Dr Moreau''. "Fear and Trembling". Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of [[W. N. P. Barbellion]]'s diaries, ''The Journal of a Disappointed Man'', published in 1919. Since "Barbellion" was the real author's [[pen name]], many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the ''Journal''; Wells always denied this, despite being full of praise for the diaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/thequotablebarbellion/a-barbellion-chronology "A Barbellion Chronology"].

In 1927, a Canadian teacher and writer [[Florence Deeks]] unsuccessfully sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust, claiming that much of ''The Outline of History'' had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;At the time of the alleged infringement in 1919–20, unpublished works were protected in Canada under common law.{{cite journal |last=Magnusson |first=Denis N. |date=Spring 2004 |title=Hell Hath No Fury: Copyright Lawyers' Lessons from ''Deeks v.

While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with [[sexism]] from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Magnusson |first=Denis N. |date=Spring 2004 |title=Hell Hath No Fury: Copyright Lawyers' Lessons from Deeks v.

Prior to 1933, Wells's books were widely read in Germany and Austria, and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication.&lt;ref name="Partington"/&gt; By 1933, he had attracted the attention of German officials because of his criticism of the political situation in Germany, and on 10 May 1933, Wells's books were [[List of book-burning incidents#Jewish, anti-Nazi and "degenerate" books (by the Nazis)|burned by the Nazi youth]] in Berlin's [[Bebelplatz|Opernplatz]], and his works were banned from libraries and book stores.&lt;ref name="Partington"&gt;Patrick Parrinder and John S. Partington (2005). ''The Reception of H. G. Wells in Europe''. pp. 106–108. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Wells, as president of [[PEN International]] (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), angered the [[Nazism|Nazis]] by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN's refusal to admit non-[[Aryan]] writers to its membership. At a PEN conference in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Wells refused to yield to Nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author [[Ernst Toller]] be prevented from speaking.&lt;ref name="Partington"/&gt; Near the end of the World War II, [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] discovered that the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned [[Operation Sea Lion]], with Wells included in the alphabetical list of "[[The Black Book]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Frank.

Seeking a more structured way to play war games, Wells also wrote ''[[Floor Games]]'' (1911) followed by ''[[Little Wars]]'' (1913), which set out rules for fighting battles with [[toy soldier]]s (miniatures).&lt;ref name="toy soldiers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rundle|first1=Michael|title=How H.

=== Travels to Russia===
Wells visited Russia three times: 1914, 1920 and 1934. During his second visit, he saw his old friend [[Maxim Gorky]] and with Gorky's help, met [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In his book ''[[Russia in the Shadows]]'', Wells portrayed Russia as recovering from a total social collapse, "the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, ''Russia in the Shadows'' (New York: George H. Doran, 1921), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 1934, after visiting U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Wells went to the Soviet Union and interviewed [[Joseph Stalin]] for three hours for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine, which was extremely rare at that time. He told Stalin how he had seen 'the happy faces of healthy people' in contrast with his previous visit to Moscow in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.G.

Stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly. As the chairman of the London-based [[PEN International|PEN Club]], which protected the rights of authors to write without being intimidated, Wells hoped by his trip to USSR, he could win Stalin over by force of argument.

===Final years===
[[File:Herbert George Wells in 1943.jpg|right|thumb|upright|H. G. Wells in 1943]]
Wells's literary reputation declined as he spent his later years promoting causes that were rejected by most of his contemporaries as well as by younger authors whom he had previously influenced. In this connection, [[George Orwell]] described Wells as "too sane to understand the modern world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orwell |first=George |title=Wells, Hitler and the World State |journal=Horizon |date=August 1941 |url=http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/wells/english/e_whws |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118081350/http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/wells/english/e_whws |archivedate=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. K. Chesterton]] quipped: "Mr Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message".&lt;ref&gt;Chesterton's reference is to the biblical "[[mess of pottage]]", implying that Wells had sold out his artistic birthright in mid-career: {{cite book|last1=Rolfe|first1=Christopher|last2=Parrinder|first2=Patrick|authorlink2=|title=H.

On 28 October 1940, on the radio station [[KTSA]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Wells took part in a radio interview with [[Orson Welles]], who two years previously had performed a famous [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|radio adaptation of ''The War of the Worlds'']]. During the interview, by Charles C Shaw, a KTSA radio host, Wells admitted his surprise at the widespread panic that resulted from the broadcast but acknowledged his debt to Welles for increasing sales of one of his "more obscure" titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flynn|first=John L. |authorlink=|title=War of the Worlds: from Wells to Spielberg by |publisher=Galactic|isbn=978-0-9769400-0-5|location=Owens Mills, MD|page=45|chapter=The legacy of Orson Welles and the Radio Broadcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
{{Main|Political views of H.G. Wells}}
[[File:Churchill V sign HU 55521.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An avid reader of Wells' books, [[Winston Churchill]] wrote to the author in 1906, stating "I owe you a great debt", two days before giving an early landmark speech that the state should support its citizens, providing pensions, insurance and child welfare.&lt;ref name="Churchill"&gt;{{cite news|URL=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/churchill-borrowed-famous-lines-from-books-by-hg-wells-6229767.html|title=Churchill 'borrowed' famous lines from books by HG Wells|publisher=The Independent|date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Wells called his political views socialist. His contemporary political impact was limited, however, excluding his fiction's positivist stance on the leaps that could be made by [[physics]] towards world peace. [[Winston Churchill]] was an avid reader of Wells' books, and after they first met in 1902 they kept in touch until Wells died in 1946.&lt;ref name="Churchill"/&gt; As a junior minister Churchill borrowed lines from Wells for one of his most famous early landmark speeches in 1906, and as Prime Minister the phrase "[[The Second World War (book series)|the gathering storm]]" — used by Churchill to describe the rise of Nazi Germany — had been written by Wells in ''The War of the Worlds'', which depicts an attack on Britain by Martians.&lt;ref name="Churchill"/&gt; Wells's extensive writings on equality and human rights, most notably his most influential work, ''The Rights of Man'' (1940), laid the groundwork for the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which was adopted by the United Nations shortly after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/400254/Human_Rights_and_Public_Accountability_in_H._G._Wells_Functional_World_State 'Human Rights and Public Accountability in H.

His efforts regarding the [[League of Nations]], on which he collaborated on the project with [[Leonard Woolf]] with the booklets ''The Idea of a League of Nations'', ''Prolegomena to the Study of World Organization'', and ''The Way of the League of Nations'',  became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Wells, ''[[The Fate of Homo Sapiens]]'', (London: Secker &amp; Warburg, 1939), p 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; In his last book ''[[Mind at the End of Its Tether]]'' (1945), he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea. He referred to the era between the two World Wars as "The Age of Frustration".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert George Wells Newsletter, Volume 2. p. 10. H.G. Wells Society, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
Wells wrote in his book ''God the Invisible King'' (1917) that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world: &lt;blockquote&gt;This book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer. [Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God.&amp;nbsp;... Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is opposed to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer would suggest that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H. G. |title=God the Invisible King|publisher=Cassell|location=London|year=1917|chapter=Preface|oclc=261326125|isbn=0-585-00604-0}} [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1046/1046-h/1046-h.htm Link to the online book.].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Later in the work, he aligns himself with a "renascent or modern religion&amp;nbsp;... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian&amp;nbsp;... [that] he has found growing up in himself".&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1917: "The cosmology of modern religion").&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[Christianity]], he said: "it is not now true for me.&amp;nbsp;... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother&amp;nbsp;... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie". Of other world religions, he writes: "All these religions are true for me as [[Canterbury Cathedral]] is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.&amp;nbsp;... They do not work for me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H. G. |title=First &amp; last things; a confession of faith and rules of life|year=1908|publisher=Putnam|pages=77–80|oclc=68958585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Fate of Homo Sapiens]]'' (1939), Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating "there is no creed, no way of living left in the world at all, that really meets the needs of the time… When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Fate of Homo Sapiens]]'', p 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:H G Wells SWS 2906.jpg|right|thumb|upright|H. G. Wells as depicted in Gernsback's ''[[Science Wonder Stories]]'' in 1929]]
The science fiction historian [[John Clute]] describes Wells as "the most important writer the genre has yet seen", and notes his work has been central to both British and American science fiction.&lt;ref name="jc"&gt;John Clute, ''Science Fiction :The Illustrated Encyclopedia''. Dorling Kindersley London, {{ISBN|0751302023}} (p. 114–15).&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction author and critic [[Algis Budrys]] said Wells "remains the outstanding expositor of both the hope, and the despair, which are embodied in the technology and which are the major facts of life in our world".&lt;ref name="budrys196809"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Budrys|first=Algis|author= |last2= |first2=|date=September 1968|title=Galaxy Bookshelf |department= |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v27n02_1968-09#page/n185/mode/2up|magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction|pages=187–193|type=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1921, 1932, 1935, and 1946.&lt;ref name="Nobel nominations"&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=10075 "Nomination Database: Herbert G Wells"].

In Britain, Wells's work was a key model for the British "[[Scientific Romance]]", and other writers in that mode, such as [[Olaf Stapledon]],&lt;ref&gt;Andy Sawyer, "[William] Olaf Stapledon (1886–1950)", in ''Fifty Key Figures in Science Fiction''.

Wells was also an important influence on British science fiction of the period after the Second World War, with [[Arthur C. Clarke]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Sharp, ''Popular Contemporary Writers'', Marshall Cavendish, 2005 {{ISBN|0761476016}} p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Aldiss]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Collings, ''Brian Aldiss''. Mercer Island, WA : Starmont House, 1986. {{ISBN|0916732746}} p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; expressing strong admiration for Wells's work. Among contemporary British science fiction writers, [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]] and [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]] have all acknowledged Wells's influence on their writing; all three are Vice-Presidents of the [[H. G. Wells Society]]. He also had a strong influence on British scientist [[J. B. S. Haldane]], who wrote ''[[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future]]'' (1924), "The Last Judgement" and "On Being the Right Size" from the essay collection ''Possible Worlds'' (1927), and ''Biological Possibilities for the Human Species in the Next Ten Thousand Years'' (1963), which are speculations about the future of human evolution and life on other planets.

[[Sinclair Lewis]]'s early novels were strongly influenced by Well's realistic social novels, such as ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]''; Lewis would also name his first son Wells after the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Romance of Sinclair Lewis|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1992/10/08/the-romance-of-sinclair-lewis/|date=22 September 2017|publisher=The New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External history==

===Historical development===
[[Russian language|Russian]] is a [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]] of the [[Indo-European Languages|Indo-European family]]. All Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, reconstructed as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], spoken sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era. Although no written records remain, much of the [[Proto-Indo-European society|culture]] and [[Proto-Indo-European religion|religion]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European people]] can also be reconstructed based on their daughter cultures traditionally and continuing to inhabit most of Europe and South Asia, areas to where the Proto-Indo-Europeans [[Indo-European migrations|migrated]] from their [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|original homeland]].

====Kievan period and feudal breakup====
[[Image:beresta.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|14th-century [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]]ian children were literate enough to send each other [[birch-bark letter]]s written in the [[Old Novgorod dialect]].]]

Up to the 14th century, ancestors of the modern Russians (who likewise called themselves ''ruskiye''{{refnec||date=January 2014}}) spoke dialects of the [[Old East Slavic language]], related to the dialects of other [[East Slavs]].  This spoken tongue and the literary [[Old Church Slavonic language]] operated throughout [[Kievan Rus]]. The earliest written record of the language, an amphora found at [[Gnezdovo]], may date from the mid-10th century. (Until the 15th century, Gnezdovo was a part of the independent [[Principality of Smolensk]].)

For the debate concerning derivation of the words ''Rus'' and ''Russia'', see [[Etymology of Rus and derivatives]] and [[Rus' (people)]]. For the general history of the language and Old East Slavic literature, see [[Old East Slavic language]].

During the pre-Kievan period, the main sources of borrowings were [[Germanic languages]], particularly [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]. In the Kievan period, however, [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s entered the vernacular primarily from [[Old Church Slavonic]] and from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Greek language|Greek]]:

|}

After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]] in the 13th century the vernacular language of the conquered peoples remained firmly Slavic. [[Turko-Mongol]] borrowings in Russian relate mostly to [[commerce]] and the [[military]]:

|-
| {{lang|ru|лошадь}} || {{IPA|[ˈloʂətʲ]}} || Turkic || 'horse'
|}

In Russia, [[Church Slavonic]]&amp;nbsp;– which evolved from [[Old Church Slavonic]]&amp;nbsp;– remained the literary language until the [[Peter the Great|Petrine]] age (1682–1725), when its usage shrank drastically to biblical and liturgical texts. Legal acts and private letters had been, however, already written in pre-Petrine Muscovy in a less formal language, more closely reflecting spoken Russian. The first grammar of the Russian language was written by Vasily Adodurov in the 1740s,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} and a more influential one by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] in 1755.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

After the disestablishment of the "[[Golden Horde|Tartar yoke]]" ({{lang|ru|монголо-татарское иго}}, {{IPA-ru|tɐˈtarskəjə ˈiɡə|}}) in the late 14th century, both the political centre and the predominant dialect in European [[Russia]] came to be based in [[Moscow]].   A scientific consensus exists that Russian and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (the predecessor of Belarusian and Ukrainian) had definitely become distinct by this time ''at the latest'' (according to some linguists and historians,{{who?|date=June 2014}} even earlier). The official language in Russia remained a kind of Church Slavonic until the close of the 18th century, but, despite attempts at standardization, as by [[Meletius Smotrytsky]] c.&amp;nbsp;1620, its purity was by then strongly compromised by an incipient [[Russian literature|secular literature]]. Vocabulary was borrowed from [[Polish language|Polish]], and, through it, from German and other Western European languages. At the same time, a number of words of native (according to a general consensus among etymologists of Russian) coinage or adaptation appeared, at times replacing or supplementing the inherited [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]/[[Common Slavonic]] vocabulary.

|}

Much annalistic, [[hagiography|hagiographic]], and poetic material survives from the early Muscovite period. Nonetheless, a significant amount of philosophic and secular literature is known to have been destroyed after being proclaimed [[heresy|heretical]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The material following the election of the [[Romanov]] dynasty in 1613 following the [[Time of Troubles]] is rather more complete.  Modern Russian literature is considered to have begun in the 17th century, with the autobiography of [[Avvakum]] and a corpus of ''chronique scandaleuse'' short stories from Moscow.

====Empire (18th–19th centuries)====
[[Image:Geometry 1708 Russian.GIF|thumb|right|The first book printed in the "civil" script, 1708]]

The political reforms of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and [[modernization]].  Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of [[Western Europe]].  Most of the modern naval vocabulary, for example, is of Dutch origin.  [[Latin]], French, and German words entered Russian for the intellectual categories of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].  Greek words already in the language through Church Slavonic were refashioned to reflect post-[[Renaissance]] European rather than Byzantine pronunciation.  By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke French, less often German, on an everyday basis.

|-
| {{lang|ru|библиотека}} || {{IPA|[bʲɪblʲɪɐˈtʲɛkə]}} || Gr bibliothḗkē via Fr. bibliothèque || 'library' (modern form)
|}

At the same time, there began explicit attempts to fashion a modern literary language as a compromise between Church Slavonic, the native vernacular, and the style of Western Europe.  The writers [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]], [[Gavrila Romanovich Derzhavin|Derzhavin]], and [[Nikolai Mikhailovich Karamzin|Karamzin]] made notable efforts in this respect, but, as per the received notion, the final synthesis belongs to [[Pushkin]] and his contemporaries in the first third of the 19th century.

During the 19th century, the standard language assumed its modern form; literature flourished. Spurred perhaps by the so-called [[Slavophilism]], some terms from other languages fashionable during the 18th century now passed out of use (for example, {{lang|ru|виктория}} {{IPA|[vʲɪˈktorʲɪjə]}} &gt; {{lang|ru|победа}} {{IPA|[pɐˈbʲɛdə]}}, 'victory'), and formerly vernacular or dialectal strata entered the literature as the "speech of the people". Borrowings of political, scientific and technical terminology continued.  By about 1900, [[commerce]] and [[fashion]] ensured the first wave of mass adoptions from German, French and English.

====Soviet period and beyond (20th century)====
The political upheavals of the early 20th century and the wholesale changes of political ideology gave written Russian its modern appearance after the [[Spelling reform#Russian|spelling reform of 1918]].  Reformed spelling, the new political terminology, and the abandonment of the effusive formulae of politeness characteristic of the pre-Revolutionary upper classes prompted dire statements from members of the émigré intelligentsia that Russian was becoming debased.  But the authoritarian nature of the regime, the system of schooling it provided from the 1930s, and not least the often unexpressed yearning among the literati for the former days ensured a fairly static maintenance of Russian into the 1980s. Though the language did evolve, it changed very gradually.  Indeed, while literacy became nearly universal, dialectal differentiation declined, especially in the vocabulary: schooling and mass communications ensured a common denominator.

The 1964 proposed reform was related to the [[Russian orthography|orthography]]. In that year the Orthographic commission of the Institute of the Russian language ([[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]), headed by [[Viktor Vinogradov]], apart from the withdrawal of some spelling exceptions, suggested:
* retaining one partitive [[soft sign]]
* always writing {{angbr|[[I (Cyrillic)|i]]}} {{angbr|[[Tse (Cyrillic)|ц]]}}
* writing {{angbr|[[O (Cyrillic)|o]]}} instead of {{angbr|[[Yo (Cyrillic)|ё]]}} after {{angbr|[[Zhe (Cyrillic)|ж]]}}, {{angbr|[[Che (Cyrillic)|ч]]}}, {{angbr|[[Sha (Cyrillic)|ш]]}}, {{angbr|[[щ]]}}, and {{angbr|ц}} if [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] or {{angbr|[[Ye (Cyrillic)|е]]}} if not
* not writing the soft sign after {{angbr|ж}}, {{angbr|ш}}, {{angbr|ч}}, and {{angbr|щ}}
* canceling the interchange in [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] -zar/-zor, -rast/-rost, -gar/-gor, -plav/-plov etc.; canceling the [[Digraph (orthography)#Double letters|double consonants]] in [[loan word]]s
* writing only -yensk(iy) instead of two [[suffix]]es -insk(iy) and -yensk(iy), write only -yets instead of -yets or -its
* simplifying the spelling of {{angbr|[[En (Cyrillic)|н]]}} (н-н) in [[participle]]s: write double {{angbr|н}} in prefixal participles and ordinary {{angbr|н}} in non-prefixal
* always writing with [[hyphen]] the "pol-" (half-) combinations with subsequent [[genitive]] of [[noun]] or [[ordinal number]]
* writing the nouns beginning with vice-, Unter-, ex- together
* writing all [[Grammatical particle|particles]] separately
* allowing the optional spelling of noun [[inflexion]]s

The reform, however, failed to take root.

Political circumstances and the undoubted accomplishments of the superpower in military, scientific, and technological matters (especially cosmonautics), gave Russian a worldwide if occasionally grudging prestige, most strongly felt during the middle third of the 20th century.

The political collapse of 1990–1991 loosened the shackles.  In the face of economic uncertainties and difficulties within the educational system, the language changed rapidly. There was a wave of adoptions, mostly from English, and sometimes for words with exact native equivalents.

|}

At the same time, the growing public presence of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and public debate about the history of the nation gave new impetus to the most archaic Church Slavonic stratum of the language, and introduced or re-introduced words and concepts that replicate the linguistic models of the earliest period.

Russian today is a tongue in great flux.  The new words entering the language and the emerging new styles of expression have, naturally, not been received with universal appreciation.

===Examples===
The following excerpts illustrate (very briefly) the development of the literary language.

&lt;small&gt;Spelling has been partly modernized.  The translations are as literal as possible, rather than literary.&lt;/small&gt;

====[[Primary Chronicle]]====
[[File:Povest vremennykh let text.png|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Graphic of the text (if your browser's font is missing some characters), click to enlarge]]

c. 1110, from the Laurentian Codex, 1377

: {{Script|Cyrs|Се повѣсти времѧньны&lt;sup&gt;х&lt;/sup&gt; лѣ&lt;sup&gt;т&lt;/sup&gt; ‧ ѿкꙋдꙋ єсть пошла рускаꙗ земѧ ‧ кто въ києвѣ нача первѣє кнѧжи&lt;sup&gt;т&lt;/sup&gt; ‧ и ѿкꙋдꙋ рꙋскаꙗ землѧ стала єсть}}.

: 'These [are] the tales of the bygone years, whence is come the Russian land, who first began to rule at Kiev, and whence the Russian land has come about.'

[[Old East Slavic]], the common ancestor of Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian.  Fall of the [[yer]]s in progress or arguably complete (several words end with a consonant; {{Script|Cyrs|кнѧжит}} 'to rule' &lt; {{Script|Cyrs|кънѧжити}}, modern {{lang|ru|княжить}}). South-western (incipient [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) features include {{Script|Cyrs|времѧньнъıх}} 'bygone'; modern Russian {{lang|ru|временных}}).  Correct use of [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[aorist]]: {{Script|Cyrs|єсть пошла}} 'is/has come' (modern Russian {{lang|ru|пошла}}), {{Script|Cyrs|нача}} 'began' (modern Russian {{lang|ru|начал}} as a development of the old perfect.)  Note the style of punctuation.

====[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]====
[[Image:slovo o polku igoreve text.PNG|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Graphic of the text (if your browser's font is missing some characters), click to enlarge]]

{{Script|Cyrs|Слово о пълку Игоревѣ}}. c. 1200(?), from the Catherine manuscript, c. 1790.

: {{Script|Cyrs|Не лѣпо ли ны бяшетъ братіе, начати старыми словесы трудныхъ повѣстій о полку Игоревѣ, Игоря Святъ славича? Начатижеся тъ пѣсни по былинамъ сего времени, а не по замышленію Бояню. Боянъ бо вѣщій, аще кому хотяше пѣснѣ творити, то растекашется мысію по древу, сѣрымъ волкомъ по земли, шизымъ орломъ подъ облакы.}}

: 'Would it not be meet, o brothers, for us to begin with the old words the difficult telling of the host of Igor, Igor Sviatoslavich?  And to begin in the way of the true tales of this time, and not in the way of Boyan's inventions.  For the wise Boyan, if he wished to devote to someone [his] song, would wander like a squirrel over a tree, like a grey wolf over land, like a bluish eagle beneath the clouds.'

Illustrates the sung [[Epic poetry|epics]].  Yers generally given full voicing, unlike in the first printed edition of 1800, which was copied from the same destroyed prototype as the Catherine manuscript. Typical use of metaphor and simile. The  misquote {{lang|ru|растекаться мыслью по древу}} ('to effuse/pour out one's thought upon/over wood'; a product of an old and habitual misreading of the word {{lang|orv|мысію}}, 'squirrel-like' as {{lang|orv|мыслію}}, 'thought-like', and a change in the meaning of the word {{lang|orv|течь}}) has become proverbial in the meaning 'to speak ornately, at length, excessively'.

====[[Avvakum]]'s autobiography====
1672–73.  Modernized spelling.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|ru|Таже послали меня в Сибирь с женою и детьми. И колико дорогою нужды бысть, того всего много говорить, разве малая часть помянуть. Протопопица младенца родила; больную в телеге и повезли до Тобольска; три тысящи верст недель с тринадцеть волокли телегами и водою и саньми половину пути.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''And then they sent me to Siberia with my wife and children.  Whatever hardship there was on the way, there's too much to say it all, but maybe a small part to be mentioned.  The archpriest's wife [= My wife] gave birth to a baby; and we carted her, sick, all the way to Tobolsk; for three thousand versts, around thirteen weeks in all, we dragged [her] by cart, and by water, and in a sleigh half of the way.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pure 17th-century central Russian vernacular.  Phonetic spelling ({{lang|ru|тово всево}} 'it all, all of that', modern {{lang|ru|того всего}}).  A few archaisms still used (aorist in the perfective aspect {{lang|ru|бысть}} 'was').  Note the way of transport to exile.

====[[Alexandr Pushkin]]====
From "Winter Evening" ({{lang|ru|Зимний вечер}}), 1825.  Modern spelling. {{Audio|Ru-Zimniy vecher.ogg|listen}}
&lt;div lang="ru"&gt;
: Буря мглою небо кроет,
: Вихри снежные крутя;
: То, как зверь, она завоет,
: То заплачет, как дитя,
: То по кровле обветшалой
: Вдруг соломой зашумит,
: То, как путник запоздалый,
: К нам в окошко застучит.
&lt;/div&gt;
: Tempest covers sky in haze[s],
: Twisting gales full of snow;
: Like a beast begins to howl,
: A cry, as if a child, it will let go,
: On the worn-out roof it will clamour
: Suddenly upon the thatch,
: Or as though a traveller tardy
: Starts to knock upon our hatch. (''lit.'', window)

Modern Russian is sometimes said to begin with Pushkin, in the sense that the old "high style" [[Church Slavonic]] and vernacular Russian are so closely fused that it is difficult to identify whether any given word or phrase stems from the one or the other.

====[[Dostoevsky|Fyodor Dostoevsky]]====
From ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' ({{lang|ru|Преступление и наказание}}), 1866.  Modern spelling.

: {{lang|ru|В начале июля, в чрезвычайно жаркое  время,  под  вечер,  один  молодой человек вышел из своей каморки, которую нанимал от жильцов в  С-м  переулке, на улицу и медленно, как бы в нерешимости, отправился к К-ну мосту.}}

: ''In early July, during a spell of extraordinary heat, towards evening, a young man went out from his garret, which he sublet in S—— Lane, [entered] the street, and slowly, as though in [the grip of] indecision, began to make his way to K—— Bridge.''

19th century prose.  No archaisms.  "European" syntax.

====Fundamental laws of the [[Russian Empire]]====
{{lang|ru|Основные законы Российской Империи}} (''Constitution of the Russian Empire''), 1906.  Modern spelling.

: {{lang|ru|Императору Всероссийскому принадлежит Верховная Самодержавная Власть. Повиноваться власти Его не только за страх, но и за совесть Сам Бог повелевает.}}

: "To the Emperor of all Russia belongs the Supreme Autocratic Power.  To obey His power, not merely in fear but also in conscience, God Himself does ordain."

Illustrates the categorical nature of thought and expression in the official circles of the Russian Empire.  Exemplifies the [[#Syntax|syntactic]] distribution of emphasis.

====[[Mikhail Bulgakov]]====
From ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' ({{lang|ru|Мастер и Маргарита}}), 1930–40

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|ru|Вы всегда были горячим проповедником той теории, что по отрезании головы жизнь в человеке прекращается, он превращается в золу и уходит в небытие. Мне приятно сообщить вам, в присутствии моих гостей, хотя они и служат доказательством совсем другой теории, о том, что ваша теория и солидна и остроумна. Впрочем, ведь все теории стоят одна другой. Есть среди них и такая, согласно которой каждому будет дано по его вере. Да сбудется же это!}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"You have always been a passionate proponent of the theory that upon decapitation human life comes to an end, the human being transforms into ashes, and passes into oblivion.  I am pleased to inform you, in the presence of my guests, though they serve as a proof for another theory altogether, that your theory is both well-grounded and ingenious.  Mind you, all theories are worth one another.  Among them is one, according to which every one shall receive in line with his faith. May that come to be!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An example of highly educated modern speech (this excerpt is spoken by [[Woland]]).  See [[Russian humor]] for the essential other end of the spectrum.

==Internal history==
The modern [[phonology|phonological]] system of Russian is inherited from [[Common Slavonic]] but underwent considerable innovation in the early historical period before it was largely settled by about 1400.

Like other [[Slavic languages]], [[Old Russian language|Old Russian]] was a language of ''open syllables''.{{sfn|Padgett|2003b|p=324}} All syllables ended in vowels and consonant clusters, with far less variety than today, existed only in the [[syllable onset]]. However, by the time of the earliest records, Old Russian already showed characteristic divergences from [[Common Slavonic]].

Despite the various sound changes, Russian is in many respects a relatively conservative language, and is important in reconstructing Proto-Slavic:
* Russian largely preserves the position of the Proto-Slavic accent, including the complex systems of alternating stress in nouns, verbs and short adjectives.
* Russian consistently preserves {{IPA|/j/}} between vowels, unlike all other modern Slavic languages.
* Russian preserves palatalized consonants better than all other East and West Slavic languages, making it important for the reconstruction of [[yer]]s.
* The Russian development of CerC, CorC, CĭrC, CŭrC and similar sequences is straightforward and in most cases easily reversible to yield the Proto-Slavic equivalent. Similarly the development of the strong yers is straightforward and preserves the front-back distinction. (But note that Russian shows early development of *CelC &gt; *ColC and *CĭlC &gt; *CŭlC, obscuring the front-back differences in these sequences.)

===Vowels===

====Loss of yers====
{{main|Yer}}
As with all other Slavic languages, the ultra-short vowels termed [[yer]]s were lost or transformed. From the documentary evidence of [[Old East Slavic]], this appears to have happened in the 12th century, about 200 years after its occurrence in [[Old Church Slavonic]]. The result was straightforward, with reflexes that preserve the front-back distinction between the yers in nearly all circumstances:
# Strong {{lang|sla|*ь}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}}, with palatalization of the preceding consonant
# Strong {{lang|sla|*ъ}} &gt; {{IPA|/o/}}, without palatalization of the preceding consonant
# Weak {{lang|sla|*ь}} is lost, with palatalization of the preceding consonant
# Weak {{lang|sla|*ъ}} is lost, without palatalization of the preceding consonant
See the article on [[yer]]s for the hypothesized pronunciation of these sounds and the meaning of the strong vs. weak distinction.

Examples:
* [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]] {{lang|orv|объ мьнѣ}} {{IPA|/obŭ mĭˈně/}} &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|обо мне}} {{IPA|[əbɐ ˈmnʲe]}} "about me"
* Old East Slavic {{lang|orv|сънъ}} {{IPA|/ˈsŭnŭ/}} &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|сон}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-сон.ogg|[son]|help=no}} "sleep (nom. sg.)", cognate with Lat. somnus
* Old East Slavic {{lang|orv|съна}} {{IPA|/sŭˈna/}} &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|сна}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-сна.ogg|[sna]|help=no}} "of sleep (gen. sg.)"

The loss of the yers caused the phonemicization of palatalized consonants and led to geminated consonants and a much greater variety of consonant clusters, with attendant voicing and/or devoicing in the assimilation:
* Old East Slavic {{lang|orv|къдѣ}} {{IPA|/kŭˈdě/}} &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|где}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-где.ogg|[ɡdʲe]|help=no}} ('where').

Unlike most other Slavic languages, so-called ''yer tensing'' (the special development of {{lang|sla|*ь}} &gt; {{lang|sla|*i}} and {{lang|sla|*ъ}} &gt; {{lang|sla|*y}} for some yers preceding {{IPA|/j/}}) did not happen in Russian, nor was {{IPA|/j/}} later lost. Yers preceding {{IPA|/j/}} developed as elsewhere; when dropped, a sequence ''Cʲj'' developed, which is preserved as such only in Russian. (*Cʲj &gt; ''CʲCʲ'' in Ukrainian and Belarusian; elsewhere, it generally merged with *Cʲ or *Cj, or the {{IPA|/j/}} was dropped early on.) The main exception to the lack of lack of yer tensing is in long adjectives, where nominative {{lang|sla|*-ъjь}} becomes expected {{lang|ru|-ой}} (''oj'') only when stressed, but yer-tensed {{lang|ru|-ый}} (''yj'') elsewhere, and nominative {{lang|sla|*-ьjь}} (which is never stressed) always becomes yer-tensed {{lang|ru|-ий}} (''ij'').

Some yers in weak position developed as if strong to avoid overly awkward consonant clusters:
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*stьblo}} "stem, stalk" &gt; {{lang|ru|стебло́}} (''stebló'') (cf. [[Old Czech]] ''{{lang|cs|stblo}}''&lt;!-- no article on Old Czech listing language code --&gt;, [[Czech language|Czech]] ''{{lang|cs|stéblo}}'' or (dialectal) ''{{lang|cs|zblo}}'', [[Old Polish]] ''{{lang|pl|śćbło}}'' or ''{{lang|pl|ściebło}}''&lt;!-- no language code in the article on Old Polish language --&gt;, [[Polish language|Polish]] ''{{lang|pl|źdźbło}}'', all meaning "stalk, straw")
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*pь̀strъjь}} "variegated" &gt; {{lang|ru|пёстрый}} (''pjóstryj'') (cf. [[Polish language|Polish]] ''{{lang|pl|pstry}}'', but [[Czech language|Czech]] ''{{lang|cs|pestrý}}'')
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*zvьněti}} "to ring, to clank" &gt; {{lang|ru|звене́ть}} (''zvenétʹ'') (cf. [[Old Czech]] ''{{lang|cs|zvnieti}}'', [[Czech language|Czech]] ''{{lang|cs|zníti}}'')

As shown, Czech and especially Polish are more tolerant of consonant clusters than Russian; but Russian is still more tolerant than [[Serbo-Croatian]] or [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*mьglà}} "mist, haze" &gt; {{lang|ru|мгла}} (''mgla'') (cf. [[Old Czech]] ''{{lang|cs|mgla}}'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''{{lang|pl|mgła}}'', but [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''{{lang|sh|màgla}}'', Bulgarian {{lang|bg|мъгла́}} (''măglá'') ).

====Loss of nasal vowels====
The nasal vowels (spelled in the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet with [[yus]]es), which had developed from Common Slavic {{lang|sla|*eN}} and {{lang|sla|*oN}} before a consonant, were replaced with nonnasalized vowels:
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*ǫ}} &gt; Russian u
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*ę}} &gt; Russian ja (i.e. {{IPA|/a/}} with palatalization or softening of the preceding consonant)

Examples:
* [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] {{PIE|*h₁sónti}} "they are" &gt; [[Proto-Slavic]] {{lang|sla|*sǫtь}} &gt; {{lang|ru|суть}} (''sutʹ'') {{Audio-IPA|Ru-суть.ogg|[sutʲ]}} (literary in modern Russian; cf. [[Old Church Slavonic]] {{wikt-lang|cu|бꙑти|сѫтъ}} (''sǫtĭ''), [[Polish language|Polish]] ''{{wikt-lang|pl|są}}'', [[Latin]] ''{{wikt-lang|la|sunt}}''){{sfn|Vinogradov||p=}}
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*rǫka}} "hand" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|рука́}} (''ruká'') (cf. Polish ''{{wikt-lang|pl|ręka}}'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''{{wikt-lang|lt|ranka}}'')
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*męso}} "meat" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|мя́со}} (''mjáso'') (cf. Polish ''{{wikt-lang|pl|mięso}}'', Old Church Slavonic {{wikt-lang|cu|мѧсо}} (''męso''), [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]] ''mensa'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{wikt-lang|got|𐌼𐌹𐌼𐍃}} (''mims''), [[Sanskrit]] {{wikt-lang|sa|मांस}} (''māṃsa''))
* PIE {{PIE|*pénkʷe}} "five" &gt;&gt; Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*pętь}} &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|пять}} (''pjátʹ'') (cf. Polish ''{{wikt-lang|pl|pięć}}'', Old Church Slavonic {{wikt-lang|cu|пѧть}} (''pętĭ''), Lithuanian ''{{wikt-lang|lt|penki}}'', [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|πέντε}} (''pénte''), Sanskrit {{wikt-lang|sa|पञ्चन्}} (''páñcan''))

In the case of Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*ę}} &gt; Russian ja, the palatalization of the preceding consonant was due to the general Russian palatalization before all front vowels, which occurred prior to the lowering of {{lang|sla|*ę}} to {{IPA|/a/}}. If the preceding consonant was already soft, no additional palatalization occurred, and the result is written {{angbr|а}} rather than {{angbr|я}} when following the palatal consonants {{lang|ru|ш ж ч щ ц}} (''š ž č šč c''):
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|načęti}} "to begin" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|нача́ть}} (''načatʹ'') (cf. Old Church Slavonic {{wikt-lang|cu|начѧти}} (''načęti''))
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|žę̀tva}} "harvest" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|жа́тва}} (''žátva'') (cf. Old Church Slavonic {{wikt-lang|cu|жѧтва}} (''žętva''))

Nearly all occurrences of Russian {{lang|ru|я}} (''ja'') following a consonant other than {{lang|ru|л}} (''l''), {{lang|ru|н}} (''n'') or {{lang|ru|р}} (''r'') are due to nasal vowels or are recent borrowings.

Borrowings in the [[Uralic languages]] with interpolated {{IPA|/n/}} after Common Slavonic nasal vowels{{examples needed|date=July 2017}} have been taken to indicate that the nasal vowels existed in East Slavic until some time possibly just before the historical period.

====Loss of prosodic distinctions====
In earlier Common Slavic, vowel length was allophonic, an automatic concomitant to vowel quality, with {{lang|sla|*e}} {{lang|sla|*o}} {{lang|sla|*ь}} {{lang|sla|*ъ}} short and all other vowels (including nasal vowels) long. By the end of the Common Slavic period, however, various sound changes (e.g. pre-tonic vowel shortening followed by [[Dybo's law]]) produced contrastive vowel length. This vowel length survives (to varying extents) in Czech, Slovak, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian and Old Polish, but was lost entirely early in the history of Russian, with almost no remnants. (A possible remnant is a distinction between two ''o''-like vowels, e.g. {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, in some Russian dialects, that may partly reflect earlier length distinctions.)

Proto-Slavic accentual distinctions (circumflex vs. acute vs. neoacute) were also lost early in the history of Russian. It has often been hypothesized that the accentual distinctions were first converted into length distinctions, as in [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]], followed by the loss of distinctive vowel length. Pretty much the only reflex of the accentual type is found in the stress pattern of pleophonic sequences like ''CereC, CoroC, ColoC'' (where C = any consonant); see [[#Pleophony and CVRC sequences|below]].

Notably, however, the position (as opposed to the type) of the accent was largely preserved in Russian as a [[stress (linguistics)|stress-type accent]] (whereas the Proto-Slavic accent was a [[pitch accent]]). The complex stress patterns of Russian nouns, verbs and short adjectives are a direct inheritance from Late Common Slavic, with relatively few changes.

====Pleophony and CVRC sequences====
''[[Pleophony]]'' or "full-voicing" ([[polnoglasie]], {{wikt-lang|ru|полногласие}} {{IPA|[pəlnɐˈɡlasʲɪje]}}) is the addition of vowels on either side of {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} in Proto-Slavic sequences like CorC where C = any consonant. The specific sound changes involved are as follows:

* *CerC &gt; CereC
* *CorC &gt; CoroC
* *CelC, *ColC &gt; ColoC
* *CьrC &gt; CerC
* *CъrC &gt; CorC
* *CьlC, *CъlC &gt; ColC

Examples:
* Proto-Slavic ''{{lang|sla|*bêrgъ}}'' "bank (of a river), shore" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|бе́рег}} (''béreg''); cf. Old Church Slavonic {{wikt-lang|cu|брѣгъ}} (''brěgŭ'')
* Proto-Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*bordà}} "beard" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|борода́}} (''borodá''); cf. Old Church Slavonic {{wikt-lang|cu|брада}} (''brada'')
* Proto-Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*melkò}} "milk" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|молоко́}} (''molokó''); cf. Old Church Slavonic {{wikt-lang|cu|млѣко}} (''mlěko'')
* Proto-Slavic ''{{lang|sla|*kôlsъ}}'' "ear (of corn), spike" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|ко́лос}} (''kólos''); cf. Old Church Slavonic {{wikt-lang|cu|класъ}} (''klasŭ'')

Note that Church Slavonic influence has made it less common in Russian than in modern Ukrainian and Belarusian:
* Ukrainian: {{lang|uk|Володи́мир}} {{IPA|/woloˈdɪmɪr/}}
* Russian: {{lang|ru|Влади́мир}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-Владимир.ogg|[vlɐˈdʲimʲɪr]|help=no}} ('Vladimir') (although a familiar form of the name in Russian is still {{lang|ru|Володя}} {{IPA|[vɐˈlodʲə]}}).

When a Proto-Slavic sequence like *CerC was accented, the position of the accent in the resulting pleophonic sequence depends on the type of accent (circumflex, acute or neoacute). This is one of the few places in Russian where different types of accents resulted in differing reflexes. In particular, a sequence like CéreC, with the stress on the first syllable, resulted from a Proto-Slavic circumflex accent, while a sequence like CeréC, with the stress on the second syllable, resulted from a Proto-Slavic acute or neoacute accent. Examples:

* Proto-Slavic ''{{lang|sla|*gôrdъ}}'' "town" (circumflex) &gt; {{lang|ru|го́род}} (''górod'')
* Proto-Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*pórgъ}} "doorsill" (acute) &gt; {{lang|ru|поро́г}} (''poróg'')
* Proto-Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*korljь|*kõrľь}} "king" (neoacute) &gt; {{lang|ru|коро́ль}} (''korólʹ'')

====Development of *i and *y====
Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*i}} and {{lang|sla|*y}} contrasted only after [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]s and [[labial consonant|labial]]s. After [[palatal consonant|palatal]]s only {{lang|sla|*i}} occurred, and after [[velar consonant|velar]]s only {{lang|sla|*y}} occurred. With the development of phonemic palatalized alveolars and labials in Old East Slavic, {{lang|sla|*i}} and {{lang|sla|*y}} no longer contrasted in any environment, and were reinterpreted as [[allophone]]s of each other, becoming a single phoneme {{IPA|/i/}}. Note that this reinterpretation entailed no change in the pronunciation and no mergers. Subsequently, (sometime between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries), the allophone of {{IPA|/i/}} before velar consonants changed from {{IPA|[ɨ]}} to {{IPA|[i]}} with subsequent palatalization of the velars.{{sfn|Padgett|2003a|p=39}} Hence, for example, Old Russian {{lang|orv|гыбкыи}} {{IPA|[gɨpkɨj]}} became modern {{lang|ru|гибкий}} {{IPA|[gʲipkʲij]}}. Conversely, the soft consonants {{lang|sla|*ž}} {{lang|sla|*š}} {{lang|sla|*c}} were hardened, causing the allophone of {{IPA|/i/}} to change from {{IPA|[i]}} to {{IPA|[ɨ]}}.

====The yat vowel====
{{main|Yat#Russian}}
Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*ě}} (from Balto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European long *ē) developed into Old Russian {{lang|orv|ѣ}}, distinct from {{lang|orv|е}} (the outcome of Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*e}} from Balto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European short *e). They apparently remained distinct until the 18th century, although the timeline of the merger has been [[Yat|debated]]. The sound denoted {{angbr|{{lang|orv|ѣ}}}} may have been a higher sound than {{angbr|{{lang|orv|е}}}}, possibly high-mid {{IPA|/e/}} vs. low-mid {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. They still remain distinct in some Russian dialects, as well as in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], where Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*e}} {{lang|sla|*ě}} {{lang|sla|*i}} developed into {{IPA|/e i ɪ/}} respectively. The letter {{lang|orv|ѣ}} remained in use until 1918; its removal caused by far the greatest of all Russian [[Reforms of Russian orthography#Yat-reform|spelling controversies]].

====The yo vowel====
Proto-Slavic stressed {{lang|sla|*e}} developed into {{IPA|/o/}}, spelled {{lang|ru|ё}}, when following a soft consonant and preceding a hard one.{{sfn|Crosswhite|2000|p=167}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Padgett|2003b}} attributes this change to the velarization of the hard consonant.&lt;/ref&gt; The shift happened after {{lang|ru|ш ж}}, which were still soft consonants at the time. The preceding consonant remained soft.
* OR {{lang|orv|о чемъ}} {{IPA|/o ˈt͡ʃemŭ/}} ('about which' loc. sg.) &amp;gt; R {{lang|ru|о чём}} {{IPA|[ɐ ˈt͡ɕɵm]}}

This sound change also occurred in Belarusian, but not in Ukrainian, as seen in the word for "flax": Belarusian and Russian {{wikt-lang|ru|лён}} {{IPA|/ˈlʲon/}} but Ukrainian {{wikt-lang|uk|лен}} {{IPA|/ˈlʲen/}}.

That has led to a number of alternations:{{sfn|Lightner|1972|pp=20–23}}

This development occurred prior to the merger of ѣ ([[yat]]) with е, and ѣ did not undergo this change, except by later analogy in a short list of words as of about a century ago. Nowadays, the change has been reverted in two of those exceptional words.
* {{lang|ru|вдёжка}} 'threading needle, bodkin'

Loanwords from [[Church Slavonic]] reintroduced {{IPA|/e/}} between a (historically) soft consonant and a hard one, creating a few new minimal pairs:{{sfn|Lightner|1972|pp=75–76, 84}}

|}

Russian spelling does not normally distinguish stressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} following a soft consonant (and in some cases also following the unpaired consonants {{lang|ru|ж ш ц}}), writing both as {{lang|ru|е}}. However, dictionaries notate {{lang|ru|е}} as {{lang|ru|ё}} when pronounced as {{IPA|/o/}}.

====Vowel reduction====
Modern Russian has extensive reduction of unstressed vowels, with the following mergers:

* original unstressed {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} following a hard consonant are merged as {{IPA|/a/}} (pronounced {{IPA|[ɐ]}} or {{IPA|[ə]}}, depending on position)
* original unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} following a hard consonant are merged as {{IPA|/i/}}, or as {{IPA|/ɨ/}} if {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is considered a phoneme (pronounced {{IPA|[ɨ]}})
* original unstressed {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} following a soft consonant are merged as {{IPA|/i/}} (all are pronounced {{IPA|[ɪ]}})

The underlying vowel resurfaces when stressed in related forms or words, cf. {{lang|ru|балда́}} (''baldá'') {{IPA|[bɐlˈda]}} "sledgehammer", with genitive plural {{lang|ru|балд}} (''bald'') {{IPA|[balt]}}, vs. {{lang|ru|корма́}} (''kormá'') {{IPA|[kɐrˈma]}}, with genitive plural {{lang|ru|корм}} (''korm'') {{IPA|[korm]}}. The spelling consistently reflects the underlying vowel, even in cases where the vowel never surfaces as stressed in any words or forms (e.g. the first syllables of {{lang|ru|хорошо́}} (''xorošó'') "well (adverb)" and {{lang|ru|сапожо́к}} (''sapožók'') "boot") and hence the spelling is purely etymological. See [[Vowel reduction in Russian]] for more details.

There are exceptions to the rule given above: for example, {{wikt-lang|ru|ви́део}} "video" is pronounced as {{IPA|[ˈvʲidʲɪo]}} rather than {{IPA|[ˈvʲidʲɪə]}}.

===Consonants===

====Consonant cluster simplification====
Simplification of Common Slavic {{lang|sla|*dl}} and {{lang|sla|*tl}} to {{lang|sla|*l}}:{{sfn|Schenker|2002|p=74}}
* Common Slavonic {{lang|sla|*mydlo}}  "soap" &gt; Russian: {{lang|ru|мы́ло}} (''mylo'') {{Audio-IPA|Ru-мыло.ogg|[ˈmɨlə]}} (cf.[[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|mydło}})

Consonant clusters created by the loss of yers were sometimes simplified, but are still preserved in spelling:
* {{lang|ru|здра́вствуйте}} (''zdravstvujte'') {{Audio-IPA|zdravstvuyte.ogg|[ˈzdrastvʊjtʲe]}} "hello" (first ''v'' rarely pronounced; such a pronunciation might indicate that the speaker intends to give the word its archaic meaning "be healthy")
* {{lang|ru|се́рдце}} (''sérdce'') {{IPA|[ˈsʲert͡sə]}} "heart" (''d'' not pronounced; but not genitive plural {{lang|ru|серде́ц}} (''sérdec'') {{IPA|[sʲɪrˈdʲet͡s]}})
* {{lang|ru|со́лнце}} (''solnce'') {{IPA|[ˈsont͡sə]}} "sun" (''l'' not pronounced; but note adjectival {{lang|ru|со́лнечный}} (''sólnečnyj'') "solar", diminutive {{lang|ru|со́лнышко}} (''sólnyško'') "small sun, sweetheart", in both of which words the ''l'' is pronounced)

====Development of palatalized consonants====
Around the tenth century, Russian may have already had paired coronal fricatives and [[sonorant]]s so that {{IPA|/s z n l r/}} could have contrasted with {{IPA|/sʲ zʲ nʲ lʲ rʲ/}}, but any possible contrasts were limited to specific environments.{{sfn|Padgett|2003b|p=324}} Otherwise, palatalized consonants appeared allophonically before front vowels.{{sfn|Padgett|2003b|p=325}} When the [[Havlík's law|yers were lost]], the palatalization initially triggered by high vowels remained,{{sfn|Padgett|2003b|p=307}} creating minimal pairs like {{lang|ru|данъ}} {{IPA|/dan/}} ('given') and {{lang|ru|дань}} {{IPA|/danʲ/}} ('tribute'). At the same time, {{IPA|[ɨ]}}, which was already a part of the vocalic system, was reanalyzed as an allophone of {{IPA|/i/}} after hard consonants, prompting leveling that caused vowels to alternate according to the preceding consonant rather than vice versa.{{sfn|Padgett|2003b|p=330}}

Sometime between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, the velars became allophonically palatalized before {{IPA|/i/}}, which caused its pronunciation to change from {{IPA|[ɨ]}} to {{IPA|[i]}}.{{sfn|Padgett|2003a|p=39}} This is reflected in spelling, which writes e.g. {{wikt-lang|ru|ги́бкий}} (''gíbkij'') rather than {{lang|ru|*гы́бкый}} (''gybkyj'').

====Depalatalization====
The palatalized unpaired consonants {{lang|sla|*š *ž *c}} depalatalized at some point, with {{lang|sla|*š *ž}} becoming [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPA|[ʂ]}} and {{IPA|[ʐ]}}. This did not happen, however, to {{lang|sla|*č}}, which remains to this day as palatalized {{IPA|/t͡ɕ/}}. Similarly {{lang|sla|*šč}} did not depalatalize, becoming {{IPA|/ɕː/}} (formerly and still occasionally {{IPA|/ɕt͡ɕ/}}). The depalatalization of {{lang|sla|*š *ž *c}} is largely not reflected in spelling, which still writes e.g. {{wikt-lang|ru|шить}} (''šitʹ''), rather than {{lang|ru|*шыть}} (''šytʹ''), despite the pronunciation {{IPA|[ʂɨtʲ]}}.

Paired palatalized consonants other than {{IPA|/lʲ/}} and sometimes {{IPA|/nʲ/}} and {{IPA|/rʲ/}} eventually lost their palatalization when followed by another consonant. This is generally reflected in spelling. Examples:
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*lьnǫti}} "to stick" &gt; Russian {{wikt-lang|ru|льнуть}} (''lʹnutʹ'')
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*sъ̑lnьce}} "sun" &gt; Russian {{wikt-lang|ru|со́лнце}} (''sólnce'')
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*arьmò}} "ox-yoke" &gt; Russian {{wikt-lang|ru|ярмо́}} (''jarmó''); but Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*gorьkъjь}} "bitter" &gt; Russian {{lang|ru|го́рький}} (''gorʹkij'')
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*drevьnьjь}} "ancient" &gt; Russian {{wikt-lang|ru|дре́вний}} (''drévnij'')
* Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*brusьnica}} "cowberry" &gt;&gt; Russian {{lang|ru|брусни́ка}} (''brusníka'')

====Incomplete early palatalizations====
There is a tendency to maintain intermediate ancient {{IPA|[-ɡ-]}}, {{IPA|[-k-]}}, etc. before frontal vowels, in contrast to other Slavic languages. This is the so-called ''incomplete second and third palatalizations'':
* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] {{lang|uk|нозі́}} {{IPA|/noˈzʲi/}}
* Russian: {{wikt-lang|ru|ноге́}} {{IPA|[nɐˈɡʲe]}} ('leg' [[dative case|dat.]])
It is debated whether these palatalizations never occurred in these cases or were due to later analogical developments. A relevant data point in this respect is the [[Old Novgorod dialect]], where the [[Slavic second palatalization|second palatalization]] is not reflected in spelling and may never have happened.

====Development of palatal consonants====
The Proto-Slavic palatal series of consonants (not to be confused with the later palatalized consonants that developed in Russian) developed as follows:
* The palatal resonants {{lang|sla|*ľ *ň *ř}} merged with the new palatalized consonants *lʲ *nʲ *rʲ that developed before Proto-Slavic front vowels.
* The palatal plosives {{lang|sla|*ť *ď}} merged with {{lang|sla|*č *ž}}. Note, however, that Proto-Slavic {{lang|sla|*ť *ď}} appear as {{angbr|щ}} {{angbr|жд}} (commonly notated ''šč žd'' and pronounced {{IPA|[ɕː ʐd]}} respectively, although {{angbr|щ}} was formerly pronounced {{IPA|[ɕt͡ɕ]}}, as its transcription suggests) in words borrowed from [[Old Church Slavonic]].
* The palatal clusters {{lang|sla|*šč *ždž}} developed into sounds denoted respectively {{angbr|щ}} and either {{angbr|жж}} or {{angbr|зж}} (nowadays normatively pronounced {{IPA|[ɕː ʑː]}}, although there is a strong tendency to instead pronounce {{angbr|жж}} and {{angbr|зж}} as hard {{IPA|[ʐː]}}).
* The palatal fricatives {{lang|sla|*š *ž}} hardened into [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPA|[ʂ ʐ]}} (although the affricate {{lang|sla|*č}} remained as soft {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}}).

====Degemination====
Many double consonants have become degeminated but are still written with two letters.

(In a 1968 study, long {{IPA|[tː]}} remains long in only half of the words in which it appears written, but long {{IPA|[fː]}} did so only a sixth of the time. The study, however, did not distinguish spelling from actual historical pronunciation, since it included loanwords in which consonants were written doubled but never pronounced long in Russian.){{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=71}}

===Effect of loanwords===
A number of the phonological features of Russian are attributable to the introduction of loanwords (especially from non-Slavic languages), including:
* Sequences of two vowels within a morpheme.{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=66}} Only a handful of such words, like {{lang|ru|паук}} 'spider' and {{lang|ru|оплеуха}} 'slap in the face' are native.
**{{lang|ru|поэт}} {{IPA|[pɐˈɛt]}} 'poet'.  From [[French language|French]] ''poète''.
**{{lang|ru|траур}} {{IPA|[ˈtraur]}} 'mourning'. From [[German language|German]] ''Trauer''.
*Word-initial {{IPA|/e/}}, except for the root эт-.{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=66}}
**{{lang|ru|эра}} {{IPA|[ˈɛrə]}} 'era'.  From German ''Ära''
*Word-initial {{IPA|/a/}}.{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=66}} (Proto-Slavic *a- &gt; Russian ''ja-'')
**{{lang|ru|авеню}} {{IPA|[ɐvʲɪˈnʲu]}} 'avenue. From French ''avenue''.
**{{lang|ru|афера}} {{IPA|[ɐˈfʲerə]}} 'swindle'. From French ''affaire''.
**{{lang|ru|агнец}} {{IPA|[ˈaɡnʲɪts]}} 'lamb'. From [[Church Slavonic]]
*The phoneme {{IPA|/f/}} (see [[Ef (Cyrillic)]] for more information).{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=66}}{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=66}}
**{{lang|ru|фонема}} {{IPA|[fɐˈnɛmə]}} 'phoneme'.  From [[Greek language|Greek]] φώνημα.
**{{lang|ru|эфир}} {{IPA|[eˈfʲir]}} '[[ether]]'. From Greek αἰθήρ.
**{{lang|ru|фиаско}} {{IPA|[fʲɪˈaskə]}} 'fiasco'. From [[Italian language|Italian]] ''fiasco''. &lt;!-- Not sure if this is directly from Italian --&gt;
*The occurrence of non-palatalized consonants before {{IPA|/e/}} within roots.{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=66}} (The initial {{IPA|/e/}} of a suffix or flexion invariably triggers palatalization of an immediately preceding consonant, as in {{lang|ru|брат}} / {{lang|ru|братец}} / {{lang|ru|о брате}}.){{sfn|Padgett|2003b|p=}}
*The sequence {{IPA|/dʐ/}} within a morpheme.{{sfn|Lightner|1972|pp=67, 82}}
** {{lang|ru|джин}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-джин.ogg|[dʐɨn]}}) 'gin' from [[English language|English]].
** {{lang|ru|джаз}} {{IPA|[dʐas]}} 'jazz' from English.

===Morphology and syntax===
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}

Some of the morphological characteristics of Russian are:
* Loss of the [[vocative case]]
* Loss of the [[aorist]] and [[imperfect]] tenses (still preserved in Old Russian)
* Loss of the short adjective declensions except in the nominative
* Preservation of all Proto-Slavic participles

'''''I Know What You Did Last Summer''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[film series]], based on the [[I Know What You Did Last Summer (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Lois Duncan]]. The series consists of three films.

==Released films==
===''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' (1997)===
{{main|I Know What You Did Last Summer}}
After an accident on a winding road, four teens make the fatal mistake of dumping their victim's body into the sea. But exactly one year later, the dead man returns from his watery grave and he's looking for more than an apology.

===''I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' (1998)===
{{main|I Still Know What You Did Last Summer}}
The murderous fisherman with a hook is back to once again stalk the two surviving teens, Julie James and Ray Bronson who left him for dead, as well as cause even more murder and mayhem, this time at a posh island resort.

===''I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer'' (2006)===
{{main|I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer}}
A group of teenagers in Colorado find themselves being stalked and killed one by one by a mysterious figure with a hook, exactly one year after they covered up a friend's accidental death.

==Upcoming films==
===Reboot===
On September 14, 2014, Sony reported that they have plans to remake the film; Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard are writing a script. In a June 1, 2016, Blumhouse.com "Shockwaves" podcast, writer Mike Flanagan revealed and further confirmed this new iteration and reimagination of the franchise would not have any inventions of the Lois Duncan novel (the antagonist being a central character) nor the 1997 feature (the fisherman Ben Willis and four primary protagonists Julie James, Helen Shivers, Barry Cox, and Ray Bronson). Further, the new direction and scope of the film necessitates an estimated budget of $15–20 million. Sony also states that the film is a high priority and is set for a release somewhere until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/09/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-remake-horror-movie-sony-834570/|title=‘I Know What You Did Last Summer’ In Season Again At Sony|first=Anita|last=Busch|date=15 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ideological criticism''' is a method in [[rhetorical criticism]] concerned with critiquing texts for the dominant ideology they express while silencing opposing or contrary [[ideologies]]. It was started by a group of scholars roughly in the late-1970s through the mid-1980s at universities in the United States. Leading scholars of ideological criticism were Michael Calvin McGee at the University of Iowa and Phillip Wander at San Jose State University. Wander's 1983 article, "The Ideological Turn in Modern Criticism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=March 1983|title=The ideological turn in modern criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978309368110?journalCode=rcst19|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/10510978309368110|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1984 article, "The Third Persona: An Ideological Turn in Rhetorical Theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=December 1984|title=The third persona: An ideological turn in rhetorical theory|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978409368190|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=197–216|doi=10.1080/10510978409368190|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain two of the most important articles in the field. According to Sonja Foss, “the primary goal of the ideological critic is to discover and make visible the dominant ideology or ideologies embedded in an artifact and the ideologies that are being muted in it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice (3rd ed.)|last=Foss|first=|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss has also mentioned the contribution to ideological criticism of several theoretical schools, including [[Marxism]], [[structuralism]], [[cultural studies]], and [[postmodernism]].

==Ideograph==
A unit of analysis in ideological criticism, or what Foss calls "traces of ideology in an artifact," is the [[ideograph (rhetoric)|ideograph]].  It is a symbol representing an ideological concept and is more than what the symbol itself depicts.  Michael McGee, a renowned ideological critic, postulated that an “ideograph is an ordinary term found in political discourse” that “is a high-order abstraction representing collective commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=462–463}}  Thus, McGee restricted ideographs to [[words]], words that “constitute a vocabulary of public motives, which authorize and warrant public actions”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|p=479}}  McGee encourages the study of ideographs (such as “[[liberty]]” and “[[Political freedom|freedom]]”) to help identify the ideological position of a [[society]].  He argues such terms are used in [[discourse]] as a means of justifying problematic issues within a society.  The meaning of an ideograph is defined by a society and its [[culture]] and can change over time.  Ideographs need not be only positive in nature, but can be negative as well.  For example, [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[slavery]], can “guide behavior and belief negatively by branding unacceptable behavior."  McGee notes that to fully understand ideographs, they must be examined both “[[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]” as well as “[[Synchronic analysis|synchronically]].”  That is, ideographs need to be examined across time to determine how their meanings may have changed and all ideographs that are used in a given situation must be considered.

Who in [[democracy]] would be opposed to actions taken under the auspices of liberty and freedom?  To do so would, ideographically speaking, be undemocratic. Citizens of a democratic state are “conditioned” to believe that liberty and freedom are so fundamentally important that society expects those citizens to simply unquestioningly accept actions claiming to be in defense of liberty and freedom.  For example, even within the United States, the ideograph of freedom has changed.  At the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] (1775–1783), freedom meant breaking away from the tyrannical rule of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].  Today, freedom means many things including the freedom to pursue one's dreams and the freedom to be left alone.  People disagree about the freedoms that are most important: freedom to possess guns, freedom to make decisions that affect one's body, freedom from fear or violence, and freedom of movement.  Depending on one's ideological orientation, the ideograph of freedom represents many things, which is why it can be so powerfully used by politicians.  Ideographs succeed in political discourse because of their inability to be concretely understood.  

Ideographs need not be [[Linguistics|verbal]] only; they can be [[Visual communication|visual]] too.  In 1997, Janis Edwards and Carol Winkler expanded the idea of the ideograph to include visual images as well as written words.{{Sfn|Edwards and Winkler 1997|pp=289–310}}  They argue images can act as “a Visual reference point that forms the basis of arguments about a variety of themes and subjects” that are used by both “[[elite]]s and non-elites” alike.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=487–508}}  Like McGee’s textual ideographs, visual ideographs depict common values and goals in a given culture, recur in different contexts over time, and are used to validate arguments and [[Social practice theory|social practice]]s.  Edwards and Winkler mention images of people can act as ideographs too.  “In their construct, a person (character) is abstracted and elevated to the status of a cultural figure, and becomes a surface for the articulation of the political character, employing cultural ideals”.  Foss identifies the following steps in a piece of ideological criticism: 1) “formulate a [[research question]] and select an [[Social artifact|artifact]]”; 2) “select a [[unit of analysis]]” (which she calls “traces of ideology in an artifact”); 3) “analyze the artifact” (which, according to Foss, involves identifying the ideology in the artifact, analyzing the interests the ideology serves, and uncovering the strategies used in the artifact to promote the ideology); and 4) “write the critical essay”.

==Second mint==
The second Calcutta Mint was established with the modern machinery brought in 1790 from England. It was located at the site of Gillet Ship building Establishment, which had been taken over by the Stamp and Stationary Committee in 1833. The coins issued from this mint continued to bear mint name Murshidabad.

==Third mint==
[[File:Silver Mint House - 60 Strand Road - Kolkata 2016-10-11 0637.JPG|thumb|The Old Silver Mint house, 60 Strand road, Kolkata. Now it is occupied by the [[CRPF]].]]
In March 1824, the foundation of the third Calcutta Mint was laid on Strand Road and was opened for production from 1 August 1829. Until 1835 the coins issued at this mint continued to be in the name of the Murshidabad Mint. The imposing frontage of the building of the third Mint was based on a design of the [[Temple of Athena]] in [[Athens]], Greece, usually known as the [[Parthenon]]. The operative blocks were hidden out of view by the magnificent frontage.

This mint was named as "Old Silver Mint".&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET_Cetera/Kolkatas_Old_Silver_Mint_to_get_renovated/articleshow/3244324.cms |title=Kolkata's landmark Old Silver Mint to be re-incarnated |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=15 September 2008 |publisher=Economic Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802223916/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET_Cetera/Kolkatas_Old_Silver_Mint_to_get_renovated/articleshow/3244324.cms |archivedate=2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for this mint was laid March 1824, and production began 1 August 1829.&lt;ref name="ET" /&gt;

The coinage production capacity then was varying between {{formatnum:300000}} and {{formatnum:600000}} pieces per day. In 1860 an annexe known as the "Copper Mint" was built to the north of the Silver Mint for the exclusive production of copper coins.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The silver and copper mints both used to function and produce coins of [[bronze]], silver and gold. Both these mints were well equipped with the coining presses supplied by Boulton and Watt of Soho, Birmingham, England.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Apart from minting of coins another important function of the Kolkata Mint was the manufacturing of medals and decorations during the British regime. The production of medals continues to this day.

After the closure of this mint in 1952 the building fell into disrepair, after years of neglect. The [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation]] declared this building a heritage building. A proposal to restore this building and convert its vast spaces into a museum was put up,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Alipore Mint==
In the late 1930s foundation work for a new mint was completed at [[New Alipore]] and construction was to have completed by early 1942. However [[World War II]] brought all construction to a halt. It was completed in early 1950s.&lt;ref name="Hindu"&gt;{{cite news

The Alipore Mint was opened by Finance Minister of Government of India Shree [[C. D. Deshmukh]] on 19 March 1952.&lt;ref name="Hindu" /&gt; The full operation for the coinage and preparation of medals, decorations and badges started in Alipore Mint from this date. In addition to production of coins for domestic use also produces coins for other nations.

A '''knockout rat''' is a [[genetically modified organism|genetically engineered]] [[rat]] with a single [[gene]] turned off through a targeted mutation ([[gene trapping]]) used for academic and pharmaceutical [[animal testing|research]].  Knockout rats can mimic human diseases and are important tools for studying gene function ([[functional genomics]]) and for [[drug discovery]] and development. The production of knockout rats was not economically or technically feasible until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott A: Laboratory animals: the Renaissance rat. Nature 2004, 428:464-466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Q, Renard JP, Le Friec G, Brochard V, Beaujean N, Cherifi Y, Fraichard A, Cozzi J: Generation of fertile cloned rats by regulating oocyte activation.

Nat Methods 2007, 4:131-133.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Technology developed through funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and work accomplished by the members of the Knock Out Rat Consortium (KORC) led to cost-effective methods to create knockout rats. The importance of developing the rat as a more versatile tool for human health research is evidenced by the $120 million investment made by the NIH via the Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium, resulting in the draft sequence of a laboratory strain of the [[Brown rat|brown or Norway rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus'').&lt;ref name="rat genome"&gt;Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium, Genome sequence of the brown rat yields insights into mammalian evolution. Nature, 2004. 428(6982): p. 493-521.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional developments with [[zinc finger nuclease]] technology in 2009 led to the first knockout rat with targeted, germline-transmitted mutations.&lt;ref name="guerts_am"&gt;Guerts, A.M., et. al, Knockout Rats via Embryo Microinjection of Zinc-Finger Nucleases.

==Research use==
Mice, rats, and humans share all but approximately 1% of each other's genes&lt;ref name="rat genome"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome. Nature, 2001. 409(6822): p. 860-921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium, Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome. Nature, 2002. 420(6915): p. 520-62.&lt;/ref&gt; making rodents good model organisms for studying human gene function.  Both mice and rats are relatively small, easily handled, have a short generation time, and are genetically inbred.  While mice have proven to be a useful rodent model and techniques have been developed for routine disruption of their genes, in many circumstances rats are considered a superior laboratory animal for studying and modeling human disease. 
 
Rats are physiologically more similar to humans than are mice. For example, rats have a heart rate more similar to that of humans, while mice have a heart rate five to ten times as fast. It is widely believed that the rat is a better model than the mouse for human [[cardiovascular disease]], diabetes, [[arthritis]], and many [[autoimmune]], [[neurological]], behavioral, and addiction disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, A., Laboratory animals: the Renaissance rat. Nature, 2004. 428(6982): p. 464-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rat models are superior to mouse models for testing the [[pharmacodynamics]] and toxicity of potential therapeutic compounds, partially because the number and type of many of their detoxifying enzymes are very similar to those in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lindblad-Toh, K., Genome sequencing: three's company. Nature, 2004. 428(6982): p. 475-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Their larger size makes rats more conducive to study by instrumentation, and also facilitates manipulation such as blood sampling, nerve conduction, and performing surgeries. 

Techniques for genetic manipulation are available in the mouse, which is commonly used to model human disease.  Although published knockouts exist for approximately 60%&lt;ref&gt;Zambrowicz, 1998; Skarnes et
al., 2004; To et al., 2004; Nord et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of mouse genes, a large majority of common human diseases do not have a [[knockout mouse]] model. Knockout rat models are an alternative to mice that may enable the creation of new gene disruptions that are unavailable in the mouse. Knockout rat models can also complement existing transgenic mouse models. Comparing mouse and rat mutants can facilitate the distinction between rodent-specific and general [[mammalian]] [[phenotypes]].

==Production challenges==
Rat models have been used to advance many areas of medical research, including cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders (studies of behavioral intervention and addiction), [[neural regeneration]], diabetes, [[Organ transplant|transplant]]ation, autoimmune disorders ([[rheumatoid arthritis]]), [[cancer]], and wound &amp; bone healing. While the completion of the rat [[genome]] sequence provides very key information, how these diseases relate to gene function requires an efficient method to create knockout rat models in which specific genomic sequences are manipulated.
Most techniques for genetic manipulation, including random mutagenesis with a [[gene trap]] (retroviral-based and non-retroviral-based), gene knock-outs/knock-ins, and conditional mutations, depend upon the culture and manipulation of embryonic stem (ES) cells.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Tannoudji, M. and C. Babinet, Beyond 'knock-out' mice: new perspectives for the programmed modification of the mammalian genome. Molecular Human Reproduction, 1998. 4(10): p. 929-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Rat ES cells were only recently isolated and no demonstration of gene modification in them has been reported. Consequently, many genetic manipulation techniques widely used in the mouse are not possible in the rat.

==Early methods==
Until the commercial development of mobile [[DNA]] technology in 2007 and zinc-finger nuclease technology in 2009, there were only two technologies that could be used to produce rat models of human disease: [[cloning]] and chemical mutagenesis using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ([[ENU]]). Although cloning by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] (SCNT) could theoretically be used to create rats with specific mutations by mutating somatic cells, and then using these cells for SCNT, this approach has not been used successfully to create knockout rats. One problem with this strategy is that SCNT is extremely inefficient. The first published attempt had a success rate of less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, Q., J.P. Renard, G. Le Friec, V. Brochard, N. Beaujean, Y. Cherifi, A. Fraichard, and J. Cozzi, Generation of fertile cloned rats by regulating oocyte activation. Science, 2003. 302(5648): p. 1179.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, ENU mutagenesis is a common random mutagenesis gene knockout strategy in the mouse that can also be used in the rat. ENU mutagenesis involves using a chemical, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), to create single base changes in the genome. ENU transfers its ethyl group to oxygen or nitrogen radicals in DNA, resulting in mis-pairing and base pair substitution. Mutant animals can be produced by injecting a male mouse with ENU, and breeding with a wild type female to produce mutant offspring. ENU mutagenesis creates a high frequency of random mutations, with approximately one base pair change in any given gene in every 200-700 [[Gamete|gametes.]]&lt;ref&gt;Hitotsumachi, S., D.A. Carpenter, and W.L. Russell, Dose-repetition increases the mutagenic effectiveness of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in mouse spermatogonia. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 1985. 82(19): p. 6619-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its high mutagenicity, the physical penetration of ENU is limited and only about 500 genes are mutated for each male and a very small number of the total mutations have an observable phenotype. Thousands of mutations typically need to be created in a single animal in order to generate one novel phenotype.  

Despite recent improvements in ENU technology,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S.D. and R.E. Hardisty, Mutagenesis strategies for identifying novel loci associated with disease phenotypes. Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology, 2003. 14(1): p. 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated314"&gt;Chen, Y., D. Yee, K. Dains, A. Chatterjee, J. Cavalcoli, E. Schneider, J. Om, R.P. Woychik, and T. Magnuson, Genotype-based screen for ENU-induced mutations in mouse embryonic stem cells. Nature Genetics, 2000. 24(3): p. 314-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated314"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zan, Y., J.D. Haag, K.S. Chen, L.A. Shepel, D. Wigington, Y.R. Wang, R. Hu, C.C. Lopez-Guajardo, H.L. Brose, K.I. Porter, R.A. Leonard, A.A. Hitt, S.L. Schommer, A.F. Elegbede, and M.N. Gould, Production of knockout rats using ENU mutagenesis and a yeast-based screening assay. Nature Biotechnology, 2003. 21(6): p. 645-51.&lt;/ref&gt; mapping mutations responsible for a particular phenotype is typically difficult and time-consuming. Neutral mutations must be separated from causative mutations, via extensive breeding.  ENU and cloning methods are simply inefficient for creating and mapping gene knockouts in rats for the creation of new models of human disease.  Through 2007, the largest rat ENU mutagenesis project to date run by the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]] was able to produce only 9 knockout rat lines in a period of five years at an average cost of $200,000 per knockout line. Although some companies are still pursuing this strategy, the Medical College of Wisconsin has switched to a more efficient and commercially viable method using mobile DNA and CompoZr ZFN technology.

==Zinc-finger and TALE nuclease technology==
Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and [[Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease]]s (TALENs) are engineered DNA-binding proteins that facilitate targeted editing of the genome by creating double-strand breaks in DNA at user-specified locations. Double strand breaks are important for site-specific mutagenesis in that they stimulate the cell’s natural DNA-repair processes, namely homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining.  When the cell uses the non-homologous end joining pathway to repair the double-strand break, the inherent inaccuracy of the repair often generates precisely targeted mutations. This results in embryos with targeted gene knockout.&lt;ref name="guerts_am"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tesson et al., Knockout rats generated by embryo microinjection of TALENs. Nature Biotechnology Vol 29:695-96 (5 August 2011) {{Cite journal | last1 = Tesson | first1 = L. | last2 = Usal | first2 = C. | last3 = Ménoret | first3 = S. V. | last4 = Leung | first4 = E. | last5 = Niles | first5 = B. J. | last6 = Remy | first6 = S. V. | last7 = Santiago | first7 = Y. | last8 = Vincent | first8 = A.

A major advantage of ZFN- and TALEN-mediated gene knockout relative to the use of mobile DNA is that a particular gene can be uniquely and specifically targeted for knockout. In contrast, knockouts made using mobile DNA technology are random and are therefore unlikely to target the gene of interest.

==Mobile DNA technology==
Mobile DNA (jumping gene) technology uses [[retrotransposons]] and [[transposons]] for the production of knockout rat models. This platform technology meets all of the criteria for a successful gene knockout approach in mammals by permitting random mutagenesis directly in the [[germ cells]] ([[sperm]] and [[oocytes]]) of mammalian model organisms, including rats. Using this technology, genes are disrupted completely and in a stable manner, are knocked out at a high frequency, and are randomly disrupted throughout the entire genome. The genomic location of mutations can be easily mapped, creating a library of knockout rats for later use. Once the random knockout mutations are created, more refined mutations such as conditional mutations can be created by breeding knockout lines with rat lines expressing [[Cre recombinase|CRE recombinase]] in a tissue specific manner. Knock-ins can be produced by recombination mediated cassette exchange.

==''piggyBac'' (PB) DNA transposons==
[[Image:PB lifecycle2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''piggyBac'' transposon technology]]
[[PiggyBac_Transposon_System|''piggyBac'' (PB) DNA transposons]] mobilize via a "cut-and-paste" mechanism whereby a transposase enzyme (PB transposase), encoded by the transposon itself, excises and re-integrates the transposon at other sites within the genome. PB transposase specifically recognizes PB inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the transposon; it binds to these sequences and catalyzes excision of the transposon. PB then integrates at TTAA sites&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, M.J., et al., Precise excision of TTAA-specific lepidopteran transposons piggyBac (IFP2) and tagalong (TFP3) from the baculovirus genome in cell lines from two species of Lepidoptera. Insect Mol Biol, 1996. 5(2): p. 141-51.&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the genome, in a relatively random fashion. For the creation of gene trap mutations (or adapted for generating transgenic animals), the transposase is supplied in trans on one plasmid and is co-transfected with a plasmid containing donor transposon, a recombinant transposon comprising a gene trap flanked by the binding sites for the transposase (ITRs). The transposase will catalyze the excision of the transposon from the plasmid and subsequent integration into the genome. Integration within a coding region will capture the elements necessary for gene trap expression. PB possesses several ideal properties: (1) it preferentially inserts within genes (50 to 67% of insertions hit genes) (2) it exhibits no local hopping (widespread genomic coverage) (3) it is not sensitive to
over-production inhibition in which elevated levels of the transposase cause decreased transposition 4) it excises cleanly from a donor site, leaving no “footprint,” unlike Sleeping Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, R., J. Fain-Thornton, and N.L. Craig, piggyBac can bypass DNA synthesis during cut and paste transposition. EMBO J, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ding, S., et al., Efficient transposition of the piggyBac (PB) transposon in mammalian cells and mice. Cell, 2005. 122(3): p. 473-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sleeping beauty (SB) transposons==
[[Image:Sleeping Beauty transposon.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Sleeping Beauty transposon technology]]
The sleeping beauty (SB) transposon is a derivative of the Tc1/mariner superfamily of DNA transposons prevalent among both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. However, endogenous DNA transposons from this family are completely inactive in vertebrate genomes. An active Tc1/mariner transposon, synthesized from alignment of inactive transposons from the salmonid subfamily of elements, was “awoken” to form the transposon named Sleeping Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Ivics, Z., et al., Molecular reconstruction of Sleeping Beauty, a Tc1-like transposon from fish, and its transposition in human cells. Cell, 1997. 91(4): p. 501-10.&lt;/ref&gt; SB, like other DNA transposons, mobilizes itself via a cut-and-paste mechanism whereby a transposase enzyme, encoded by the transposon itself, excises and re-integrates the transposon at other sites within the genome. The 340 amino acid SB protein recognizes inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the transposon; it binds to these sequences and catalyzes excision of the transposon. SB then integrates into random sites within the genome, although some studies report very slight preferences for transcriptional units.&lt;ref&gt;Vigdal, T.J., et al., Common physical properties of DNA affecting target site selection of sleeping beauty and other Tc1/mariner transposable elements. J Mol Biol, 2002. 323(3): p. 441-52.

Mol Cell Biol, 2005. 25(6): p. 2085-94.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a simple requirement of a TA-dinucleotide at the target site, like all Tc1/mariner transposons.&lt;ref&gt;Plasterk, R.H., Z. Izsvak, and Z. Ivics, Resident aliens: the Tc1/mariner superfamily of transposable elements. Trends Genet, 1999. 15(8): p. 326-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SB transposon is a powerful tool for insertional mutagenesis in many vertebrate species. It recently exhibited especial utility for germ line mutagenesis in both mice and rats.&lt;ref&gt;Geurts, A.M., et al., Gene mutations and genomic rearrangements in the mouse as a result of transposon mobilization from chromosomal concatemers.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2002. 99(7): p. 4495-9.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several advantages that make SB a highly attractive mutagen geared toward gene discovery: 1) it has little bias for inserting within particular genomic regions or within specific recognition sequences, 2) de novo insertions of the transposon provide a “tagged” sequence marker for rapid identification of the specific mutation by simple PCR cloning methods, 3) in vivo SB insertional mutagenesis allows multiple mutations to be quickly and easily generated in a single animal, and in a single tissue, such as an adenomatous polyp.

==LINE1 (L1) retrotransposons==
[[Image:L1 Retrotransposon.jpg|thumb|right|400px|L1 retrotransposon technology]]
Transposons and retrotransposons are valuable tools for unbiased gene discovery as mobile pieces of DNA used for gene disruption.  Retrotransposons, such as LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), mobilize via a “copy and paste” mechanism and are abundant in many eukaryotic species.  Several L1 retrotransposons have remained active in mice and humans.  L1s contain a small internal promoter within a 5’ untranslated region to drive expression, two [[open reading frames]] (ORFs), and a 3’ untranslated region containing sequences for polyadenylation.  The two ORFs encode proteins necessary for autonomous retrotransposition; ORF1 encodes an [[RNA]]-binding protein while ORF2 encodes a protein containing endonuclease (EN) and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, which nick a site in DNA, then produce a copy via RT.  These proteins exhibit an overwhelming specificity for binding to and acting on the transcript that encodes them, enabling near exclusive mobilization of the parental L1 RNA. Using the RT activity of the ORF2 protein, the transcribed L1 RNA is copied into DNA by a process termed target primed reverse transcription (TPRT),&lt;ref&gt;Luan, D.D., M.H. Korman, J.L. Jakubczak, and T.H. Eickbush, Reverse transcription of R2Bm RNA is primed by a nick at the chromosomal target site: a mechanism for non-LTR retrotransposition. Cell, 1993. 72(4): p. 595-605.&lt;/ref&gt; and integrated into the genome.  Integration occurs with little bias for any particular genomic region, requiring a simple consensus sequence, 5’TTTT’A-3’ (along with minor variations of this sequence).  Integrated L1 sequences are often truncated at the 5’ end, with an average total size of 1 Kb, many containing only 3’ terminal sequences. 

The nature of retrotransposition endows the L1 with some unique advantages; L1 retrotransposons have an essentially unlimited supply of the insertional mutagen since it is continually transcribed from a promoter, which would be useful for applications where large numbers of mutations are needed in a single cell. L1 elements also demonstrate widespread genomic coverage, with a largely random distribution of insertions.&lt;ref&gt;Ostertag, E.M., et al., A mouse model of human L1 retrotransposition. Nat Genet, 2002. 32(4): p. 655-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babushok, D.V., et al., L1 integration in a transgenic mouse model. Genome Res, 2006. 16(2): p. 240-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cost, G.J. and J.D. Boeke, Targeting of human retrotransposon integration is directed by the specificity of the L1 endonuclease for regions of unusual DNA structure. Biochemistry, 1998. 37(51): p. 18081-93.&lt;/ref&gt; L1 insertions at genomic sites are also irreversible, and thus any mutagenic event caused by an L1 insertion is “tagged” by L1 sequences.

'''Malaipatukataam''' (Tamil: மலைபடுகடாம், meaning ''the rut of the mountains''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Treatment of Nature in Sangam Literature|last=Mu Varadarajan|first=|publisher=|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetic work in the [[Eighteen Greater Texts]] (''Pathinenmaelkanakku'') anthology of [[Tamil literature]], belonging to the [[Sangam period]] corresponding to between 100 BCE–100 CE. Malaipatukatam contains 583 lines of poetry in the ''Achiriyappa'' [[Poetic metre|metre]]. The poems were written by the poet Perunkosikanaar from Perunkunrur. In praise of a minor chieftain named Nannan Venmaan. Malaipatukatam belongs to the [[Ten Idylls]] (''Pattupattu'') collection and follows the ''Arruppadtai'' style, a device used by most of the books in the Pattupattu collection.

''Arruppatai'' poems read like travelogues in which poets who were returning with gifts received from a king, encourage other poets to do the same by describing in glowing terms the king and his country. This gives the opportunity to the poet, among other topics, to describe in great detail the natural beauty, fertility, and resources of the territory that has to be traversed to reach the palace of the patron. 

Malaipatukatam describes the various sounds generated and echoed in a mountainous terrain and uses the analogy of an elephant for the mountain to explain these sounds. It also describes the lifestyle of the folk dancers of the [[ancient Tamil country]].

'''Octobriana''' is a [[Russia]]n [[comic]] [[superheroine]] created by [[Petr Sadecký]] and based on the artistic works of [[Bohumil Konečný]] and [[Zdeněk Burian]].&lt;ref name="pospiszyl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divus.cz/umelec/article_page.php?item=700|title=Octobriana a ruský underground, part 1. |last1=Pospiszyl |first1=Tomáš |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= Umelec international|trans-title=Octobriana and the Russian Underground|accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1971 book ''Octobriana and the Russian Underground'' by Petr Sadecký, Octobriana was created in the 1960s by a group of dissident Russian artists calling themselves Progressive Political Pornography (PPP), however, this was a [[Octobriana#Hoax|hoax]].

As a character embodying [[Communist]] ideals, Octobriana was said to be usable by anyone who wanted, rather than being [[copyright|copyrighted]] by an author or coproration. This made her, in part, the inspiration for the creation of [[Jenny Everywhere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=in search of jenny everywhere|url=http://futureofthebook.org/blog/2008/03/17/in_search_of_jenny_everywhere/|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Octobriana and the Russian Underground==

In ''Octobriana and the Russian Underground'', Sadecký describes the PPP as a loose group of cells, not only in [[Russia]], but throughout the [[Soviet Union]]. This group, Sadecký wrote, started around 1957, after the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1956. At first they called themselves Progressivnaya Politika (Progressive Politics) and tried to go back to the pure principles of the [[White movement]] and their [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavian roots]]; the [[Rus' people]]. They were descendants of the [[Vikings]].

Later they put together [[samizdat]] comics about the superheroine Octobriana, said to embody the principles of the Russian Revolution and battle against both Russian and American oppression. Sadecky provides a history for Octobriana where she is said to be from thousands of years ago, the child of a [[Viking]] and a [[Toltec]] princes, whose original name was Mahari (which means "divine maiden" in [[Sanskrit]]). She was given radiation treatments that made her immortal and reborn as a superhuman in a radioactive volcano. (Her ethnicity has often shifted; the initial Amazona character seems to have been a confused mix of different indigenous backgrounds; Octobriana in Sadecky's book was said to have [[Mongolia]]n features. Many later portrayals have ignored this and rendered her as white.)

Sadecky portrays her as a legendary figure who has been sighted throughout history; there are reports from Siberia, Spain in the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], Chinese explorer [[Zhang Qian]], and an unpublished book by left wing Moroccan politician [[Mehdi Ben Barka]]. She has been called The White She-Dragon, The Girl with the White Face Coming from the Sky, The Mother of the Seven Red Stars, Angelic Maiden who Turned into a Devil, the Avenger. It is said that she comes from an ancient civilization and was granted immortality by radiation treatments, then underwent an ordeal in a radioactive volcano which transformed her into a superhuman being. She pilots the Wonder Machine, which travels through time and space, crewed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Her weapons and equipment include a Smith and Wesson revolver, a kris knife, and a shark-tooth necklace which can detect radiation. &lt;ref name="Short"&gt;{{cite book |last=Short |first= John A. |authorlink=John A. Short |date=2015 |title=Octobriana: The Underground History}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the stories was "The living sphinx of the [[Kamchatka]] radioactive volcano 1934", in which she swims into a radioactive [[volcano]] and kills a giant [[walrus]] with her [[kris]]. Afterwards she brings the tribesmen of the [[Koryaks]] home with a giant flying ball. Another story was titled "Octobriana and the Atomic Suns".

==Hoax==
Octobriana was actually Sadecký's own creation.&lt;ref name="pospiszyl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="komiks.cz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.komiks.cz/clanek.php?id=945|title=Octobriana a ruský underground - neuvěřitelný příběh Petra Sadeckého|last1=Alena |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2008-03-25|work= |publisher=Komiks.cz |language= Czech|trans-title=Octobriana and the Russian Underground: The incredible story of Petr Sadecký|accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petr Sadecký, while still in [[Prague]], enlisted the help of two Czech artists, [[Bohumil Konečný]] and [[Zdeněk Burian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reflex.cz/Clanek18703.html|title=Zdeněk Burian|last1=Walica |first1=Rostislav |last2= |first2= |date= 2005-02-17|work= |publisher=[[Reflex (magazine)|Reflex Magazine]]|language= Czech| accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in creating a comic centering on the character of "Amazona." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kultura.ihned.cz/c1-28925250-bohumil-bimba-konecny-ilustrator-foglara-batlicky-a-octobriany|title=Bohumil "Bimba" Konečný - ilustrátor Foglara, Batličky a...

However, Sadecký betrayed his friends by stealing all the artwork and escaping to the West where, in his efforts to market the Amazona comic, he changed the dialogue, drew a red star on the character's forehead, and was successful only after turning Amazona into a fake political statement, "Octobriana: the spirit of the [[October Revolution]]". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divus.cz/umelec/article_page.php?item=699|title=Octobriana a ruský underground, part 2. |last1=Pospiszyl |first1=Tomáš |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= Umelec international|trans-title=Octobriana and the Russian Underground, part 2|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major inconsistencies in his story, and a frame in his book where Octobriana is referred to as "Amazona" (p.&amp;nbsp;83), lend credence to this story. In addition, Burian and Konečný sued Sadecký in a West German court, winning the case but never recovering all their stolen artwork.{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=So does this mean they got *some* of their original art back?}}
Since Octobriana is still widely believed to be the product of dissident cells within the U.S.S.R., she is not copyrighted, and has appeared in a variety of artistic incarnations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6541">{{dablink|This article is about a Māori word; for the mountain range in [[Japan]], see [[Ōu Mountains]]. For the university, see [[Ohu University]].}}

'''Ohu''' is a [[Māori language|Māori]] word meaning 'communal work group'. A number of ohu (see [[intentional community]]) were set up in rural areas of [[New Zealand]] under a government scheme established in the mid-1970s.

==Background==

In the 1970s, the third [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Government of New Zealand]] (1972–75) under Prime Minister [[Norman Kirk]] was reportedly known for its strong social conscience in both international and domestic affairs (Govt Whips Office 1974, Bassett 1978, Hayward 1981). The government confronted the global nuclear arms race by strong opposition to French testing in the Pacific. As a nation, New Zealand sponsored non-proliferation measures such as the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone (later embodied in the [[Rarotonga Treaty]] of 1986) and South Pacific Environmental programme. The Labour Government ended national conscription and New Zealand’s contribution to the Vietnam War upon coming to power in 1972. Notably also, they cancelled the visas of a visiting [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] in early 1974 to show its opposition to the regime of apartheid in that country. On the domestic front, it demonstrated its commitment to environmental protection by setting up a Royal Commission on Nuclear Power in 1974, and the establishment of the Guardians of the [[Rotorua]] Lakes and [[Lake Manapouri]] (both 1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohu: Utopias in Paradise Lost?|url=http://www.converge.org.nz/evcnz/resources/ohu.html|website=Converge|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1974, the Labour Government announced the establishment of the ohu scheme for groups of New Zealand citizens willing to set up alternative communities in rural areas.

==The purposes of the scheme==
Forster and Metcalf suggest the Ohu movement was intended to remove radicals from urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Peter Michael|last2=Metcalf|first2=William James|title=Communal Groups: Social Laboratories or Places of Exile?|journal=Communal Societies|date=2000|volume=20|url=https://www.academia.edu/821756/Communal_Groups_Social_laboratories_or_places_of_exile|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However statements from the then Prime Minister, Norman Kirk, and the Minister for Lands, [[Matiu Rata]], suggest the purposes were:
* To assist people in becoming self-sufficient from the land.
* To enhance people's spiritual and social wellbeing. 
* To reconnect people to the land.
* To give people a chance to develop alternative social models. 
* To provide a communal environment as a potential antidote "to the ills of modern society[...]" (Hayward 1981 p.&amp;nbsp;173.)
* The promotion of the virtues of a simpler life (Hayward 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;173).
* To be a place of healing for participants as well as for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sargent|first1=Lyman Tower|title=The Ohu Movement|journal=The Journal of New Zealand Studies|date=1996|volume=6|issue=3|pages=18–19|url=http://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/jnzs/article/view/407/329|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1975 brochure about the scheme suggested it may be of interest to people keen on organic farming, alternative energy and recycling and referred to the Kibbutz as an inspiration but that communities were not expected to be a copy of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oved|first1=aácov|title=Globalization of Communes: 1950 - 2010|date=2012|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1412849487|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZskJtPcWFcC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=ohu+communities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NYaNKmM4ES&amp;sig=92zqe_SaneJ4vRBJjqM_lF5fLTE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZM7cU6HzFYHj8AWBuoGYAw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ohu%20communities&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matiu Rata also emphasised the social implications of this alternative land settlement scheme. For Rata, the scheme had a strong Māori spiritual dimension: "For some time now I have been concerned with the needs of that section of society that has worked so hard to gain social, economic and cultural integrity while trying to maintain spiritual and cultural strength and self-respect. I refer of course, to the Māori section of our society". (Matiu Rata to the Ohu Working Party, August 1974).

==Additional points==

* Over 30 sites were approved by the government for the establishment of ohu.
* Many of these sites were reportedly of poor quality and very remote.
* About eight communities were originally established, Sunburst Ohu, near Whitianga, Coromandel, was the first in to be approved in August 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilton|first1=Caren|title=Communes and communities - Communes: 1960s and 1970s|journal=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|page=2|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28118/ahu-ahu-ohu-around-2010|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The longest lasting of the Ohu communities was Ahu ahu ohu, which ceased in about 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilton|first1=Caren|title=Communes and communities - Communes: 1960s and 1970s|journal=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28118/ahu-ahu-ohu-around-2010|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Ahu ahu ohu was first founded access required crossing the river and a walk in of nearly an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sargent|first1=Lyman Tower|title=The Ohu Movement|journal=The Journal of New Zealand Studies|date=1996|volume=6|issue=3|page=21|url=http://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/jnzs/article/view/407/329|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former community is now a point of interest for tramping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taupotrampers.com/ahuAhuOhuNZGrid.pdf|title=AHU AHU OHU from Wanganui River Road|website=taupotrampers.com|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the [[New Zealand National Party|National government]] had voiced support for the scheme prior to the election, when it came into power in 1975 it wound up the Ohu advisory committee and eventually did away with the scheme altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sargent|first1=Lyman Tower|title=The Ohu Movement|journal=The Journal of New Zealand Studies|date=1996|volume=6|issue=3|page=22|url=http://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/jnzs/article/view/407/329|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open source product development''' (OSPD) refers to the development of [[open-source hardware]] products performed in a collaborative development process allowing the participation of any interested person. Open source product development instantiate the concept of [[open-source model]] in the context of physical products. 

__TOC__

== Characteristics of OSPD ==
OSPD is characterized by the simultaneity of two forms of openness: '''product openness''' (the development of open source hardware products as defined by the Open Source Definition) and '''process openness''' (the possibility for any interested person to take part in the collaborative development process). Generally, OSPD processes are relevant for complex products, whose definition requires the collaborative integration of inputs from multiple contributions. This, however, does not excludes the existence of OSPD processes for simple products. In that sense, OSPD specifies the concept of "open source innovation" as defined by Huizingh&lt;ref&gt;Huizingh, Eelko K. R. E. 2011. “[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497210001100 Open Innovation: State of the Art and Future Perspectives].” Technovation, ''Open Innovation - ISPIM Selected Papers'', 31 (1): 2–9.&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of complex tangible products.

Process openness requires that the product development process is performed by a "community". The word "community" is used in contrast to "company" or "team" in order to highlight three fundamental differences with the governance of conventional industrial product development&lt;ref&gt;see for example Demazière, Didier, François Horn, and Marc Zune. “[https://www.cairn.info/revue-societes-contemporaines-2007-2-page-101.htm Des relations de travail sans règles ?]” ''Sociétés contemporaines'', no. 66: 101–125.
&lt;/ref&gt;. First, communities are groups of individual people whose affiliation to institutions or companies has little influence on the role they play in the product development project. Second, the participation of a member to a community is voluntary, that is, each member defines independently his/her degree of involvement and the delivered workload is generally not paid. Third, the composition of a community is not set at the beginning of the project but is open for the participation of any interested person and evolves along the self-defined involvement of the community members. 

OSPD is "collaborative" in that it is performed with a certain simultaneity or parallelity in the work provided by the community members. In other words, OSPD is characterized by "intention for co-development"&lt;ref&gt;Raasch, Christina, and Cornelius Herstatt. 2011. "[http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S021987701100260X Product Development in Open Design Communities: A Process Perspective]." ''[[International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management]]'' 08 (04): 557–575.&lt;/ref&gt;. Collaboration is defined as the coordinated work performed by a group using common material and following a common objective&lt;ref&gt;Leimeister, Jan Marco, and Eva Alice Christiane Bittner. 2014. “[https://elibrary.vahlen.de/10.15358/0340-1650_2014_5_243/collaboration-engineering-jahrgang-43-2014-heft-5 Collaboration Engineering].” ''WiSt - Wirtschaftswissenschaftliches Studium'' 43 (5): 243–249.&lt;/ref&gt;. It therefore delineates with sequential development loops of open source designs&lt;ref&gt;for a description of such iterative processes, see Kyriakou, Harris, Jeffrey V. Nickerson, and Gaurav Sabnis. 2017. "[https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2924083 Knowledge Reuse for Customization: Metamodels in an Open Design Community for 3D Printing]." SSRN Scholarly Paper ID 2924083. Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network.&lt;/ref&gt; where a product is sequentially developed and released by an isolated member then reused, further developed and released again by another community member, and so on. 

===Further characteristics===
* OSPD is mostly an internet phenomenon: continuity of work, acquisition of new members and collaboration in (eventually geographically distributed) communities is enabled by online data management and communication. The online platform has been described as the "core" of an OSPD project&lt;ref&gt;Fjeldsted, A.S., G. Adalsteinsdottir, T. J. Howard, and T. C. McAloone. 2012. "[https://www.designsociety.org/publication/38539/open_source_development_of_tangible_products Open Source Development of Tangible Products-from a Business Perspective]." In ''DS 71: Proceedings of NordDesign 2012, the 9th NordDesign conference'', Aarlborg University, Denmark. 22-24.08.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;, whereas own research to be published shows that OSPD projects are not focused on one platform but tend to use several parallel tools and communication channels&lt;ref&gt;Bonvoisin, Jérémy, Laetitia Thomas, Robert Mies, Céline Gros, Rainer Stark, Karine Samuel, Roland Jochem, Jean-François Boujut. "Current state of practices in open source product development." Accepted for publication at the ICED 2017 Conference (to be published)&lt;/ref&gt;.
* In contrast to conventional industrial product development, the OSPD process is not characterized by clearly defined inputs, outputs and timelines, but is more an ongoing continuous improvement process.
* OSPD projects are not embedded in formal organisations but are characterized by a low level of restrictions, self-motivation and self-selection of modular tasks that can be performed by one person. 
* OSPD processes not only aim at generating a functioning technology but equally at personal development and process learning.
* The concept of OSPD implies the coexistence of three interwoven objects: a ''community'' involved in a ''project'' aiming at developing a ''product''. While those three concepts are necessary for the emergence of OSPD, they do not necessarily have a 1:1 relation. There may be for example communities involved in different projects or projects aiming at developing different products.

== Delineation with other terms ==
* Not all '''open source hardware''' projects are OSPD projects. OSPD projects are those of the open source hardware projects where a community-based collaborative product development process takes place.
* OSPD delineates clearly with '''crowdsourcing'''. In crowdsourcing, the outcome of the collaborative product development process is protected and the process is per definition centralized around a company or an institution. In OSPD, the outcome of the process is open source and the community is not necessarily centred around a company.
* The term '''[[open design]]''' may be used as an alternative to OSPD in literature. However, it is generally defined in less specific terms and is coined by conflicting definitions. Most of the available definitions do not refer simultaneously to product openness (the development of open source hardware products as defined by the Open Source Definition) and process openness (possibility to any interested person to take part in the collaborative development process). 
** Brulé and Valentin&lt;ref&gt;Brulé, Emeline, and Frédéric Valentin. 2016. "[https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01304721. Of Open Bodies: Challenges and Perspectives of an Open Design Paradigm]." In ''50th Anniversary Design Research Society Conference. Proceedings of DRS’16''. Brighton, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; define openness in the context of open design as "the inclusion of people and their values during the project framing and ideation process" and as "a space left to users in the formalization process (choice of functions, interactions, aesthetcics...)". Open design is in this sense the inclusion of the end user in the development of the artefact through the sharing of designs that are low constrained and can be customized. Although this definition refers in some way to both process and product openness, it is expressed in more generic terms than the provided OSPD definition. 
** In the Open Design Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;Ronen Kadushin, "[http://www.ronen-kadushin.com/files/4613/4530/1263/Open_Design_Manifesto-Ronen_Kadushin_.pdf Open Design Manifesto]."&lt;/ref&gt;, Kadushin defines open design as "a method consist[ing] of two preconditions: 1. An Open Design is CAD information published online under a Creative Commons license to be downloaded, produced, copied and modified. 2. An Open Design product is produced directly from file by CNC machines and without special tooling." This definition does not refer to collaborative product development. This definition only refers to product openness.
** In the "Open Design Definition v. 0.5"&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/OpenDesign-WorkingGroup/Open-Design-Definition/blob/master/open.design_definition/open.design.definition.md Open Design Definition v. 0.5]&lt;/ref&gt;, Meninchinelli and colleagues define open design as "a design artifact project whose source documentation is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, prototype and sell the artifact based on that design. In this sense, the term open design is used as a synonym of open source hardware. It only refers to product openness.
** The definition of Aitamurto et al.&lt;ref&gt;Aitamurto, Tanja, Dónal Holland, and Sofia Hussain. 2015. "[[doi:10.1162/DESI_a_00348|The Open Paradigm in Design Research]]. ''Design Issues'' 31 (4): 17–29.&lt;/ref&gt; is the definition which is at the closest to the definition of OSPD provided here: open design is a "process provid[ing] public access to participation in the design process and to the product resulting from that process, as well as the data created in the design process, including technical details and other data and content gathered or generated during the process." In that sense, OSPD is a specification of open design where the terms of product openness are specified by the open source definition.
** Ostuzzi et al.&lt;ref&gt;Ostuzzi, Francesca, Peter Conradie, Lieven De Couvreur, Jan Detand, and Jelle Saldien. 2016. “[http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2543. The Role of Re-Appropriation in Open Design: A Case Study on How Openness in Higher Education for Industrial Design Engineering Can Trigger Global Discussions on the Theme of Urban Gardening].” ''The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning'' 17 (4).&lt;/ref&gt; define open design as a product property, i.e. the spaces of freedom offered by a product so it can be reappropriated and adapted to another context than the original one.
** Buitenhuis and Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Buitenhuis, A. J., &amp; Pearce, J. M. (2012). "[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2012.06.006 Open-source development of solar photovoltaic technology]". ''Energy for Sustainable Development'', 16(3), 379–388.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as&lt;ref&gt;Howard, T. J., Achiche, S., Özkil, A., &amp; McAloone, T. C. (2012). "Open Design and Crowdsourcing: maturity, methodology and business models." Proceedings of the 12th International Design Conference DESIGN 2012, 181–190.&lt;/ref&gt; use misleadingly the term open design as an equivalent to open source hardware, however including the collaborative aspect of developing open source hardware. 
* Howard et al.&lt;ref&gt;Fjeldsted, A. S., Adalsteinsdottir, G., Howard, T. J., &amp; McAloone, T. C. (2012). "Open Source Development of Tangible Products-from a business perspective". Presented at the NordDesign 2012, Aalborg, Dennmark.&lt;/ref&gt; also use the term '''open source development''' to name the "development of intangible as well as tangible products, through accessible and sharable platforms, where motivated communities with common practices share, adopt, produce and further develop innovative solutions, under commonly agreed credits and licensing. Open source development being free to anyone can still encompass revenue streams from related services and branding recognition, which enforce new business opportunities within the open source world." This term tends to be quite similar to the principle of OSPD, however not centred on a defined product.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3532">A '''[[readability]] survey''' is a [[statistical survey]] of the ability of people to read given passages of text, written, formatted and/or [[page layout|laid-out]] in a variety of [[wiktionary:style|style]]s. The intent is to discover which are the preferable styles to use in order to maximise the ability of the [[reading audience]] to receive the intended message.

Tests may be performed by surveying real people reading the works, or an abbreviated test may be followed, where a number of works are surveyed using [[readability test|pre-determined scoring methodologies]], which were themselves developed by [[the scientific method|systematically]] surveying real people's response to given texts.

These tests are commissioned or performed by [[wiktionary:entity|entities]] like [[publisher]]s, [[educators]], [[design house]]s and [[government]]s, and have resulted in divination of a number of ''[[wiktionary:rule of thumb|rules of thumb]]'' based on [[statistical analysis]] of results which demonstrate a level of consistency in certain parameters [http://www.avery.com/promotions/color/facts_combinations.html], such as the quantity and location of [[White space (visual arts)|whitespace]] which obtains maximum readability (e.g. 20% whitespace in text body, margins should be around 40% of the width, for [[English language|English]] [[textbook]]s, preferably including a [[wiktionary:column|column]] down the left side of the page, or split over both sides, or down the right side as a last resort if sufficient room on the left is not available).

A readability survey implementation may use one or more [[readability test]]s in scoring the works.

{{Renaissance}}
'''Renaissance technology''' is the set of European artifacts and inventions which span the [[Renaissance]] period, roughly the 14th century through the 16th century. The era is marked by profound technical advancements such as the [[printing press]], [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective in drawing]], [[patent law]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] and [[Star fort|Bastion fortresses]]. Sketchbooks from artisans of the period ([[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]],  example) give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied.

[[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.

== Basic technology ==
Some important Renaissance technologies, including both innovations and improvements on existing techniques:
*mining and metallurgy
*[[blast furnace]] enabled iron to be produced in significant quantities
*[[finery forge]] enabled pig iron (from the blast furnace) into bar iron ([[wrought iron]])
*[[slitting mill]] mechanized the production of iron rods for [[nail (engineering)|nailmaking]]
*[[smeltmill]] increased the output of lead over previous methods ([[bole hill]])

=== Late 14th century ===
Some of the technologies were the [[arquebus]] and the [[musket]].

=== 15th century ===
The technologies that developed in Europe during the second half of the 15th century were commonly associated by authorities of the time with a key theme in Renaissance thought: the rivalry of the Moderns and the Ancients. Three inventions in particular — the printing press, firearms, and the nautical compass — were indeed seen as evidence that the Moderns could not only compete with the Ancients, but had surpassed them, for these three inventions allowed modern people to communicate, exercise power, and finally travel at distances unimaginable in earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Boruchoff 2012, 133-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crankshaft|Crank and connecting rod]]'''
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006690 Mechanik ^ Wasserförderung ^ Pumpe.jpg|thumb|150px|Water-raising pump powered by crank and connecting rod mechanism ([[Georg Andreas Böckler]], 1661)]]

The [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] mechanism which converts circular into reciprocal motion is of utmost importance for the mechanization of work processes; it is first attested for [[Hierapolis sawmill|Roman water-powered sawmills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Renaissance, its use is greatly diversified and mechanically refined; now connecting-rods are also applied to double compound cranks, while the [[flywheel]] is employed to get these cranks over the 'dead-spot'.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 112"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence of such machines appears, among other things, in the works of the 15th-century engineers [[Anonymous of the Hussite Wars]] and [[Taccola]].&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 113"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, cranks and connecting rods become an integral part of machine design and are applied in ever more elaborate ways: [[Agostino Ramelli]]'s ''The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines'' of 1588 depicts eighteen different applications, a number which rises in the 17th-century ''Theatrum Machinarum Novum'' by [[Georg Andreas Böckler]] to forty-five.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Printing press]]'''
[[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|left|Two printers operating a Gutenberg-style [[printing press]] (1568). Such presses could make around 3,600 impressions per workday.&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."/&gt;]]

The invention of the printing press by the German goldsmith [[Johannes Gutenberg]] (1398–1468) is widely regarded as the single most important event of the second millennium,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm People of the Millenium] for an overview of the wide acclaim. In 1999, the [[A&amp;E Network]] ranked [http://www.wmich.edu/mus-gened/mus170/biography100 Gutenberg no. 1 on their "People of the Millennium" countdown]. In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked [http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310192514/http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm |date=2010-03-10 }}; the same did four prominent US journalists in their 1998 resume [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium]. The [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07090a.htm Johann Gutenberg] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] describes his invention as having made a practically unparalleled cultural impact in the [[Christian era]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the defining moments of the Renaissance. The [[The Printing Revolution|Printing Revolution]] which it sparks throughout Europe works as a modern "agent of change" in the transformation of medieval society.

The mechanical device consists of a [[screw press]] modified for printing purposes which can produce 3,600 pages per workday,&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=67f}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the mass production of printed books on a proto-industrial scale. By the start of the 16th century, printing presses are operating in over 200 cities in a dozen European countries, producing more than twenty million volumes.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f"&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): "The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800", London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo", Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp. 58f&lt;/ref&gt; By 1600, their output had risen tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies, while Gutenberg book printing [[global spread of the printing press|spread from Europe further afield]].&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f" /&gt;

The relatively free flow of information transcends borders and induced a sharp rise in Renaissance literacy, learning and education; the circulation of (revolutionary) ideas among the rising middle classes, but also the peasants, threatens the traditional power monopoly of the ruling nobility and is a key factor in the rapid spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The dawn of the [[Gutenberg Galaxy]], the era of mass communication, is instrumental in fostering the gradual [[democratization of knowledge]] which sees for the first time modern media phenomena such as the [[newspaper#History|press]] or [[bestseller]]s emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prized [[incunable]]s, which are testimony to the aesthetic taste and high proficient competence of Renaissance book printers, are one lasting legacy of the 15th century.

'''[[Parachute]]'''
[[File:Homo Volans.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fausto Veranzio|Veranzio]]'s 1595 parachute design titled "Flying Man"]]

The earliest known parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s [[Renaissance Italy]];&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Add. MSS 34,113, fol. 200v&lt;/ref&gt; it depicts a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1968, 462f"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1968|pp=462f}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a safety measure, four straps run from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. Around 1485, a more advanced parachute was sketched by the polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in his ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (fol. 381v), which he scales in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1968, 462f"/&gt; Leonardo's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame, altering the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1968, 465"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1968|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetian inventor [[Fausto Veranzio]] (1551–1617) modifies da Vinci's parachute sketch by keeping the square frame, but replacing the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth. This he realized decelerates the fall more effectively.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1968, 465"/&gt; Claims&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wilkins]] (1614–1672): ''Mathematical Magic of the Wonders that may be Performed by Mechanical Geometry, part I: Concerning Mechanical Powers Motion, part II, Dead-loss or Mechanical Motions'', published in London in 1648&lt;/ref&gt; that Veranzio successfully tested his parachute design in 1617 by jumping from a tower in Venice cannot be substantiated; since he was around 65 years old at the time, it seems unlikely.

'''[[Mariner's astrolabe]]'''

The earliest recorded uses of the astrolabe for navigational purposes are by the Portuguese explorers [[Diogo de Azambuja]] (1481), [[Bartholomew Diaz]] (1487/88) and [[Vasco da Gama]] (1497/98) during their [[Portuguese discoveries|sea voyages around Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stimson|1985|p=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Dry dock]]'''

While dry docks were already known in [[Hellenistic]] shipbuilding,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|pp=326−328}}&lt;/ref&gt; these facilities were reintroduced in 1495/96, when [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England ordered one to be built at the [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth navy base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarton|1946|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th century ===
'''[[Dry dock|Floating dock]]'''
[[File:Floating Dock. Woodcut included in the 'Descrittione' of Venice 1560.jpg|thumb|left|Floating dock at Venice (1560)]]

The earliest known description of a floating dock comes from a small Italian book printed in Venice in 1560, titled ''Descrittione dell'artifitiosa machina''. In the booklet, an unknown author asks for the privilege of using a new method for the salvaging of a grounded ship and then proceeds to describe and illustrate his approach. The included [[woodcut]] shows a ship flanked by two large floating trestles, forming a roof above the vessel. The ship is pulled in an upright position by a number of ropes attached to the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarton|1946|pp=153f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domenico Fontana, Lowering of Vatican Obelisk, Rome, 1586.jpg|thumb|Relocation of the Vatican Obelisk, Rome, by [[Domenico Fontana]] (1586)]]
'''[[Crane (machine)#History|Lifting tower]]'''

A lifting tower was used to great effect by [[Domenico Fontana]] to relocate the monolithic [[List of obelisks in Rome|Vatican obelisk]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 1999 428"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its weight of 361 t was far greater than any of the blocks the Romans are known to have lifted by cranes.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 1999 428"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;53.3 t at [[Trajan's Column]] ({{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=426}}); 60−100 t at the Jupiter temple of [[Baalbek]] ({{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=16}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|left|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]

'''Mining, machinery and chemistry'''
A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

=== Early 17th century ===
'''[[Newspaper]]'''
[[File:Relation Aller Fuernemmen und gedenckwuerdigen Historien (1609).jpg|thumb|left|Title page of the ''[[Relation (journal)|Relation]]'' (1609), the earliest newspaper&lt;ref&gt;World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html "Newspapers: 400 Years Young!"]; {{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The newspaper is an offspring of the printing press from which the [[newspaper|press]] derives its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th century sees a rising demand for up-to-date information which can not be covered effectively by the circulating [[Avviso|hand-written newssheets]]. For "gaining time" from the slow copying process, [[Johann Carolus]] of Strassburg is the first to publish his German-language ''Relation'' by using a printing press (1605).&lt;ref name="Weber 2006, 396f"&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rapid succession, further German newspapers are established in Wolfenbüttel (''[[Avisa Relation oder Zeitung]]''), Basel, Frankfurt and Berlin.&lt;ref name="Weber 2006, 396f"/&gt; From 1618 onwards, enterprising Dutch printers take up the practice and begin to provide the English and French market with translated news.&lt;ref name="Weber 2006, 396f"/&gt; By the mid-17th century it is estimated that political newspapers which enjoyed the widest popularity reach up to 250,000 readers in the Holy Roman Empire, around one quarter of the literate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Air-gun'''

In 1607 Bartolomeo Crescentio described an air-gun equipped with a powerful spiral spring, a device so complex that it must have had predecessors.{{Or|date=January 2011}} In 1610 Mersenne spoke in detail of "sclopeti pneumatici constructio", and four years later [[John Wilkins|Wilkins]] wrote enthusiastically of "that late ingenious invention the wind-gun" as being "almost equall to our powder-guns". In the 1650s Otto von Guericke, famed for his experiments with vacua and pressures, built the ''Madeburger Windbuchse'', one of the technical wonders of its time.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Tools, devices, work processes ==

=== 15th century ===
'''[[Archimedes' screw|Cranked Archimedes' screw]]'''

The German engineer [[Konrad Kyeser]] equips in his ''[[Bellifortis]]'' (1405) the Archimedes' screw with a crank mechanism which soon replaces the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|pp=105, 111, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Reel|Cranked reel]]'''

In the textile industry, cranked [[reel]]s for winding skeins of yarn were introduced in the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"/&gt;

'''[[Brace (tool)|Brace]]'''

The earliest carpenter's braces equipped with a U-shaped grip, that is with a [[Crank (mechanism)|compound crank]], appears between 1420 and 1430 in [[Flanders]].&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 112"/&gt;

'''Cranked well-hoist'''

The earliest evidence for the fitting of a well-hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c. 1425 in the German ''Hausbuch of the Mendel Foundation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=167}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Paddle wheel boat|Paddle wheel boat powered by crank and connecting rod mechanism]]'''

While paddle wheel boats powered by manually turned [[crankshaft]]s were already conceived of by earlier writers such as [[Guido da Vigevano]] and the [[Anonymous Author of the Hussite Wars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|pp=80f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Roberto Valturio]] much improves on the design in 1463 by devising a boat with five sets of parallel cranks which are all joined to a single power source by one [[connecting rod]]; the idea is also taken up by his compatriot [[Francesco di Giorgio]].&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 114"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Grindstone (tool)|Rotary grindstone with treadle]]'''

Evidence for rotary grindstones operated by a crank handle goes back to the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] ''[[Utrecht Psalter]]''.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1480, the crank mechanism is further mechanized by adding a [[treadle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geared hand-mill'''

The geared hand-mill, operated either with one or two cranks, appears in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th century ===
[[File:Early Modern Grenade Rifles, Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, München. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|German grenade [[musket]]s from the 16th century (the two upper ones)]]
'''[[Grenade rifle|Grenade musket]]'''

Two 16th-century German grenade [[musket]]s working with a [[wheellock]] mechanism are on display in the [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]], Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, München, Inv. nos. W 1450, W 1451&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical drawings of artist-engineers ==
{{HistOfTech}}
The revived scientific spirit of the age can perhaps be best exemplified by the voluminous corpus of [[technical drawing]]s which the artist-engineers left behind, reflecting the wide variety of interests the Renaissance [[Homo universalis]] pursued. The establishment of the laws of linear perspective by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] gave his successors, such as [[Taccola]], [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], a powerful instrument to depict mechanical devices for the first time in a realistic manner. The extant sketch books give modern historians of science invaluable insights into the standards of technology of the time. Renaissance engineers showed a strong proclivity to experimental study, drawing a variety of technical devices, many of which appeared for the first time in history on paper.

However, these designs were not always intended to be put into practice, and often practical limitations impeded the application of the revolutionary designs. For example, da Vinci's ideas on the conical [[parachute]] or the winged flying machine were only applied much later. While earlier scholars showed a tendency to attribute inventions based on their first pictorial appearance to individual Renaissance engineers, modern scholarship is more prone to view the devices as products of a technical evolution which often went back to the Middle Ages.

'''Ṣàngó''' ([[Yoruba language]]: Ṣàngó, also known as '''Changó''' or '''Xangô''' in [[Latin America]]; and also known as '''Jakuta''' or '''Badé''') (from '=shan, 'to strike') is an [[Orisha]]. He is syncretized with either [[Saint Barbara]] or [[Saint Jerome]]. Historically, Shango is a royal ancestor of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] as he was the third [[Alafin of Oyo|Alafin]]  of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo Kingdom]] prior to his posthumous [[deification]]. Ṣàngó has numerous manifestations including Airá, Agodo, Afonja, Lubé, and Obomin.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="William"/&gt; He is considered to be one of the most powerful rulers that [[Yorubaland]] has ever produced, and is noted for his anger.

==Historical figure==

Jakuta was the third Alafin of Oyo, following [[Oranmiyan]] and [[Ajaka]].&lt;ref name="William" /&gt; Jakuta brought prosperity to the [[Oyo Empire]].&lt;ref name="Anthony" /&gt; According to Professor Mason's ''Mythological Account of Heroes and Kings'', unlike his peaceful brother Ajaka, Jakuta (meaning: someone who fought with stones) was a powerful and violent ruler. He reigned for seven years which were marked by his continuous campaigns and many battles. His reign ended due to his inadvertent destruction of his palace by lightning. He had three wives, namely Princess [[Oshun]], Princess [[Oba (orisha)|Oba]], and Princess [[Oya]]. The Oyo Empire declined in the 19th century, which led to the enslavement of its people by the Fulani and the Fon. Among them were many followers of Ṣàngó, and worship of the deity thrives in the New World as a result. Strong devotion to Ṣàngó led to Yoruba religions in Trinidad and [[Recife]], Brazil being named after the deity.&lt;ref name="v"/&gt;

In Yorubaland, Sango is worshiped on the fifth day of the week in which is named Ojo Jakuta. Ritual worship foods include guguru, bitter cola, [[Amala (food)|àmàlà]], and gbegiri soup. Also, he is worshiped with the Bata drum. One significant thing about this deity is that he is worshiped using red clothing, just as he is said to have admired red attire during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="j"/&gt;

==Veneration of Sango==

=== Nigeria ===

Ṣàngó is viewed as the most powerful and feared of the orisha pantheon. He casts a "thundersone" to earth, which creates thunder and lightning, to anyone who offends him.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Worshippers in [[Yorubaland]] in [[Nigeria]] do not eat [[cowpea]] because they believe that the wrath of the god of iron would descend on them.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The Ṣàngó god necklaces are composed in varying patterns of red and white beads; usually in groupings of four or six which are his sacred numbers. Rocks created by lightning strikes are venerated by Ṣàngó worshipers; these stones, if found, are maintained at sacred sites and used in rituals. Ṣàngó is called on during coronation ceremonies in Nigeria to the present day.&lt;ref name="mu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Onifade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="v"/&gt;

=== The Americas ===

Ṣàngó is venerated in [[Santería]] and [[Haiti]] as "Chango". As in the Yoruba religion, Chango is the most feared god in Santería.&lt;ref name="mu"/&gt;

In Haïti, he is from the "Nago" Nation, as [[Ogou]]. [[Palo (religion)|Palo]] recognizes him as "Siete Rayos".

====Candomblé====

Ṣàngó is known as Xangô in the [[Candomblé]] pantheon. He is said to be the son of [[Oranyan]], and his wives include [[Oya]], [[Oshun]], and [[Oba (Orisha)|Oba]], as in the Yoruba tradition. Xangô took on strong importance among slaves in Brazil for his qualities of strength, resistance, and aggression. He is noted as the god of lightning and thunder. He became the patron orixa of plantations and many Candomblé terreiros. In contrast [[Oko (Orisha)|Oko]], the orixá of agriculture, found little favor among slaves in Brazil and has few followers in the Americas. The main barracão of [[Ilê Axé Iyá Nassô Oká]], or the terreiro Casa Branca, is dedicated to Xangô. Xangô is depicted with an ''oxê'', or double-sided ax similar to a [[labrys]]; a brass crown.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;&lt;ref name="v"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abril"/&gt;

====Characteristics====

*Consecrated day: Tuesday
*Colors: white and red
*Element: fire
*Sacred food: [[amalá]] (a stew of okra with shrimp and palm oil)
*Instruments: oxê, a double ax; bangles; brass crown
*Garment: red cloth with printed white squares
*Necklace: white and red beads
*Archetype: power, domain
*Sacred dance: ''alujá'', the ''roda de Xangô''. It speaks of his achievements, deeds, consorts, power, and dominion 
*Sacrificial animals: fresh water turtle, male goat, duck, sheep&lt;ref name="abril"/&gt;&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;

Amalá, also known as ''amalá de Xangô'', is the ritual dish offered to the orixá. It is a stew made of chopped okra, onion, dried shrimp, and palm oil. Amalá is served on Wednesday at the ''pegi'', or altar, on a large tray, traditionally decorated with 12 upright uncooked okra. Due to ritual prohibitions, the dish may not be offered on a wooden tray or accompanied by [[garcinia kola|bitter kola]]. Amalá de Xangô may also be prepared with the addition of beef, specifically an ox tail. Amalá de Xangô is different than [[amala (food)|àmàlà]], a dish common to Yoruba areas of Nigeria.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;

Xangô is depicted with an oxê, also known as the ''oxê de Xangô''. The oxê is a double axe similar to a [[labrys]] and originally made of wood.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
{{trivia|date=November 2018}}
The song "Mama Loi, Papa Loi" by Bahamian musician [[Exuma (musician)|Exuma]] includes the lines "Come on Shango, Satan come to me/Let me speak what I can't see".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkj1DDKSDUg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/exuma/mama+loi+papa+loi_21017880.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Shango is also a large theme in the [[Mighty Sparrow]] song, "congo Man".

Caliban invokes Shango in [[Aimé Césaire]]'s play ''[[Une Tempête]]'' (''A Tempest'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aspresolver.com/aspresolver.asp?BLD2;PL005436|title=A tempest|last=Césaire|first=Aimé|date=2010|publisher=[[Alexander Street Press]]|location=Alexandria, VA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shango appears as a minor character in [[The Iron Druid Chronicles]] by [[Kevin Hearne]].

In episode 28 of the telenovela "Celia," loosely based on the life of Celia Cruz (produced by Telemundo), the cultural ancestors of Celia's African heritage visit her in her dreams, chanting and invoking the presence of Chango.

Xango is mentioned in the song Canto de Ossanha by Baden Powell and Vinicius de Moraes. &lt;ref&gt;https://blogdobatman.wordpress.com/2010/12/25/translation-of-%e2%80%9ccanto-de-ossanha%e2%80%9d-by-baden-powell-and-vinicius-de-moraes/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thunderstorms over the Pacific seen from Earth orbit on STS-64.jpg|270px|thumb|Space burials launch cremated remains out of the atmosphere.]] '''Space burial''' refers to the blasting of cremated remains into outer space. Missions may go into orbit around the Earth, to other planetary bodies (such as the Moon), or into deep space.

The cremated remains are not actually scattered in space, and thus do not contribute to [[space debris]]. Instead, the ashes remain sealed inside their spacecraft until the spacecraft either: re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and burns up upon re-entry (Earth orbit missions); reaches its final, extraterrestrial destination (e.g. the Moon); or escapes the solar system (deep space missions). To a lesser extent, suborbital flights provide the opportunity to briefly fly ashes into space and return them back to Earth for recovery. Only a sample of remains is launched so as to make the service affordable.

==History and typology==
The concept of launching remains into space using conventional rockets was proposed by the science fiction author [[Neil R. Jones]] in the novella "The Jameson Satellite," which was published in the pulp magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;"The Jameson Satellite" (''Amazing Stories'', July 1931; ''Amazing Stories'', April 1956 (reprint); Ace Books collection #1, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later proposed as a commercial service in the 1965 movie, "The Loved One,"&lt;ref&gt;goodgoodbye.com/film-and-video-reviews/funeral-films-the-loved-one/&lt;/ref&gt; and by Richard DeGroot in a ''[[Seattle Times]]'' newspaper article on April 3, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;John Hinterberger: ''The Seattle Times'' Sunday Magazine, page 3, April 3, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the private company [[Celestis]] has conducted numerous space burials flying as [[secondary payload]]s.&lt;ref name=CelestisFAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Celetis Launch Manifest |url=http://celestis.com/manifest.asp |publisher=CelestisInc |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Space shuttle enterprise star trek-cropcast.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Gene Roddenberry (third from the right) in 1976 with most of the cast of ''Star Trek'' at the rollout of the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']] at the [[Rockwell International]] plant at [[Palmdale, California]], USA]]

'''First Flights'''

The first space burial occurred in 1992 when the NASA space shuttle ''Columbia'' (mission [[STS-52]]) carried a portion of Gene Roddenberry's cremated remains into space and returned them to Earth.&lt;ref name="Shuttle bore Roddenberry's ashes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&amp;dat=19940429&amp;id=bUMvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CjMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1725,8689414 |title=Shuttle bore Roddenberry's ashes |publisher=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=April 29, 1994 |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first private space burial, Celestis' ''Earthview 01: The Founders Flight'', was launched on April 21, 1997. An aircraft, departing from the [[Canary Islands]], carried a [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus rocket]] containing samples of the remains of 24 people to an altitude of 11&amp;nbsp;km (38,000&amp;nbsp;ft) above the Atlantic Ocean. The rocket then carried the remains into an elliptical orbit with an [[apogee]] of {{convert|578|km|mi|abbr=on}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|551|km|mi|abbr=on}}, orbiting the Earth once every 96 minutes until reentry on May 20, 2002, northeast of Australia.  Famous people on this flight included [[Gene Roddenberry]] and [[Timothy Leary]].&lt;ref name=CelestisFoundersFlight&gt;{{cite web|title=Celestis Memorial Spaceflights – The Founders Flight |url=http://celestis.com/foundersFlight.asp |publisher=CelestisInc |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suborbital flights'''

Short flights that cross the boundary of space without attempting to reach orbital velocity are a cost-effective method of space burial. The remains do not burn up and are either recovered or lost.

'''Moon Burials'''

The first moon burial was that of Dr. [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker|Eugene Shoemaker]], a portion of whose cremated remains were flown to the Moon by NASA.&lt;ref name="ESAshes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stiles|first=Lorie|title=Eugene Shoemaker Ashes Carried on Lunar Prospector|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/news82.html|publisher=UA News Services, University of Arizona|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoemaker's former colleague [[Carolyn Porco]], a University of Arizona professor, proposed and produced the tribute of having Shoemaker's ashes launched aboard the NASA's [[Lunar Prospector]] spacecraft.&lt;ref name="DSPTribute"&gt;{{cite web|last=Porco|first=Carolyn|title=The Eugene M. Shoemaker Tribute|url=http://ciclops.org/public/tribute.html|publisher=Diamond Sky Productions|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days after Shoemaker's passing, Porco had the go-ahead from NASA administrators and delivered the ashes to the Lunar Prospector Mission Director Scott Hubbard at the NASA Ames Research Center.&lt;ref name="ESAshes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AstronomyMag"&gt;{{cite news|last=Porco|first=Carolyn C.|title=Destination Moon|url=http://www.astronomy.com/~/media/Files/PDF/Magazine%20articles/Destination%20Moon.ashx|accessdate=June 8, 2013|newspaper=Astronomy|date=February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ashes were accompanied by a piece of brass foil inscribed with an image of a Comet Hale-Bopp, an image of Meteor Crater in northern Arizona, and a passage from [[William Shakespeare]]’s Romeo and Juliet.&lt;ref name="ESAshes" /&gt;  The Lunar Prospector spacecraft was launched on January 6, 1998 and impacted the south polar region of the moon on July 31, 1999.&lt;ref name="LunarProspector"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David|title=Lunar Prospector|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunarprosp.html|publisher=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upcoming missions are proposed by both Elysium Space&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/elysium-space-lunar-memorial-service|title=This startup will send your loved one's ashes to the Moon|last=Clark|first=Liat|work=WIRED UK|access-date=2017-05-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Celestis as part of an upcoming mission by [[Astrobotic Technology]] of Pittsburgh.

'''Pet Burials'''

In 2014, Celestis launched Celestis Pets, a pet memorial spaceflight service for animal cremated remains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.celestispets.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to then, a [[Monroe, Washington]] [[police dog]] may have flown on a 2012 memorial spaceflight.  When this news broke, Celestis' President said that if dog ashes were on the rocket, the person who supplied the cremated remains likely violated the contract they signed with Celestis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20120524/NEWS01/705249808|title=Dog's ashes may have been sneaked on to space flight|author=Rikki King|work=[[The Herald (Everett)|Everett Herald]]|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dedicated Spacecraft'''

On May 17, 2017, [[Elysium Space]] announced the world's first memorial flight involving a dedicated spacecraft. The [[CubeSat|cubesat]] will be placed as a secondary payload on a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] rocket as part of a dedicated rideshare mission called SSO-A planned by [[Spaceflight Industries|Spaceflight]]. The launch will take place from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

'''''The Baptism of Christ''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Piero della Francesca]], finished around 1448–50. It is housed in the [[National Gallery]], London.

The panel was commissioned presumably some time about 1440 by the [[Camaldolese]] [[Monastery]] of [[Sansepolcro]] in [[Tuscany]], originally part of a [[triptych]]. Its dating to Piero della Francesca's early career is evidenced by the strong relationship with the "light painting" of his master, [[Domenico Veneziano]].

It portrays [[Baptism of Christ|Christ being baptised]] by [[St. John the Baptist|John]], his head surmounted by a [[dove]] representing the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. Christ, John's hand, the bird and the bowl form an axis which divides the painting in two symmetrical parts.  A second division is created by the tree on the left, which instead divides it according to the [[golden ratio]].

Behind John, a man in white briefs, his feet already in the water, is struggling to get out of his undershirt. The three angels on the left wear different clothes and, in a break from traditional iconography, are not supporting Christ's garments, but are holding each other's hands, in a sort of way. This could be an allusion to the contemporary [[Council of Florence]] (1431–45), whose goal was the unification of the Western and Eastern Churches. The Camaldolese [[monk]] and [[theology|theologian]], [[Saint Ambrose Traversari]] (+1439), who had been [[Prior|Prior General]] of the [[congregation (Catholic)|Camaladolese congregation]], had been a strong supporter of the union. Such symbolism is also suggested by the presence, behind the [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]] on the right, of figures dressed in an oriental fashion.

Piero della Francesca was renowned in his times as an authority on perspective and geometry: his attention to the theme is shown by John's arm and leg, which form two angles of the same size.

'''''The Killing of a Sacred Deer''''' is a 2017 [[psychological thriller]] film directed by [[Yorgos Lanthimos]], from a screenplay by Lanthimos and [[Efthymis Filippou]]. It stars [[Colin Farrell]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Barry Keoghan]], [[Raffey Cassidy]], [[Sunny Suljic]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], and [[Bill Camp]]. The story is based on the ancient Greek play ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'' by [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Kevin |last=Lincoln |date=October 27, 2017 |title=The Ancient Greek Plays That Explain How ''The Killing of a Sacred Deer'' Got Its Title |website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] |access-date=November 22, 2017|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-and-greek-myths.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Lane |first=Anthony |date=October 30, 2017 |title='The Killing of a Sacred Deer' and 'The Square' |department=The Current Cinema (column) |work=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]] |access-date=November 22, 2017 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-and-the-square}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film follows a cardiac surgeon (Farrell) who secretly befriends a teenage boy (Keoghan) with a connection to his past. He introduces the boy to his family, who begin to fall mysteriously ill.

''The Killing of a Sacred Deer'' was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] in the main competition section at the [[2017 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film was theatrically released in the United States on October 20, 2017, by [[A24 (company)|A24]], and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on November 3, 2017, by [[Curzon Artificial Eye]]. It has received positive reviews, and grossed over $6 million worldwide.&lt;ref name="numbers"/&gt;

==Plot==
Steven Murphy, a skilled [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]], finishes an [[open heart surgery]], and goes to a diner where he meets a teenage boy named Martin. Afterward, Steven returns home to his wife, Anna, and their children, Kim and Bob. He later tells Anna that Martin's father died in a car accident ten years earlier, and that he has taken an interest in the boy to help him grieve. Martin comes to the Murphy household for dinner; Kim seems rather taken with him.

Martin returns the favor by inviting Steven to his mother's home for dinner. After the meal, Steven tries to leave but Martin insists he watch a movie with them. Martin leaves halfway through, and his mother makes a romantic advance on Steven, who rebuffs her and goes home. Over the next few days, Martin's demands on Steven's time grow increasingly frequent and desperate, but Steven does not reply. One morning, Bob awakens and finds he cannot feel his legs; he has become [[Paralysis|paralyzed]]. Steven and Anna rush him to the hospital, where an examination reveals that nothing is physically wrong. Meanwhile, Kim meets with Martin for a date.

The next morning, Martin meets Steven and reveals the truth: his father did not die in the crash but had died during surgery that Steven himself performed after the accident. Steven failed to save his father, and the boy blames the surgeon for the death. Martin explains that, to "balance" the act of destroying a family, Steven must kill one of the members of his own. If not, the Murphys will slowly die after four stages; paralysis is the first stage. Steven attempts to dismiss these claims, but later finds that Bob is refusing food: this is the second stage. Kim also loses the use of her legs and the will to eat.

Kim receives a call from Martin at the hospital. During the conversation, she regains the use of her legs, only to lose mobility again when the connection is broken. This convinces Anna that Martin has power. She visits Martin to ask why she and her children must suffer for Steven's mistakes. Martin responds that "it's the only thing...that's close to justice". Anna, suspecting that her formerly [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] husband may have drank on the day of the operation, speaks to Steven's anesthesiologist, Matthew, who reveals that Steven did in fact have a few drinks that morning. Anna performs a [[handjob]] on Matthew as payment for the information. At Anna's insistence, the children are transported to their home, where they are fed through a tube. Steven then kidnaps Martin, brutally beating him and demanding that he reverse the condition of the children. Martin is unaffected, warning Steven that time is running out.

Martin's presence only exacerbates the tension in the household: Kim and Bob argue over who their father will choose; and Anna claims that killing one of the children is clearly the only option, as they can have another. Kim attempts to save herself by escaping and crawling through the neighborhood. Steven and Anna retrieve her. The next morning, Anna releases Martin as holding him captive was no use. Bob begins bleeding from the eyes—the final stage before death. Rather than choose, Steven binds Kim, Bob, and Anna to chairs, covers their heads, and pulls a woolen hat over his own face. He loads a rifle, spins in circles, and fires. The first two shots miss, but the third kills Bob.

Some time later, the family visits the same diner where Steven met with Martin. Martin enters and stares at them; he and the family briefly lock eyes and the Murphys leave as Martin gazes after them.

'''''The Steve Harvey Show''''' is a sitcom that aired on [[The WB]] from August 25, 1996 to February 17, 2002. It was created by [[Winifred Hervey]] and directed by [[Stan Lathan]].

==Synopsis==
Steve Hightower ([[Steve Harvey]]) is a 1970s [[funk]] legend who is now a music teacher/vice-principal at [[Booker T. Washington]] High School on [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]'s West Side. Budget cutbacks meant Steve also had to teach drama and art, much to his surprise. Cedric Robinson ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) is a coach at the high school, and Steve's longtime best friend. The principal of Booker T. Washington High is Steve's former classmate, Regina Grier ([[Wendy Raquel Robinson]]), who Steve affectionately calls "Piggy", because of the fact that she was overweight as an adolescent.

Steve forms a strong bond with two of his students: Romeo Santana ([[Merlin Santana]]), a stylish, popular, self-absorbed ladies' man, and the equally vacuous Stanley Kuznocki, nicknamed Bullethead ([[William Lee Scott]]) - acting as their mentor, and gradually, accepts them as friends.

In 1997, the show introduced a new character, a secretary named Lovita Jenkins ([[Terri J. Vaughn]]), a woman who is fundamentally good in nature, but nonetheless, considerably unrefined in terms of disposition. Cedric and Lovita begin dating, and eventually marry and produce a child. The show also featured a succession of young actresses who served as female foils to Romeo and Bullethead; the longest-lasting of these was [[Lori Beth Denberg]] as the overachieving, socially inept Lydia Gutman.She would also call Bullethead a "broke [[Brad Pitt]]" whenever he annoyed her, but would usually refer to Lydia as "Linda", "Lisa", or "Lucy" (correctly calling her "Lydia" only once). Rapper [[The Lady of Rage]] also had a recurring role as Coretta "The Ox" Cox, a physically massive, brutish teenaged girl in romantic pursuit of Romeo. 

Steve was part of a fictional singing group called "Steve Hightower and the High Tops," who would temporarily reunite to perform on occasion (the spelling of "High Tops" appears on a promotional poster that hangs on Steve's wall). The members consisted of Steve, T-Bone (played by [[T. K. Carter]], later by [[Don Curry|Don 'D.C.' Curry]]), Pretty Tony (played by [[Ronald Isley]] of [[The Isley Brothers]]), and Clyde (played by Jonathan Slocumb). Two of their signature songs (performed several times on the show) were "When the Funk Hits the Fan" (and later on [[Steve Harvey (talk show)|Harvey's eponymous talk show]]), and "Break Me Off a Piece of That Funk."  Though Cedric was not an original member of the group, he usually sang with them on several events.

A few other recurring characters throughout the series included Cedric's grandmother named "Grandma Puddin'" (played by Cedric the Entertainer) and Regina's boyfriend, former NFL star Warrington Steele (played by [[Dorien Wilson]]). [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]] appeared in several episodes as "Junior" and "Vincent."  [[Wayne Wilderson]] portrayed Byron, a "bougie" type character who was a TV producer and a member of the Onyx Club (a professional men's group that Steve and Cedric tried to join). Dwayne Adway played Jordan Maddox, a professional basketball player who was briefly married to Regina before dying during their honeymoon. [[Ernest Lee Thomas]] made a couple of appearances as the Reverend who eulogized Maddox, and who married Cedric and Lovita.

==Running gags==
There were a few recurrent gags throughout the series. For instance, Lovita had several relatives named after products or items (her brother's name was [[Duracell]]; she had cousins named "[[Kinko]]", "[[Bruschetta]]," "[[Clinique]]," and "[[Camay]]").

Steve also made several references to his well-known hot spot "The Nasty Kitty" and his favorite working girl, Bubblicious, even though the strip club is never seen. Steve's topical humor of popular culture was also another recurring gag. One example of these jokes: "When I see that woman, I'm like [[Shaquille O'Neal|Shaq]] doing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] - I just don't know how to act!". Another recurring gag on the show was despite being a one-time famous musician in the universe of the show, Steve was always mistaken for being other famous musicians. For example, in an episode guest starring [[Jerry Springer]], he refers to him as "That Cop from the [[Village People]]." Another episode featured singer [[Teena Marie]], who when Steve went to introduce himself to see if she'd remember him, answers "Oh yes! Lionel! How are you? Give my best to the rest of [[The Commodores]]" (referring to singer [[Lionel Richie]]).

Though Regina had blossomed into a beautiful, stylish lady, she sometimes displayed her insecurities, and was highly competitive (always displayed childlike exuberance whenever she won a trophy by yelling her signature catchphrase "Bam! In your face!", and once cheated Steve in a game of [[Scrabble]] because he played it better than she). In addition, the romantic tension between Steve and Regina eventually blossomed into a relationship, though they never kissed on the show.

A very well-known gag was Cedric's story about being from Willacoochee, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where he was raised in a one-bedroom shack. The story was never finished, the scene would change or someone would interrupt him. Cedric's love for decking out his [[Hyundai]], which was never seen in the show, was another running gag, as well as offering to take Lovita out to dinner whenever he had a two-for-one coupon at the [[Sizzler]] restaurant.

Occasional gags referenced Bullethead's trailer park lifestyle, and Romeo's numerous names (he has used the names Romeo Miguel Jesus Pele Rojas Alejandro Santana). In one episode, he wrote all of his names on paper but never prepared his assignment, resulting in an "F". Lydia almost always displayed an obsession for her classmate/alleged lover, Arthur Rabinowitz (whom Steve referred to as "that polite Jewish boy that does his taxes"), and for her favorite entertainer, [[Barbra Streisand]]; however, she had total disdain for classmates "Heather the cheerleader" and "Jennifer the cheerleader". One other gag was that teachers would refer to a student (amongst themselves) because of a condition or appearance ("Helmet Boy" for wearing a special helmet in gym class; "Au Natural Girl" for having a strong body odor, and "Firestarter" for one kid who kept setting items on fire).

==Series end==
In 2001, Harvey decided to pursue other projects. He wished to end the show after the fifth season, but at the insistence of the WB network, reluctantly filmed a 13-episode sixth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_13_101/ai_84184937?tag=content;col1|title=`The Steve Harvey Show' ends after six seasons|date=March 18, 2002|publisher=''Jet''|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ended with Regina mulling over a job offer to be a principal at a private school in California. Steve, who doesn't want Regina to go, acts supportive despite his feelings. Regina ends up taking the job; with encouragement from Lydia, Bullethead, and Romeo, Steve decides to go after her to reveal his true feelings. Lydia, Romeo, and Bullethead have all graduated by the series' finale. Meanwhile, Cedric and Lovita win the lottery and Lovita goes into labor (Terri J. Vaughn's real-life pregnancy was written into the show that season).

===Death of Merlin Santana===
On November 9, 2002, nine months after the show ended, Merlin Santana was shot in the head and killed while sitting in his friend's ([[Brandon Adams (actor)|Brandon Adams]]) car in [[South Central Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He was 26 years old. The reason for his death is that the killer's girlfriend falsely stated that Santana tried to rape her. The episode of ''The Steve Harvey Show'' immediately following Santana's death was dedicated to his honor.

==Syndication==
The series was first distributed to syndication to [[The WB]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], [[UPN]], and independent affiliates in the United States by [[Columbia TriStar Television|Columbia Tristar Television Distribution]]  in September 2000, and remained airing in broadcast syndication in some U.S. markets on various local stations (such as [[WCIU-TV|WCIU]] and [[Me-TV]] in Chicago) as late as 2008. From 2000-2005, reruns aired on New York's UPN station, [[WWOR-TV]]. From 2014 to June 2016, after [[Bill Cosby]]'s rape allegation, ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' reruns were replaced on [[WPIX]] by reruns of ''The Steve Harvey Show''. The show has started airing again in syndication as of 2015.

The series aired on [[BET]] until March 2009, and was on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in the [[United States]] until September 24, 2011, UK Channel [[Trouble (TV channel)|Trouble]]. It was broadcast on [[Ion Television]] until March 16, 2009.

As of June 2018, reruns of the show can be seen on [[BET Her]].

==DVD release==
In 2003, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment| Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment]] released ''The Best of the Steve Harvey Show, Vol. 1'', on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD. The disc features five episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Best-Steve-Harvey-Show-Vol/dp/B000095WW5|title=''The Best of the Steve Harvey Show, Vol. 1''|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Uncanny''''' is a 1977 British [[anthology film|anthology]] horror film, concerning feline revenge. The film was written by [[Michael Parry]], directed by [[Denis Héroux]] and stars [[Peter Cushing]], [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Ray Milland]], [[Joan Greenwood]], [[Donald Pilon (actor)|Donald Pilon]], [[Samantha Eggar]], and [[John Vernon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0076853}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNCANNY, The
Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 44, Iss. 516,  (Jan 1, 1977): 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is similar to the horror anthologies released by [[Amicus Productions]] and could be mistaken as one, it was actually distributed by [[The Rank Organisation]]. However, the co-producer was [[Milton Subotsky]] of Amicus.&lt;ref name="amicus"&gt;Ed. Allan Bryce, ''Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood'', Stray Cat Publishing, 2000 p 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the film was originally given an [[X-rating]].

==Plot==
In 1977, in Montreal, writer Wilbur Gray ([[Peter Cushing]]) visits his publisher Frank Richards ([[Ray Milland]]) to discuss his new book about cats. Wilbur believes that felines are supernatural creatures, and that they are the devil in disguise. Wilbur tells three tales to illustrate his thoughts:

In 1912, in London, Miss Malkin ([[Joan Greenwood]]) is a wealthy woman who rewrites her will leaving her fortune to her cats rather than to her nephew Michael ([[Simon Williams (actor)|Simon Williams]]). Her maid Janet ([[Susan Penhaligon]]), also the mistress of Michael, steals one copy of the will from the lawyer's briefcase and tries to destroy the original copy which is kept in the safe. When Miss Malkin sees her attempt, Janet kills her. The cats avenge Miss Malkin's death.

In 1975, in the Province of Quebec, the orphan Lucy ([[Katrina Holden Bronson|Katrina Holden]]) comes to live with her aunt Mrs. Blake ([[Alexandra Stewart]]), her husband (Donald Pilon), and her cousin Angela ([[Chloe Franks]]) after the death of her parents in a plane crash. Lucy brings her only friend, the cat Wellington, but her mean cousin forces her parents to get rid of Wellington. Lucy uses her mother's book of witchcraft to avenge Wellington.

In 1936, in Hollywood, the actor Valentine De'ath ([[Donald Pleasence]]) replaces the blade of a fake pendulum to kill his actress wife (Catherine Bégin), and give his young mistress and aspiring actress ([[Samantha Eggar]]) a chance. The cat of his wife avenges her death.

In [[Irish mythology]] and [[Scottish mythology]], '''Tír na nÓg''' ({{IPA-ga|tʲiːɾˠ n̪ˠə ˈn̪ˠoːɡ|}}; "Land of the Young") or '''Tír na hÓige''' ("Land of Youth") is one of the names for the [[Celtic Otherworld]], or perhaps for a part of it. Other [[Old Irish]] names for the Otherworld include Tír Tairngire ("Land of Promise/Promised Land"),&lt;ref name="koch1671" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James MacKillop (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=U-O0wzFcu2gC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;dq=T%C3%ADr+na+n%C3%93g+land+of+youth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=i-fzS5T5G53J_gbTx4H9DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=T%C3%ADr%20na%20n%C3%93g%20land%20of%20youth&amp;f=false A dictionary of Celtic mythology] Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tír fo Thuinn ("Land under the Wave"),&lt;ref name="koch1671" /&gt; [[Mag Mell]] ("Plain of Delight/Delightful Plain"),&lt;ref name="koch1671" /&gt; Ildathach ("Multicoloured place"),&lt;ref name="monaghan" /&gt; and [[Emain Ablach]] (the Isle of Apple Trees). Similar myths in the northern Celtic cultures include these of [[Annwn]], [[Fairyland]], and [[Brasil (mythical island)|Hy Brasil]].

Tír na nÓg is depicted as a paradise and supernatural realm of everlasting youth, beauty, health, abundance and joy.&lt;ref name="koch1671"&gt;Koch, John T.

They reach it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, or by going under water or across the sea.&lt;ref name="koch1671" /&gt; The mortal who visit the Otherworld are referred to as echtrai (adventures) and baili (visions, ecstasies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/52527112|title=The Celtic realms|last=1900-1972.|first=Dillon, Myles,|date=2003|publisher=Castle Books|isbn=0760742847|oclc=52527112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The path across the sea is called Mag Mell (Plain of Honey). It is the golden path made by the sun on the ocean.

==Oisín and Niamh==

Tír na nÓg is best known from the tale of [[Oisín]] and [[Niamh (mythology)|Niamh]].&lt;ref&gt;T.A. Rolleston (1990). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4CUS2j5fw-QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Celtic%20Myths%20and%20Legends%2C%20by%20T.%20W.%20Rolleston&amp;pg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Celtic Myths and Legends] Courier Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In the tale, Oisín (a human hero) and Niamh (a woman of the Otherworld) fall in love. She brings him to Tír na nÓg on a magical horse that can travel over water. After spending what seems to be three years there, Oisín becomes homesick and wants to return to Ireland. Niamh reluctantly lets him return on the magical horse, but warns him never to touch the ground. When he returns, he finds that 300 years have passed in Ireland. Oisín falls from the horse. He instantly becomes elderly, as the years catch up with him, and he quickly dies of old age.&lt;ref name=monaghan&gt;Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2004. pp.358, 368&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Oisín and Niamh bears a striking similarity to many other tales, including the Japanese tale of [[Urashima Tarō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=World tales : the extraordinary coincidence of stories told in all times, in all places|year=1991|publisher=Octagon|location=London|isbn=978-0863040368|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version concerns King [[Herla]], a legendary king of the ancient Britons, who visited the Otherworld, only to return some two hundred years later after the lands had been settled by the Anglo-Saxons. The "[[Seven Sleepers]] of Ephesus", a group of Christian youths who hid inside a cave outside the city of [[Ephesus]] around 250, purportedly awoke approximately 180 years later during the reign of [[Theodosius II]].

== Oisín in Tír na nÓg ==

=== Plot ===
There is a king of Tír na nÓg who held the crown for many years. The tradition of the land is that every seven years champions come to run against the king in order to rule. They run up a hill to a throne and the first person to sit on the throne becomes king until a champion replaces him. The king begins to fear that someone else will replace him as king. He visits a Druid and asks about his fate as a monarch. The Druid tells him that he will always be king unless his son-in law runs against him. Since the king's daughter is not yet married he decides to use the Druid's magic to turn his daughter's head into the head of a pig. The [[Druid]] then tells the king's daughter that she get her own head back if she marries a son of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Fin MacCumhail]]. The king's daughter finds one of the sons, Oisin, and tells him what the Druid told her. They marry and she transforms back into herself. They then go back to Tír na nÓg and Oisin enters the challenge for the throne. He wins the throne and no one ever runs against him again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Beauty and the beast : classic tales about animal brides and grooms from around the world |last=Tatar |first=Maria |isbn=9780143111696 |location=New York |oclc=952384463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbols of Irish mythology ===

==== Pigs ====
The princess is given a pig's head and pigs are a common symbol in Irish mythology. For the culture they were a vital meat source and they were smaller and fiercer than the modern domesticated pig. Early in Celtic culture, the pig was used as a funeral animal and pigs were an important aspect of trade between the [[Celts]] and [[Romans]].They also represent a connection to the warrior class and are said to be good luck to the person who catches them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore|last=Monaghan|first=Patricia|publisher=Checkmark Books|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">'''Ura''' is one of the popular traditional dances of the [[Cook Islands]], a Maori sacred ritual usually performed by a female who moves her body to tell a story, accompanied by intense drumming by at least five drummers. Moving the hips, legs and hands give off different gestures to the audience to tell a tale, typically related to the natural landscape such as the ocean and birds and flowers, but also feelings of love and sadness.&lt;ref name="ECI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjoycookislands.com/rarotonga-culture-dancing-drumming.html|title=Dancing &amp; drumming|publisher=Enjoycookislands.com|accessdate=26 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510224006/http://www.enjoycookislands.com/rarotonga-culture-dancing-drumming.html|archive-date=10 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ura dance has three distinct components; the ura pa'u (drum dances), korero (legends) and kaparima (action songs).{{sfn|Sissons|1999|p=44}} To perform the ura, women typically wear a [[Pareo|''pareu'']] and a ''kikau'' (grass) skirt, with flowers and shell headbands and necklaces known as ''ei''.{{sfn|Sissons|1999|p=44}} Men during the dance are said to "vigorously flap their knees in a semi-crouched position while holding their upper bodies steady", and they typically wear ''kikau'' skirts and headbands.{{sfn|Sissons|1999|p=44}} The drumming group, an integral part of the Ura, typically consists of a lead drummer (''pate taki''), support lead (''pate takirua''), a double player (''tokere'' or ''pate akaoro'') playing wooden gongs, and two other players playing skin drums (''pa'u'' and ''mango'').&lt;ref name="ECI"/&gt; The finest performances of the Ura are put on in [[Rarotonga]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999|p=312}}

==African customs==

===Ethiopia===
The Wedding procedure starts with the groom's side sending elders (Shimagle) who then request a union between the parties. The elders discuss a dowry (ጧሎሽ) and verify that the intended bride and groom are not relatives by checking their lineage a minimum of seven generations. After a dowry is agreed upon and it has been determined that there is no relationship between the intended bride and groom, the wedding is announced and the families begin preparations for a church/mosque ceremony and a mels/melsi ceremony.   On the wedding day the groom and groomsmen (ሚዜ) get ready at the groom's house early in the morning and proceed to the bride's parents house to begin the wedding ceremonies. At the bride's parent's house, the bride gets ready and is seated awaiting the groom's arrival.  As the groom and his wedding party arrive, the bride's family and friends ceremonially block the entrance to the house. The groomsmen have to either serenade or bribe their way into the house so that the groom can take the bride with him. Additionally, the best man holds perfume and sprays it everywhere inside the bride's family house. After this ceremony, the groom retrieves his bride and they along with a procession go to a church/mosque to take their wedding vows.

After the religious ceremony, the wedding procession moves to a park/garden where lunch is served to guests.  Afterwards, the wedding party typically takes pictures while guests make their way to the reception.  At the reception, depending on the family's ethnic group there are several traditional dances performed.  Ethiopian weddings typically serve Ethiopian food and live music and the party typically goes on into the early morning.  To close the wedding ceremony, elders are seated at the exit of the venue and the bride and groom along with the wedding party bow and kiss the knees of the elders as they exit the venue.  This is typically the conclusion the first day of a typical Ethiopian wedding.

During the mels/i ceremony is dependent on the ethnic heritage of the family but it is typically smaller than the first ceremony and a time for close friends and family to spend some time with each other and continue to celebrate the newly married couple.

===Kikuyu===
Customarily, marriage proceedings often begin with the man proposing to the woman. Upon her acceptance the man then calls for a meeting with his clan elders who largely consist of extended elderly family members. A delegation carrying small gifts is then sent to the woman's home to meet with her clan elders. Deliberations on bride price actually begin on a later date and these are strictly conducted by the older men only. Upon completion of these negotiations, a wedding date is set, with the elders having provided an acceptable percentage of the full dowry. The rest of the dowry is expected later. No request is made for it, but the young man is expected to remember to finish his payment and failure to do so spells dishonor for that family.

The wedding day begins with a convoy from the grooms family that heads to the girl's home to collect her. However, the convoy is not immediately let into the girl's homestead. Rather the bride's gate is locked and song and dance begins as a cover for negotiations. Various goods may be asked of the groom and he willingly obliges to the demands after which he is let into the compound.

===Nigeria===
Generally, there are three types of weddings in Nigeria: traditional weddings, church weddings and court weddings. The civil marriage takes place at a registry, and then the religious ceremony follows. Finally it’s the traditional Nigerian wedding ceremony. Many couples choose to do all three, depending on their financial situation. Nigerian weddings are normally characterised by lots of colours.

In traditional weddings, customs vary slightly from one part of Nigeria to the other. In Western parts it is called the engagement ceremony. Officials and elders sip wine while they invite the couple in for introductions and negotiations, and presentation of the bride price which consists mainly of gifts of shoes, textiles, jewelry and bags.

In Eastern parts of the country it is very much the same. Elders from both families retreat into an inner room to negotiate on the bride price. When concluded, the gifts are then presented to the bride's family. After this, the bride, along with her entourage of girls is presented to the husband, family and guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldweddingtraditions.net/nigerian-wedding-traditions/|title=Nigerian wedding traditions {{!}} World Wedding Traditions|last=|first=|date=|website=www.worldweddingtraditions.net|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pygmy wedding traditions===
[[Pygmies#Africa|Pygmy]] engagements were not long and usually formalized by an exchange of visits between the families concerned. The groom to be would bring a gift of game or maybe a few arrows to his new in-laws, take his bride home to live in his band and with his new parents. His only obligation is to find among his relatives a girl willing to marry a brother or male cousin of his wife. If he feels he can feed more than one wife, he may have additional wives.

===Arabic customs===
{{Main article|Arabic wedding}}
{{See also|Etiquette in Canada and the United States#Weddings|Ceremonial clothing in Western cultures#Marriage|Weddings in the United States}}
Although [[Christian]] weddings in the [[Arab World]] bear similarities to Western weddings, [[Muslim]] weddings in the Arab countries are influenced by [[Islamic culture|Muslim traditions]]. Muslim weddings start with a [[Sheikh]] and [[Islamic holy books|Al-kitaab]] (book) for the bride and groom. A wedding is not [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamically valid]] unless both bride and groom are willing, and the groom is often encouraged to visit her before the wedding (as advised in many ''[[Hadith|aḥadīth]]'' of the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]]). However, these visits must be [[chaperone (social)|chaperone]]d to ensure purity of action between the two.
It's the custom that the groom and his family pay for all the wedding expenses. The Bride's family gather together before the wedding in the Bride's parents house. The Groom's family come and take the Bride from the house in a decorated car along with the one bride's mate which usually is the bride's sister, cousin, or best friend. The rest of the family and close friends follow in their cars, honking the car's horns. The reception is usually for all the family and friends  usually with a meal and cake. Candy covered almonds is a traditional giveaway from the couple. There is a lot of dancing and (zaghareet)Ululation. The Muslims tradition is to have Men in one side and women in another so the ladies can take their head cover off. But in non-Muslim traditions the whole wedding is for both sexes.

===Iranian customs===
{{Main article|Persian marriage}}
Persian wedding tradition, despite its local and regional variations, like many other rituals in [[Persia]] goes back to the ancient [[Zoroastrian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/culture/articles/iranian_marriage_ceremony.php|title=Culture of Iran: Iranian Marriage Ceremony, Its History &amp; Symbolism|website=www.iranchamber.com|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the concepts and theory of the marriage have changed drastically by [[Islamic]] traditions, the actual ceremonies have remained more or less the same as they were originally in the ancient Zoroastrian culture.

==European customs==

===English customs===
[[Image:wedding.carriage.bristol.arp.jpg|thumb|A wedding carriage in [[Bristol]], [[England]]]]
The [[Western culture|Western]] custom of a bride wearing a [[White wedding#History and traditions|white wedding dress]] came to symbolize purity, not virginity, in the Victorian era. Within the "white wedding" tradition, a white dress and veil is not considered appropriate in the second or subsequent wedding of a widow or divorcee. The specific conventions of Western weddings, largely from a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] viewpoint, are discussed at "[[white wedding]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British wedding traditions to know before the royal wedding |url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/british-wedding-traditions-prince-harry-meghan-markles-royal/story?id=53799693 |accessdate=July 8, 2018 |work=ABC News |date=May 19, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wedding is often followed or accompanied by a wedding reception, which in some areas may be known as the 'Wedding Breakfast', at which an elaborate [[wedding cake]] is served. Western traditions include [[toast (honor)|toast]]ing the couple, the newlyweds having the [[first dance]], and cutting the cake. A bride may throw her [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]] to the assembled group of all unmarried women in attendance, with folklore suggesting the person who catches it will be the next to wed. A fairly recent equivalent has the groom throwing the bride's [[Garter (stockings)|garter]] to the assembled unmarried men; the man who catches it is supposedly the next to wed.

The Wedding Breakfast is one occasion where every member of the family who has had at least some role in the wedding is present. It is also important as the first time the newly married bride and groom share their first meal together as a lawfully wedded couple.  The modern Wedding Breakfast includes the service of food to guests that can range from traditional roasts, buffets, or regional treats such as in the case of a London Wedding&lt;ref&gt;London Wedding {{cite web |url=http://www.veilandtrain.com/uncategorized/how-can-i-have-a-real-east-end-wedding/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918094841/http://www.veilandtrain.com/uncategorized/how-can-i-have-a-real-east-end-wedding/ |archivedate=2012-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 'East End'.

Another Victorian tradition is for brides to wear or carry "[[Something old|something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue]]" during the service. It is considered good luck to do so. Often the bride attempts to have one item that meets all of these qualifications, such as a borrowed blue handkerchief which is "new to her" but loaned by her grandmother (thus making it old). Another addition to this custom is to wear a coin in one's shoe to bring prosperity.

The full text of the verse is:

:''Something borrowed, something blue,
:''And silver sixpence in your shoe.''&lt;ref&gt;Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.155. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0-684-80164-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scottish customs===
{{Main article|Marriage in Scotland}}
[[File:Scotland Wedding.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Scottish Wedding]]
[[Scotland]] is a popular place for young English couples to get married since, in Scotland, parents' permission is not required if both the bride and groom are old enough to legally be married (16). In [[England]] it was the case that if either was 16 or 17 then the permission of parents had to be sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotlandinfo.eu/getting-married-in-scotland/|title=Getting Married in Scotland|date=2015-02-27|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Scotland, and especially the [[blacksmith]]'s at [[Gretna Green]], became a very popular place for couples to [[Elopement (marriage)|elope]] to, especially those under 18 and usually living in England. Gretna Green now hosts hundreds of weddings a year and is Scotland's third most popular tourist attraction.

*The bride's family sends invitations on behalf of the couple to the wedding guests, addressed by hand. The couple may send the invitations themselves, especially if they are more middle-aged. The invitations are usually sent no later than 6 weeks before the wedding and will specify if the invitation is for ceremony and/or reception and/or evening following the meal at the reception. It has become more common in recent times for Save The Date Cards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lifestyle.howstuffworks.com/weddings/planning/wedding-stationery/save-the-date-cards.htm|title=Save-the-Date Cards: Optional or Necessary?|date=2010-09-28|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be used to notify invitees further in advance to allow sufficient notice for arrangements to be made to ensure attendance. These can be sent up to 6 months before the wedding day.
*Guests send or deliver wedding [[gift]]s to the bride's family home before the wedding day. Alternatively, the couple may register at a department store and have a list of gifts there. The shop then organizes delivery, usually to the bride's parents' house or to the reception venue.
*A wedding ceremony takes place at a [[Church (building)|church]], [[register office]] or possibly another favorite location, such as a hilltop. In this regard Scotland differs significantly from England where only pre-approved public locations may be used for the wedding ceremony. Most ceremonies take place mid afternoon and last about half an hour during which the marriage schedule is signed by the couple and two witnesses, usually the best man and chief bridesmaid.
*The newly wed couple often leave the ceremony to the sound of [[bagpipes]].
*There is a wedding reception following the ceremony, usually at a different venue.
*The bridal party, or members of it, always including the bride and groom, lines up in a receiving line and the wedding guests file past, introducing themselves.
*Usually a beverage is served while the guests and bridal party mingle. In some cases the drink may be [[whisky]] or [[wine]] with a non alcoholic alternative.
*The best man and bride's father toast the bride and groom with personal thoughts, stories, and well-wishes, usually humorous. The groom then follows with a response on behalf of his bride. [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] is usually provided for the toast.
*There is nearly always dancing following the meal, with the style of music being selected by the couple to suit their preference. Often in Scotland this takes the form of a [[céilidh]], a night of [[Scottish country dance|Scottish country dancing]] in couples and groups (sets) to live [[Music of Scotland|traditional music]]. This may be performed by a specialist céilidh band, though many non-specialist bands will also incorporate some traditional céilidh dances in their repertoire along with a range of music of all styles to suit tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulseband.co.uk/setlist/|title=Setlist - Pulse Wedding Band Glasgow &amp; Ayrshire|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The first dance is led by the bride and groom, followed by the rest of the bridal party and finally the guests.
*The cake-cutting ceremony takes place; the bride and groom jointly hold a cake cutter and cut the first pieces of the wedding cake.
*Gifts are not opened at the reception; they are either opened ahead of time and sometimes displayed at the reception, or if guests could not deliver gifts ahead of time, they are placed on a table at the reception for the bride and groom to take home with them and open later.
*A sprig of white [[Calluna|heather]] is usually worn as a buttonhole for good luck.
*It is the norm for the groom and much of the male [[bridal party]] and guests to wear kilts, although suits are also worn. Kilts and [[Scottish dress|Highland dress]] are often rented for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/highland-dress/scottish-weddings/|title=Scottish Weddings {{!}} Scottish Tartans Authority|website=www.tartansauthority.com|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celtic Handfasting===
{{Main article|Handfasting (Neopaganism)}}
[[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|Handfasting]] is a wedding ritual in which the bride's and groom's hands are tied together. It is said to be based on an ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] tradition and to have inspired the phrase "tying the knot". "Handfasting" is favoured by practitioners of Celtic-based religions and spiritual traditions, such as [[Wicca]] and [[Druid]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.handfastings.co.uk/handfasting_ceremony.php|title=The Handfasting Ceremony|website=www.handfastings.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish customs===
In [[Finland]], a tradition is for the bride-to-be to go from door to door with a pillowcase, to receive wedding gifts. Often, an older, married man accompanies her, holding an umbrella or parasol over her head to shelter her. This symbolises protecting and sheltering the new bride. On the day of the wedding, the bride may wear a golden crown on her head. At the wedding reception, the Dance of the Crown is performed, where the bridesmaids blindfold the bride and dance around her. The bride then places the crown on the head of one of the bridesmaids, who tradition dictates will be the next to marry. Traditionally, the bride and groom sit next to each other in designated "seats of honour" at the wedding reception. The bride holds in her lap a sieve covered by a shawl, into which monetary gifts are put by the guests. In some weddings, the bride's mother-in-law or godmother will place a china plate on the bride's head, after which the newlyweds will perform the first dance (usually a waltz). When the plate falls and breaks, the guests collect the pieces. The number of pieces determines how many children the couple will have.

The last dance in a Finnish wedding is called the weaning waltz. All the female guests dance with the bride and all the male guests dance with the groom, including children. Each guest only dances with the bride or groom for a brief period before moving on. This custom was originally conceived as a test to see how quickly the bride and groom will "forget" each other (i.e. how long they will dance with each other before moving on to a guest).

===French customs===
[[File:Soir de noces dans les Landes (la Roste).jpg|thumb|left|Wedding evening in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]]: Three people bring ''la roste'' (roasted bread soaked in sweet wine) to a couple of newlyweds in bed. Map postally used on July 16, 1914.]]

In [[France]] many couples choose to have two weddings, only civil weddings are legally recognized (due to the concept of [[laïcité]]), they are performed in the town hall by the mayor (or a deputy mayor or another councillor acting on his/her behalf). At least one of the spouses must reside in the town where the ceremony takes place. For people choosing to also have a religious wedding, the religious ceremony can only take place after the civil one, often in the same day. Town halls often offer a more elaborate ceremony for couples who do not wish to marry religiously.

If the two ceremonies take place separately, the civil one will usually include close family and witnesses. Once the civil ceremony is complete, the couple will receive a ''livret de famille'', a booklet where a copy of the [[marriage certificate]] is recorded. This is an official document and, should the couple have children, each child's birth certificate will be recorded in the ''livret de famille'' too. The civil ceremony in France is free of charge.

Traditionally, the wedding guests gathered at the fiancée home and went on procession to the church. The procession were led by the bridegroom and his mother, followed by the bride mother and bridegroom father, the witnesses, grandparents, brothers and sisters with their spouse. At last came the bride and her father followed by the bridesmaids (usually family children).

Nowadays, the guests usually gathered at the town hall or church and the bride and bridegroom enter together, followed by the family and guests.

In some regions, the groom may meet his fiancée at her home on the day of the wedding and escort her to the chapel where the ceremony is being held. As the couple proceeds to the chapel, children will stretch long white ribbons across the road which the bride will cut as she passes.

At the chapel, the bride and groom are seated on two red velvet chairs underneath a silk canopy called a ''carre''.
Laurel leaves may be scattered across their paths when they exit the chapel. Sometimes small coins are also tossed for the children to gather.
[[Image:Weddinghattonchatel.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[France|French]] wedding celebration at [[Château de Hattonchâtel]]]]
At the reception, the couple customarily uses a toasting cup called a ''Coupe de Mariage''. The origin of giving this toast began in France, when a small piece of toast was literally dropped into the couple's wine to ensure a healthy life. The couple would lift their glass to "a toast", as is common in Western culture today.

In south west France it is customary to serve spit roast wild boar (or sanglier in French) as the wedding breakfast, a local delicacy.

Some couples choose to serve a ''[[croquembouche]]'' instead of a wedding cake. This dessert is a pyramid of crème-filled pastry puffs, drizzled with a caramel glaze.

At more boisterous weddings, tradition involves continuing the celebration until very late at night. In many regions of France, wedding rituals continue late into the night after the official ceremonies and party. In some regions after the reception, those invited to the wedding will gather outside the newlyweds' window and bang pots and pans; this is called a 'charivari'. They are then invited into the house for some more drinks in the couple's honor, after which the couple is finally allowed to be alone for their first night together as husband and wife.

In the rural Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, a post-wedding ritual called ''la rôtie'' involves a gang of unmarried men and women finding the bride and groom who have escaped from the reception, tipping them out of their bed, and serving them a concoction of champagne and chocolate served in a chamber pot, which will be passed around and drank by everyone. Afterwards, the whole group will enjoy an onion soup. The heavily scatological and sexual implications and off-putting appearance of this ritual is supposed to symbolize the day-to-day intimacy of married life, deeply connected to the rural nature of the area. L''a rôtie'' is an alternative ceremony outside the official ceremonies that the youth can be involved in, and create humor by making something that "tastes good but is in bad taste". The commensal quality of the ritual is a symbol for the bridge between youth and adulthood that the couple becomes in marriage, as well as the community's involvement in the new couple's married life.&lt;ref&gt;Reed-Danahay, Deborah. “Champagne and Chocolate: ‘Taste’ and Inversion in a French Wedding Ritual.” ''American Anthropologist'', vol. 98, no. 4, 1996, pp. 750–761. ''New Series'', www.jstor.org/stable/681883.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rituals are widespread across rural France, though perhaps with different foods and containers.

===German customs===
Mostly it is the good friends who kidnap the bride. Here, the kidnappers go with her from bar to bar, the best man of the bride (or her father) or the groom have to pay the bill every time.  The kidnappers go to a certain place, such as a public building, and leave a few pointers to help for searching. The exemption may be associated with a task for the groom, for example an artistic performance or wash the dishes for the next few weeks.

In Austria and Bavaria (preferably at country weddings), it is now customary to sing a derisive song before the freeing of the bride.

In Lower Austria it is customary for the masked men and the bride to go to the nearest coffee bar or tavern to drink, sing and to wait for the groom to come. In most areas of Austria it is the best man, sometimes the groom or the bride's father (rarely the best man) that pays the price of the kidnappers.

This ordinariness is due to the supposed 'right of the first night' (German 'Recht der ersten Nacht', French 'droit du seigneur') in the Middle Ages. According to myth the clergy and nobility in the Middle Ages had the right to deflower their female subordinates in their wedding night. Back then the brides was retrieved (kidnapped) from the vassals of the government from their Weddings. The historiography sees this right rather as a literary fiction.

In Bavaria and Western Austria another tradition is to wake up the bride early in the morning with a gun shoot or firecrackers on wedding day. Friends and neighbours meet at dawn at the brides house to "greet" her on her special day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wedding customs in Austria |url=https://www.virtualvienna.net/wedding-customs-austria/|publisher=Virtual Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek customs===
{{Main article|Marriage in the Eastern Orthodox Church}}
[[File:Greek Wedding Photography Money Dance.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of the traditional 'Money Dance' at a Greek wedding.]]
Two or three days before the wedding, the couple organizes a celebration called ''Krevati'' (Greek for [[bed]]) in their new home. In Krevati, friends and relatives of the couple put money and young children on the couple's new bed for prosperity and fertility in their life. After the custom, they usually have a party with food and music.

On the day of the wedding, usually Saturday, but also Friday or Sunday, the groom cannot see the bride until the wedding ceremony. The groom usually arrives first in church and waits for bride, who usually arrives late. After they exchange flower bouquets, they have the wedding ceremony, where the best man puts the [[wedding ring]]s and crowns on the couple. The couple drink red wine from the same glass (between one and three sips, depending on the tradition). This is not "communion" in the formal religious sense, but about sharing the cup of life. At the end of the wedding ceremony, as the newly wedded pair leave the church, the guests throw rice and flowers for fertility and felicity. Special guests, such as close friends and family receive sugar-coated almonds (traditionally an odd number, usually seven but sometimes five) as a gift from the couple. Most Greek ceremonies are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]].

After the ceremony, usually the couple hold a great wedding party in some place with plenty of food, drinks, music and dance, usually until next morning. The wedding party starts with the invited people waiting for the couple, who usually come after some time. They start the dancing and eventually eat a piece of their wedding cake. At some point during the party, they also dance the traditional [[zeibekiko]] (groom) and [[çiftetelli]] (bride).

In many places of [[Greece]], where they hold a more traditional wedding, they usually play only [[Music of Greece|traditional music]] and eat [[Greek cuisine|local food]]. For example, in the region of [[Cyclades]], they eat the traditional [[pasteli]] (solid honey with sesame) and in the region of [[Crete]] they cook rice with goat. In most traditional weddings, they bake whole animals like pigs, goats or sheep just like the [[Easter]] celebration. Before the church ceremony, especially in smaller areas, usually friends and relatives of the bride and the groom, accompanies them separately to the church playing traditional instruments, according to the region.

A typical Greek wedding will usually have more than 100 invited people (but usually 250-500) who are friends, siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts, first or second cousins, neighbors and colleagues. It is common to have guests whom the couple has never met before. This is because the people who will be invited are usually determined by the parents of the couple and not by the couple themselves. Traditionally, the whole village would have attended the wedding, so very often the parents invite friends of theirs and their children, to the weddings of their own children.

There are many other traditions which are local to their regional areas. One famous tradition is the pinning of money on the bride's dress. This custom originated in one part of Greece, where it is a substitute for wedding presents, however it has become more widespread recently.

===Italian customs===
In some parts of [[Italy]], a party, known as a Serenade, is thrown outside of the bride's home by the groom. His family and friends come and wait for the bride, entertaining themselves until she appears. The groom then sings to his bride to further seduce her. Once his song is sung, the party ends.

The day of the wedding, the [[Wedding ceremony participants#Groomsmen|groomsmen]] try their hardest to make the groom as uncomfortable as possible by saying things like "Maybe she forgot where the church is".

It is also traditional for the grooms family to give a [[dowry]] to the bride and to provide the [[engagement ring]]. The bride's family is then responsible for receiving the guests of the wedding in their home for a reception afterward.

The color green is very important in the Italian wedding. In Italy, the tradition of something blue is replaced with something green. This color brings good luck to the married couple. The veil and [[bridesmaids]] also were important in an Italian wedding. The tradition began in [[Ancient Rome]] when the veil was used to hide the bride from any spirits that would corrupt her and the bridesmaids were to wear similar outfits so that the evil spirits were further confused.

An old Roman custom was that brides threw nuts at rejected suitors as they left the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.152. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0-684-80164-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After dessert, more dancing commences, gifts are given, and the guests eventually begin to leave. In [[Southern Italy]], as the guests leave, they hand envelopes of money to the bride and groom, who return the gift with a [[Wedding favors|wedding favor]] or [[bomboniere]], a small token of appreciation.

===Polish customs===
In [[Poland|Polish]] weddings, the celebrations may continue for two or three days. In the past, the engagement ceremony was organized by the future groom as a formal family gathering, during which he asked his chosen lady to marry him. In the recent years this custom has changed and today an engagement is much more personal and intimate. An elegant dinner party afterward is still a nice way to inform the closest family members about the couples' decision to get married.

In some regions of Poland, the tradition to invite the wedding guests in person is still upheld. Many young couples, accompanied by the parents, visit their family and friends to hand them the wedding invitations personally.

According to the old tradition, a groom arrives with his parents at the house of a bride just before the wedding ceremony. At that time, both parents and parents-in-law give a young couple their blessing. The couple enter the church together and walks up to the altar followed by two witnesses and the parents. In Poland, it is quite unusual for the bride to be walked down the aisle or to have bridesmaids and groomsmen in a wedding. The couple is assisted by two witnesses, a man (usually grooms' side) and a woman (usually brides' side) who are either family members or close friends.

The Polish bride traditionally wears a white dress and a veil. The groom, on the other hand, usually wears a fitted suit with a bow tie and a [[boutonnière]] that matches the brides' bouquet. During the ceremony, wedding rings are exchanged and both the husband and wife wear them on their right hand. Right after the ceremony, the closest family and all the guest form a line in the front of the church to congratulate the newlyweds and wish them love and happiness. As soon as the married couple leave the church they get showered with rice for luck or guests drop coins at their feet for them to pick up. This is done to ensure a good and prosperous future for the newlyweds.

Once all the guests have showered the couple with kisses, hugs and flowers everyone heads to the reception. It is a custom in Poland to prepare "passing gates" on the way to the reception for the newlyweds who, in order to pass, have to give the "gate keepers" some vodka. This is a misinterpretation of an earlier tradition, where the "passing gates" were built if the bride was an orphan and money collected by "gate keepers" from the guests was handed over to the bride as her dowry (being an orphan usually implied poverty).

The married couple is welcomed at the reception place by the parents with bread and salt. The bread symbolizes the prosperity, salt stands for hardship of life, the parents wish the young couple that they never go hungry and learn how to deal with every day hardships together. The wedding party lasts (and the bride and groom remain) until the last guest leaves, usually until morning.

In Poland, movements like [[Human Liberties Crusade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KWC |url=http://www.kwc.oaza.org.pl/dokument.php?id=224 |title=Krucjata Wyzwolenia Człowieka |publisher=Kwc.oaza.org.pl |date= |accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=elamelka |url=http://www.spontana.fora.pl/diakonia-wyzwolenia,44/wesela-bezalkoholowe-gazeta-wyborcza-o-kulturze-niepicia,505.html |title=Lepiej łyknij wody [Gazeta Wyborcza - DUżY FORMAT&amp;#93; Witold Szabłowski |publisher=Spontana.fora.pl |date= |accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Wedding of the Weddings]] promote non-alcoholic wedding celebrations.

===Romanian customs===
[[Lăutari]] are [[Romania]]n musicians performing traditional songs. The music of the lăutari establishes the structure of the elaborate Romanian  weddings. The lăutari also function as guides through the wedding rituals and moderate any conflicts that may arise during what can be a long, alcohol-fueled party. Over a period of nearly 48 hours, this can be very physically strenuous.

Following custom almost certainly dating back at least to the [[Middle Ages]], most lăutari spend the fees from these wedding ceremonies on extended [[banquet]]s for their friends and families over the days immediately following the wedding.

The wedding begins at the Town hall where the couple literally gets married in the presence of their closest friends and relatives. After that, they go to the bride's house where the Lăutari come and sing themed songs like "Ia-ți mireasă ziua bună" (Say goodbye, bride) while the bride, the groom and the couple's parents take part in a symbolic preparation for the wedding (the best man and the best maid put a flower on their chests, arrange the groom's tie and shaves him and put the bride's veil, all in front of a big mirror decorated with pieces of veil and white flowers, mirror that separates the bride from the groom). They then go to the church where the religious ceremony is performed. Afterwords they go to a restaurant where the banquet begins.

The newlyweds meet the guests at the entrance and they serve a glass of champagne while the Lautari sing the "Marș de intampinare" (meeting march). After all the guests have arrived, the couple breaks the ice and starts dancing a waltz. Later on, the chefs do "Dansul găinii" (the chicken dance: they dress up a roasted chicken and decorate it and they dance with it while the best man negotiate the chicken's price with them).

Another tradition is [[bride kidnapping]]. A few friends of the newlywed stake the bride while the groom is not paying attention and take her somewhere else, usually to a club. The groom is then forced to negotiate the bride's price and to redeem it, but not until the "criminals" show evidence of having the bride ( a shoe, her necklace, etc.). Usually, the "thieves" ask for beverage. They then take the bride back to the wedding and as a punishment they are forced to dance a waltz with the bride lifted up.

It is normal to wish the bride and groom "Casa de Piatra" (Stone house) which symbolizes a solid marriage.

===Russian customs===
{{Main article|Russian wedding}}
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
A traditional [[Russia]]n wedding lasts for at least two days and some weddings last as long as a week. Throughout the celebration there is dancing, singing, long toasts, and food and drinks. The best man and maid of honor are called witnesses, "svideteli" in Russian. The ceremony and the ring exchange takes place on the first day of the wedding.

Throughout the years, Russian weddings have adopted many western customs, including bridesmaids and flower girls.
During the wedding feast any of the guests can start chanting "Gor'ko" ("bitter") which usually is immediately supported by the rest of the guests. In this case bride and groom should kiss each other and the kiss should last for as long as the chanting continues. It's customary for the bride to eat a spoonful of sour cream on your wedding day.

===Swedish customs===
In a Swedish church wedding, the priest generally doesn't say when the couple may kiss each other, in contrast to Anglo-Saxon traditions. It is probably because the kiss doesn't traditionally belong to Swedish wedding customs, but has relatively recently been associated with marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brollopstorget.se/Forberedelser/1.1027104-vigselakten brollopstorget.se &gt; vigselakten (the wedding ceremony)] Cite: ''I Sverige säger vanligvis inte prästen till när paret får kyssa varandra vilket de gör i de anglosaxiska länderna. Antagligen är det för att kyssen egentligen inte är tillhör svensk vigseltradition, men numera är det så starkt förknippat med vigseln att den svenska traditionen får stå åt sidan.'' Retrieved on March 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In Swedish weddings, the bride and groom usually go down the aisle together, rather than the bride being escorted by her father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brollopstorget.se/Forberedelser/1.1027104-vigselakten brollopstorget.se &gt; vigselakten (the wedding ceremony)] Cite: ''Det vanligaste nuförtiden i Sverige är att brud och brudgum går in i kyrkan tillsammans.'' Retrieved on Mars 22, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The symbolism is that of a free man and a free woman voluntarily uniting in marriage.

It is custom in Sweden that instead of guests bringing gifts for the bride and groom, they will pay for the dinner and drinks in order to help pay for the cost of the wedding.  An older tradition is that the bride's parents will give her one gold and one silver coin, which she puts in her shoe.   &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swedishfreak.com/2015/10-awesome-swedish-wedding-traditions/|title=10 Awesome Wedding Traditions in Sweden|last=|first=|date=July 2015|website=Swedish Freak|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725015301/https://www.swedishfreak.com/2015/10%2Dawesome%2Dswedish%2Dwedding%2Dtraditions/|archive-date=2015-07-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, instead of getting two wedding rings, the tradition is to get three.  One for the engagement, one for the marriage, and then one when the couple has their first child. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-customs-and-traditions-from-around-the-globe|title=Wedding Customs and Traditions from Around the Globe|last=|first=|date=|website=The Knot|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the United States, it is also customary have a simple wedding party, consisting of one or two bride's maid and one groom's man. Lastly, at the wedding party the couple is placed at the head of a U shaped table instead of a separate head table for the bridal party.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://somethingswedish.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/swedish-wedding-svenskt-brollop/|title=Swedish Wedding Svenskt Brollop|last=|first=|date=|website=Something Swedish|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albanian customs===
[[File:Apollonia (Albania)3.JPG|thumb|left|A couple posing in ancient site of Apollonia, Albania]]

In Albanian traditional weddings, the dress of the Muslim bride is characterized by its elegance and transparency, in that of the Catholic one can see full colors. The Catholic bride's dress is characterized by its picturesque effects and harmony.

There are two types of Muslim wedding dresses. One is worked on a "shajak" (large piece of wool) and with floral motives worked with "gajtan" (kind of rope) black cotton, sometimes mixed with green. The other one is worked in the same material but with red color. Different from the first here the motifs are enriched with full colors. These dresses have a belt worked with gold and grain necklaces in red, rose, orange creating all together a warm surface. Here the motifs are very small.

This gallery of costumes, richness of colors, sentiments are a big experience of lots of years of a population like the Albanians, not only for the ability to conserve alive the tradition, inheriting it generations after generations, but also for conserving the high technique of elaboration or the high artistic level.

The dress of a Catholic bride from Shkodër is tripped from the transparent white, shiny, soft, which spreads all over the body, and is intended to suggest tranquility and a warm purity. This concept of tradition is achieved through the white of the base material and the gold thread over. This dress is composed by the "barnaveke": some kind of very long pants which seem a skirt. In the upper part is worn a shirt and over it a "jelek" (waistcoat).
[[File:How a wedding looks like.jpg|thumb|Wedding in Kosovo]]
Ritual songs name various elements which contain "paja" (pronounced ''paya'') of the girl, which are the goods parents give to the daughter to wear, to furnish the house, gifts for her husband and the intimate cousins. Elements are typically made by [[weaving]] clothes using [[loom]]s. The preparation of the "paja" for the parents of the bride is a pleasure which means also accomplishing the obligations toward the daughter. This is also an expression of the love of parents, but is connected with the economical conditions of the family.

"Dhunti" in Shkodra means the gifts that the groom prepares for the bride during the engagement, mainly clothes, jewelry, gold ornaments and tricks, which are sent to her a few days before the wedding. In addition to those received by the family of his father, the bride takes many gifts from the groom and his family. "Dhuntia", which had a considerable monetary value, was prepared with great care by the family of the boy, because in some way embodied respect and love for his young bride, to whom these gifts were made, love for their son that he married at the same time was also a representation of the family in its economic and aesthetic. In "dhunti" there were enough clothes and items for use at all times, in joy and in sorrow, which expressed particular attention to the role of women.

''See: [[Bengali Hindu wedding]] and [[Bengali Muslim wedding]]''

Bengali wedding refers to both [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] weddings in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]], India. Although Muslim and Hindu marriages have their distinctive religious rituals, there are many common cultural rituals in marriages across religion among [[Bengali people]].

===Indian wedding customs===
{{Main article|Indian wedding}}

Indian weddings take anywhere from five minutes to several days, depending on region, religion, and a variety of other factors.  Due to the diversity of Indian culture, the wedding style, ceremony and rituals may vary greatly amongst various states, regions, religions and castes. In certain regions, it is quite common that during the traditional wedding days, there would be a ''[[Tilaka|tilak]]'' ceremony (where the groom is anointed on his forehead), a ceremony for adorning the bride's hand and feet with [[henna]] (called ''mehendi'') accompanied by ''Ladies' [[Sangeet (music)|Sangeet]] (music and dance)'', and many other pre-wedding ceremonies. Another important ceremony followed in certain areas is the "Haldi" program where the bride and the groom are anointed with turmeric paste. All of the close relatives make sure that they have anointed the couple with turmeric.  In certain regions, on the day of the wedding ''proper'', the Bridegroom, his friends and relatives come singing and dancing to the wedding site in a procession called ''[[baraat]]'', and then the religious rituals take place to solemnize the wedding, according to the religion of the couple. While the groom may wear traditional ''Sherwani'' or ''[[dhoti]]'' or Western suit, or some other local costume, his face, in certain regions, is usually veiled with a mini-curtain of flowers called ''[[sehra (headdress)|sehra]]''. In certain regions, the bride (Hindu or Muslim) always wears red clothes, never white because white symbolizes widowhood in Indian culture. In Southern and Eastern states the bride usually wears a [[Wedding sari|Sari]], but in northern and central states the preferred garment is a decorated Red skirt-blouse and veil called ''[[Choli|lehenga]]''. After the solemnization of marriage, the bride departs with her husband. This is a very sad event for the bride's relatives because traditionally she is supposed to permanently "break-off" her relations with her [[Kinship terminology|blood relatives]] to join her husband's family.  Among [[Christians]] in the state of Kerala, the bridegroom departs with the bride's family. The wedding may be followed by a "reception" by the groom's parents at the groom's place. While gifts and money to the couple are commonly given, the traditional ''[[Dowry law in India|dowry]]'' from the bride's parents to the couple is now officially forbidden by law.

===Pakistani wedding customs===
{{Main article|Marriage in Pakistan}}
A [[Pakistan]]i wedding typically consist of four ceremonies on four separate days. It may consist of 3 days if the first function called "[[Mehndi]]" is done in a combined manner by both the bride and groom's family.

On this day, it is customary to wear either green, yellow, orange, or other vibrant colors.

This event is usually held in a reception hall, and the groom comes over with his family and friends; a large feast is given. The bride's friends and relatives are also present, and the Baraat event can be considered the 'main' wedding event as it is the largest one out of all the events. Then there is the holy ceremony of "Nikah" which is performed by a religious ''Pastor'' or ''imam'', after which bride and groom are declared as husband and wife.The Next day there is a function of "[[Walima]]" in which the groom's family is the host and the bride's family come over for a big feast.

On her wedding day, the bride-to-be can wear any color she wants, but vibrant colors and lots of traditional gold jewelry are typically worn. It is customary for the bride to wear traditional clothes such as a ''lahnga'', ''shalwar kameez'', or ''sari''. These weddings are also typical of the [[Islam in India|Muslim community in India]].

===Sri Lankan wedding customs===

===Chinese wedding customs===
{{Main article|Chinese marriage|Southern Chinese wedding}}
[[File:Chinese Restaurant Wedding Reception.jpg|thumb|Decorations at a traditional [[China|Chinese]] wedding banquet]]
Traditional Chinese marriage is a ceremonial ritual within Chinese societies that involve a marriage established by [[Arranged marriage|pre-arrangement between families]]. Within the traditional [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]], romantic love was allowed, and [[monogamy]] was the norm for most ordinary citizens. A band of musicians with gongs and double-reed instruments accompanies the bridal parade to the groom's home. Similar music is also played at the wedding banquet. Depending on the region from which the bride hails, Chinese weddings will have different traditions such as the [[Chinese tea culture|Tea Ceremony]] or the use of a wedding emcee. Also, in modern times, Chinese couples will often go to [[photo studio]]s to take "glamour shots," posing in multiple gowns and various backgrounds.

Most regional Chinese wedding rituals follow the main Chinese wedding traditions, although some rituals are particular to the peoples of the southern China region. In most southern Chinese weddings, the bride price is based on the groom's economic status. The idea of "selling the daughter" or bride is not a phrase that is used often. Therefore, the price of the bride does not tend to be too demanding. Most of the time, the bride price is in the form of gold jewelry, fine fabric, money, or even a roast pig, which symbolizes that the bride is a virgin. Wedding presents are given by elderly couples or couples that are older than the newlyweds, while tea is served by the younger family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How marriage customs have rung the changes |url=http://www.ecns.cn/news/culture/2018-06-21/detail-ifyvmiee7351816.shtml |accessdate=July 8, 2018 |work=www.ecns.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese wedding customs===
{{Main article|Japanese wedding}}
Japanese customs fall into two categories: traditional [[Shinto]] ceremonies, and modern [[Western-style weddings in Japan|Western-style ceremonies]]. In either case, the couple must first be legally married by filing for marriage at their local government office, and the official documentation must be produced in order for the ceremony to be held.

====Traditional customs====
Before ever getting married there are two types of mate selection that may occur with the couple: (1) ''[[Omiai|miai]]'', or an arranged marriage and (2) ''ren ai'', or a love match.&lt;ref&gt;Kinko, Ito (March 9, 2000) Modern japan through its weddings: gender, person, and society in ritual portrayal. Blackwell Publishing, 29, Retrieved January 11, 2009, from EBSCOhost&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese bride-to-be may be painted pure white from head to toe, visibly declaring her maiden status to the gods. Two choices of headgear exist. One, the ''watabōshi'', is a white hood; the other, called the ''[[tsunokakushi]]'', serves to hide the bride's 'horns of jealousy.' It also symbolizes the bride's intention to become a gentle and obedient wife.

[[Image:MeijiShrineWedding.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[Japan]]ese wedding ceremony]]
Traditional [[Japanese people|Japanese]] wedding customs (shinzen shiki) involve an elaborate ceremony held at a [[Shinto shrine]]. Japanese weddings are being increasingly extravagant with all the elaborate details placed into thought. However, in some cases, younger generations choose to abandon the formal ways by having a "no host party" for a wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Lebra, T, Sugiyama (1984). Japanese women: constraint and fulfillment. Honolulu University of Hawaii Press, Retrieved January 10, 2009, from NetLibrary&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, the guests include mainly of the couple's friends who pay an attendance fee.

====Western-style customs====
In recent years, the "Western Style Wedding" (influenced by Christian weddings) has become the choice of most couples in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seiyaku.com/seiyaku/en/western-wedding.html |title=Western Style Weddings in Japan |publisher=Seiyaku.com |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An industry has sprung up, dedicated to providing couples with a ceremony modeled after church rituals. Japanese western style weddings are generally held in a chapel, either in a simple or elaborate ceremony, often at a dedicated [[wedding chapel]] within a hotel.

Before the ceremony, there is a rehearsal. Often during this rehearsal, the bride's mother lowers the veil for her daughter, signifying the last act that a mother can do for her daughter, before "giving her away". The father of the bride, much like in Western ceremonies, walks the bride down the aisle to her awaiting groom.

After the rehearsal comes the procession. The wedding celebrant will often wear a wedding cross, or cana, a cross with two interlocking wedding rings attached, which symbolize a couple's commitment to sharing a life together in the bonds of holy matrimony. The wedding celebrant gives a brief welcome and an introductory speech before announcing the bride's entrance. The procession ends with the groom bowing to the bride's father. The father bows in return.

The service then starts. The service is given either in Japanese, English or quite often, a mix of both. It follows Protestant ceremony, relaxed and not overtly religious. Typically part of [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 13 is read from the [[Bible]]. After the reading, there is a prayer and a short message, explaining the sanctity of the wedding vows (''seiyaku''). The bride and groom share their vows and exchange rings. The chapel register is signed and the new couple is announced. This is often followed by the traditional [[Kissing traditions#Wedding kiss|wedding kiss]]. The service can conclude with another hymn and a benediction.

With the two types of ceremonies, Shinto and Western, available it was bound for the two to be combined into what is called a contemporary Japanese wedding. Contemporary Japanese weddings are celebrated in many ways. On the beginning of the wedding day, the participants are to get ready at the parlor's beauty shop. The responsibility of the beauty shop is to dress the bride, the groom, and the other participants in the formal Japanese attire. Dressing the bride is an important task because the bride is to change into several outfits throughout her wedding day. Due to the complexity of the design, dressing a bride can be difficult and time consuming and for this reason the bride must be the first person to arrive two hours prior to the wedding ceremony. The bride's attire consists of an extravagant kimono, heavy make-up, a wig, and a head covering. An hour prior to the wedding ceremony, the guests and the groom should start to arrive.&lt;ref name = GG&gt;Goldstein-Gidoni, O (2000, March). The production of tradition and culture in the japanese wedding enterprise. Taylor &amp; Francis, 65, Retrieved January 10, 2009, from EBSCOhost&lt;/ref&gt;

When everyone is dressed in their formal attire, the bride and the groom are to separate from each other and meet their close relatives in a waiting room. The relatives present will appear in the family photo and will also attend the religious ceremony. During this gathering, the kaizoe (assistant) will inform the participants of what will take place and what they should do during the day since they are not familiar with the ceremony.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

When all is understood, the relatives and participants are brought to the photo studio where the professional photographs are to be taken. Taking the photographs of the bride, the groom, and their relatives is considered to be the central part of the wedding day. The photographs of the couple and their family are designed to represent the couple's prospective future together.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

After the lengthy photo session, the bride, the groom, and others are brought to the Shinto shrine. Nowadays, the Shinto shrine may be conveniently located inside a hotel where all the activities will take place. A Shinto priest conducts the ceremony. In the ceremony, the bride and the groom are purified. However, the ceremony's important event occurs when the bride and the groom exchange nuptial cups of ''[[sake]]'' also known as ''san-san-ku-do''. With the addition of Western tradition, the exchange of rings and weddings vows also take place. Those guests who did not attend the religious ceremony are able to view the ceremony on video screens located in the lobby.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

Like Western-style traditions, a reception takes place right after the wedding ceremony. The guests of the reception include family members, friends, and colleagues. Due to the wedding industry's attempt to maximize time and space, the reception will last exactly two hours. The reception does not include any random activities, but follows a strict order of events. The reception includes dramatic entrances by the bride and the groom with special effects, speeches, and other performances.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

Throughout the reception, the bride shall receive the guests' utmost attention because she changes two to three times for the dramatic entrances. With all the dramatic entrances, the groom will join the bride. For example, the first entrance includes the bride, the groom, and the ''nakodo'' couple. ''Nakodo'' means a "matchmaker" or a "go-between", which is usually referred to the husband. The ''nakodo'' couple plays such an important role that their names appear on the announcement of the wedding. The purpose of the ''nakodo'' is to symbolize a stable marriage. As the two couples appear a special effect of a cloud of white smoke will appear to surround them. Simultaneously, the hall lights are dimmed and the stage lighting will turn to the color of rose-pink; this astonishes the guests. Pictures are to be taken during the dramatic entrances of the bride and the groom. After the photographs have been taken, they will be led back to their table.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

At this point the [[Master of Ceremonies]] will congratulate the newlyweds and their family. He/she will then introduce the ''nakodo'', who will start the opening speeches and more speeches will follow. Being that the reception is highly structured the speakers will have the idea of being formal and concise in mind. With all the speeches finished, the bride and the groom will perform the Western-style traditions, which include the following: (1) the cake cutting ceremony and (2) the newlyweds' first dance as husband and wife.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

The next part of the reception is the toast, or ''kanpai'', which simplifies the mood of the reception where the guests can start to relax, eat, and drink. What follows the toast are the short congratulatory speeches made by relatives, friends, and colleagues. During this time, the bride has gone to change into her first costume and continues throughout the reception. However, the groom will also have a chance to change into his costume, which is the Western tuxedo. By the end of the night, both the bride and the groom have changed from their traditional Japanese attire to their Western-style attire.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

After their last change of costumes, the newlyweds will perform the candle service. Both will have a long, unlit candle, which will be lit from the table where their parents are seated. Next, the couple will walk around the room in a circle and light the candles placed on their guests' table. Once all the candles are lit, the newlyweds will return to their table where they will light what is called the Memorial Candle.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

By the time the candle service is done the two hours restriction will soon expire. The remaining few minutes includes short speeches, songs, dances, etc. As the reception ends a flower presentation ceremony will take place, which is where the newlyweds will present their parents with a gift of flowers to display appreciation for their parents raising them to the people they are today. At this point, the reception has ended with quick flashes and farewells.

The groom usually wears the [[Barong Tagalog]] during the wedding, along with the male attendants, though nowadays the wealthy opt to don Western attire such as a tuxedo. Weddings held within the same year by two siblings, usually sisters, called ''Sukob'' are frowned upon as it is regarded as bad luck. Some hold it that the wedding rings dropping to the ground is a portent of bad luck (this is usually said to the ring bearer to ensure that the child is careful in handling the rings). Money, in the form of paper bills, is sometimes taped or pinned to the groom and bride's dress during their first dance.

The groom signs the marriage contract and agrees to provide the bride with a ''mas kahwin'' (dowry). After that, their hands are dyed with henna during the berinai besar ceremony.
On the second day, the bride is with her family and friends with musicians and bunga manggar or palm blossom carriers at the bride's house. At the house they are greeted with sprinkling of yellow rice and scented water.

===Minangkabau wedding customs===
[[Image:Minangkabau wedding 2.jpg|thumb|A [[Minangkabau Highlands|Minangkabau]] wedding in [[West Sumatera]], [[Indonesia]] ]]
As a [[matrilineal]] society, the bride family will be the one who proposes to the groom. This tradition is called ''maminang''. If proposal is accepted, they will sign marriage contract. For the ceremony,''manjapuik marapulai '', the bride family will invite the groom, . Then they will  be shown to the public as newly married couple

Most weddings in the [[United States]] follow a similar pattern to an English wedding. It traditionally follows the ''[[white wedding]]'' type (see also ''Wedding types'' below), which originates from the white color of the bride's wedding dress, but refers to an entire wedding routine. Customs and traditions vary, but common components are listed below.
;Before the wedding
*The host sends [[Wedding invitation|invitations]] to the wedding guests, usually one to two months before the wedding. Invitations may most formally be addressed by hand to show the importance and personal meaning of the occasion. Large numbers of invitations may be mechanically reproduced. As [[engraving]] was the highest quality printing technology available in the past, this has become associated with wedding invitation tradition. Receiving an invitation does not impose any obligation on the invitee other than promptly accepting or declining the invitation, and offering congratulations to the couple.&lt;ref name="manners647"&gt;Miss Manners Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p.647, {{ISBN|0-671-72228-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*While giving any gift to the newlywed couple is technically optional, nearly all invited guests who attend the wedding choose to do so. Wrapped gifts can be brought to the wedding ceremony or reception, but it's considered thoughtful to have them delivered to the address on the wedding invitation or to the address given with the couple's [[bridal registry]]. Typical gifts are useful household items, such as dishes, silverware, kitchen utensils and appliances, or towels. Guests are not obligated to use the couple's registry information.
*A color scheme is selected by some to match everything from bridesmaids' dresses, flowers, invitations, and decorations, though there is no necessity in doing so.
*The groom's friends throw a party for the groom, called a "[[bachelor party]]". It usually involves alcohol and racy entertainment, as this is supposedly the groom's last chance to engage in debauchery before marriage. It has become increasingly popular for the bride's friends to organize similar "[[bachelorette party|bachelorette]]" parties.
;At the wedding
*A wedding ceremony may take place anywhere, but often a church, [[courthouse]], or outdoor venue is selected. The ceremony may be dictated by the couple's religious practices, or lack thereof. The most common non-religious form is derived from a simple [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] ceremony in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', and can be performed in less than ten minutes, although it is often extended by inserting music or speeches.
*American brides usually wear a white, off-white, silver, or other very light-colored dress, particularly at their first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior: Freshly Updated, Judith Martin, 2007, p. 414, {{ISBN|0-393-05874-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brides may choose any color, although black is strongly discouraged by some as it is the color of mourning in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin, Judith|title=Miss Manners on weddings|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|year=1999|pages=142–143|isbn=0-609-60431-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*White seeds, or confetti is sometimes thrown at the newlyweds as they leave the ceremony to symbolize fertility. Some individuals, churches or communities choose birdseed due to a false but widely believed myth that birds eating the rice will burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/birdrice.asp |title=Against the Grain |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the mess that rice and birdseed make, modern couples often leave in clouds of [[soap bubble|bubbles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Post, Peggy|title=Emily Post's wedding etiquette|publisher=Collins|location=London|year=2006|page=360|isbn=0-06-074504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The wedding party may form a [[receiving line]] at this point, or later at a [[wedding reception]], so that each guest may briefly greet the entire wedding party.
;At the wedding reception
*Drinks, snacks, or perhaps a full meal, especially at long receptions, are served while the guests and wedding party mingle.
*Often, best men and/or maids of honor will toast newlyweds with personal thoughts, stories, and well-wishes; sometimes other guests follow with their own toasts. Champagne is usually provided for this purpose.
*In a symbolic cutting of the wedding cake, the couple may jointly hold a cake knife and cut the first pieces of the wedding cake, which they feed to each other. In some sub-cultures, they may deliberately smear cake on each other's faces, which is considered vulgar elsewhere.&lt;ref name="isbn0-609-60431-7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin, Judith|title=Miss Manners on weddings|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|year=1999|page=22|isbn=0-609-60431-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-393-05874-3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin, Judith|title=Miss Manners' guide to excruciatingly correct behavior|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|location=New York|year=2005|page=419|isbn=0-393-05874-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Post, Peggy|title=Emily Post's wedding etiquette|publisher=Collins|location=London|year=2006|page=344|isbn=0-06-074504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If dancing is offered, the newlyweds first dance together briefly. Sometimes a further protocol is followed, wherein each dances next with a parent, and then possibly with other members of the wedding party. Special songs are chosen by the couple, particularly for a mother/son dance and a father/daughter dance. In some subcultures, a [[Money dance|dollar dance]] takes place in which guests are expected to dance with one of the newlyweds, and give them a small amount of cash. This practice, as is any suggestion that the guests owe money to the couple, is considered rude in most social groups as it is contrary to basic western etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Manners Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the mid-twentieth century it became common for a bride to toss her bouquet over her shoulder to the assembled unmarried women during the reception. The woman who catches it, superstition has it, will be the next to marry. In a similar process, her groom tosses the bride's garter to the unmarried men, followed by the man who caught the garter placing it on the leg of the woman who caught the bouquet. While still common in many circles, these practices (particularly the latter) are falling out of favor in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Manners Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p. 638&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wedding gifts====
The purpose of inviting guests is to have them witness a couple's marriage ceremony and vows and to share in their joy and celebration. Gifts for the wedding couple are optional, although most guests attempt to give at least a token gift of their best wishes. Some couples and families feel that in return for the expense they put into entertaining and feeding their guests, the guests should pay them with similarly expensive gifts or cash.&lt;ref&gt;How much money you should give for a wedding, [http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-to-give-as-wedding-gift-2017-7 "How to figure out how much money you should give for a wedding gift"], ''[[Business Insider]]'', Retrieved 18 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe this is contrary to proper etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Manners Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p.587, {{ISBN|0-671-72228-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple often [[bridal registry|registers for gifts]] at a store well in advance of their wedding. This allows them to create a list of household items, usually including china, silverware and crystalware, linens or other fabrics, pots and pans, ''etc.'' Registries are intended to aid guests in selecting gifts the newlyweds truly want, and the service is sufficiently profitable that most retailers, from luxury shops to discount stores, offer the opportunity. Registry information should, according to etiquette, be provided only to guests upon direct request, and never included in the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior: Freshly Updated, Judith Martin, 2007, p. 435, {{ISBN|0-393-05874-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some couples additionally or instead register with services that enable money gifts intended to [[honeymoon registry|fund items such as a honeymoon]], home purchase or college fund. Some find bridal registries inappropriate as they contravene traditional notions behind gifts, such as that all gifts are optional and delightful surprises personally chosen by the giver, and that registries lead to a type of price-based competition, as the couple knows the cost of each gift. Traditionally, weddings were considered a personal event and inviting people to the wedding who are not known to at least one member of the couple well enough to be able to choose an appropriate gift was considered inappropriate, and registries should therefore be unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Manners Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p.643, {{ISBN|0-671-72228-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether considered appropriate or not, others believe that weddings are opportunities to extract funds or specific gifts from as many people as possible, and that even an invitation carries an expectation of monetary reward rather than merely congratulations.

Letters of thanks for any gift are traditionally sent promptly after the gift's receipt. Tradition allows wedding gifts to be sent up to a year after the wedding date. Thanks should be sent as soon as possible, preferably within two weeks.&lt;ref name="manners647"/&gt;

====African-American customs====
{{Main article|Jumping the broom}}
Jumping the broom developed out of the West African [[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] custom. The broom in [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] and other [[Akan people|Akan]] cultures also held spiritual value and symbolized sweeping away past wrongs or warding off evil spirits. Brooms were waved over the heads of marrying couples to ward off spirits. The couple would often but not always jump over the broom at the end of the ceremony.

The custom took on additional significance in the context of [[slavery in the United States]]. Slaves had no right to legal marriage; slaveholders considered slaves property and feared that legal marriage and family bonds had the potential to lead to organization and revolt. Marriage rituals, however, were important events to the Africans, who came in many cases come from richly ceremonial [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]].

Taking marriage vows in the presence of a [[witness]] and then leaping over the handle of a [[broom]] became the common practice to create a recognized union. Brooms are also symbols of the [[hearth]], the center of the new family being created.

There are also traditions of broom jumping in Europe, in the Wicca and Celtic communities especially.

==South American customs==

===Brazil customs===
The South American country of Brazil features a host of traditions and customs within its culture. For Brazilian brides, these traditions lead to extravagant, fun-filled weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=8 Brazilian Wedding Traditions {{!}} Maximise Hen Weekends {{!}} Hen News |url=https://www.maximise.co.uk/hen-hub/hen-news/8-brazilian-wedding-traditions/ |accessdate=July 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Preparations
*Bridesmaids and groomsmen are chosen months before the time of the wedding. It is tradition for the groom and all men who attend the ceremony to dye their hair blonde signifying purity (similar to how the bride chooses to wear a white dress). Those selected consist of couples paired off at the altar, usually three men and three women for the brides side and more three men and three women for the grooms side. The groom arrives at the wedding ceremony location first. The bride comes to the location, usually a church, at least 10 minutes after the groom’s arrival. The two should not see each other before the ceremony, however, as it is believed this will bring bad luck.
*In a military officer's wedding, the roles of groomsmen are replaced by swordsmen of the sword honor guard. They are usually picked as close personal friends of the groom who have served with him. Their role includes forming the traditional [[saber arch]] for the married couple and guests to walk through.
*Some time before the wedding, usually about one month, either the bride, or her best friends, organizes a "kitchen shower" (wedding shower) with the purpose of giving the bride an intimate reunion with her closest friends.  This party used to be a "girls-only" event, and was usually a small intimate party. Nowadays not only have the parties gotten bigger, but they also have started to admit men to the event.  The person that is invited to this kind of party usually gives the bride something for her kitchen; hence the name "kitchen shower", and not wedding shower.
*The wedding ceremony and party are usually paid by the wife’s family, although this is a tradition that is not always followed, understandably because of the high costs involved.

;Ceremony
*Brazilian wedding ceremonies normally follow Christian traditions closely. The bride and groom recite wedding vows to each other after a prayer is read. Then the bride and groom exchange wedding rings. These rings are usually engraved with the name of the groom on the bride’s ring and the name of the bride on the groom’s ring.
*After the religious ceremony, the newlyweds usually throw a big party were they receive the compliments from all the guests.  The party usually happens in a different place, a private party house that in Brazil is called a "ceremonial."  A lot of singing and dancing goes on usually after the couple dances a Waltz.

;Reception
*Receptions for Brazilian weddings involve food, drinks and music. The married couple gives gifts to their parents, while the parents bestow a number of gifts upon the couple.
*Another unique thing about the weddings in Brazil is a sweet called "bem casado" (well married), which is normally given to the guests on their way out.  It is considered to bring good luck to the couple. Usually towards the end of the party or before the married couple leaves, the bride throws her flower bouquet to her unmarried friends.  The belief is that whoever catches the bouquet will be the next one to marry.  One other tradition for offering fortune to the couple is for the bride’s friends is to write their names on the inner part of the bride’s dress.  This is also said to help the unmarried bride’s friends to find a husband for them.

The Brazilian culture is very rich with its numerous traditions, celebrations, and in many cases superstitions.  Wedding celebrations are definitely inserted in this context. This is considered a festive event for the Brazilian society and thus it is usually celebrated with a lot of music, dances and overall happiness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8952">The '''word count''' is the number of [[word]]s in a document or passage of text. Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words. This may particularly be the case in [[academia]], legal proceedings, [[journalism]] and [[advertising]]. Word count is commonly used by [[translator]]s to determine the price for the translation job. Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of [[readability]] and to measure typing and reading speeds (usually in [[words per minute]]). When converting [[character (computing)|character]] counts to words, a measure of 5 or 6 characters to a word is generally used for English.&lt;ref&gt;The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America suggest [http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/what-is-a-word/ 6 chars to a word]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details and variations of definition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Variations in the [[operational definition]]s of how to count the words can occur (namely, what "counts as" a word, and which words "don't count" toward the total). However, especially since the advent of widespread [[word processing]], there is a broad consensus on these operational definitions (and hence the bottom-line integer result). The consensus is to accept the [[text segmentation]] rules generally found in most word processing software (including how [[Word#Word boundaries|word boundaries]] are determined, which depends on how [[word divider]]s are defined). The first trait of that definition is that a [[space (punctuation)|space]] (any of various [[whitespace character]]s, such as a "regular" word space, an [[space (punctuation)#Space characters and digital typography|em space]], or a [[tab key#Tab characters|tab character]]) is a word divider. Usually a [[hyphen]] or a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] is, too. Different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the [[text segmentation]] rule details, and on whether words outside the main text (such as [[note (typography)|footnotes]], [[note (typography)|endnotes]], or [[hidden text]]) are counted. But the behavior of most major word processing applications is broadly similar.

However, during the era when school assignments were done in [[handwriting]] or with [[typewriter]]s, the rules for these definitions often differed from today's consensus. Most importantly, many students were drilled on the rule that "certain words don't count", usually [[English articles|articles]] (namely, "a", "an", "the"), but sometimes also others, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s (for example, "and", "or", "but") and some prepositions (usually "to", "of"). Hyphenated permanent compounds such as "follow-up" (noun) or "long-term" (adjective) were counted as one word. To save the time and effort of counting word-by-word, often a [[rule of thumb]] for the average number of words per line was used, such as 10 words per line. These "rules" have fallen by the wayside in the word processing era; the "word count" feature of such software (which follows the [[text segmentation]] rules mentioned earlier) is now the standard arbiter, because it is largely consistent (across documents and applications) and because it is fast, effortless, and costless (already included with the application).

As for which sections of a document "count" toward the total (such as [[note (typography)|footnotes]], [[note (typography)|endnotes]], [[abstract (summary)|abstract]]s, [[citation|reference lists and bibliographies]], [[table (information)|tables]], figure captions, [[hidden text]]), the person in charge (teacher, client) can define their choice, and users (students, workers) can simply [[selection (user interface)|select]] (or exclude) the elements accordingly, and watch the word count automatically update.

== Software ==
Modern [[web browser]]s support word counting via [[Browser extension|extensions]], via a [[JavaScript]] [[bookmarklet]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web | url=http://marklets.com/Word+Count.aspx | title=Word Count Bookmarklet | publisher=Marklets.com | accessdate=March 3, 2013 | author=Tavory, Ran}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[script (computing)|script]] &lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web | url=https://wordcounttools.com/ | title=Word Count Tool | accessdate=March 6, 2014 | author=Word Counter}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is hosted in a website. Most [[word processor]]s can also count words. [[Unix]]-like systems include a  program, ''[[wc (Unix)|wc]]'', specifically for word counting. There are a wide variety of word counting tools available online.

As [[#Details and variations in how the count is defined|explained earlier]], different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the [[text segmentation]] rule details. The exact number of words often is not a strict requirement, thus the variation is acceptable.

== In fiction ==
Novelist [[Jane Smiley]] suggests that length is an important quality of the [[novel]].&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, Jane. 2005. Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel. NY: Alfred A. Knopf, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, novels can vary tremendously in length; Smiley lists novels as typically being between 100,000 and 175,000 words,&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[National Novel Writing Month]] requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words. There are no firm rules: for example, the boundary between a [[novella]] and a [[novel]] is arbitrary and a literary work may be difficult to categorise.&lt;ref&gt;Edge, Tom, "Does Size Matter?" The Guardian (UK), Booksblog, Nov. 2, 2006. http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2006/nov/02/doessizematter&lt;/ref&gt; But while the length of a novel is to a large extent up to its writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[New York Times]]|last=Quindlen|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Quindlen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/books/writers-on-writing-the-eye-of-the-reporter-the-heart-of-the-novelist.html|title=Writers on Writing: The Eye of the Reporter, the Heart of the Novelist|date=September 23, 2002|quote=A novelist doesn't write to space, of course; 80,000 words, 100,000, it is up to the writer to say when the story is done.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lengths may also vary by subgenre; many [[chapter book]]s for children start at a length of about 16,000 words,&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Nancy, Crafting Stories for Children. Cincinnati: Writer's Digest Books, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and a typical mystery novel might be in the 60,000 to 80,000 word range while a thriller could be well over 100,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Agents give writers the book on what's hot and what's not|journal=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|first=Carol|last=Thurston|date=August 3, 1997|quote=no one wants more than 60-80,000 words in a mystery, 110,000 for a thriller}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] specifies word lengths for each category of its [[Nebula award]] categories:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090319043837/http://sfwa.org/awards/faq.htm SFWA Awards FAQ], [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] as follows:&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ZANEWS'''''  (now also known as ''Puppet Nation ZA'') is a South African satirical puppet show first produced in 2008 by Both Worlds, a [[Cape Town]] based production company. The show is a daily and weekly satirical news programme in the form of a mock puppet television newscast and features on both the web and TV. ''ZANEWS'' features key local and international political figures and celebrities. For eight seasons, ''ZANEWS'' has been using its puppet cast as mouthpieces for satirical commentary on South Africa's public space.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Rebecca|title=ZA News: Return of the puppets|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-08-06-za-news-return-of-the-puppets/#.UVBIyeutwhw|work=Daily Maverick|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the cult British television series ''[[Spitting Image]]'' along with the French equivalent, ''[[Les Guignols]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-08-06-za-news-return-of-the-puppets/#.UWbwQldjudl|title=ZA News: Return of the puppets {{!}} Daily Maverick|last=Davis|first=Rebecca|work=Daily Maverick|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ZANEWS'' has been aired on the web and TV since 2009 on a range of media platforms, the most prolific of these being the show's online presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2011-03-03-za-news-and-the-irony-of-local-satire-facing-extinction/#.UXeHNMpjudn|title=ZA News and the irony of local satire facing extinction {{!}} Daily Maverick|last=Waal|first=Mandy De|work=Daily Maverick|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's motto of 'Make Laugh. Not War’ has perpetuated the show's portrayal of South African and international politicians and celebrities in its news format. The show is the only South African satirical puppet show, but is somewhat similar to the Kenyan produced The XYZ Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memeburn.com/2011/09/no-one-is-safe-but-everyone-is-welcome-zanews-now-on-tv/|title='No one is safe, but everyone is welcome': ZANews now on TV - Memeburn|date=2011-09-02|work=Memeburn|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 it was announced that ''Puppet Nation ZA'' is a nominee for Best TV Comedy in the [[44th International Emmy Awards]].

== History and Development ==

''ZANEWS'' started in 1997 when French producer [[Thierry Cassuto]] and South African cartoonist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] with the help of Jeffrey Fineberg from ''Spitting Image''&lt;ref name="dailymaverick"&gt;{{cite web|last=de Waal |first=Mandy |url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2011-03-03-za-news-and-the-irony-of-local-satire-facing-extinction/#.UWbyXVdjudm |title=ZA News and the irony of local satire facing extinction |publisher=Daily Maverick |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; made their first puppet of former South African president [[Nelson Mandela]]. "Shapiro was invited to a farewell garden party and sneaked the Mandela puppet in. He approached Mandela, much to the mirth of the members of government and politicians present and extended the puppet’s hand. Mandela didn’t miss a beat of course and shook the puppet’s hand saying: ‘Oh, I believe I have met this gentleman before’".&lt;ref name="dailymaverick"/&gt;

The show launched its first season on the ZANEWS website and YouTube with the assistance of low cost airline [[Kulula.com]]. Cassuto and Zapiro spent years trying to shop ''ZANEWS'' to a variety of broadcasters. The show was commissioned by the national broadcaster but when they demanded editorial control the deal fell apart. “People aren’t ready for this,” was the message they got time and time again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Listening Post |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2011/06/20116258446620353.html |title=Greece: Is the media part of the problem? - Listening Post |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; And this was incorporated into the script and the show's slogan of ‘Why are we doing this? Because here we can!'&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0C8-4k9UAw |title=Cnn Visits Zanews Studios |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storylines of Season 1 to 8 have developed along the lines of current news stories and events, with more characters being added to the show’s lineup. The eighth season of ''ZANEWS'' began in November 2014. The show's YouTube channel has over 4 million hits to date. ''ZANEWS'' is produced South Africa with puppet caricatures of mostly local politicians, celebrities and the everyman, bringing audiences a mix of the latest and most current events, parodying the formulaic style of media broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8295418.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; SA launches satire in cyberspace |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the show began airing on [[TopTV]]'s channel Top One,&lt;ref name="dailymaverick" /&gt; a South African satellite TV service. hey also launched a bigger website, ‘ZANEWS Network’, meant to be the online portal for quality South African satire. The site hosts their weekly episodes and daily videos shows as well as the best satirical columns, fake news, cartoons and user-generated content. In the same year the co-creator of ''[[Spitting Image]]'', [[Roger Law]] made a documentary for [[BBC Radio 4]], entitled ''South Africa Spits Back''. Law visited ''ZANEWS'' in South Africa to find out just how 'colourful comedy can get in the Rainbow Nation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rkxht |title=BBC Radio 4 - South Africa Spits Back |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-30 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, the show started its sixth season on [[StarSat]] (formerly TopTV) under the new title ''Puppet Nation''. ZA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/66/103187.html|title=Puppet Nation ZA aired this weekend|website=www.bizcommunity.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

Shows are recorded and produced at the Both World's studios in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2009-10-06-za-news-a-molotov-cocktail-in-the-making |title=ZA News: A Molotov cocktail in the making &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National &amp;#124; Mail &amp; Guardian |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; All departments, from management, writers, crew, and fabrication along with post-production and on-line management are found on these premises.

''Puppet Nation'' is structured as a 30-minute news show and the turnaround time from script to online / televised broadcast is three working days, which means ''ZANEWS'' is able to produce a weekly news show that is extremely current, with close to 80 puppet caricatures of local and international celebrities. Justice Malala and Debora Patta host the show.

The characters consist predominantly of South African politicians with a growing number of international celebrities and sports personalities joining the ranks each year, namely individuals that would be likely to feature in the general news, the show is therefore structured as such.&lt;ref name="dailymaverick" /&gt;

When the show first began, [[Tim Modise]], as the news anchor, with the ‘ZANEWS team’, investigates the top stories of the day and interviews and engages with a number of prominent South African and foreign politicians, celebrities and sports stars as a news show would.&lt;ref name="citypress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/news/internet-goes-where-tv-fears-to-tread-with-za-news-20091007/ |title=Internet goes where TV fears to tread with ZA News |publisher=City Press |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was joined in Season 5 by firebrand reporter [[Debora Patta]] (whose strange orange skin tone the show makes fun of)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citypress.co.za/entertainment/debora-patta-puppet-to-join-za-news-20120801-3/&lt;/ref&gt; then by popular political analyst Justice Malala in season 6.

Separated from the news show is the Tata and Tutu skit which involves a parody of [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Desmond Tutu]] discussing the events of the day but also offering their opinions on these current issues and regarded as the 'moral voices'.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;&lt;ref name="citypress"/&gt;

On a number of occasions, the puppet cast has been joined by well known comedians along with their real-life counterparts. Season 4 saw a number of these ‘in the flesh’ shows in which certain politicians and celebrities featured in the show along with their puppet counterparts. Most striking of these episodes were those of Premier of the Western Cape and official opposition leader [[Helen Zille]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Theresa Smith |url=http://www.iol.co.za/tonight/tv-radio/zille-in-on-being-butt-of-zanews-joke-1.1191176?showComments=true#.UV05-uutwhw |title=Zille in on being butt of ZANews joke - Tonight TV &amp; Radio |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the other end of the political spectrum, [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU)’s General Secretary [[Zwelinzima Vavi]], who interacted with their puppet counterparts.&lt;ref name="dailymaverick" /&gt; News anchor [[Tim Modise]], radio DJ Gareth Cliff, sportsman Pieter de Villiers and comedians [[Riaad Moosa]], [[Marc Lottering]] and [[Nik Rabinowitz]] also featured on the show.

In 2010 ''ZANEWS'' collaborated with a South African band [[Freshlyground]] on their music video for their song "Chicken To Change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdf2lBIe4Ac |title=Freshlyground &amp; ZA NEWS - Chicken to Change (OFFICIAL RELEASE) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was nominated for "Music Video of the Year" at the 17th Annual [[South African Music Awards]] (SAMA) sponsored by [[MTN Group|MTN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=Anton |url=http://www.channel24.co.za/Music/Features/Best-Video-2011-Sama-noms-20110519 |title=Best Video 2011 Sama noms |publisher=Channel24 |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[Zimbabwe]] banned Freshlyground over the music video because it portrays its president [[Robert Mugabe]] as a chicken afraid to relinquish power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laing |first=Aislinn |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/7994851/Zimbabwes-Robert-Mugabe-bans-Freshlyground-music-group-over-chicken-song.html |title=Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe bans Freshlyground music group over 'chicken' song |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-09-10 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 ''ZANEWS'' released a parody of ‘Wrecking Ball’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Og8sgv-3pA&amp;list=PLpXh_xMZwi7Ps4PcqmbsZr76fqfHq69WY&amp;index=12|title=Thuli Madonsela - Wrecking Ball |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Miley Cyrus. The video starred the puppet of South Africa's Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, and the lyrics were written by popular South African comedian, Deep Fried Man. The video received over 122 000 views between its release and February 2015 and received massive media attention, with Thuli Madonsela herself discussing it on eNCA.
