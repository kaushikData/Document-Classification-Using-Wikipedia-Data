{{Jainism}}
'''Ajiva''' ([[Sanskrit]]) is anything that has no soul or life, the polar opposite of "[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]" (soul). Because ''ajiva'' has no life, it does not accumulate ''karma'' and cannot die. Examples of ajiva include chairs, computers, paper, plastic, etc. According to [[Jain philosophy]], ''Ajiva'' can be divided into two kinds, with form and without form.&lt;ref name="Shah"&gt;{{citation |last=Shah |first=Natubhai |title=Jainism : The World of Conquerors |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |date=November 1998 |isbn=1-898723-30-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g120RG8GkHAC&amp;pg=PA50 |p=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five categories of Ajiva==
In [[Jainism]], there are five categories which ''ajīva'' can be placed into.{{sfn|George|2008|p=328}} Out of these, four categories, ''Dharma'' (medium of motion), ''Adharma'' (medium of rest), ''[[Ākāśa (Jainism)|Akasha]]'' (space) and ''[[Pudgala]]'' (matter) are described as the ''asti-kaya [[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya's]]'' (substances which possess constituent parts extending in space) while the fifth category ''Kala'' is an ''anasti-kaya dravya'' (which has no extension in space).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma-Astikaya===
{{Main|Dharma (Jainism)}}
Dharmastikaya is formed from the two words: [[Dharma]] &amp; Astikaya. Dharma here isn't referring to religion, but instead its referring to the medium of motion. Astikay itself is formed of two words: Asti &amp; Kaya. Asti means space, body or mode and Kaya means collection. So Astikaya means a collection of spaces or regions. Dharmastikaya denotes the medium of motion for things in the universe. In the absence of this medium, living things (i.e. [[jiva]]) would not be able to move.

===Adharma-Astikaya===
Adharmastikaya is also formed from two words: Adharma &amp; Astikaya. Adharma in this case means the
medium of rest. In the absence of this medium, Living things or [[jiva]] would continuously move.

===Ākāśa -Astikaya===
{{Main|Ākāśa (Jainism)}}
The infinity of space, called ''ākāśa'' in Sanskrit, is divided by the [[Jain philosophy]] into two parts, namely, the ''lokākāśa'' (loka+ākāśa), that is the space occupied by the universe, and the ''alokākāśa'' (a not, and lokākāśa), the portion beyond the universe. The ''lokākāśa'' is the portion in which are to be found the remaining five substances, i.e., ''Jīvas'', Matter, Time, Dharma and Adharma; but the ''alokākāśa'' is the region of pure space containing no other substance and lying stretched on all sides beyond bounds of the three worlds (the entire universe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=518–520}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the summit of the ''lokākāśa'' is the ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (abode of the liberated souls).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pudgala-Astikaya===
{{Main|Pudgala}}
The word [[Pudgala]] is made up of two terms: ''Pud'' means supplement (integration) and ''Gala'' means disintegration (division). In other words, what continuously changes by supplementation and/or division (''purayanti galanti cha'') is called Pudgala or [[matter]]. All matter in the [[universe]] is called Pudgala. Pudgala has form and [[shape]]. Pudgala can be experienced by touching, tasting, smelling, or seeing.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}}&lt;ref&gt;"Sparsharasagandhavarnavantah pudgalah" - [[Umasvati]], [[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvarthadhigama-sutra]], v.23&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Jiva]] Pudgala is also mobile. According to [[Jainism]], The karma [[wiktionary:Particle|particles]] that attach to our souls are also Pudgala. Pudgala can only be divided and subdivided to a certain extent that it is not possible to further subdivide it. This indivisible part of Pudgala, which is separated from the main pudgala, is called Paramanu. A paramanu is much more minute than even an [[atom]]. When a Paramanu is attached to the main pudgala, it is called a Pradesha. These [[subatomic]] Paramanus are too minute to be detected by normal vision, but they can be combined. Thus when a paramanu is combined with one or more other paramanus, they are called a skandha which are more or less like a [[molecules]]. Part of skandha is called desha. Such sknadhas may be large or small. Small skandhas may be invisible to the eye, but they can be seen when the combinations are larger.

===Kala===
Kala refers to time that brings forth changes. Past, present, and future are the different modes of time and are measured in terms of years, months, days, hours, minutes or seconds. For practical purposes a second happens to be the finest measurement of time. [[Jainism]] however, recognizes a very small [[measurement]] of time known as ''samaya'' which is an infinitely small part of a [[second]]. 

''Kala'' (time) is infinite, but there are cycles (''kalachakra''s) in it. Each cycle having two eras of equal duration described as the ''[[avasarpini]]'' and the ''utsarpini''. The former is a descending era in which virtue gradually decreases. The latter is an ascending era in which the reverse takes place. The present era is stated to be the former.&lt;ref&gt;Hiriyanna, M. (1993, reprint 2000). ''Outlines of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-1099-6}}, pp.159-60&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Indivisible time = 1 Samaya (smallest unit of measurement)
&lt;br&gt;Countless Samayas = 1 Avalika
&lt;br&gt;16,777,216 Avalikas = 1 Muhurt (48 minutes)
&lt;br&gt;30 Muhurtas = 1 day and night
&lt;br&gt;15 Days and nights = 1 Paksha
&lt;br&gt;2 Pakshas = 1 Month
&lt;br&gt;12 Months = 1 Year
&lt;br&gt;Countless years = 1 Palyopam
&lt;br&gt;1,000,000,000,000,000 (one quintillion) Palyopams = 1 Sagaropam; one quintillion is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
&lt;br&gt;1,000,000,000,000,000 Sagaropams = 1 Utsarpini or Avasarpini
&lt;br&gt;1 Utsarpini or Avasarpini = 1 Kalchakra (One time cycle)

'''Alluvial diagrams''' are a type of [[flow diagram]] originally developed to represent changes in network structure over time.
In allusion to both their visual appearance and their emphasis on flow, alluvial diagrams are named after [[alluvial fan]]s that are 
naturally formed by the soil deposited from streaming water.

==Interpretation==

In an alluvial diagram, blocks represent clusters of nodes, and stream fields between the blocks represent changes in the composition of these clusters over time.  The height of a block represents the size of the cluster and the height of a stream field represents the size of the components contained in both blocks connected by the stream field.

==Application==
Alluvial diagrams were originally developed to visualize structural change in large [[complex network]]s. They can be used to visualize any type of change in group composition between states or over time and include statistical information to reveal significant change. 
Alluvial diagrams highlight important structural changes that can be further emphasized by color, and make identification of major transitions easy.

Alluvial diagrams can also be used to illustrate patterns of flow on a fixed network over time. The ''Users Flow'' feature of Google Analytics uses alluvial diagrams to graphically represent how visitors move among the nodes (individual pages) on a web sites{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1733">The '''Antaryāmin''', in terms of [[Hindu]] philosophy, is related to the "inner-self", the "inner-controller" or the "inner-guidance" that exists in a person and itself manifests on an intuitive way to the one manifesting it. It recalls a teacher or a guru that resides within and once it is manifested - for a higher context of knowledge guidance - usually after one [[Conjuration|summons]] or [[Prayer|prays]] for it, the Antaryamin comes to help. In some cases, the Antaryamin is asked to be manifested in order to resolve non-intellectual issues, also performing [[miracle]]s to the one asking.

==Hindu contextualization==

On the [[Hindu scriptures]], we find the concept of the Antaryamin as the Inner Controller &lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanian&lt;/ref&gt; after the building of the elementary concepts regarding a [[deity]] or an [[Ego (spirituality)|ego]] - on a [[wikt:unity|unity]] way - of which is controlling, somehow to a compared intelligence, the universe and all that is. This [[intelligence]] may also refer to what is called [[consciousness]] or [[awareness]] that is far superior, hence capable of doing superior things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Krishnananda]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18919">'''Battered woman syndrome''' ('''BWS''') emerged in the 1990s from several murder cases in England in which women had killed violent partners in response to what they claimed was cumulative abuse, rather than in response to a single provocative act. Feminist groups, particularly [[Southall Black Sisters]] and [[Justice for Women]], challenged the legal definition of [[Provocation (legal)|''provocation'']], and in a series of appeals against murder convictions secured the courts' recognition of battered woman syndrome.&lt;ref name=Connelly2010p292&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connelly|first1=Clare|editor1-last=Hunter|editor1-first=Rosemary|editor2-last=McGlynn|editor2-first=Clare|editor3-last=Rackley|editor3-first=Erica|title=Feminist Judgments: From Theory to Practice|date=2010|publisher=Hart Publishing|location=Oxford|pages=(292–310), 292|chapter=Commentary on ''Attorney-General for Jersey v Holley''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bottomley1996p201&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bottomley|first1=Anne|title=Feminist Perspectives on The Foundational Subjects of Law|date=1996|publisher=Cavendish Publishing|location=London|p=201|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Magrath|first1=Paul|title=Law Report: Classic direction to jury on provocation defence upheld: R v Ahluwalia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-report-classic-direction-to-jury-on-provocation-defence-upheld-r-v-ahluwalia-court-of-appeal-1538094.html|work=The Independent|date=3 August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tan11July1995&gt;Ying Hui Tan (11 July 1995).

Walker]]'s ''The Battered Woman'' (1979).

==The law==
{{further|Provocation in English law}}

Until the mid-1990s, the legal definition of ''provocation'' in England had relied on [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Devlin J]] in ''R v Duffy'' [1949] 1 All ER 932: "Provocation is some act, or series of acts done (or words spoken)&amp;nbsp;... which would cause in any reasonable person and actually causes in the accused, a sudden and temporary loss of self-control, rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make him or her for the moment not master of his or her mind." Three cases helped to change this: [[Kiranjit Ahluwalia|''R v Ahluwalia'']] [1992] 4 AER 889; [[Emma Humphreys|''R v Humphreys'']] [1995] 4 All ER 1008); and ''[[Sara Thornton case|R v Thornton]] (No 2)'' [1996] 2 AER 1023.&lt;ref name=Connelly2010p292/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bottomley1996p201/&gt;

The courts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States have accepted the extensive and growing body of research showing that battered women can use force to defend themselves and sometimes kill their abusers because of the abusive and sometimes life-threatening situation in which they find themselves, acting in the firm belief that there is no other way than to kill for self-preservation. The courts have recognized that this evidence may support a variety of defenses to a charge of [[murder]] or to mitigate the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] if convicted of lesser offenses. Battered woman syndrome is not a legal defense in and of itself, but may legally constitute:

* Self-defense when using a reasonable and proportionate degree of violence in response to the abuse might appear the most appropriate defense but, until recently, it almost never succeeded. Research in 1996 in England found no case in which a battered woman successfully pleaded self-defense (see Noonan at p. 198). After analysing 239 appellate decisions on trials of women who killed in self-defense in the U.S., Maguigan (1991) argues that self-defence is gender biased.
* [[provocation (legal)|provocation]];
* insanity (usually within the meaning of the [[M'Naghten Rules]]); and
* [[diminished responsibility]].

However, in 1994, as part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]], the [[United States Congress]] ordered an investigation into the role of battered woman syndrome expert testimony in the courts to determine its validity and usefulness.  In 1997, they published the report of their investigation, titled ''The Validity and Use of Evidence Concerning Battering and Its Effects in Criminal Trials''.  "The federal report ultimately rejected all terminology related to the battered woman syndrome...noting that these terms were 'no longer useful or appropriate{{'"}} (Rothenberg, "Social Change", 782).&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Bess.  {{"'}}We Don't Have Time for Social Change’ Cultural Compromise and the Battered Woman Syndrome". ''Gender and Society'', Oct. 2003:771-87.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of using the term "battered woman", the terminology "battering and its effects" became acceptable. The decision to change this terminology was based on a changing body of research indicating there is more than one pattern to battering and a more inclusive definition was necessary to more accurately represent the realities of domestic violence.

==English law==
In ''R v Ahluwalia'' (1992) 4 AER 889 a woman ([[Kiranjit Ahluwalia]]), created [[napalm]] and set fire to the bed of her husband, Deepak, after he had gone to sleep. He suffered severe burns over 40% of his body and died 10 days later in the hospital. He allegedly had attempted to break her ankles and burn her with a hot iron on the night of her attack. Accusing him of [[domestic violence]] and [[marital rape]], she claimed provocation. The judge directed the jury to consider whether, if she did lose her self-control, a reasonable person having the characteristics of a well-educated married Asian woman living in England would have lost her self-control given her husband's provocation. On appeal, it was argued that he should have directed the jury to consider a reasonable person suffering from 'battered woman syndrome'. Having considered fresh medical evidence, the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] ordered a retrial on the basis that the new evidence showed an arguable case of [[diminished responsibility in English law]].&lt;ref&gt;''R v Ahluwalia'' (1992) 4 AER 889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in ''[[Sara Thornton case|R v Thornton]] (No 2)'' (1996) 2 AER 1023 the battered wife adduced fresh evidence that she had a personality disorder and the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial considering that, if the evidence had been available at the original trial, the jury might have reached a different decision. The victim does not have to be in a position to carry out the threats immediately.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Thornton (No 2)'' (1996) 2 AER 1023.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Charlton'' (2003) EWCA Crim 415, following threats of sexual and violent abuse against herself and her daughter, the defendant killed her obsessive, jealous, controlling partner while he was restrained by handcuffs, blindfolded and gagged as part of their regular sexual activity. The term of five years' imprisonment was reduced to three and a half years because of the terrifying threats made by a man determined to dominate and control the defendant's life. The threats created a genuine fear for the safety of herself and more significantly, her daughter, and this caused the defendant to lose control and make the ferocious attack.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Charlton'' (2003) EWCA Crim 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''HM's AG for Jersey v Holley'' (2005) 3 AER 371, the Privy Council regarded the Court of Appeal precedent in ''Smith''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Smith (Morgan)'' [1998] ''The Times'', 29 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; as wrongly decided, interpreting the Act as setting a purely objective standard. Thus, although the accused's characteristics were to be taken into account when assessing the gravity of the provocation, the standard of self-control to be expected was invariable except for the accused's age and sex. The defendant and the deceased both suffered from chronic [[alcoholism]] and had a violent and abusive relationship. The evidence was that the deceased was drunk and taunted him by telling him that she had sex with another man. The defendant then struck the deceased with an axe which was an accident of availability. Psychiatric evidence was that his consumption of alcohol was involuntary and that he suffered from a number of other psychiatric conditions which, independently of the effects of the alcohol, might have caused the loss of self-control and induced him to kill. Lord Nicholls said:
:Whether the provocative acts or words and the defendant's response met the 'ordinary person' standard prescribed by the statute is the question the jury must consider, not the altogether looser question of whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the jury consider the loss of self-control was sufficient excusable. The statute does not leave each jury free to set whatever standard they consider appropriate in the circumstances by which to judge whether the defendant's conduct is 'excusable'.&lt;ref&gt;''HM's AG for Jersey v Holley'' (2005) 3 AER 371.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the passage of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]], the defence of provocation—used in a number of the aforementioned cases—has been replaced with 'loss of control'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199696796.001.0001/acprof-9780199696796-chapter-8|title=Principles and Values in Criminal Law and Criminal Justice: Essays in Honour of Andrew Ashworth|last=Mitchell|first=Barry|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=113–132|language=en|chapter=Years of Provocation, Followed by a Loss of Control|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199696796.003.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law Commission Report on ''Partial Defences to Murder'' (2004) rejects the notion of creating a mitigatory defence to cover the use of excessive force in self-defence but accepts that the "all or nothing" effect of self-defence can produce unsatisfactory results in the case of murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2015/03/lc290_Partial_Defences_to_Murder.pdf The Law Commission Report on ''Partial Defences to Murder''] (2004), Part 4 (pp. 78-86).]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2017}}

==Australia==
In Australia, self-defence might be considered the most appropriate defence to a charge of murder for a woman who kills to protect her life or the lives of her children in a domestic violence context. It is about the rational act of a person who kills in order to save her (or his) own life.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite AustLII|HCA|75|1998|litigants=Osland v The Queen |parallelcite= |date=10 December 1998 |courtname=auto}}.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] set a precedent for the use of the battered women defence in the 1990 case of ''[[R. v. Lavallee]]''.

==New Zealand==
In ''R v Fate'' (1998) 16 [[CRNZ]] 88 a woman who had come to [[New Zealand]] from the small island of [[Nanumea]], which is part of the [[Tuvalu Islands]], received a two-year sentence for manslaughter by provocation. Mrs. Fate spoke no English and was isolated within a small close-knit [[Wellington]] community of 12 families, so she felt trapped in the abusive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Fate'' (1998) 16 CRNZ 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, ''The Queen v Epifania Suluape'' (2002) [[NZCA]] 6, deals with a wife who pleaded provocation after she killed her husband with an axe when he proposed to leave her for another woman. There was some evidence of neglect, humiliation, and abuse but the court concluded that this was exaggerated. On appeal, the court was very conscious of the [[Samoa]]n culture in New Zealand in restricting the power of the wife to act independently of her husband and reduced her sentence for manslaughter to five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl/nz/cases/NZCA/2002/6.html?query=tuvalu%2a ''The Queen v Epifania Suluape'' (2002) NZCA 6(21 February 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''birthday-number effect''' is the subconscious tendency of people to prefer the [[number]]s in the date of their [[birthday]] over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese [[psychologists]] Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been replicated in various countries. It holds across age and gender. The effect is most prominent for numbers over 12.

Most people like themselves; the birthday is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the [[name-letter effect]], has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Number Preference Task is used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards [[prices]] when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects' birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price did not lead to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with high [[self-esteem]] liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.

== Background ==
Throughout history, societies have had [[number]]s they consider special.{{sfn|Schimmel|1994|p=4, back cover}}{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=3}} For example, in [[ancient Rome]] the number 7 was auspicious,{{sfn|Schimmel|1994|p=139}} in [[Maya civilisation]] the number 13 was sacred,{{sfn|Schimmel|1994|p=207}} in modern-day Japan people give three, five, or seven gifts for luck, and in China the number 8 is considered lucky and 4 is avoided whenever possible.{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=4}} In Western cultures the number 13 is often considered unlucky, hence the term [[triskaidekaphobia]], fear of the number 13.{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=67}}

[[Design of experiments|Controlled experiments]] with numbers date back to 1933 when the researcher Dietz asked Dutch people to name the first number to come to mind between 0 and 99.{{sfn|Dietz|1933}}{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=291}} The number 7 was mentioned most, as it was in various later replicas of the study in other countries.{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=291}}{{sfn|Heywood|1972}}{{sfn|Simon|Primavera|1972}}{{efn-ua|When Kubovy and Psotka constrained the task to any number in the 20s, 27 came out as most mentioned.{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=291}} They argued that for this type of task, participants produce answers such that they ''appear'' to comply with the request for a spontaneous response.{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=294}} They speculated that the other numbers appear too obvious and that 7 is unique among the numbers from 0 to 9: it has no multiples among these numbers and neither is it a multiple of any of these numbers.{{sfn|Kubovy|Psotka|1976|p=294}} However, young children do not apply this strategy and 7 does not come out on top in children of age eight and nine.{{sfn|Wiegersma|1979|p=472}}}} The number 7 also came out on top in studies that asked people to name their favourite number.{{sfn|Saito|1999|p=532}}{{sfn|Philbrick|1976}}{{sfn|Kuloğlu|Caykoylu|Yılmaz|Akyol|2009|p=113}}{{sfn|Milikowski|Elshout|1996|p=13}} In an online poll by [[Alex Bellos]], a columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'', more than 30,000 people from all over the world submitted numbers, with 7 the most popular. All numbers under 100 were submitted at least once and nearly half of the numbers under 1,000.{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=5}}{{efn-ua|Odd numbers outnumbered even numbers. Bellos' explanation was that in both the East and the West odd numbers tend to have more spiritual significance than even ones.{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=5}} The brain also appears to process odd and even numbers differently: measuring reaction speed researcher Hines discovered that it takes people longer to judge an odd number to be odd than an even number to be even.{{sfn|Bellos|2015|p=4}}{{sfn|Hines|1990|p=40}}}} [[Marketing research]]ers King and Janiszewski investigated number preference in a different way. They showed undergraduate students random numbers and asked them to say quickly whether they liked the number, disliked it, or felt neutral. The number 100 had the highest proportion of people liking it (70%) and the lowest proportion of people disliking it (5%). The numbers 1 to 20 were liked by 9% more people than the higher numbers; the numbers that are the result of rote-learned [[multiplication tables]] (i.e. 2 × 2 to 10 × 10)  were liked by 15% more people than the remaining numbers. The researchers concluded that number fluency predicts number preference: hence multiplication table numbers are preferred over [[prime number]]s.{{sfn|King|Janiszewski|2011|pp=329–330}}

The closely related field of letter-preference research dates back to the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian [[psychologist]] Nuttin reported the unexpected finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The [[name-letter effect]] has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different [[languages]], cultures and [[alphabets]], no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014}} Nuttin predicted that because the driving force behind the name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the [[self]], there would also be a birthday-number effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=383}}

== Original study  ==
In 1997, researchers Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa observed that studies repeatedly showed that Japanese people do not seek to maintain and enhance their [[self-esteem]], unlike Europeans and Americans.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=736}} Whereas research with Western participants found that, on average, people falsely believe they are better than average,{{sfn|Chambers|2008|p=878}} that they take credit for successes and blame others for failures,{{sfn|Miller |Ross |1975}} and that they overestimate the chances of good fortune happening to them,{{sfn|Taylor|Brown|1988|p=193}} studies with Japanese did not reveal such self-enhancing tendencies.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|pp=736–737}} In addition, in cross-cultural studies, Japanese reported self-esteem to be hurt more by failures than boosted by successes, the opposite of what was reported by Americans.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=737}} All these studies involved participants being aware that their self-esteem was being evaluated, and hence they are said to be measures of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=737}} This made Kitayama and Karasawa wonder. It seemed unlikely to them that Japanese have no positive feelings attached to their selves. They hypothesized that somehow Japanese do not allow these feelings to be detected overtly. To test this, they ran two experiments that hid the aim of assessing self-esteem, measuring instead [[implicit self-esteem]].{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=737}}  Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Greenwald |Banaji|1995|pp=4,10–11}}{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}} The first experiment was a replica of Nuttin's 1987 study of letter preference, looking for an effect tied to letters of the participant's name.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=738}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}} The second experiment involved numbers, looking for an effect tied to numbers representing the day of the month a participant was born (between 1 and 31) and the month of their birthday (between 1 and 12).{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=739}}

=== Method ===
For the letter experiment, they asked 219 Japanese undergraduate students to rate each of the 45 ''[[hiragana]]'', part of the [[Japanese writing system]], according to how much they liked it.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=738}} For the number experiment, they asked 269 Japanese undergraduate students to rate the numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 was chosen as the upper limit to mask the true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum number of days in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1, if they disliked the number very much, to 6, if they liked it very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthdays.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=739}}

=== Results ===
Analysis of the letter preference data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|pp=738–739}} Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants who did not have that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference.{{efn-ua|An alternative scoring algorithm is to take the mean of all of a respondent's ratings and subtract that from his or her birthday-number rating. But as Bosson, Swann, and Pennebaker later argued, this does not control for common preference effects.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}}}} The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers&lt;!--digits, or the full numbers?--&gt; in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|pp=739–740}}

=== Explanations ===
Kitayama and Karasawa concluded that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with the hypothesis that the preference is due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|pp=738–740}}{{efn-ua|Previous studies had already proven that birthdays are a positively valued part of the self-concept.{{sfn|Kesebir| Oishi|2010|p=1526}} Finch and Cialdini, for example, manipulated some participants into thinking they shared their birthday with [[Rasputin]]. These people rated him more favourably than the control group.{{sfn|Finch| Cialdini| 1989|p=222}}}} Since most people like themselves,{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} most people are found to have positive feelings for these constituent parts. The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=740}}

An alternative explanation for the birthday-number effect that had to be tested is [[mere exposure]]. If it were true that the numbers in one's birthday are used disproportionately in one's daily life, then the preference for numbers in one's birthday could simply be a preference for what is most frequent. Zajonc found in his 1960s and 1980s lab studies that familiarity can strongly influence preference, and coined the term "mere exposure effect".{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} But Kitayama and Karasawa argued that even if people did see numbers from their own birthday more, this would still be negligible in comparison to the overall quantity of numbers they encounter in daily life.{{efn-ua|Kitayama and Karasawa found a name-letter effect even for the high-frequency letters, which helped convince them mere exposure is not the driving force behind the two effects.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} This is in line with the argument other researchers have used to rule out mere exposure as an explanation for the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama| Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Greenwald |Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}}

Kitayama and Karasawa concluded that Japanese people do indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, just like Americans and Europeans, but that these feelings are masked when explicitly asked for. They speculated that the reason for this masking lies in the Japanese tendency to attend to negative, undesirable features by way of improving the self.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|pp=737,741}}

== Subsequent studies ==
By 2017, Kitayama and Karasawa's original study had been cited in over 300 scientific papers.{{sfn|Google Scholar|2017}}

=== Early follow-up studies ===
The first follow-up study looked at cultural differences. Blass, Schmitt, Jones, and O'Connell used  US undergraduate students as participants to replicate the original study. In their paper presented at the [[American Psychological Association]]'s annual conference in Chicago, in August 1997, they reported the same result: a preference for birthday numbers. They did find a much stronger effect though, which according to the researchers could be due to Americans' tendency towards self-enhancement.{{sfn|Blass|Schmitt|Jones|O'Connell|1997}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Markus|1999|pp=286–287}}

The second follow-up study was done in 1998 by Kitayama and Uchida. They sought to investigate the relationship between a person's name-letter effect and his or her birthday-number effect, given that Kitayama and Karasawa had suspected a single driving force behind both. As they had predicted, Kitayama and Uchida found that within a person the two effects were correlated.{{sfn|Kitayama|Markus|1999|p=286}} Later studies confirmed this finding.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Tennen|2006|p=5}}

In 2000, Bosson, Swann and Pennebaker tested seven measures of implicit self-esteem, including the birthday-number task and name-letter task, and four measures of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}} They used a seven-point rating scale instead of the six-point scale Kitayama and Karasawa had used, and they only looked at the day of the birthday. On average, respondents scored their birthday number 0.73 higher than the other numbers. When the researchers retested all seven implicit self-esteem measures, the birthday-number task was one of three that produced similar results.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=636}}  From the weak or non-significant correlations between the implicit and explicit self-esteem measures they concluded that implicit and explicit self-esteem are tapping different underlying constructs.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=636}}

=== Later follow-up studies ===
Later studies investigated aspects of the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=673–674}} This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition the strength of a participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=675}}

Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts investigated how the effect held up under so-called 'threats' to the self. Earlier research by Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis had already shown that the name-letter effect is influenced by a perceived threat.{{sfn|Koole| Smeets|van Knippenberg| Dijksterhuis| 1999|p=111}} Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts first made some participants write about a personal flaw and then gave all participants the Number Preference Task and the Letter Preference Task. What they found was consistent with previous findings: people who liked themselves a lot liked the numbers in their birthday and the letters of their name even more when an aspect of their self seemed under threat. This is predicted by the theory of unconscious self-enhancement. It can not be explained by  mere exposure theory.{{sfn|Jones| Pelham| Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}}{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}

Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow looked for effects with significant years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, on a scale from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}}

Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu investigated the validity of implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences.{{sfn|Falk| Heine| Takemura|Zhang |2015|p=57}} They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants to a series of tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them.{{sfn|Falk| Heine| Takemura|Zhang|2015|p=59}} Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences.{{sfn|Falk| Heine| Takemura|Zhang|2015|p=66}} Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which [[Christmas]] is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25.{{sfn|Stieger| Krizan|2013|pp=187–188}} They concluded that cultural influences need to be taken into account if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.{{sfn|Stieger| Krizan|2013|p=190}}

== Application ==
In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the birthday-number effect has been exploited to measure implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=70}} The Number Preference Task is often used in combination with the more popular Letter Preference Task, sometimes jointly called the Initials and Birthday Preference Task (IBPT).{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}}{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=70}} The most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem is the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}

There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a rating task, which involves having participants judge all the numbers under a certain threshold (typically over 31 to mask the purpose of assessing connections to dates), indicating how much they like them on a 7-point [[Likert scale|rating scale]].{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}} There is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use. In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} The algorithms are typically applied to both the number of the day and of the month.{{sfn|Bosson|Swann|Pennebaker|2000|p=635}}{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}}

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task involve both letter preference and number preference, that it be administered twice, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} The Number Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[parenting]]{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Tennen|2006|p=5}} and mental [[habits]].{{sfn|Verplanken|Friborg|Wang|Trafimow|2007|p=534}}

== Wider implications ==
Researchers have looked for wider implications of the birthday-number effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&amp;nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or  birthday numbers.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p= 665}} Skeptics say that the claim that letters influence life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}} Based on analysis of US field data Pelham et al. concluded that people disproportionately live in towns whose names contain numbers that match the numbers in their birthday. They looked at people who were born on 2 February, 3 March, 4 April, etc. up to 8 August, and at people who lived in towns with numbers in them, such as [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin|Two Rivers]], [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], [[Four Corners, San Diego County, California|Four Corners]], etc.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|pp=478–479}} But in his critical analysis of this study Simonsohn argued that its reliability is questionable, as it found only a small number of residents with matching numbers. Simonsohn tried to replicate the finding in different ways but without success. He found no effect of just the day of birthday on the town (e.g. the second of any month, not just February). He also found no effect of birthday number on street, address, or apartment number.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011}}

Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg investigated the influence of number preference on interpersonal attraction. In a lab study they showed US participants text profiles of people. The profiles came with a prominently displayed, seemingly arbitrary code that was explained as merely to help the researchers keep track of the profiles. One half of the participants were shown a code that matched their birthday (e.g. someone born on 8 September saw a partner profile with the code "09-08"); the other half a non-matching code (e.g. "03-23"). All participants were shown exactly the same profile. They had to rate how much they thought they would like the person in the profile. The results showed that participants liked the profiles significantly more when the code matched their own birthday numbers.{{sfn|Jones| Pelham|Carvallo | Mirenberg|2004|p=672}} Relative to participants in the control condition, participants in the birthday-association condition could at the end of the test more accurately recall the code, but only 5 of 110 participants mentioned the matching code as a potential influence. Jones et al. concluded that people’s preferences for their own birthday numbers are potent enough to influence people’s attraction to other people.{{sfn|Jones| Pelham|Carvallo | Mirenberg|2004|p=674}} Pelham and Carvallo subsequently looked at interpersonal attraction using field data. They used statewide marriage records to conclude that people disproportionately marry people who share their birthday numbers.{{sfn|Pelham| Carvallo |2015|p=692}} They also found that brides disproportionately chose their own birthday numbers and birth months as wedding dates.{{sfn|Pelham| Carvallo |2015|p=706}}{{efn-ua|There is a body of research into the effects of knowing a birthday match exists. Jiang, Hoegg, Dahl and Chattopadhyay examined the role of a salesperson and a potential customer knowingly sharing a birthday in a sales context. They found such an incidental similarity can result in a higher intention to purchase. This persuasive effect stems from the need for connectedness.{{sfn|Jiang| Hoegg|Dahl |Chattopadhyay|2010|p=778}} Similarly, Burger, Messian, Patel, del Prado and Anderson investigated the impact sharing a birthday with someone has in the context of making a request. Some participants were led to believe they shared a birthday with the requester, who asked for an overnight critique of an eight-page English paper. Whereas in the control group 34% of participants complied with the request, in the birthday group 62% complied. Burger et al. wrote that this is caused by the incidental association producing fleeting feelings of attraction. Participants reacted in a heuristic fashion, acting as if they were dealing with a friend.{{sfn|Burger|Messian| Patel|del Prado|2004|pp=37–38}} An analysis of large databases of lottery number picks revealed that people disproportionately selected numbers matching their birthdays.{{sfn|Wang|Potter van Loon|van den Assem|van Dolder|2016|p=247}}}}

Coulter and Grewal investigated if the birthday-number effect could be exploited in sales and marketing. Over 200 participants of an online survey were asked about an advertisement for a pasta dinner, where the price was secretly matched to the day of the month of their birthday. For example, someone born on the 16th  of a certain month would see the price "$39.16". The researchers found that matching numbers increased price liking and purchase intention. When introducing a perceived threat to the self into the task, they found an exaggerated effect. From this they concluded that the positive affect linked to birthday-numbers transfers directly to consumers’ price predilections, and ultimately affects their purchase intentions.{{sfn|Coulter|Grewal|2014}} Keller and Gierl sought to replicate Coulter and Grewal's study. They manipulated the prices in advertisements for pizza and a music streaming service to match the birthday (day, year) of the participants in their lab study. They did not find any disproportionate liking of matching prices, neither for the year the participant was born in or the day. Keller and Gierl concluded that there must be some prerequisites such as priming stimuli to trigger the effect, although they suggested it is possible that their participants, who all happened to have been born between 1990 and 1999, saw their birthyear as price so often in real life that it had become too common.{{sfn|Keller|Gierl|2017|pp=39–42}}

Smeets used name and birthday matching in a product-liking experiment. He made up product names for a DVD that matched both part of the participant's name and his or her birthday. For example, a participant named Mariëlle, born on 14 May, would get an ad for a DVD-player named "DVD-Ma 14" in the self-relevant condition and "DVD-Pu 30" in the control condition. He found that high self-esteem participants liked products more if the product names were self-relevant than if they were not. He also found the opposite happened among low self-esteem participants: they liked products better if they were not self-relevant.{{sfn|Smeets|2009|pp=47–49}}

[[File:Malcolm X any means necessary.jpg|thumb|This poster, based on a famous photograph from ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', popularized the slogan.]]

'''By any means necessary''' is a translation of a phrase used by French intellectual [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in his play ''[[Dirty Hands]]''. It entered the popular [[civil rights]] culture through a speech given by [[Malcolm X]] at the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] founding rally on June 28, 1964. It is generally considered to leave open all available tactics for the desired ends, including [[violence]]; however, the “necessary” qualifier adds a caveat—if violence is not necessary, then presumably, it should not be used.

== Jean-Paul Sartre ==

The phrase is translation of a sentence used in French intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre's play ''Dirty Hands'':

{{quote
| text = I was not the one to invent lies: they were created in a [[society]] divided by [[Social class|class]] and each of us inherited lies when we were born. It is not by refusing to lie that we will abolish lies: it is by eradicating class ''by any means necessary''.
| sign = Jean-Paul Sartre
| source = ''Dirty Hands'': act 5, scene 3. 1963&lt;ref name="Bartleby" /&gt;
}}

== Malcolm X ==

It entered the popular culture through a speech given by Malcolm X in the last year of his life.
{{quote
| text = We declare our right on this earth to be a man, to be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence ''by any means necessary''.
| sign = Malcolm X
| source = 1965&lt;ref name="Malcolm X 1992" /&gt;
}}

=== Mandela case ===

In the final scene of the 1992 movie ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'', [[Nelson Mandela]]—recently released after 27&amp;nbsp;years of political imprisonment—appears as a schoolteacher in a [[Soweto]] classroom.&lt;ref name="Cunningham 2004-06-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero 1993" /&gt; Yet Mandela informed director [[Spike Lee]] that he could not utter the famous final phrase ''"by any means necessary"'' on camera; fearing that the [[apartheid]] government would use it against him if he did. Lee obliged, and the final seconds of the film feature black-and-white footage of Malcolm X himself delivering the phrase.&lt;ref name="Guerrero 1993" /&gt;

In at least one source,&lt;ref&gt;"From Aristotle to EA: a type theory for EA"{{reliable source|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''class''' is a set in which an individual member can be recognized in one or both of two ways: a) it is included in an [[Extensionality|extensional]] definition of the whole set (a list of set members) b) it matches an [[Intensional definition]] of one set member. By contrast, a "type" is an intensional definition; it is a description that is sufficiently generalized to fit every member of a set.

[[Philosopher]]s sometimes distinguish classes from [[type (metaphysics)|types]] and [[natural kind|kinds]].  We can talk about the ''class'' of human beings, just as we can talk about the ''type'' (or ''natural kind''), human being, or humanity. How, then, might classes differ from types?  One might well think they are not actually different [[category of being|categories of being]], but typically, while both are treated as [[abstract object]]s, classes are not usually treated as [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]], whereas types usually are. Whether natural kinds ought to be considered universals is vexed; see [[natural kind]].

There is, in any case, a difference in how we talk about types or kinds. We say that [[Socrates]] is a ''[[Type-token distinction|token]]'' of a type, or an ''[[Instantiation principle|instance]]'' of the natural kind, ''human'' ''being''. But notice that we say instead that Socrates is a ''member'' of the class of human beings.  We would not say that Socrates is a "member" of the type or kind, human beings. Nor would we say he is a type (or kind) of a class. He is a token (instance) of the type (kind).  So the linguistic difference is: types (or kinds) have tokens (or instances); classes, on the other hand, have members.

The concept of a class is similar to the concept of a set defined by its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Antony Flew]]|page=64|title=Dictionary of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the class is extensional. If, however, a set is defined intensionally, then it is a set of things that meet some requirement to be a member. Thus, such a set can be seen as creating a type. Note that it also creates a class from the extension of the intensional set. A type always has a corresponding class (though that class might have no members), but a class does not necessarily have a corresponding type.

[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]] played a major role in developing the concept of a coherent [[CGS system]] and in extending the [[metric system]] to include electrical units.]]

A '''coherent system of units''' is a system of units based on a system of quantities in such a way that the equations between the numerical values expressed in the units of the system have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the quantities.&lt;ref name=definition/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/30/5/010/pdf |author=Thor, A. J. |year=1994 |title=New International Standards for Quantities and Units |journal=Metrologia |volume=30 |number=5|page=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, it is a system in which every quantity has a unique unit, or one that does not use [[conversion factor]]s.

A '''coherent derived unit''' is a [[Derived unit (measurement)|derived unit]] that, for a given system of quantities and for a chosen set of [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]]s, is a product of powers of base units with the proportionality factor being one.&lt;ref name=definition/&gt;

If a system of units has both equations and base units, with only one base unit for each base quantity, then it is coherent if and only if every derived unit of the system is coherent.

The concept of coherence was developed in the mid-nineteenth century by, amongst others, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and promoted by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]].  The concept was initially applied to the [[centimetre–gram–second]] (CGS) in 1873 and the [[foot–pound–second system]]s (FPS) of units in 1875.  The [[International System of Units]] (1960) was designed around the principle of coherence.

==Basic concepts==
In SI, which is a coherent system, the unit of power is the [[watt]], which is defined as one joule per second.&lt;ref&gt;SI Brochure, Table 4, pg 118&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[US customary system]] of measurement, which is non-coherent, the unit of power is the [[horsepower]], which is defined as 550 foot-pounds per second (the pound in this context being the [[pound-force]]); similarly the gallon is not equal to a cubic yard (nor is it the cube of any length unit of the system).

==Before the metric system==
The earliest units of measure devised by humanity bore no relationship to each other.  As both humanity's understanding of [[Philosophy|philosophical concepts]] and the organisation of [[society]] developed, so units of measurement were standardised – first particular units of measure had the same value across a [[community]] then different units of the same [[quantity]] (for example feet and inches) were given a fixed relationship. Apart from [[Ancient China]] where the units of capacity and of mass are linked to [[millet|red millet seed]], there is little evidence of the linking of different quantities until the [[Age of Reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Relating quantities of the same kind===
&lt;!--Discussion of development of relationship between quantities of the same kind, for eample, feet and inches are quantities of the same kind, feet and acres are not.--&gt;
The history of the measurement of length dates back to the early civilisations of the [[Middle East]] (10000&amp;nbsp;BC &amp;ndash; 8000&amp;nbsp;BC). Archeologists have been able to reconstruct the units of measure in use in [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Mesopotamia]], [[History of measurement systems in India|India]], [[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement|the Jewish culture]] and many others. Archaeological and other evidence shows that in many civilisations, the ratios between different units for the same quantity of measure were adjusted so that they were integer numbers.  In many early cultures such as [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|Ancient Egypt]], multiples of 2, 3 and 5 were not always used&amp;mdash;the Egyptian royal cubit being 28 fingers of 7 [[Hand (unit)|hands]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite book

===Relating quantities of different kinds===
Non-[[Unit_commensurability#Commensurability|commensurable]] quantities have different [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimension]]s which means that adding or subtracting them is not meaningful. For instance, adding the [[mass]] of an object to its [[volume]] has no physical meaning. However, new quantities (and, as such, units) can be [[Derived units|derived]] via multiplication and [[exponentiation]] of other units. As an example, the [[SI unit]] for force is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]], which is defined as kg⋅m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since a coherent derived unit is one which is defined by means of multiplication and exponentiation of other units but not multiplied by any scaling factor other than 1, the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] is a coherent unit of [[pressure]] (defined as kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;), but the [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (defined as {{val|100000|u=kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is not. 

Note that coherence of a given unit depends on the definition of the base units. Should the meter's definition change such that it is shorter by a factor of {{val|100000}}, then the bar would be a coherent derived unit. However, a coherent unit remains coherent (and a non-coherent unit remains non-coherent) if the base units are redefined in terms of other units with the numerical factor always being unity.

==Metric system==

===Rational system and use of water===
The concept of coherence was only introduced into the metric system in the third quarter of the nineteenth century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherent – in particular the [[litre]] was 0.001&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the [[Hectare#Are|are]] (from which we get the [[hectare]]) was 100&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A precursor to the concept of coherence was however present in that the units of mass and length were related to each other through the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point.&lt;ref name=France1795&gt;{{cite web

The [[CGS system]] had two units of energy, the [[erg]] that was related to [[mechanics]] and the [[calorie]] that was related to [[thermal energy]], so only one of them (the erg, equivalent to the g⋅cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) could bear a coherent relationship to the base units. By contrast, coherence was a design aim of the SI, resulting in only one unit of energy being defined – the [[joule]].&lt;ref&gt;SI brochure, §1.2 Two classes of SI Units, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimension-related coherence===
Work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and others

Each variant of the metric system has a degree of coherence&amp;nbsp;– the various derived units being directly related to the base units without the need of intermediate conversion factors.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{citation

:''{{overset|force|F}}'' = ''{{overset|mass|m}}'' × ''{{overset|acceleration|a}}''
:''{{overset|energy|E}}'' = ''{{overset|force|F}}'' × ''{{overset|distance|d}}''
:''{{overset|power|P}}'' = ''{{overset|energy|E}}'' / ''{{overset|time|t}}''
hold without the introduction of constant factors. Once a set of coherent units have been defined, other relationships in physics that use those units will automatically be true – [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy equation]], {{math|1=''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, does not require extraneous constants when expressed in coherent units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Isaac Asimov]] wrote, "In the cgs system, a unit force is described as one that will produce an acceleration of 1 cm/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  on a mass of 1 gm. A unit force is therefore 1 cm/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  multiplied by 1 gm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are independent statements. The first is a definition; the second is not. The first implies that the constant of proportionality in the force law has a magnitude of one; the second implies that it is dimensionless. Asimov uses them both together to prove that it is the pure number one.

Asimov's conclusion is not the only possible one. In a system that uses the units foot (ft) for length, second (s) for time, pound (lb) for mass, and pound-force (lbf) for force, the law relating force (''F''), mass (''m''), and acceleration (''a'') is {{nowrap|1=''F'' = 0.031081 ''ma''}}. Since the proportionality constant here is dimensionless and the units in any equation must balance without any numerical factor other than one, it follows that 1 lbf = 1 lb⋅ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This conclusion appears paradoxical from the point of view of competing systems, according to which {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''ma''}} and {{nowrap|1=1 lbf = 32.174 lb⋅ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Although the pound-force is a coherent derived unit in this system according to the official definition, the system itself is not considered to be coherent because of the presence of the proportionality constant in the force law.

A variant of this system applies the unit s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ft to the proportionality constant. This has the effect of identifying the pound-force with the pound. The pound is then both a base unit of mass and a coherent derived unit of force. One may apply any unit one pleases to the proportionality constant. If one applies the unit s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/lb to it, then the foot becomes a unit of force. In a four-unit system ([[English engineering units]]), the pound and the pound-force are distinct base units, and the proportionality constant has the unit lbf⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(lb⋅ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

All these systems are coherent. One that is not is a three-unit system (also called English engineering units) in which ''F'' = ''ma'' that uses the pound and the pound-force, one of which is a base unit and the other, a noncoherent derived unit. In place of an explicit proportionality constant, this system uses conversion factors derived from the relation 1 lbf = 32.174 lb⋅ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In numerical calculations, it is indistinguishable from the four-unit system, since what is a proportionality constant in the latter is a conversion factor in the former. The relation among the numerical values of the quantities in the force law is {''F''} = 0.031081 {''m''} {''a''}, where the braces denote the numerical values of the enclosed quantities. Unlike in this system, in a coherent system, the relations among the numerical values of quantities are the same as the relations among the quantities themselves.

The following example concerns definitions of quantities and units. The (average) velocity (''v'') of an object is defined as the quantitative physical property of the object that is directly proportional to the distance (''d'') traveled by the object and inversely proportional to the time (''t'') of travel, i.e., ''v'' = ''kd''/''t'', where ''k'' is a constant that depends on the units used. Suppose that the meter (m) and the second (s) are base units; then the kilometer (km) and the hour (h) are noncoherent derived units. The meter per second (mps) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one meter in one second, and the kilometer per hour (kmph) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one kilometer in one hour. Substituting from the definitions of the units into the defining equation of velocity we obtain, 1 mps = ''k'' m/s and 1 kmph = ''k'' km/h = 1/3.6 ''k'' m/s = 1/3.6 mps. Now choose ''k'' = 1; then the meter per second is a coherent derived unit, and the kilometer per hour is a noncoherent derived unit. Suppose that we choose to use the kilometer per hour as the unit of velocity in the system. Then the system becomes noncoherent, and the numerical value equation for velocity becomes {''v''} = 3.6 {''d''}/{''t''}. Coherence may be restored, without changing the units, by choosing ''k'' = 3.6; then the kilometer per hour is a coherent derived unit, with 1 kmph = 1 m/s, and the meter per second is a noncoherent derived unit, with 1 mps = 3.6 m/s.

A definition of a physical quantity is a statement that determines the ratio of any two instances of the quantity. The specification of the value of any constant factor is not a part of the definition since it does not affect the ratio. The definition of velocity above satisfies this requirement since it implies that ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); thus if the ratios of distances and times are determined, then so is the ratio of velocities. A definition of a unit of a physical quantity is a statement that determines the ratio of any instance of the quantity to the unit. This ratio is the numerical value of the quantity or the number of units contained in the quantity. The definition of the meter per second above satisfies this requirement since it, together with the definition of velocity, implies that ''v''/mps = (''d''/m)/(''t''/s); thus if the ratios of distance and time to their units are determined, then so is the ratio of velocity to its unit. The definition, by itself, is inadequate since it only determines the ratio in one specific case; it may be thought of as exhibiting a specimen of the unit.

A new coherent unit cannot be defined merely by expressing it algebraically in terms of already defined units. Thus the statement, "the meter per second equals one meter divided by one second", is not, by itself, a definition. It does not imply that a unit of velocity is being defined, and if that fact is added, it does not determine the magnitude of the unit, since that depends on the system of units. In order for it to become a proper definition both the quantity and the defining equation, including the value of any constant factor, must be specified. After a unit has been defined in this manner, however, it has a magnitude that is independent of any system of units.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''cone of a functor''' is an abstract notion used to define the [[limit (category theory)|limit]] of that [[functor]]. Cones make other appearances in category theory as well.

==Definition==

Let ''F'' : ''J'' &amp;rarr; ''C'' be a [[diagram (category theory)|diagram]] in ''C''. Formally, a diagram is nothing more than a [[functor]] from ''J'' to ''C''. The change in terminology reflects the fact that we think of ''F'' as indexing a family of objects and [[morphism]]s in ''C''. The [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''J'' is thought of as an "index category".  One should consider this in analogy with the concept of an [[indexed family]] of objects in [[set theory]]. The primary difference is that here we have [[morphism]]s as well. Thus, for example, when ''J'' is a [[discrete category]], it corresponds most closely to the idea of an indexed family in set theory. Another common and more interesting example takes ''J'' to be a [[span (category theory)|span]]. ''J'' can also be taken to be the [[empty category]], leading to the simplest cones.

Let ''N'' be an object of ''C''. A '''cone''' from ''N'' to ''F'' is a family of morphisms
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_X\colon N \to F(X)\,&lt;/math&gt;
for each object ''X'' of ''J'' such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''J'' the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:

[[Image:Functor cone.svg|175px|center|Part of a cone from N to F]]

The (usually infinite) collection of all these triangles can
be (partially) depicted in the shape of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] with the apex ''N''. The cone ψ is sometimes said to have '''vertex''' ''N'' and '''base''' ''F''.

One can also define the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] notion of a '''cone''' from ''F'' to ''N'' (also called a '''co-cone''') by reversing all the arrows above. Explicitly, a co-cone from ''F'' to ''N'' is a family of morphisms
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_X\colon F(X)\to N\,&lt;/math&gt;
for each object ''X'' of ''J'' such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''J'' the following diagram commutes:

[[Image:Functor co-cone.svg|175px|center|Part of a cone from F to N]]

==Equivalent formulations==

At first glance cones seem to be slightly abnormal constructions in category theory. They are maps from an ''object'' to a ''functor'' (or vice versa). In keeping with the spirit of category theory we would like to define them as morphisms or objects in some suitable category. In fact, we can do both.

Let ''J'' be a small category and let ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; be the [[category of diagrams]] of type ''J'' in ''C'' (this is nothing more than a [[functor category]]). Define the [[diagonal functor]] Δ : ''C'' &amp;rarr; ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; as follows: Δ(''N'') : ''J'' &amp;rarr; ''C'' is the [[constant functor]] to ''N'' for all ''N'' in ''C''.

If ''F'' is a diagram of type ''J'' in ''C'', the following statements are equivalent:
* ψ is a cone from ''N'' to ''F''
* ψ is a [[natural transformation]] from Δ(''N'') to ''F''
* (''N'', ψ) is an object in the [[comma category]] (Δ &amp;darr; ''F'')

The dual statements are also equivalent:
* ψ is a co-cone from ''F'' to ''N''
* ψ is a [[natural transformation]] from ''F'' to Δ(''N'')
* (''N'', ψ) is an object in the [[comma category]] (''F'' &amp;darr; Δ)

These statements can all be verified by a straightforward application of the definitions. Thinking of cones as natural transformations we see that they are just morphisms in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; with source (or target) a constant functor.

== Category of cones ==

By the above, we can define the '''category of cones to ''F''''' as the comma category (Δ &amp;darr; ''F''). Morphisms of cones are then just morphisms in this category. This equivalence is rooted in the observation that a natural map between constant functors Δ(''N''), Δ(''M'') corresponds to a morphism between ''N'' and ''M''. In this sense, the diagonal functor acts trivially on arrows. In similar vein, writing down the definition of a natural map from a constant functor Δ(''N'') to ''F'' yields the same diagram as the above. As one might expect, a morphism from a cone (''N'', ψ) to a cone (''L'', φ) is just a morphism ''N'' &amp;rarr; ''L'' such that all the "obvious" diagrams commute (see the first diagram in the next section).

Likewise, the '''category of co-cones from ''F''''' is the comma category (''F'' &amp;darr; Δ).

== Universal cones ==

[[Limit (category theory)|Limits and colimits]] are defined as '''universal cones'''. That is, cones through which all other cones factor. A cone φ from ''L'' to ''F'' is a universal cone if for any other cone ψ from ''N'' to ''F'' there is a unique morphism from ψ to φ.

[[Image:Functor cone (extended).svg|250px|center]]

Equivalently, a universal cone to ''F'' is a [[universal morphism]] from &amp;Delta; to ''F'' (thought of as an object in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;), or a [[terminal object]] in (&amp;Delta;&amp;nbsp;&amp;darr;&amp;nbsp;''F'').

Dually, a cone φ from ''F'' to ''L'' is a universal cone if for any other cone ψ from ''F'' to ''N'' there is a unique morphism from φ to ψ.

[[Image:Functor co-cone (extended).svg|250px|center]]

Equivalently, a universal cone from ''F'' is a universal morphism from ''F'' to &amp;Delta;, or an [[initial object]] in (''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;darr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;).

The limit of ''F'' is a universal cone to ''F'', and the colimit is a universal cone from ''F''. As with all universal constructions, universal cones are not guaranteed to exist for all diagrams ''F'', but if they do exist they are unique up to a unique isomorphism (in the comma category (&amp;Delta;&amp;nbsp;&amp;darr;&amp;nbsp;''F'')).

==Biblical basis==
The basis for many creationists' beliefs is a literal or quasi-literal interpretation of the [[Old Testament]], especially from stories from the [[book of Genesis]]:

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1–2) describes how [[God]] brings the Universe into being in a series of creative acts over six days and places the first man and woman ([[Adam and Eve]]) in a divine garden (the [[Garden of Eden]]). This story is the basis of creationist cosmology and biology.
* The [[Genesis flood narrative]] (Genesis 6–9) tells how God destroys the world and all life through a great flood, saving representatives of each form of life by means of [[Noah's ark]]. This forms the basis of creationist geology, better known as [[flood geology]].

A further important element is the interpretation of the [[Biblical chronology]], the elaborate system of life-spans, "generations," and other means by which the Bible measures the passage of events from the creation (Genesis 1:1) to the [[Book of Daniel]], the last biblical book in which it appears. Recent decades have seen attempts to de-link creationism from the Bible and recast it as science; these include [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Carlson, Tremper Longman III, Science, Creation and the Bible: Reconciling Rival Theories of Origins, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-Christian forms of creationism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/creationism_1.shtml |title=Creationism and intelligent design |date=2 June 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Islamic creationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/science/03islam.html |title=Creationism, Minus a Young Earth, Emerges in the Islamic World |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[NY Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/16/darwin-evolution-china-politics |title=Darwinism, through a Chinese lens |first=Riazat |last=Butt |date=16 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Young Earth creationism===
{{Main|Young Earth creationism}}
[[File:ICR building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) is a young-Earth creationist organization.]]
Young Earth creationists such as [[Ken Ham]] and [[Doug Phillips]] believe that God created the Earth within the last ten thousand years, literally as described in the Genesis creation narrative, within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth and the universe their much longer [[timeline]]s.

The Christian organizations [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) and the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) both promote young Earth creationism in the US. Another organization with similar views, [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG)—based in both the U.S. and the [[United Kingdom]]—has opened the [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]], to promote young Earth creationism. [[Creation Ministries International]] promotes young Earth views in Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. Among [[Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], the [[List of Catholic creationist organisations|Kolbe Center]] for the Study of Creation promotes similar ideas. In 2007, Ken Ham founded the [[Creation Museum]] and [[Ark Encounter]] in northern [[Kentucky]].

===Old Earth creationism===
{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}
Old Earth creationism holds that the physical universe was created by God, but that the creation event described in the Book of Genesis is to be taken figuratively. This group generally believes that the [[age of the universe]] and the age of the Earth are as described by [[astronomer]]s and [[geologist]]s, but that details of [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary theory]] are questionable.&lt;ref name="Scott1999" /&gt;

Old Earth creationism itself comes in at least three types:&lt;ref name="Scott1999" /&gt;

====Gap creationism====
{{Main|Gap creationism}}
Gap creationism, also called "restoration creationism," holds that life was recently created on a pre-existing old Earth. This version of creationism relies on a particular interpretation of {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1–2|KJV}}. It is considered that the words [[Tohu wa-bohu|''formless'' and ''void'']] in fact denote waste and ruin, taking into account the original Hebrew and other places these words are used in the [[Old Testament]]. Genesis 1:1–2 is consequently translated:

: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." (Original act of creation.)
: "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."

Thus, the six days of creation (verse 3 onwards) start sometime after the Earth was "without form and void." This allows an indefinite "gap" of time to be inserted after the original creation of the universe, but prior to the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation according to Genesis]], (when present biological species and [[human]]ity were created). Gap theorists can therefore agree with the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the age of the Earth and universe, while maintaining a literal interpretation of the biblical text.

Some{{which|date=November 2013}} gap creationists expand the basic version of creationism by proposing a "primordial creation" of biological life within the "gap" of time. This is thought to be "the world that then was" mentioned in [[2 Peter]] 3:3–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Peter|3|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries of fossils and archaeological ruins older than 10,000 years are generally ascribed to this "world that then was," which may also be associated with [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. These views became popular with publications of Hebrew Lexicons such as ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', and Bible commentaries such as the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' and [[E. W. Bullinger|''The Companion Bible'']].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

====Day-age creationism====
{{Main|Day-age creationism}}
Day-age creationism states that the "six days" of the Book of Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather much longer periods (for instance, each "day" could be the equivalent of millions, or billions of years of human time). The physicist [[Gerald Schroeder]] is one such proponent of this view. This version of creationism often states that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "yôm," in the context of Genesis 1, can be properly interpreted as "age."

Strictly speaking, day-age creationism is not so much a version of creationism as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] option which may be combined with other versions of creationism such as progressive creationism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Progressive creationism====
{{Main|Progressive creationism}}
Progressive creationism holds that species have changed or evolved in a process continuously guided by God, with various ideas as to how the process operated—though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including the age of the Earth, but rejects much of modern [[evolutionary biology]] or looks to it for evidence that evolution by [[natural selection]] alone is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Organizations such as [[Reasons To Believe]], founded by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], promote this version of creationism.

Progressive creationism can be held in conjunction with [[hermeneutic]] approaches to the Genesis creation narrative such as the [[day-age creationism]] or [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|framework]]/metaphoric/poetic views.

===Philosophic and scientific creationism===
====Creation science====
{{Main|Creation science}}
Creation science, or initially scientific creationism, is a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2267227 | pmid=18059309 | doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7401131 | volume=8 | issue=12 | title=Taking on creationism.

Okasha's full statement is that "virtually all professional biologists regard creation science as a sham{{snd}}a dishonest and misguided attempt to promote religious beliefs under the guise of science, with extremely harmful educational consequences."&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in the 1960s with proponents aiming to have young Earth creationist beliefs taught in school science classes as a counter to teaching of evolution. Common features of creation science argument include: creationist cosmologies which accommodate a universe on the order of thousands of years old, criticism of [[radiometric dating]] through a technical argument about [[radiohalo]]s, explanations for the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] as a record of the [[Genesis flood narrative]] (see [[flood geology]]), and explanations for the present diversity as a result of pre-designed genetic variability and partially due to the rapid degradation of the perfect [[genome]]s God placed in "created kinds" or "[[Baraminology|Baramin]]" (see [[Creation science#Creationist biology|creationist biology]]) due to [[mutation]]s.

====Neo-creationism====
{{Main|Neo-creationism}}
Neo-creationism is a [[pseudoscientific]] movement which aims to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the [[scientific community]]. It aims to [[Framing (social sciences)|re-frame]] the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public-school curricula violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=morris_neo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=425 |title=Neocreationism |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |authorlink=Henry M.

One of the principal claims of neo-creationism propounds that ostensibly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] orthodox science, with a foundation in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], is actually a dogmatically [[atheism|atheistic]] [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.darwinreconsidered.org/media/MaterialistMythology.pdf |title= Darwinism is Materialist Mythology, Not Science |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=October 2004 |website= DarwinReconsidered.org |accessdate=Sep 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents argue that the [[scientific method]] excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards [[supernatural]] elements, thus effectively excluding religious insight from contributing to understanding the [[universe]]. This leads to an open and often hostile opposition to what neo-creationists term "[[Darwinism]]", which they generally mean to refer to [[evolution]], but which they may extend to include such concepts as [[abiogenesis]], [[stellar evolution]] and the [[Big Bang]] theory.

Unlike their philosophical forebears, neo-creationists largely do not believe in many of the traditional cornerstones of creationism such as a young Earth, or in a dogmatically [[Biblical inerrancy|literal interpretation of the Bible]].

ID originated as a re-branding of creation science in an attempt to avoid a series of court decisions ruling out the teaching of creationism in American public schools, and the Discovery Institute has run [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|a series of campaigns]] to change school curricula.&lt;ref name="Flank_April2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID: A Short Legal History |last=Flank |first=Lenny |website=Talk Reason |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=August 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, where curricula are under the control of state governments rather than local school boards, there was a public outcry when the notion of ID being taught in science classes was raised by the Federal Education Minister [[Brendan Nelson]]; the minister quickly conceded that the correct forum for ID, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Deborah |date=October 21, 2005 |title=Intelligent design not science: experts |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, teaching of intelligent design in public schools has been decisively ruled by a [[United States district court|federal district court]] to be in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]], the court found that intelligent design is not science and "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District |vol=04 |reporter=cv |opinion=2688 |date=December 20, 2005}}, [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 136 of 139|Curriculum, Conclusion, p. 136]].&lt;/ref&gt; and hence cannot be taught as an alternative to evolution in public school science classrooms under the jurisdiction of that court. This sets a [[Precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive precedent]], based on previous US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions in ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' and ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' (1968), and by the application of the [[Lemon v.

===Geocentrism===
{{Main|Geocentric model}}
In [[astronomy]], the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, or the Ptolemaic system), is a description of the [[Cosmos]] where Earth is at the orbital center of all celestial bodies. This model served as the predominant cosmological system in many ancient civilizations such as [[ancient Greece]]. As such, they assumed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and [[Classical planet|naked eye planets]] circled Earth, including the noteworthy systems of [[Aristotle]] (see [[Aristotelian physics]]) and [[Ptolemy]].

Articles arguing that geocentrism was the biblical perspective appeared in some early creation science newsletters associated with the Creation Research Society pointing to some passages in the Bible, which, when taken literally, indicate that the daily apparent motions of the Sun and the Moon are due to their actual motions around the Earth rather than due to the rotation of the Earth about its axis for example, [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:12 where the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and [[Psalms]] 93:1 where the world is described as immobile.&lt;ref name="Numbers1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L. |year=1993 |origyear=Originally published 1992; New York: [[Alfred A.

=== Omphalos hypothesis ===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The Omphalos hypothesis argues that in order for the world to be functional, God must have created a mature Earth with mountains and canyons, rock strata, trees with growth rings, and so on; therefore ''no'' evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the Earth and age of the universe can be taken as reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gosse 1857|Gosse 1857]]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has seen some revival in the 20th century by some modern creationists, who have extended the argument to address the [[Creationist cosmologies#Starlight problem|"starlight problem"]]. The idea has been criticised as [[Last Thursdayism]], and on the grounds that it requires a deliberately deceptive creator.

==Theistic evolution==
{{Main|Theistic evolution}}
Theistic evolution, or evolutionary creation, is a belief that "the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sweet &amp; Feist 2007|Sweet &amp; Feist 2007]], [https://books.google.com/?id=qwaRUNj6S34C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=theistic+evolution+evolutionary+creation#v=onepage&amp;q=theistic%20evolution%20evolutionary%20creation&amp;f=false p. 48], "''Evolutionary Creation'' (or Theistic Evolution) asserts that the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Scientific Affiliation:

Through the 19th century the term ''creationism'' most commonly referred to [[Creationism (soul)|direct creation of individual souls]], in contrast to [[traducianism]]. Following the publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', there was interest in ideas of Creation by [[divine law]]. In particular, the [[liberal Christianity|liberal theologian]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that this illustrated the Creator's power better than the idea of miraculous creation, which he thought ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; When ''On the Origin of Species'' was published, the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote of evolution as "just as noble a conception of Deity."&lt;ref name="Darwinanddesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |title=Darwin and design: historical essay |year=2007 |website=Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=Cambridge University Library |location=Cambridge, UK |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021101910/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2534 |title=Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] were favoured as being more compatible with purpose than natural selection.&lt;ref name="bowl202"&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], pp. 202–08&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theists took the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and creation are compatible with some or all of modern scientific theory, including specifically evolution; it is also known as "evolutionary creation." In Evolution versus Creationism, [[Eugenie Scott]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] state that it is in fact a type of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 2005|Scott 2005]], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

It generally views evolution as a tool used by God, who is both the [[Unmoved mover#First cause|first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the day-age creationist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of the Book of Genesis should not be interpreted as a "literal" description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or allegory.

From a theistic viewpoint, the underlying laws of nature were designed by God for a purpose, and are so self-sufficient that the complexity of the entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles in processes such as [[stellar evolution]], life forms developed in biological evolution, and in the same way the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life by natural causes]] has resulted from these laws.&lt;ref name="The Origin of Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/originoflife.html#intro |title=The Origin of Life |last=Moritz |first=Albrecht |date=October 31, 2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one form or another, theistic evolution is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline [[Protestantism|Protestant]] seminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 1999|Scott 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; For Roman Catholics, human evolution is not a matter of religious teaching, and must stand or fall on its own scientific merits. [[Catholic Church and evolution|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]] are not in conflict. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] comments positively on the theory of evolution, which is neither precluded nor required by the sources of faith, stating that scientific studies "have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akin |first=Jimmy |date=January 2004 |title=Evolution and the Magisterium |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |journal=[[Catholic Answers|This Rock]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |issn=1049-4561 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804102139/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |archivedate=2007-08-04 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] schools teach evolution without controversy on the basis that scientific knowledge does not extend beyond the physical, and scientific truth and religious truth cannot be in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guntzel |first=Jeff Severns |url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005a/032505/032505ssn.htm |date=March 25, 2005 |title=Catholic schools steer clear of anti-evolution bias |newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]] |location=Kansas City, MO |publisher=The National Catholic Reporter Publishing Company |issn=0027-8939 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic evolution can be described as "creationism" in holding that [[Miracle|divine intervention]] brought about the origin of life or that divine laws govern formation of species, though many creationists (in the strict sense) would deny that the position is creationism at all. In the [[creation–evolution controversy]], its proponents generally take the "evolutionist" side. This sentiment was expressed by Fr. [[George Coyne]], (the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]'s chief astronomer between 1978 and 2006):&lt;blockquote&gt;...in America, creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis. Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in a belief that everything depends upon God, or better, all is a gift from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18504 |title=Text of talk by Vatican Observatory director on 'Science Does Not Need God.

While supporting the [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] inherent in modern science, the proponents of theistic evolution reject the implication taken by some [[atheism|atheists]] that this gives credence to [[Ontology|ontological]] [[materialism]].

&lt;/ref&gt; churches have made statements in favor of evolutionary theory, as have scholars such as the physicist [[John Polkinghorne]], who argues that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier supporters of evolutionary theory include [[Frederick Temple]], Asa Gray and Charles Kingsley who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories upon their publication,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polkinghorne 1998|Polkinghorne 1998]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the French Jesuit priest and geologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories. Another example is that of [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theology]], not providing any creation models, but instead focusing on the [[symbol]]ism in beliefs of the time of authoring Genesis and the cultural environment.

Many Christians and Jews had been considering the idea of the creation history as an allegory (instead of historical) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. For example, Philo, whose works were taken up by early Church writers, wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.&lt;ref name="Philo_Chapter2"&gt;[[#Philo|Philo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.earlychurch.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/philo.php |title=Philo of Alexandria (c. 20&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}}c.

In the US, Evangelical Christians have continued to believe in a literal Genesis. Members of evangelical Protestant (70%), [[Mormons|Mormon]] (76%) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (90%) denominations are the most likely to reject the evolutionary interpretation of the origins of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2008 |title=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey |url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Social and Political Views |page=95 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-19}} Report 2: Religious Beliefs &amp; Practices, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses adhere to a combination of [[gap creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]], asserting that scientific evidence about the age of the universe is compatible with the Bible, but that the 'days' after Genesis 1:1 were each thousands of years in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|title=Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses|date=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810862692|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx6nUwZzeCsC&amp;pg=PA37|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic Christian literal interpretation of creation requires the harmonization of the two creation stories, Genesis 1:1–2:3 and Genesis 2:4–25, for there to be a consistent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2194 |title=Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? |last=Jackson |first=Wayne |website=Apologetics Press |location=Montgomery, Al |accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |last=Tobin |first=Paul N. |year=2000 |title=The Creation Myths: Internal Difficulties |website=The Rejection of Pascal's Wager: A Skeptic's Guide to Christianity |publisher=Paul Tobin |location=Singapore |accessdate=2014-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008175621/http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |archivedate=2014-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes seek to ensure that their belief is taught in science classes, mainly in American schools. Opponents reject the claim that the literalistic biblical view meets the criteria required to be considered scientific. Many religious groups teach that God created the Cosmos. From the days of the early Christian Church Fathers there were allegorical interpretations of the Book of Genesis as well as literal aspects.&lt;ref name="rsf"&gt;[[#Forster &amp; Marston 1999|Forster &amp; Marston 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]], a system of thought and practice derived from the writings of [[Mary Baker Eddy]], interprets the Book of Genesis figuratively rather than literally. It holds that the material world is an illusion, and consequently not created by God: the only real creation is the spiritual realm, of which the material world is a distorted version. Christian Scientists regard the story of the creation in the Book of Genesis as having symbolic rather than literal meaning. According to Christian Science,  both creationism and evolution are false from an absolute or "spiritual" point of view, as they both proceed from a (false) belief in the reality of a material universe. However, Christian Scientists do not oppose the teaching of evolution in schools, nor do they demand that alternative accounts be taught: they believe that both material science and literalist theology are concerned with the illusory, mortal and material, rather than the real, immortal and spiritual. With regard to material theories of creation, Eddy showed a preference for Darwin's theory of evolution over others.&lt;ref name=S&amp;Hp547&gt;[[#Eddy 1934|Eddy 1934]], p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hindu views on evolution}}
According to Hindu creationism, all species on Earth including humans have "devolved" or come down from a high state of pure [[consciousness]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGrath 2010|McGrath 2010]], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: "Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu creationism is a form of old Earth creationism, according to Hindu creationists the universe may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]], the creation myths of which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carper &amp; Hunt 2009|Carper &amp; Hunt 2009]], p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dasgupta 1922|Dasgupta 1922]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic views on evolution}}
[[Islamic views on evolution|Islamic creationism]] is the belief that the universe (including humanity) was directly created by [[God in Islam|God]] as explained in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. It usually views the Book of Genesis as a corrupted version of God's message. The creation myths in the Qur'an are vaguer and allow for a wider range of interpretations similar to those in other Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Islam also has its own school of theistic evolutionism, which holds that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Some [[Muslims]] believe in evolutionary creation, especially among [[liberal movements within Islam]].&lt;ref name="Huffpo"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Drake Bennett noted: "Without a Book of Genesis to account for ... Muslim creationists have little interest in proving that the age of the Earth is measured in the thousands rather than the billions of years, nor do they show much interest in the problem of the dinosaurs. And the idea that animals might evolve into other animals also tends to be less controversial, in part because there are passages of the Koran that seem to support it. But the issue of whether human beings are the product of evolution is just as fraught among Muslims."&lt;ref name="Bennett 4"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennett |first=Drake |date=October 25, 2009 |title=Islam's Darwin problem |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |location=Boston, MA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030044754/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |archivedate=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Muslims, such as [[Adnan Oktar]] (also known as Harun Yahya), do not agree that one species can develop from another.&lt;ref name="PrizeforFossil"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/3102103/Creationist-Adnan-Oktar-offers-trillion-pound-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution.html |last=Irvine |first=Chris |date=September 29, 2008 |title=Creationist Adnan Oktar offers trillion-pound prize for fossil proof of evolution |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian0104&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 7, 2004 |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html |title=Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools |newspaper=The Guardian |type=Conferences |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmadiyya====
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement actively promotes evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="Masood_Ch13"&gt;[[#Masood 1994|Masood 1994]], [http://www.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html Chapter 13, "Every Wind of Doctrine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208191324/http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |date=2013-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadis interpret scripture from the Qur'an to support the concept of [[macroevolution]] and give precedence to scientific theories. Furthermore, unlike orthodox Muslims, Ahmadis believe that humans have gradually evolved from different species. Ahmadis regard [[Adam]] as being the first Prophet of God{{spaced ndash}}as opposed to him being the first man on Earth.&lt;ref name="Masood_Ch13" /&gt; Rather than wholly adopting the theory of natural selection, Ahmadis promote the idea of a "guided evolution," viewing each stage of the evolutionary process as having been selectively woven by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf |title=Guided Evolution: Proof From Punctuated Equilibrium |last1=Lahaye |first1=Ataul Wahid |last2=Shah |first2=Zia H. |website=Al Islam |publisher=[[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] |location=London |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' (1998) that evolution did occur but only through God being the One who brings it about. It does not occur itself, according to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on evolution}}
For [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who seek to reconcile discrepancies between science and the creation myths in the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the [[Torah]] and if there seems to be a problem, [[Epistemology|epistemological]] limits are to blame for apparently irreconcilable points. They point to discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They note that even the root word for "world" in the [[Hebrew language]]—עולם (Olam)—means hidden—נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they know from the Torah that God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their observed state, so too can they know that the world was created in its over the six days of Creation that reflects progression to its currently-observed state, with the understanding that physical ways to verify this may eventually be identified. This knowledge has been advanced by Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]], former philosophy professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Also, relatively old [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the first-century [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]]. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the [[Sefer HaTemunah]], including the medieval Jewish scholar [[Nahmanides]], his close student [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]], and [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]]. Other parallels are derived, among other sources, from Nahmanides, who expounds that there was a [[Neanderthal]]-like species with which Adam mated (he did this long before Neanderthals had even been discovered scientifically).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aviezer 1990|Aviezer 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carmell &amp; Domb 1976|Carmell &amp; Domb 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schroeder 1998|Schroeder 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tigay |first=Jeffrey H. |date=Winter 1987–1988 |title=Genesis, Science, and 'Scientific Creationism' |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jtigay/sci.htm |journal=[[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=20–27 |issn=0010-6542 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] does not take the Torah as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic or open-ended work.

Some contemporary writers such as Rabbi Gedalyah Nadel have sought to reconcile the discrepancy between the account in the Torah, and scientific findings by arguing that each day referred to in the Bible was not 24 hours, but billions of years long.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the Earth was created a few thousand years ago, but was deliberately made to look as if it was five billion years old, e.g. by being created with ready made fossils. The best known exponent of this approach being Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;   Others state that although the world was physically created in six 24 hour days, the Torah accounts can be interpreted to mean that there was a period of billions of years before the six days of creation.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, pp. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{main|Bahai Faith and science#Creation}}
In the creation myth taught by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]] founder, the universe has "neither beginning nor ending," and that the component elements of the material world have always existed and will always exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982|`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982]], [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-79.html#gr8 p. 220]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to evolution and the origin of human beings, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] gave extensive comments on the subject when he addressed western audiences in the beginning of the 20th century. Transcripts of these comments can be found in ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', ''[[Paris Talks]]'' and ''The Promulgation of Universal Peace''. `Abdu'l-Bahá described the human species as having evolved from a primitive form to modern man, but that the capacity to form human intelligence was always in existence.

Poland saw a major controversy over creationism in 2006, when the Deputy Education Minister, [[Mirosław Orzechowski]], denounced evolution as "one of many lies" taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of Education [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, "as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory."

Besides the US the study also compared data from 32 European countries, Turkey, and Japan. The only country where acceptance of evolution was lower than in the US was Turkey (25%).&lt;ref name="Science survey" /&gt;

====Education controversies====
[[File:Truth fish.jpg|thumb|right|The Truth fish, one of the many creationist responses to the [[Parodies of the ichthys symbol|Darwin fish]] ]]
{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
In the US, creationism has become centered in the political controversy over [[Creation and evolution in public education#United States|creation and evolution in public education]], and whether teaching creationism in science classes conflicts with the separation of church and state. Currently, the controversy comes in the form of whether advocates of the intelligent design movement who wish to "[[Teach the Controversy]]" in science classes have conflated [[Relationship between religion and science|science with religion]].&lt;ref name="kitz" /&gt;

[[People for the American Way]] polled 1500 North Americans about the teaching of evolution and creationism in November and December 1999. They found that most North Americans were not familiar with Creationism, and most North Americans had heard of evolution, but many did not fully understand the basics of the theory. The main findings were:

In such political contexts, creationists argue that their particular religiously based origin belief is superior to those of other [[belief system]]s, in particular those made through secular or scientific rationale. Political creationists are opposed by many individuals and organizations who have made detailed critiques and given testimony in various court cases that the [[objections to evolution|alternatives to scientific reasoning offered by creationists]] are opposed by the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] of the scientific community.&lt;ref name="aaas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|date=February 16, 2006|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|location=Washington, D.C.|format=PDF|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221125539/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|archivedate=2006-02-21|accessdate=2014-03-09}}

==Criticism==
===Christian criticism===
Most Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring and Proclaiming the Apostles' Creed |first1=Roger |last1=van Harn |first2=David F. |last2=Ford |first3=Colin E. |last3=Gunton |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8192-8116-6 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ Extract of page 44]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism |first1=Aron |last1=Ra |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-63431-079-6 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182 Extract of page 182]&lt;/ref&gt; Several religious organizations, among them the [[Catholic Church]], hold that their faith does not conflict with the scientific consensus regarding evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion |title=Statements from Religious Organizations |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2011-03-10|date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]], which has collected more than 13,000 signatures, is an "endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can be compatible."

In his 2002 article "Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem," George Murphy argues against the view that life on Earth, in all its forms, is direct evidence of God's act of creation (Murphy quotes [[Phillip E. Johnson]]'s claim that he is speaking "of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence."). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as "the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of Christ." The basis of this theology is [[Isaiah]] 45:15, "Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour."

Murphy observes that the execution of a Jewish carpenter by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities is in and of itself an ordinary event and did not require [[Miracle|divine action]]. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or "empty" himself. It was for this reason that [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote, in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:5-8:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murphy concludes that,&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the Son of God limited himself by taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine action in the world to be in accord with rational laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|''methodological'' naturalism]], meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a [[Metaphysical naturalism|''metaphysical'' naturalism]], which proposes that nature is all that there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=George L. |year=2002 |title=Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem |url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/nrcse/IDTHG.html |journal=Covalence: The Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science and Technology |volume=IV |issue=2 |oclc=52753579 |accessdate=2014-03-31}} Reprinted with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit priest [[George Coyne]] has stated that is "unfortunate that, especially here in America, creationism has come to mean...some literal interpretation of Genesis." He argues that "...Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in belief that everything depends on God, or better, all is a gift from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Brendan|title=From Big Bang to Big Mystery: Human Origins in the Light of Creation and Evolution|date=2012|publisher=New City Press of the Focolare|isbn=978-1565484337|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching of creationism===
Other Christians have expressed qualms about teaching creationism. In March 2006, then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the leader of the world's Anglicans, stated his discomfort about teaching creationism, saying that creationism was "a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories." He also said: "My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it." The views of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]{{snd}}a major American-based branch of the Anglican Communion{{snd}}on teaching creationism resemble those of Williams.&lt;ref name="Archbishop_2006" /&gt;

In April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well as other "worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23, 2010 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randy Moore and Sehoya Cotner, from the biology program at the [[University of Minnesota]], reflect on the relevance of teaching creationism in the article "The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism?" They conclude that "Despite decades of science education reform, numerous legal decisions declaring the teaching of creationism in public-school science classes to be unconstitutional, overwhelming evidence supporting evolution, and the many denunciations of creationism as nonscientific by professional scientific societies, creationism remains popular throughout the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Randy |last2=Cotner |first2=Sehoya |date=May 2009 |title=The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism? |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=429–35 |doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.5.10 |issn=0006-3568 |jstor=25502451|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific criticism===
{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Science is a system of knowledge based on observation, empirical evidence, and the development of theories that yield testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is often based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=12 p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists.&lt;ref name="SEaC"&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=10 p. 10], "In science, explanations must be based on naturally occurring phenomena. Natural causes are, in principle, reproducible and therefore can be checked independently by others. If explanations are based on purported forces that are outside of nature, scientists have no way of either confirming or disproving those explanations."&lt;/ref&gt; However, many creationist beliefs can be framed as testable predictions about phenomena such as the age of the Earth, its [[geological history of Earth|geological history]] and the origins, [[biogeography|distributions]] and [[Phylogenetics|relationships]] of living organisms found on it. [[History of science|Early science]] incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually [[Falsifiability|falsified]] and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html |title=An Index to Creationist Claims |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |year=2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Futuyma 2005|Futuyma 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref name="RoA"&gt;[[#Gould 1999|Gould 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider science and religion to be two compatible and complementary fields, with authorities in distinct areas of human experience, so-called [[non-overlapping magisteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=March 1997 |title=Nonoverlapping Magisteria |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |volume=106 |pages=16–22 |issue=3 |issn=0028-0712 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also held by many theologians, who believe that [[Unmoved mover|ultimate origins]] and [[meaning of life|meaning]] are addressed by religion, but favor verifiable scientific explanations of natural phenomena over those of creationist beliefs. Other scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dawkins 2006|Dawkins 2006]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; reject the non-overlapping magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts as a source of truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the scientific consensus is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.&lt;ref name="RoyalSociety_2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|title=Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design|date=April 11, 2006|website=[[Royal Society]]|publisher=Royal Society|location=London|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602213726/http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|archivedate=2008-06-02|accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism |title=Ten Major Court Cases about Evolution and Creationism |last1=Matsumura |first1=Molleen |last2=Mead |first2=Louise |date=February 14, 2001 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2008-11-04}} Updated 2007-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |title=Ann Coulter: No evidence for evolution? |last=Myers |first=PZ |authorlink=PZ Myers |date=June 18, 2006 |website=[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] |publisher=[[ScienceBlogs|ScienceBlogs LLC]] |type=Blog |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809011055/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |archivedate=August 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a prism, [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] causes different colors to [[refraction|refract]] at different angles, splitting white light into a rainbow of colors.]]
In [[physical sciences]] and [[electrical engineering]], '''dispersion relations''' describe the effect of [[#Dispersion|dispersion]] in a medium on the properties of a wave traveling within that medium. A dispersion relation relates the [[wavelength]] or [[wavenumber]] of a wave to its [[frequency]]. From this relation the [[phase velocity]] and [[group velocity]] of the wave have convenient expressions which then determine the [[refractive index]] of the medium. More general than the geometry-dependent and material-dependent dispersion relations, there are the overarching [[Kramers–Kronig relation]]s that describe the frequency dependence of [[wave propagation]] and [[attenuation]].

Dispersion may be caused either by geometric boundary conditions ([[waveguide]]s, shallow water) or by interaction of the waves with the transmitting medium. [[Elementary particle]]s, considered as [[matter wave]]s, have a nontrivial dispersion relation even in the absence of geometric constraints and other media.

In the presence of dispersion, wave velocity is no longer uniquely defined, giving rise to the distinction of [[phase velocity]] and [[group velocity]].

==Dispersion==
{{main|Dispersion (optics)|Dispersion (water waves)|Acoustic dispersion}}
Dispersion occurs when pure plane waves of different wavelengths have different propagation velocities, so that a [[wave packet]] of mixed wavelengths tends to spread out in space. The speed of a plane wave, ''v'', is a function of the wave's wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;v = v(\lambda).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The wave's speed, wavelength, and frequency, ''f'', are related by the identity

:&lt;math&gt;v(\lambda) = \lambda\ f(\lambda).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt; f(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; expresses the dispersion relation of the given medium. Dispersion relations are more commonly expressed in terms of the [[angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega=2\pi f&lt;/math&gt; and [[wavenumber]] &lt;math&gt;k=2 \pi /\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Rewriting the relation above in these variables gives

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(k)= v(k)\ k.\,&lt;/math&gt;

where we now view ''f'' as a function of ''k''. The use of ω(''k'') to describe the dispersion relation has become standard because both the [[phase velocity]] ω/''k'' and the [[group velocity]] dω/d''k'' have convenient representations via this function.

The plane waves being considered can be described by

:&lt;math&gt;A(x, t) = A_0e^{2 \pi i \frac{x - v t}{\lambda}}= A_0e^{i (k x - \omega t)},&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''A'' is the amplitude of the wave,
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''(0,0),
:''x'' is a position along the wave's direction of travel, and
:''t'' is the time at which the wave is described.

==Plane waves in vacuum==

Plane waves in vacuum are the simplest case of wave propagation: no geometric constraint, no interaction with a transmitting medium.

===Electromagnetic waves in a vacuum===

For [[electromagnetic wave]]s in vacuum, the angular frequency is proportional to the wavenumber:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = c k.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is a ''linear'' dispersion relation. In this case, the phase velocity and the group velocity are the same:

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{d\omega}{d k} = c;&lt;/math&gt;

they are given by ''c'', the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, a frequency-independent constant.

===De Broglie dispersion relations===

[[Image:KEvsMOMENTUM.png|thumb|350px|right|The free-space dispersion plot of kinetic energy versus momentum, for many objects of everyday life.]]

Total energy, momentum, and mass of particles are connected through the [[Energy-momentum relation|relativistic dispersion relation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;E^2 = \left(mc^2\right)^2 + \left(pc\right)^2\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Taylor| title=Classical Mechanics|publisher=University Science Books|page= 652| isbn=1-891389-22-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which in the ultrarelativistic limit is
: &lt;math&gt; E = p c\,&lt;/math&gt;

and in the nonrelativistic limit is

: &lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 + \frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the rest mass.  In the nonrelativistic limit, &lt;math&gt;m c^2&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;p^2/2 m&lt;/math&gt; is the familiar kinetic energy expressed in terms of the momentum &lt;math&gt;p = m v&lt;/math&gt;.

The transition from [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic]] to nonrelativistic behaviour shows up as a slope change from ''p'' to ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as shown in the log-log dispersion plot of ''E'' vs. ''p''.

Elementary particles, atomic nuclei, atoms, and even molecules behave in some contexts as matter waves. According to the [[de Broglie relations]], their [[kinetic energy]] ''E'' can be expressed as a frequency ''ω'', and their [[momentum]] ''p'' as a wavenumber ''k'', using the reduced [[Planck constant]] ħ:

: &lt;math&gt;E = \hbar\omega,\quad p = \hbar k.&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, angular frequency and wavenumber are connected through a dispersion relation,
which in the nonrelativistic limit reads

: &lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}.&lt;/math&gt;

! ''Animation:'' phase and group velocity of electrons
|-
| [[Image:deBroglie3.gif|frame|center]]
This animation portrays the de Broglie phase and group velocities (in slow motion) of three free electrons traveling over a field 0.4 Ångstroms in width. The momentum per unit mass (proper velocity) of the middle electron is lightspeed, so that its group velocity is 0.707 ''c''. The top electron has twice the momentum, while the bottom electron has half.  Note that as the momentum increases, the phase velocity decreases down to ''c'', whereas the group velocity increases up to ''c'', until the wave packet and its phase maxima move together near the speed of light, whereas the wavelength continues to decrease without bound. Both transverse and longitudinal coherence widths (packet sizes) of such high energy electrons in the lab may be orders of magnitude larger than the ones shown here.

==Frequency versus wavenumber==
As mentioned above, when the focus in a medium is on refraction rather than absorption—that is, on the real part of the [[refractive index]]—it is common to refer to the functional dependence of angular frequency on wavenumber as the ''dispersion relation''. For particles, this translates to a knowledge of energy as a function of momentum.

===Waves and optics===
{{See|Dispersion (optics)}}
The name "dispersion relation" originally comes from [[optics]]. It is possible to make the effective speed of light dependent on wavelength by making light pass through a material which has a non-constant [[index of refraction]], or by using light in a non-uniform medium such as a [[waveguide]]. In this case, the waveform will spread over time, such that a narrow pulse will become an extended pulse, i.e., be dispersed. In these materials, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[group velocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=F. A. Jenkins and H. E. White |date=1957|title=Fundamentals of optics|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York| page=223| isbn=0-07-032330-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and corresponds to the speed at which the peak of the pulse  propagates, a value different from the [[phase velocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= R. A. Serway, C. J. Moses and C. A. Moyer |year=1989| title=Modern Physics| publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|page= 118|isbn= 0-534-49340-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep water waves===
{{See|Dispersion (water waves)|Airy wave theory}}
[[Image:Wave group.gif|frame|right|Frequency dispersion of surface gravity waves on deep water. The {{colorbull|red|circle}} red dot moves with the phase velocity, and the {{colorbull|limegreen|circle}} green dots propagate with the group velocity. In this deep-water case, the phase velocity is twice the group velocity. The {{colorbull|red|circle}} red dot traverses the figure in the time it takes the green dot to traverse half.]]

The dispersion relation for deep [[ocean surface wave|water waves]] is often written as 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{g k},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity. Deep water, in this respect, is commonly denoted as the case where the water depth is larger than half the wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Water wave mechanics for engineers and scientists | author=R. G. Dean and R. A. Dalrymple | year=1991 | series=Advanced Series on Ocean Engineering | volume=2 | publisher=World Scientific, Singapore | isbn=978-981-02-0420-4 }} See page 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the phase velocity is

:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \frac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the group velocity is

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{d{\omega}}{dk} = \frac{1}{2} v_p.&lt;/math&gt;

===Waves on a string===
{{See|Vibrating string}}
[[Image:Two-frequency beats of a non-dispersive transverse wave (animated).gif|frame|right|Two-frequency beats of a non-dispersive transverse wave. Since the wave is non-dispersive, {{colorbull|red|circle}} phase and {{colorbull|limegreen|circle}} group velocities are equal.]]

For an ideal string, the dispersion relation can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\omega = k \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the tension force in the string and ''μ'' is the string's mass per unit length. As for the case of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, ideal strings are thus a non-dispersive medium i.e., the phase and group velocities are equal and independent (to first order) of vibration frequency.

For a nonideal string, where stiffness is taken into account, the dispersion relation is written as

: &lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = \frac{T}{\mu} k^2 + \alpha k^4&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant that depends on the string.

===Solid state===
In the study of solids, the study of the dispersion relation of electrons is of paramount importance. The periodicity of crystals means that many [[Fermi surface|levels of energy]] are possible for a given momentum and that some energies might not be available at any momentum. The collection of all possible energies and momenta is known as the [[band structure]] of a material. Properties of the band structure define whether the material is an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], [[semiconductor]] or [[Conductor (material)|conductor]].

===Phonons===
Phonons are to sound waves in a solid what photons are to light: they are the quanta that carry it. The dispersion relation of [[phonon]]s is also non-trivial and important, being directly related to the acoustic and thermal properties of a material. For most systems, the phonons can be categorized into two main types: those whose bands become zero at the center of the [[Brillouin zone]] are called [[acoustic phonon]]s, since they correspond to classical sound in the limit of long wavelengths. The others are [[optical phonon]]s, since they can be excited by electromagnetic radiation.

===Electron optics===
With high energy (e.g., {{convert|200|keV|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) electrons in a [[transmission electron microscope]], the energy dependence of higher order [[Laue zone]] (HOLZ) lines in convergent beam [[electron diffraction]] (CBED) patterns allows one, in effect, to ''directly image'' cross-sections of a crystal's three-dimensional [[Brillouin zone|dispersion surface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=P. M. Jones, G. M. Rackham and J. W. Steeds | year=1977|title= Higher order Laue zone effects in electron diffraction and their use in lattice parameter determination| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society| volume=A 354
| page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Dynamical theory of diffraction|dynamical effect]] has found application in the precise measurement of lattice parameters, beam energy, and more recently for the electronics industry: lattice strain.

== History ==
[[Isaac Newton]] studied refraction in prisms but failed to recognize the material dependence of the dispersion relation, dismissing the work of another researcher whose measurement of a prism's dispersion did not match Newton's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton |first=Richard S. |last=Westfall |edition=illustrated, revised |publisher=Cambridge University |date=1983 |isbn=9780521274357 |page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispersion of waves on water was studied by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= A.D.D.

The universality of the [[Kramers-Kronig relation]]s (1926–27) became apparent with subsequent papers on the dispersion relation's connection to causality in the [[scattering theory]] of all types of waves and particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1103/PhysRev.104.1760 | author =  John S.

{{emotion}}

'''Ecstasy''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἔκστασις ''ékstasis'') is a subjective experience of total involvement of the subject, with an object of his or her awareness.  In classical Greek literature it refers to removal of the mind or body "from its normal place of function."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|page=505|author=H. S. Versnal|work=The Oxford Classical Dictionary|edition=Third, revised|title=ecstasy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total involvement with an object of interest is not an ordinary experience because of being aware of other objects, thus ecstasy is an example of an [[altered state of consciousness]] characterized by diminished awareness of other objects or the total lack of the awareness of surroundings and everything around the object. The word is also used to refer to any heightened state of consciousness or intensely pleasant experience. It is also used more specifically to denote states of awareness of non-ordinary mental spaces, which may be perceived as [[spirit]]ual (the latter type of ecstasy often takes the form of [[religious ecstasy]]).

==Description==
[[File:Guido Reni - St Filippo Neri in Ecstasy - WGA19295.jpg|thumb|St Filippo Neri in Ecstasy by Guido Reni]] 
From a psychological perspective, ecstasy is a loss of self-control and sometimes a temporary loss of consciousness, which is often associated with religious mysticism, sexual intercourse and the use of certain drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ecstasy|title=Ecstasy|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For the duration of the ecstasy the ecstatic is out of touch with ordinary life and is capable neither of communication with other people nor of undertaking normal actions. The experience can be brief in physical time, or it can go on for hours. Subjective perception of time, space or self may strongly change or disappear during ecstasy. For instance, if one is concentrating on a physical task, then any intellectual thoughts may cease. On the other hand, making a spirit journey in an ecstatic trance involves the cessation of voluntary bodily movement.

[[File:Jean Benner, L'Extase ( Musée d'art moderne et contemporain de Strasbourg ).JPG|thumb|''Ecstasy'', by [[Jean Benner]] ([[Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art]])]]
Ecstasy can be deliberately induced using religious or creative activities, [[meditation]], [[music]], [[ecstatic dance|dancing]], breathing exercises, [[physical exercise]], [[sexual intercourse]] or consumption of [[psychotropic drug]]s. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually also associated with that individual's particular [[anthropology of religion|religious]] and [[culture|cultural traditions]]. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place due to occasional contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely beautiful or holy, or without any known reason. "In some cases, a person might obtain an ecstatic experience 'by mistake'. Maybe the person unintentionally triggers one of the, probably many, physiological mechanisms through which such an experience can be reached. In such cases, it is not rare to find that the person later, by reading, looks for an interpretation and maybe finds it within a tradition."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kaj |last=Björkqvist |title=Ecstasy from a Physiological Point of View |url=http://www.ex-premie2.org/papers/religious_ecstasy.htm |work=(Scripta Instituti Donneriani Aboensis XI: Religious Ecstasy. Based on Papers read at the Symposium on Religions Ecstasy held at Åbo, Finland, on the 26th-28th of August 1981. Edited by Nils G. Holm. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040914183254/http://www.ex-premie2.org/papers/religious_ecstasy.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People interpret the experience afterward according to their culture and beliefs (as a revelation from God, a trip to the world of spirits or a [[psychosis|psychotic episode]]). "When a person is using an ecstasy technique, he usually does so within a tradition. When he reaches an experience, a traditional interpretation of it already exists."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist" /&gt; The experience together with its subsequent interpretation may strongly and permanently change the value system and the worldview of the subject (e.g. to cause religious conversion).

In 1925, [[James Leuba]] wrote: "Among most uncivilized populations, as among civilized peoples, certain ecstatic conditions are regarded as divine possession or as union with the Divine. These states are induced by means of drugs, by physical excitement, or by psychical means. But, however produced and at whatever level of culture they may be found, they possess certain common features which suggest even to the superficial observer some profound connection. Always described as delightful beyond expression, these awesome ecstatic experiences end commonly in mental quiescence or even in total unconsciousness."  He prepares his readers "... to recognize a continuity of impulse, of purpose, of form and of result between the ecstatic intoxication of the savage and the absorption in God of the Christian mystic."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Leuba, "The Psychology of Religious Mysticism", p.8. Routledge, UK, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In everyday language, the word 'ecstasy' denotes an intense, euphoric experience. For obvious reasons, it is rarely used in a scientific context; it is a concept that is extremely hard to define."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">The '''extended mind thesis''' ('''EMT''') says that an agent's mind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor even body-bound, but extend into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonR&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/ |date=July 25, 2011}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Andy Clark|Clark]] and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] put it:

{{quote|Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?...We propose to pursue... an ''active externalism'', based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.|Andy Clark and David Chalmers: "[[The Extended Mind]]"&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3328150?sid=21105405194441&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739824&amp;uid=4 |title=The Extended Mind |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=1 |date=January 1998 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}; reprinted as: 
{{cite book |title= The Extended Mind |chapter=Chapter 2: The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |editor=Richard Menary  |pages=27–42 |isbn= 9780262014038 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010}}; and available on line as: {{cite web |title=The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=http://cogprints.org/320/1/extended.html |publisher=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question is raised as to the division point between the mind and the environment. The EMT proposes that some objects in the external environment are utilized by the [[mind]] in such a way that the objects can be seen as extensions of the mind itself. Specifically, the mind is seen to encompass every level of the cognitive process, which will often include the use of environmental aids.

==Criticism==

Philosophical arguments against the extended mind thesis include the following.&lt;ref name="Adams Aizawa"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ADADTB | title=Defending the bounds of cognition, in The Extended Mind (Eds, Richard Menary) |author1=Adams, Fred. |author2=Aizawa, Ken | year=2010 | pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# When focusing on cognition, the thesis confuses claims about what is constitutive about the concept of cognition with claims about causal influences on cognition (the "causal-constitutional fallacy"). For example, Adams and Aizawa (2010) write, "Question: Why did the pencil think that 2 + 2 = 4?, Clark’s Answer: Because it was coupled to the mathematician." 
# It stretches the limits of our ordinary concept of cognition too far ("cognitive bloating"), potentially implying that everything on the Internet is part of individual cognitive systems.
# It uses a coarse-grained functionalism about the mind that ignores plausible differences between internal and external processes, such as differences between beliefs and external props and devices; or for creating a notion of cognition too heterogeneous to make up a scientific natural kind.

Each of these arguments is addressed in Clark (2008), in which he notes:&lt;ref name="Supersizing"&gt;{{cite book | title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Clark, Andy | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# While coupling is important for cognition, that is not to say that it is sufficient – the coupling must play a functional role in cognition. Many couplings do not do so and thus would not be 'extensions' (and this is consistent with a strong extended mind thesis).
# Any putative part of a system – internal or external – is unlikely to yield "cognition" on its own. Thus, examples such as calculators, pencils, should be considered in parallel with neural regions. Simply looking at the part is not enough for cognition.
# One can imagine circumstances under which a biological being might retain information in non-neural ways (a hypothetical Martian with a bitmap-based memory, or humans with prosthetics to support memory). Thus, being neural cannot be a necessary condition for being cognitive.

While in ''Supersizing the Mind'' Clark defends a strong version of the hypothesis of [[extended cognition]] (contrasted with a hypothesis of embedded cognition) in other work, some of these objections have inspired more moderate reformulations of the extended mind thesis. Thus, the extended mind thesis may no longer depend on the parity considerations of Clark and Chalmers' original argument but, instead, emphasize the "complementarity" of internal and external elements of cognitive systems or processes. This version might be understood as emphasizing the explanatory value of the extended mind thesis for cognitive science rather than maintaining it as an ontological claim about the nature of mind or cognition.&lt;ref name="Supersizing" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33355">In a notable study of power conducted by [[social psychologist]]s [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]] in 1959, [[Power (social and political)|power]] is divided into five separate and distinct forms.  In 1965 Raven revised this model to include a sixth form by separating the informational power base as distinct from the expert power base.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010, 2006). Group Dynamics. Belmont: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relating to [[social communication]] studies, ''power'' in [[social influence]] settings has introduced a large realm of research pertaining to [[persuasion]] tactics and leadership practices. Through social communication studies, it has been theorized that leadership and power are closely linked. It has been further presumed that different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in [[organizational communication]] and throughout the workforce.  In a notable study of power conducted by social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven in 1959, power is divided into five separate and distinct forms.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt; They identified those five bases of power as ''coercive, reward, legitimate, referent, and expert''. This was followed by Raven's subsequent identification in 1965 of a sixth separate and distinct base of power: informational power.&lt;ref name=371-382&gt;Raven, B. H. (1965). Social influence and power. In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.),Current studies in social psychology (pp. 371–382). New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, French and Raven defined social influence as a change in the belief, attitude, or behavior of a person (the target of influence) which results from the action of another person (an influencing agent), and they defined social power as the potential for such influence, that is, the ability of the agent to bring about such a change using available resources.&lt;ref name=1242-49&gt;Raven, Bertram H. "Power, Six Bases of." Encyclopedia of Leadership.Ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2004. 1242-49. SAGE; Reference Online. Web. 30 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there have been many formal definitions of leadership that did not include [[social influence]] and power, any discussion of leadership must inevitably deal with the means by which a leader gets the members of a group or organization to act and move in a particular direction.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

Whereby, this is to be considered "power" in social influential situations.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Overview==
The original French and Raven (1959) model included five bases of power – reward, coercion, legitimate, expert, and referent – however, informational power was added by Raven in 1965, bringing the total to six.&lt;ref name=217-244&gt;Raven, Bertram H. (1992) "A power interaction model on interpersonal influence: French and Raven thirty years later". Journal of Social Behavior and Personality. Vol. 7, No. 2, 217-244&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the model has gone through very significant developments: coercion and reward can have personal as well as impersonal forms. Expert and referent power can be negative or positive. Legitimate power, in addition to position power, may be based on other normative obligations: reciprocity, equity, and responsibility. Information may be utilized in direct or indirect fashion.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

French and Raven defined social power as the potential for influence (a change in the belief, attitude or behavior of a someone who is the target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;

As we know [[leadership]] and power are closely linked.  This model shows how the different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in organizational communication and throughout the workforce. "The French-Raven power forms are introduced with consideration of the level of observability and the extent to which power is dependent or independent of structural conditions.  Dependency refers to the degree of internalization that occurs among persons subject to social control.  Using these considerations it is possible to link personal processes to structural conditions".&lt;ref name=Lazarsfeld&gt;Lazarsfeld, Paul. Menzel, Herbert. 1961. On the relation between individual and collective properties. pp 214–249 in Amitai Etzioni (ed.), Complex Organizations: A Sociological Reader. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original typology ==
The bases of social power have evolved over the years with benefits coming from advanced research and theoretical developments in related fields. On the basis of research and evidence, there have been many other developments and elaborations on the original theory. French and Raven developed an original model outlining the change dependencies and also further delineating each power basis.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Though it is a common understanding that most social influence can still be understood by the original six bases of power, the foundational bases have been elaborated and further differentiated.

==Bases of power==
As mentioned above, there are now six main concepts of power strategies consistently studied in social communication research. They are described as Coercive, Reward, Legitimate, Referent, Expert, and Informational.  Additionally, research has shown that [[source credibility]] has an explicit effect on the bases of power used in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Nesler, Mitchell S.; Aguinis, Herman; Quigley, Brian M.; Tedeschi, James T. (1993). "The Effect of Credibility on Perceived Power". Journal of Applied Social Psychology 23 (17): 1407–1425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Source credibility, the bases of power, and objective power, which is established based on variables such as position or title, are interrelated. The levels of each have a direct relationship in the manipulation and levels of one another.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The bases of power differ according to the manner in which social changes are implemented, the permanence of such changes, and the ways in which each basis of power is established and maintained.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The effectiveness of power is situational. Given there are six bases of power studied in the [[Communication]] field, it is very important to know the situational uses of each power, focusing on when each is most effective.  According to French and Raven, "it is of particular practical interest to know what bases of power or which power strategies are most likely to be effective, but it is clear that there is no simple answer.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

For example, a power strategy that works immediately but relies on surveillance (for example, reward power or coercive power) may not last once surveillance ends. One organizational study found that reward power tended to lead to greater satisfaction on the part of employees, which means that it might increase influence in a broad range of situations. Coercive power was more effective in influencing a subordinate who jeopardized the success of the overall organization or threatened the leader's authority, even though in the short term it also led to resentment on the part of the target. A power strategy that ultimately leads to private acceptance and long-lasting change (for example, information power) may be difficult to implement, and consume considerable time and energy. In the short term, complete reliance on information power might even be dangerous (for example, telling a small child not to run into the street unattended). A military officer leading his troops into combat might be severely handicapped if he had to give complete explanations for each move. Instead, he would want to rely on unquestioned legitimate position power, backed up by coercive power. Power resources, which may be effective for one leader, dealing with one target or follower, may not work for a different leader and follower. The manner in which the power strategy is utilized will also affect its success or failure. Where coercion is deemed necessary, a leader might soften its negative effects with a touch of humor. There have been studies indicating that cultural factors may determine the effectiveness of power strategies."&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;
             
=== Coercive power ===
{{Also|Coercive control}}
[[File:Blackbeard, Buccaneer - Cover.jpg|thumbnail|Blackbeard the infamous pirate]]
Coercive power uses the threat of force to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] from another. Force may include physical, social, emotional, political, or economic means. Coercion is not always recognized by the target of influence.&lt;ref name=Petress&gt;{{cite web|last=Petress|first=Ken|date=2003|title=Power: Definition, Typology, Description, Examples, and Implications|format=PDF|url=http://uthscsa.edu/gme/documents/powerdefinitionstypologyexamples.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is based upon the idea of [[coercion]]. The main idea behind this concept is that someone is forced to do something that he/she does not desire to do. The main goal of coercion is compliance. Coercive power's influence is socially dependent on how the target relates to the change being desired by the influence agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro&gt;Pierro, A., Cicero, L., &amp; Raven, B. Motivated Compliance With Bases of Social Power. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38, 1921-1944.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, a person would have to be consistently watched by the influencing agent in order for the change to remain in effect.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal coercion relates a person's belief that the influencing agent has the real power to physically threaten, impose a monetary fine or dismiss an employee.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal coercion relates to a threat of rejection or the possibility of disapproval from a person whom is highly valued.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

According to Changingminds.org "demonstrations of the harm are often used to illustrate what will happen if compliance is not gained".&lt;ref&gt;ChangingMinds. (2002–2009). Retrieved on May 5, 2009 from Changingminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} The power of coercion has been proven to be related with [[Punishment (psychology)|punitive behavior]] that may be outside one's normal role expectations.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; However coercion has also been associated positively with generally punitive behavior and negatively associated to contingent [[Reward system|reward behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, D. A., &amp; Sims, H. P. Perceptions of managerial power as a consequence of managerial behavior and reputation. Journal of Management 1983, 9, 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This source of power can often lead to problems and in many circumstances it involves [[abuse]].  These type of leaders rely on the use of threats in their [[leadership style]]. Often the threats involve saying someone will be fired or demoted.

=== Reward power ===
{{Also|Operant conditioning|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}
Reward power is based on the right of some to offer or deny tangible, social, emotional, or spiritual [[Reward system|rewards]] to others for doing what is wanted or expected of them. Some examples of reward power (positive reward) are: (a) a child is given a dollar for earning better grades; (b) a student is admitted into an honor society for excellent effort; (c) a retiree is praised and feted for lengthy service at a retirement party; and (d) New York firefighters were heralded as heroes for their acts on 9-11-01.[[File:Money 555.jpg|thumbnail]] Some examples of reward power (negative reward) are: (a) a driver is fined for illegal parking; (b) a teenager grounded for a week for misbehaving; (c) a rookie player is ridiculed for not following tradition; and (d) [[President Harding]]'s name is commonly invoked whenever [[political scandal]] is mentioned. Some pitfalls can emerge when a too heavy reliance is placed on reward power; these include: (a) some people become fixated and too dependent on rewards to do even mundane activities; (b) too severe fears of punishment can immobilize some people; (c) as time passes, past rewards become insufficient to motivate or activate desired outcomes; and (d) negative rewards may be perverted into positive attention.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal reward relates to promises of promotions, money and rewards from various social areas.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal reward relates to the reward of receiving approval from a desired person and building relationships with romantic partners.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

=== Legitimate power ===
{{Also|Legitimisation}}
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II - 1953-Dress.JPG|thumbnail|Queen Elizabeth II - 1953]]
Legitimate power comes from an elected, selected, or appointed position of authority and may be underpinned by [[social norms]].&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; This power which means the ability to administer to another certain feelings of [[obligation]] or the notion of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; "Rewarding and Punishing subordinates is generally seen as a legitimate part of the formal or appointed leadership role and most managerial positions in work organizations carry with them, some degree of expected reward and punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. (1990). Handbook of leadership (3rd ed.). New York: Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; This type of formal power relies on position in an authority [[hierarchy]]. Occasionally, those possessing legitimate power fail to recognize they have it, and may begin to notice others going around them to accomplish their goals.&lt;ref name="administration1998"&gt;Fuqua, E., Payne, K., &amp; Cangemi, J. (1998). Leadership and the effective use of power. National Forum of Educational Administration and Supervision Journal, 15E(4), 36-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Three bases of legitimate power are cultural values, acceptance of social structure, and designation.&lt;ref name=150-167&gt;French, J. and Raven, B. (1959). The Bases of Social Power. In Studies in Social Power, D. Cartwright, Ed., pp. 150-167. Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural values comprise a general basis for legitimate power of one entity over another.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; Such legitimacy is conferred by others and this [[Legitimation|legitimacy]] can be revoked by the original granters, their designees, or their inheritors.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Legitimate power originates from a target of influence accepting the power of the influencing agent whereas behavioral change or [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]] occurs based on target's obligation.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; One who uses legitimate power may have a high need for power which is their motivator to use this base for change in behavior and influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; There may be a range of legitimate power.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt;

==== Position ====
The legitimate position power is based on the social norm which requires people to be obedient to those who hold superior positions in a formal or informal social structure.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Examples may include: a [[Police legitimacy|police officer's legitimacy]] to make arrests; a parent's legitimacy to restrict a child's activities; the President's legitimacy to live in the White House; and the Congress' legitimacy to declare war. Some pitfalls can arise when too heavy reliance is placed on legitimate power; these include: (a) unexpected exigencies call for non-legitimized individuals to act in the absence of a legitimate authority – such as a citizen's arrest in the absence of a police official; and (b) military legitimacy&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Reciprocity ====
The legitimate power of reciprocity is based on the social norm of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Which states how we feel obligated to do something in return for someone who does something beneficial for us.&lt;ref&gt;Gouldner, A. (1960). The norm of reciprocity: A preliminary statement.
American Sociological Review, 47, 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). New York:
HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equity ====
The legitimate power of equity is based on the social norm of equity (or [[compensatory damages]])&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; The social norm of equity makes people feel compelled to compensate someone who has suffered or worked hard.&lt;ref&gt;Walster, E., Walster, G. W., &amp; Berscheid, E. (1978). Equity theory and
research. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as someone whom we have harmed in some way is based on the premise that there is a wrong that can be made right, which may be a compensatory form of righting the wrong.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz&gt;Berkowitz, L. and Daniels, L. (1963).  The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Vol 66(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dependence  ====
The legitimate power of dependence is based on the social norm of [[social responsibility]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Social responsibility norm states how people feel obligated to help someone who is in need of assistance.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz/&gt;

People traditionally obey the person with this power solely based on their role, position or title rather than the person specifically as a leader. Therefore, this type of power can easily be lost and the leader does not have his position or title anymore. This power is therefore not strong enough to be one's only form of influencing/persuading.

=== Referent power ===
{{Main article|Referent power}}
Referent power is rooted in the affiliations we make and/or the groups and organizations we belong to.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Our affiliation with a group and the beliefs of the group are shared to some degree. As Referent power emphasizes similarity, respect for an agent of influence's superiority may be undermined by a target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Use of this power base and its outcomes may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; An agent for change motivated with a strong need for affiliation and concern of likeability will prefer this power base and will influence their leadership style.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Ingratiation or flattery and sense of community may be used by an agent of influence to enhance their influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;
[[File:Reagans with Billy Graham.jpg|thumbnail|Reagans with Rev. Billy Graham]]

==== Positive ====
Referent power in a positive form utilizes the shared personal connection or shared belief between the influencing agent and target with the intention of positively correlated actions of the target.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Negative ====
Referent power in a negative form produces actions in opposition to the intent of the influencing agent, this is the result from the agent's creation of [[cognitive dissonance]] between the referent influencing agent and the target's perception of that influence.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Examples of referent power include: (a) each of the last seven White House press secretaries have been paid handsomely for their memoirs relating to their presence at the seat of government; (b) Mrs. Hillary Clinton gained political capital by her marriage to the President; (c) Reverend Pat Robertson lost a bid for the Republican Party's nomination for President due, in significant part, to his religious affiliation; and (4) national firefighters have received vocational acclaim due to the association with the heroic NYC firefighters. Some pitfalls can occur related to referent assumptions; these include: (a) guilt or glory by association where little or no true tie is established; (b) associative traits tend to linger long after real association ends; (c) some individuals tend to pay dearly for associates' misdeeds or terrible reputations.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; It is important to distinguish between referent power and other bases of social power involving control or [[conformity]].&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Fuqua, Payne, and Cangemi, referent power acts a little like [[role model]] power. It depends on respecting, liking, and holding another individual in high esteem. It usually develops over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="administration1998"/&gt;

The power of holding the ability to administer to another a sense of personal acceptance or personal approval.&lt;ref name=Hinkin&gt;Hinkin, T. R., &amp; Schriesheim, C. A. Development and application of new scales to measure the bases of social power. Journal of Applied Psychology, 1989 74, 561-567.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is strong enough that the power-holder is often looked up to as a role model.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, B. H. Political applications of the psychology of interpersonal influence and social power. Political Psychology, 1990, 11, 493-520.&lt;/ref&gt; This power is often regarded as admiration, or charm. The responsibility involved is heavy and the power easily lost, but when combined with other forms of power it can be very useful. Referent power is commonly seen in political and military figures, although celebrities often have this as well.

=== Expert power===
[[File:Julius Richmond, Surgeon General official photo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Julius Richmond]], [[Surgeon General of the United States]]]]
Expert power is based on what one knows, experience, and special skills or talents.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Expertise can be demonstrated by reputation, credentials certifying [[expertise]], and actions.  The effectiveness and impacts of the Expert power base may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Expert power if the motive is a need for achievement.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; The ability to administer to another information, knowledge or expertise.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven&gt;French, J. R. P., Raven, B. The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright and A. Zander. Group dynamics. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; (Example: Doctors, lawyers). As a consequence of the expert power or knowledge, a leader is able to convince their subordinates to trust them.  The expertise does not have to be genuine – it is the [[perception]] of expertise that provides the power base.  When individuals perceive or assume that a person possesses superior skills or abilities, they award power to that person.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Positive ====
Expert power in a positive form influences the target to act accordingly as instructed by the expert, based on the assumption of the expert's correct knowledge.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

====  Negative ====
Expert power in a negative form can result from a person acting in opposition to the experts instructions if the target feels that the expert has personal gain motives.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Some examples include: (a) a violinist demonstrating through audition skill with music; (b) a professor submits school transcripts to demonstrate discipline expertise; (c) a bricklayer relies on 20+ years of experience to prove expertise. Some pitfalls can emerge when too heavy a reliance is made on expertise; these include: (a) sometimes inferences are made suggesting expertise is wider in scope than it actually is; for example, an expert in antique vases may have little expertise in antique lamps; (b) one's expertise is not everlasting; for example, a physician who fails to keep up with medical technology and advances may lose expertise; and (c) expertise does not necessarily carry with it [[common sense]] or [[ethics|ethical judgement]].&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

=== Informational power ===
French and Raven's original five powers brought about change after many years, by which Raven added a sixth base of power. Informational is the ability of an [[agent of influence]] to bring about change through the resource of information.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Raven arguably believed that power as a potential influence logically meant that information was a form of influence and the social power base of Information Power was derived.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence results in [[cognition]] and acceptance by the target of influence. The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; In order to establish Information Power, an agent of influence would likely provide a baseline of information to a target of influence to lay the groundwork in order to be effective with future [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; A link between informational power, control, cooperation, and satisfaction have been hypothesized and tested in a lab study. The findings indicate that a channel member's control over another's strategy increases with its informational power source.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Information power if the motive is a need for achievement and can also be affected by an agent's [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Feldman summarizes informational power as the most transitory type of power. If one gives information away, then the power is given away, which differs from other forms of power because it's grounded in what you know about the content of a specific situation. Other forms of power are independent of the content.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, R.S. (1985). Social Psychology: Theories, Research, and Applications.  McGraw Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information power comes as a result of possessing knowledge that others need or want.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; In the age of [[Information technology]], information power is increasingly relevant as an abundance of information is readily available.  There may be a [[cost-benefit analysis]] by an agent of influence to determine if Information Power or influence is the best strategy.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence or persuasion would generally be favorable however it may not be best suited if timing and effort lacks.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Information possessed that no one needs or wants is powerless. Information power extends to the ability to get information not presently held such as a case with a librarian or data base manager. Not all information is readily available; some information is closely controlled by few people.  Examples of information that is sensitive or limits accessibility: (a) national security data; (b) personnel information for government or business; (c) corporate trade secrets; (d) juvenile court records; (e) many privately settled lawsuit documents; (f) Swiss bank account owners; and (g) private phone conversations. Of course, legally obtained phone tap warrants, spying, eavesdropping, group and group member leaks can allow others not intended to be privy to information.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Possessing information is not, typically, the vital act; it is what one can and does do or potentially can do with the information that typically is of vital importance. Information can, and often is, used as a weapon as in a divorce, a child custody case, business dissolution, or in civil suits discoveries. Information has been used by some to extort action, utterance, agreement, or settlement by others.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Information power is a form of personal or collective power that is based on controlling information needed by others in order to reach an important goal.  Our society is now reliant on information power as knowledge for influence, decision making, credibility, and control.  Timely and relevant information delivered on demand can be the most influential way to acquire power.  Information may be readily available through public records, research, and but information is sometimes assumed privileged or confidential. The target of influence accepts,comprehends and internalizes the change independently, without have to go back to the influencing agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

Informational power is based on the potential to utilize information.  Providing rational arguments, using information to persuade others, using facts and manipulating information can create a power base.  How information is used – sharing it with others, limiting it to key people, keeping it secret from key people, organizing it, increasing it, or even falsifying it – can create a shift in power within a group.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Direct ====

Information presented by the influencing agent directly to the target of change.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Indirect ====

Information presented influencing agent indirectly to the target of change void of attempting influence, such as hints or suggestions.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Socially independent of change====

The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Power socially independent of change may reflect the target continuing changed behavior without referring to, or even remembering, the supervisor or individual of authority as an agent of change because the target understands and accepts the reasoning of information received.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

==== Accessibility ====

Raven acknowledged leaders can attempt to influence subordinates by access and control of information. Information power may be used in both personal and positional classifications and is among the most preferable power bases.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, D. E. and Stahelski, A. J. The systematic measurement of French &amp; Raven's bases of social power in workgroups. Journal of Applied Social Psychology vol. 18 (1988) pp. 375–389&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tools/mechanisms ====

Informational power includes not only possessing information, but also the ability to obtain relevant information in a timely way to amass a power base.  The use of tools or technological mechanisms such as [[internet]], smart phones, and [[Social media]] progresses society's access to information but informational power as a base is derived by determining the usefulness and appropriateness of the information.&lt;ref&gt;Dessler, G. and Phillips, J. (2008). Managing Now. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power as a function of leadership and leadership styles ==
Tradition power is that force that is exerted upon us to conform to traditional ways. Traditions, for the most part, are social constructs; they invite, seduce, or compel us to conform and act in predictable, patterned ways. Breaking with traditions put people at risk of social alienation. Traditions can blunt rationality; they can block innovation; and they can appear to outsiders as silly when original traditions' rationales become outdated or forgotten.

The power of traditions, rather than being typically vested in particular individuals, is ordinarily focused on group conformity&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Charismatic power is that aura possessed by only a few individuals in our midst; it is characterized by super confidence, typical physical attractiveness, social adroitness, amiability, sharpened leadership skills, and heightened charm. Some [[charisma]] has dark and sinister overtones such as that shown by [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jim Jones]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[David Koresh]], and many [[confidence trickster]]s. Others demonstrate more positive displays of charisma such as that displayed by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Charisma has, in many cases, short circuited rationality; that is, others have been fooled into or lulled into not rationally considering what a charismatic requests or demands but going along as a result of the charismatic attraction. It must be remembered that power is effective only when the target of powerful actions agrees [implicitly or explicitly] to the relevant power dynamic; we are all technically able to resist the power of others; at times, however, we may feel powerless to resist or the social, political, personal, and/or emotional price to be paid is too high or we fear failure in resisting&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

{{double image|right| Harihara V&amp;A.jpg|180| Harihara Badami.jpg |135|Left: [[Vishnu]] (left half—blue) and [[Shiva]] (right half—white). Right:  A 6th-century Harihara [[murti]] in [[Badami cave temples]] of Karnataka.}}
'''Harihara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हरिहर) is the fused representation of [[Vishnu]] (Hari) and [[Shiva]] (Hara) from the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. Also known as '''Shankaranarayana''' ("Shankara" is Shiva, and "Narayana" is Vishnu) like '''Brahmanarayana'''
(Half represents [[Brahma]] and half represents [[Vishnu]]), Harihara is thus revered by both [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] and [[Shaivism|Shaivites]] as a form of the Supreme God. 

''Harihara'' is also sometimes used as a philosophical term to denote the unity of Vishnu and Shiva as different aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called [[Brahman]]. This concept of equivalence of various gods as one principle and "oneness of all existence" is discussed as Harihara in the texts of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;David Leeming (2001), A Dictionary of Asian Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195120530}}, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest sculptures of Harihara, with one half of the image as Shiva and other half as Vishnu, are found in the surviving cave temples of India, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century [[Badami cave temples]].&lt;ref&gt;Alice Boner (1990), Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture: Cave Temple Period, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807051}}, pages 89-95, 115-124, 174-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TA Gopinatha Rao (1993), Elements of Hindu iconography, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808775}}, pages 334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:Indian god-sivakesava.JPG|thumb|[[Vishnu]] ( holding [[Sudarshana Chakra]]) and [[Shiva]] (lighter coloured half, wearing tiger skin,  holding [[Trishula]]) combined in a single Harihara [[murti]], sometimes referred to as ''Sivakesava''and "Haryadhamurti".]]
The diversity within Hinduism encourages a wide variety of beliefs and traditions, of which two important and large traditions are associated with Vishnu and Shiva. Some schools focus on Vishnu (including his associated [[avatar]]s such as Rama and Krishna) as the Supreme God, and others on Shiva (including his different avatars such as Mahadeva and Pashupata). The [[Puranas]] and various Hindu traditions treat both Shiva and Vishnu as being different aspects of the one [[Brahman]]. Harihara is a symbolic representation of this idea. A similar idea, called [[Ardhanarishvara]] or ''Naranari'', fuses masculine and feminine deities as one and equivalent representation in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Goldberg (2002), The Lord who is half woman: Ardhanārīśvara in Indian and feminist perspective, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-791453251}}, pages 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on which scriptures (and translations) are quoted, evidence is available to support each of the different arguments. In most cases, even if one personality is taken as being superior over the other, much respect is still offered to both Vishnu and Shiva by the other's worshippers (i.e. Shiva is still regarded as being above the level of an ordinary [[jiva]] and 'the greatest of the Vaishnavas' by Vaishnavas who worship only Vishnu).&lt;ref&gt;"Lord Sambhu [Siva] the greatest of Vaishnavas and vice versa" from [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/12/13/16/en1 Bhag-Purana 12.13.16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009160352/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/12/13/16/en1 |date=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One and the same===
[[Sivananda]] states: "Shiva and Vishnu are one and the same entity. They are essentially one and the same. They are the names given to the different aspects of the all-pervading Supreme [[Parabrahman]] the [[Supreme Being]] or the Absolute. ‘Sivasya hridayam vishnur-vishnoscha hridayam sivah—Vishnu is the heart of Shiva and likewise Shiva is the heart of Vishnu’."

Harihara is depicted in art as split down the middle, one half representing Shiva, the other half representing Vishnu.  The Shiva half will have the matted locks of a yogic master piled high on his head and sometimes will wear a tiger skin, reserved for the most revered ascetics.  Shiva's pale skin may be read as ash-covered in his role as an ascetic.  The Vishnu half will wear a tall [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and other [[jewelry]], representing his responsibility for maintaining world order.  Vishnu's black skin represents holiness.  Broadly, these distinctions serve to represent the duality of humble religious influence in the ascetic and authoritative secular power in the king or householder.&lt;ref&gt;Thirty Thousand Years of Art.  Phaidon Press Limited.  p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in other aspects Shiva also takes on the authoritative position of householder, a position which is [[Shiva#Ascetic versus householder|directly at odds]] with the ascetic position depicted in his Harihara manifestation.

Harihara has been part of temple iconography throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia, with some illustrations listed in the following table. In some states, the concept of Harihara appears through alternate names and its progeny; for example, temples incorporating [[Ayyappan]] and [[Shasta (deity)|Shasta]] deities in [[Kerala]] illustrate this Hindu tradition there since at least the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0816054589}}, page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as '''Damas–Milner''' or '''Damas–Hindley–Milner'''. It was first described by [[J. Roger Hindley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = J. Roger Hindley | first = J.

Among HM's more notable properties are its completeness and its ability to infer the [[principal type|most general type]] of a given program without programmer-supplied [[type annotation]]s or other hints. [[#Algorithm W|Algorithm W]] is an efficient [[type inference]] method that performs in almost [[linear time]] with respect to the size of the source, making it practically useful to type large programs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Hindley–Milner is [[DEXPTIME]]-complete. Non-linear behaviour does manifest itself, yet only on [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] inputs. Thus the complexity theoretic proofs by {{harvtxt|Mairson|1990}} and {{harvtxt|Kfoury|Tiuryn|Urzyczyn|1990}} came as a surprise to the research community. When the depth of nested let-bindings is bounded—which is the case in realistic programs—Hindley–Milner type inference becomes polynomial.&lt;/ref&gt; HM is preferably used for [[functional language]]s. It was first implemented as part of the type system of the programming language [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Since then, HM has been extended in various ways, most notably with [[type class]] constraints like those in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

==Introduction==

{{main|Type system}}

One and the same thing can be used for many purposes.  A [[chair]] might be used to support a sitting person but also as a [[ladder]] to stand on while changing a light bulb or as a [[clothes valet]]. Beside having particular material qualities, which make a chair usable as such, it also has the particular designation for its use. When no chair is at hand, other things might be used as a seat, and so the designation of a thing can be changed as fast as one can turn an empty bottle crate upside down to change its purpose from a container to that of a support.

Different uses of physically near-identical things are usually accompanied by giving those things different names to emphasize the intended purpose. Depending on the use, seamen have a dozen or more words for a [[rope]] though it might materially be the same thing. The same in everyday language, where a [[leash]] indicates a use different to a [[clothes line|line]].

In computer science, this practice of naming things by its intended use is put to an extreme called ''typing'' and the names or expressions called ''types'':

* Contrary to the richly varying raw materials in the physical world, computing has only one raw material, bytes, and much like letters in a book they are used to build up and express everything in a computer's memory.
* Programmers not only have many words indicating the different uses for bytes, but rather a plethora of formal ''type'' ''languages'', each having their own grammar.
* There are branches of research in computer science and mathematics dedicated to developing and enhancing such languages. Their theoretical foundations have [[type systems]] and [[type theory]] as their subjects.
* Types are not only used in specifications and documentations, but are also an integral part of programming languages. There, they are mechanised to strongly support the programmers' tasks.

Beside structuring objects, (data) types serve as means to validate that these objects are used as intended. Much like a crate that could only be used as a support or a container at a time, a particular arrangement of bytes designated for one purpose might exclude other possible uses.

In programming, these uses are expressed as ''functions'' or ''procedures'' which serve the role of verbs in [[natural language]]. As an example for typing verbs, an English dictionary might define ''gift'' as "to give so. sth.", indicating that the object must be a person and the indirect object a physical thing. In programming, "so." (someone) and "sth." (something) would be called types and using a thing into the place of "so." would be indicated as a programming error by a [[type checker]].

Beside checking, one can use the types in this example to gain knowledge about an unknown word. Reading the sentence "Mary gifts John a bilber" the types could be used to conclude that a "bilber" is likely a physical thing. This activity and conclusion is called ''type inference''. As the story unfolds, more and more information about the unknown "bilber" may be gained, and eventually enough details become known to form a complete image of that kind of thing.

The type inference method designed by [[J. Roger Hindley|Hindley]] and [[Robin Milner|Milner]] does just this for programming languages. The advantage of type inference over type checking is that it allows a more natural and dense style of programming. Instead of starting a program text with a glossary defining what a bilber and everything else is, one can distribute this information over the text simply by using the yet undefined words and let a program collect all the details about them. The method works for both nouns (data types) and for verbs (functions types).  As a consequence, a programmer can proceed without ever mentioning types at all, while still having the full support of a type checker that validates their writing. When reading a program, the programmer can use type inference to query the full definition of anything named in the program whenever needed.

=== History of type inference ===
Historically, type inference to this extent was developed for a particular group of programming languages, called [[functional languages]]. These started in 1958 with [[Lisp]], a programming language based on the [[lambda calculus]] and that compares well with modern [[scripting languages]] like [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]. Lisp was mainly used for computer science research, often for symbol manipulation purposes where large, tree-like data structures were common.

Data in Lisp is [[dynamic type|dynamically typed]] and the types are only available to some degree while running a program. Debugging type errors was no less of a concern than it is with modern script languages. But, being completely untyped, i.e. written without any explicit type information, maintaining large programs written in Lisp soon became a problem because the many complicated types of the data were mentioned only in the program documentation and comments at best.

Thus, the need to have a Lisp-like language with machine-checkable types became more and more pressing. At some point, programming language development faced two challenges:

# [[Polymorphism (computer science)|Polymorphism]]. Some kinds of data are very generic. In particular, Lisp is a "list programming language" where lists are data whose type can be a "list of something", e.g. a list of numbers.  Functions for such generic data types are often themselves generic. For instance, counting the number of items on a list is independent of the type of its items. However, a generic function that adds another item to a given list, needs type checking to ensure that the list will remain consistent with respect to the type of its items. For example, that only numbers may be added to a list of numbers.  Types for such "generic" data and functions are called ''polymorphic'', meaning that they can be used for more than one type. The polymorphic function for adding an item can be used for a list of numbers as well as for a list of words or even a list of anything. More precisely, this kind of polymorphism is called [[parametric polymorphism]], where "something" is the parameter in "list of something".  More formally, "list of something" may be written &lt;code&gt;List T&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; being the type parameter. The type of a function that adds a new item to a list is &lt;code&gt;forall T . T -&gt; List T -&gt; List T&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that for any and all types T the adding function needs an item of type T and a list-of-Ts, to produce a resulting (new) list-of-Ts.  Thus, the first challenge was, to design a type system that properly expressed parametric polymorphism.
# [[Type inference]]. Unfortunately, polymorphic functions requiring type checking must be continuously informed of the types. The above function would need the type T as an additional first parameter, resulting in program text so cluttered with type information that it becomes unreadable. Additionally, when keying in a program, a programmer would spend a significant portion of time keying in types.

As an example, polymorphically constructing the list "(1 2)" of two numbers would mean writing:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
  (addItem Number 1 (addItem Number 2 (emptyList Number)))
&lt;/source&gt;

This example was quite typical. Every third word a type, monotonously serving the type checker in every step. This worsens when the types become more complex. Then, the methods to be expressed in code become buried in types.

To handle this issue, effective methods for type inference were the subject of research, and Hindley-Milner's method was one of them. Their method was first used in [[ML (programming language)|ML]] (1973) and is also used in an extended form in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (1990). The HM type inference method is strong enough to infer types not only for expressions, but for whole programs including the procedures and local definitions, providing a type-less style of programming.

The following text gives an impression of the resulting programming style for the [[quicksort]] procedure in Haskell:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
quickSort []     = []                           -- Sort an empty list
quickSort (x:xs) = quickSort (filter (&lt;x) xs)   -- Sort the left part of the list
                   ++ [x] ++                    -- Insert pivot between two sorted parts
                   quickSort (filter (&gt;=x) xs)  -- Sort the right part of the list
&lt;/source&gt;

Though all of the functions in the above example need type parameters, types are nowhere mentioned. The code is statically type-checked even though the type of the function defined is unknown and must be inferred to type-check the applications in the body.

Over the years, other programming languages added their own version of parametric types. [[C++]] templates were introduced in 1998 and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] introduced [[Generics in Java|generics]] in 2004. As programming with type parameters became more common, problems similar to the ones sketched for Lisp surfaced in [[imperative programming|imperative languages]] too, perhaps not as pressing as it was for the functional languages. As a consequence, these languages obtained support for some type inference techniques, for instance "auto" in [[C++11#Type inference|C++11]] (2014). Unfortunately, the stronger type inference methods developed for functional programming cannot simply be integrated in the imperative languages, as their type systems' features are in part incompatible, and a programming language must be designed from the ground up when continuous type inference is wanted.

== Features of the Hindley–Milner method ==

Before presenting the HM type system and related algorithms, the following sections make some features of HM more formal and precise.

===Type-checking vs. type-inference===

In a typing, an expression E is opposed to a type T, formally written as E : T. Usually a typing only makes sense within some context, which is omitted here.

In this setting, the following questions are of particular interest:

# E : T? In this case, both an expression E and a type T are given. Now, is E really a T? This scenario is known as [[type-checking]].
# E : _? Here, only the expression is known. So, what type is E? If there is a way to derive a type for E, then we have accomplished [[type inference]].
# _ : T? The other way round. Given only a type, is there any expression for it or does the type have no values? Is there any example of a T? And in light of the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]], is there a proof for T?

For the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], all three questions are decidable. The situation is not as comfortable when more expressive types are allowed. Additionally, the simply typed lambda calculus makes the types of the parameters of each function explicit, while they are not needed in HM. While HM is a method for type inference, it can be used also for type checking and answer the first question. To do that, a type is first inferred from E and then compared with the type wanted. The third question becomes of interest when looking at recursively-defined functions at the end of this article.

===Monomorphism vs. polymorphism===

{{main|parametric polymorphism}}

In the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], types &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are either atomic type constants or function types of form &lt;math&gt;T \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt;.  Such types are ''monomorphic''. Typical examples are the types used in arithmetic values:

  3       : Number
  add 3 4 : Number
  add     : Number -&gt; Number -&gt; Number

Contrary to this, the untyped lambda calculus is neutral to typing at all, and many of its functions can be meaningfully applied to all type of arguments. The trivial example is the identity function

:id &lt;math&gt;\equiv \lambda&lt;/math&gt; x . x

which simply returns whatever value it is applied to. Less trivial examples include parametric types like lists.

While polymorphism in general means that operations accept values of more than one type, the polymorphism used here is parametric. One finds the notation of ''type schemes'' in the literature, too, emphasizing the parametric nature of the polymorphism. Additionally, constants may be typed with (quantified) type variables. E.g.:

  cons : forall a . a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a
  nil  : forall a . List a.
  id   : forall a . a -&gt; a

Polymorphic types can become monomorphic by consistent substitution of their variables. Examples of monomorphic ''instances'' are:

 id'  : String -&gt; String
 nil' : List Number

More generally, types are polymorphic when they contain type variables, while types without them are monomorphic.

Contrary to the type systems used for example in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (1970) or [[C (programming language)|C]] (1972), which only support monomorphic types, HM is designed with emphasis on parametric polymorphism. The successors of the languages mentioned, like [[C++]] (1985), focused on different types of polymorphism, namely [[Polymorphism (computer science)#Subtyping|subtyping]] in connection with object-oriented programming and [[Polymorphism (computer science)#Ad hoc polymorphism|overloading]]. While subtyping is incompatible with HM, a variant of systematic overloading is available in the HM-based type system of Haskell.

===Let-polymorphism===

When extending the simply-typed lambda calculus towards polymorphism, one has to define when deriving an instance of a value is admissible. Ideally, this would be allowed with any use of a bound variable, as in:

  (λ id .  ... (id 3) ... (id "text") ... ) (λ x . x)

Unfortunately, type inference in such a system is not decidable.{{Citation needed|reasoning=Not obvious, under what rules.|date=November 2018}} Instead, HM provides ''let-polymorphism'' of the form

  '''let''' id = λ x . x
   '''in''' ... (id 3) ... (id "text") ...

restricting the binding mechanism in an extension of the expression syntax. Only values bound in a let construct are subject to instantiation, i.e. are polymorphic, while the parameters in lambda-abstractions are treated as being monomorphic.

==Overview==

The remainder of the article is more technical as it has to present the HM method as it is handled in the literature. It proceeds as follows:

* The HM type system is defined. This is done by describing a deduction system that makes precise what expressions have what type, if any.
* From there, it works towards an implementation of the type inference method. After introducing a syntax driven variant of the above deductive system, it sketches an efficient implementation (algorithm J), appealing mostly to the reader's metalogical intuition.
* Because it remains open whether algorithm J indeed realises the initial deduction system, a less efficient implementation (algorithm W), is introduced and its use in a proof is hinted.
* Finally, further topics related to the algorithm are discussed.

The same description of the deduction system is used throughout, even for the two algorithms, to make the various forms in which the HM method is presented directly comparable.

== The Hindley–Milner type system ==

The type system can be formally described by [[Formal grammar|syntax rules]] that fix a language for the expressions, types, etc. The presentation here of such a syntax is not too formal, in that it is written down not to study the [[Parse tree|surface grammar]], but rather the [[Abstract syntax|depth grammar]], and leaves some syntactical details open. This form of presentation is usual. Building on this, [[type rule]]s are used to define how expressions and types are related. As before, the form used is a bit liberal.

The expressions to be typed are exactly those of the [[lambda calculus]] extended with a let-expression as shown in the adjacent table. Parentheses can be used to disambiguate an expression. The application is left-binding and binds stronger than abstraction or the let-in construct.

Types are syntactically split into two groups, monotypes and polytypes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Polytypes are called "type schemes" in the original article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monotypes ====
Monotypes always designate a particular type. Monotypes &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are syntactically represented as [[Term (logic)|terms]].

Examples of monotypes include type constants like &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{string}&lt;/math&gt;, and parametric types like &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{Map\ (Set\ string)\ int}&lt;/math&gt;.   The later types are examples of ''applications'' of type functions, for example, from the set
&lt;math&gt; \{ \mathtt{Map^2,\ Set^1,\ string^0,\ int^0},\ \rightarrow^2 \} &lt;/math&gt;, 
where the superscript indicates the number of type parameters.  The complete set of type functions &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary in HM,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The parametric types &lt;math&gt;C\ \tau\dots\tau&lt;/math&gt; were not present in the original paper on HM and are not needed to present the method. None of the inference rules below will take care or even note them. The same holds for the non-parametric "primitive types" in said paper. All the machinery for polymorphic type inference can be defined without them. They have been included here for sake of examples but also because the nature of HM is all about parametric types. This comes from the function type &lt;math&gt;\tau\rightarrow\tau&lt;/math&gt;, hard-wired in the inference rules, below, which already has two parameters and has been presented here as only a special case.&lt;/ref&gt; except that it ''must'' contain at least &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow^2&lt;/math&gt;, the type of functions.  It is often written in infix notation for convenience.  For example, a function mapping integers to strings has type &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int}\rightarrow \mathtt{string}&lt;/math&gt;. Again, parentheses can be used to disambiguate a type expression. The application binds stronger than the infix arrow, which is right-binding.

Type variables are admitted as monotypes. Monotypes are not to be confused with monomorphic types, which exclude variables and allow only ground terms.

Two monotypes are equal if they have identical terms.

==== Polytypes ====
''Polytypes'' (or ''type schemes'') are types containing variables bound by one or more for-all quantifiers, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

A function with polytype &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can map ''any'' value of the same type to itself,
and the [[identity function]] is a value for this type.

As another example &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.(\mathtt{Set}\ \alpha)\rightarrow \mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of a function mapping all finite sets to integers. A function which returns the [[cardinality]] of a set would be a value of this type.

Note that quantifiers can only appear top level, i.e. a type &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\forall\alpha.\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for instance, is excluded by the syntax of types. Note also that monotypes are included in the polytypes, thus a type has the general form &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha_1\dots\forall\alpha_n.\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a monotype.

Equality of polytypes is up to reordering the quantification and renaming the quantified variables (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-conversion). Further, quantified variables not occurring in the monotype can be dropped.

==== Context and Typing ====

To meaningfully bring together the still disjoint parts (syntax expressions and types) a third part is needed: context. Syntactically, a context is a list of pairs &lt;math&gt;x:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, called [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|assignments]], [[:wikt:assumption|assumptions]] or [[Name binding|bindings]], each pair stating that value variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;. All three parts combined give a ''typing judgment'' of the form &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\ \vdash\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
stating that under assumptions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Free type variables ====

In a type &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha_1\dots\forall\alpha_n.\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; is the quantifier binding the type variables &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; in the monotype &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The variables &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; are called ''quantified'' and any occurrence of a quantified type variable in &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is called ''bound'' and all unbound type variables in &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are called ''free''. Additionally to the quantification &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; in polytypes, type variables can also be bound by occurring in the context, but with the inverse effect on the right hand side of the &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;. Such variables then behave like type constants there. Finally, a type variable may legally occur unbound in a typing, in which case they are implicitly all-quantified.

The presence of both bound and unbound type variables is a bit uncommon in programming languages. Often, all type variables are implicitly treated all-quantified. For instance, one does not have clauses with free variables in [[Prolog]]. Likely in Haskell, in the absence of the ScopedTypeVariables language extension, all type variables implicitly occur quantified, i.e. a Haskell type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; here.

=== Type order ===
{{main|Unification (computer science)#Substitution}}

Polymorphism means that one and the same expression can have (perhaps
infinitely) many types. But in this type system, these types are not completely
unrelated, but rather orchestrated by the parametric polymorphism.

As an example, the identity &lt;math&gt;\lambda x . x&lt;/math&gt; can have &lt;math&gt;\forall
\alpha . \alpha \rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt; as its type as well as
&lt;math&gt;\texttt{string} \rightarrow \texttt{string}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\texttt{int}
\rightarrow \texttt{int}&lt;/math&gt; and many others, but not &lt;math&gt;\texttt{int}
\rightarrow \texttt{string}&lt;/math&gt;. The most general type for this function is
&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha\rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, while the
others are more specific and can be derived from the general one by consistently
replacing another type for the ''type parameter'', i.e. the quantified
variable &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The counter-example fails because the
replacement is not consistent.

The consistent replacement can be made formal by applying a [[Unification (computer science)#Substitution|substitution]] &lt;math&gt;S = \left\{\ a_i \mapsto \tau_i,\ \dots\ \right\}&lt;/math&gt; to the term of a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;S\tau&lt;/math&gt;. As the example suggests, substitution is not only strongly related to an order, that expresses that a type is more or less special, but also with the all-quantification which allows the substitution to be applied.

{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Specialization Rule'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{\tau' = \left\{\alpha_i \mapsto \tau_i\right\} \tau \quad \beta_i \not\in \textrm{free}(\forall \alpha_1...\forall\alpha_n . \tau)}{\forall \alpha_1...\forall\alpha_n . \tau \sqsubseteq \forall \beta_1...\forall\beta_m . \tau'}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Formally, in HM, a type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is 
more general than &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt;, formally &lt;math&gt;\sigma \sqsubseteq
\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; if some quantified variable in &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is
consistently substituted such that one gains &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; as shown in the side bar.
This order is part of the type definition of the type system.

While substituting a monomorphic (ground) type for a quantified variable is
straight forward, substituting a polytype has some pitfalls caused by the
presence of free variables. Most particularly, unbound variables must not be
replaced. They are treated as constants here. Additionally, note
that quantifications can only occur top-level. Substituting a parametric type,
one has to lift its quantors. The table on the right makes the rule precise.

Alternatively, consider an equivalent notation for the polytypes without
quantors in which quantified variables are represented by a different set of
symbols. In such a notation, the specialization reduces to plain consistent
replacement of such variables.

The relation &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial order]]
and  &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is its smallest element.

==== Principal type ====
While specialization of a type scheme is one use of the order, it plays a
crucial second role in the type system. Type inference with polymorphism
faces the challenge of summarizing all possible types an expression may have.
The order guarantees that such a summary exists as the most general type
of the expression.

==== Substitution in typings ====

The type order defined above can be extended to typings because the implied all-quantification of typings enables consistent replacement:
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma \quad\Longrightarrow\quad S\Gamma \vdash e : S\sigma
&lt;/math&gt;
Contrary to the specialisation rule, this is not part of the definition, but like the implicit all-quantification rather a consequence of the type rules defined next.
Free type variables in a typing serve as placeholders for possible refinement. The binding effect of the environment to free type
variables on the right hand side of &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; that prohibits their substitution in the specialisation rule is again
that a replacement has to be consistent and would need to include the whole typing.

=== Deductive system ===
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''The Syntax of Rules'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lrl}
  \text{Predicate}  &amp; =      &amp;\sigma\sqsubseteq\sigma'\\
                    &amp; \vert\ &amp;\alpha\not\in free(\Gamma)\\
                    &amp; \vert\ &amp;x:\alpha\in \Gamma\\
\\
  \text{Judgment}   &amp; =      &amp;\text{Typing}\\
  \text{Premise}    &amp; =      &amp;\text{Judgment}\ \vert\ \text{Predicate}\\
  \text{Conclusion} &amp; =      &amp;\text{Judgment}\\
\\
  \text{Rule}       &amp; =      &amp;\displaystyle\frac{\textrm{Premise}\ \dots}{\textrm{Conclusion}}\quad [\mathtt{Name}]
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The syntax of HM is carried forward to the syntax of the [[Rule of inference|inference rules]] that form the body of the [[formal system]], by using the typings as [[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgments]]. Each of the rules define what conclusion could be drawn from what premises. Additionally to the judgments, some extra conditions introduced above might be used as premises, too.

A proof using the rules is a sequence of judgments such that all premises are listed before a conclusion. The examples below show a possible format of proofs. From left to right, each line shows the conclusion, the &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Name}]&lt;/math&gt; of the rule applied and the premises, either by referring to an earlier line (number) if the premise is a judgment or by making the predicate explicit.

==== Typing rules ====
{{see also|Type rules}}

\begin{array}{cl}

 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The side box shows the deduction rules of the HM type system. One can roughly divide the rules into two groups:

The first four rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt; (variable or function access), &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{App}]&lt;/math&gt; (''application'', i.e. function call with one parameter), &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; (''abstraction'', i.e. function declaration) and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; (variable declaration) are centered around the syntax, presenting one rule for each of the expression forms. Their meaning is obvious at the first glance, as they decompose each expression, prove their sub-expressions and finally combine the individual types found in the premises to the type in the conclusion.

The second group is formed by the  remaining two rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;.
They handle specialization and generalization of types. While the rule &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; should be clear from the section on specialization above, &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt; complements the former, working in the opposite direction. It allows generalization, i.e. to quantify monotype variables not bound in the context.
 
The following two examples exercise the rule system in action. Since both the expression and the type are given, they are a type-checking use of the rules.

'''Example''': A proof for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D id(n):int&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = id:\forall \alpha . \alpha\rightarrow\alpha,\ n:int&lt;/math&gt;,
could be written

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{llll}
1:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id : \forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha  &amp;[\mathtt{Var}]&amp; (id : \forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha \in \Gamma) \\
2:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id : int \rightarrow int &amp; [\mathtt{Inst}]&amp;(1),\ (\forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha \sqsubseteq int\rightarrow int)\\
3:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D n : int&amp;[\mathtt{Var}]&amp;(n : int \in \Gamma)\\
4:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id(n) : int&amp;[\mathtt{App}]&amp; (2),\ (3)\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example''': To demonstrate generalization,
&lt;math&gt;\vdash_D\ \textbf{let}\, id = \lambda x . x\ \textbf{in}\ id\, :\, \forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
is shown below:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{llll}
1: &amp; x:\alpha \vdash_D x : \alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Var}] &amp; (x:\alpha \in \left\{x:\alpha\right\})\\
2: &amp; \vdash_D \lambda x.x : \alpha\rightarrow\alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Abs}] &amp; (1)\\
3: &amp; \vdash_D \lambda x.x : \forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Gen}] &amp; (2),\ (\alpha \not\in free(\epsilon))\\
4: &amp; id:\forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha \vdash_D id : \forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Var}] &amp; (id:\forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha \in \left\{id : \forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha\right\})\\
5: &amp; \vdash_D \textbf{let}\, id = \lambda x . x\ \textbf{in}\  id\, :\,\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha  &amp; [\mathtt{Let}] &amp; (3),\ (4)\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Let-polymorphism ===
Not visible immediately, the rule set encodes a regulation under which circumstances a type might be generalized or not by a slightly varying use of mono- and polytypes in the rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt;. Remember that &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; denote poly- and monotypes respectively.

In rule &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt;, the value variable of the parameter of the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.e&lt;/math&gt; is added to the context with a monomorphic type through the premise &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\ x:\tau \vdash_D e:\tau'&lt;/math&gt;, while in the rule  &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt;, the variable enters the environment in polymorphic form &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\ x:\sigma \vdash_D e_1:\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Though in both cases the presence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the context prevents the use of the generalisation rule for any free variable in the assignment, this regulation forces the type of parameter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-expression to remain monomorphic, while in a let-expression, the variable could be introduced polymorphic, making specializations possible.

As a consequence of this regulation, &lt;math&gt;\lambda f.(f\, \textrm{true}, f\, \textrm{0})&lt;/math&gt; cannot be typed,
since the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in a monomorphic position, while &lt;math&gt;\textbf{let}\ f = \lambda x . x\, \textbf{in}\, (f\, \textrm{true}, f\, \textrm{0})&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;(bool, int)&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has been introduced in a let-expression and is treated polymorphic therefore.

===Generalization rule===

The generalisation rule is also worth for closer look. Here, the all-quantification implicit in the premise &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is simply moved to the right hand side of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; in the conclusion. This is possible, since &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; does not occur free in the context. Again, while this makes the generalisation rule plausible, it is not really a consequence. Vis versa, the generalisation rule is part of the definition of HM's type system and the implicit all-quantification a consequence.

== An inference algorithm ==
Now that the deduction system of HM is at hand, one could present an algorithm and validate it with respect to the rules.
Alternatively, it might be possible to derive it by taking a closer look on how the rules interact and proof are
formed. This is done in the remainder of this article focusing on the possible decisions one can make while proving a typing.

=== Degrees of freedom choosing the rules ===
Isolating the points in a proof, where no decision is possible at all,
the first group of rules centered around the syntax leaves no choice since
to each syntactical rule corresponds a unique typing rule, which determines
a part of the proof, while between the conclusion and the premises of these
fixed parts chains of &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;
could occur. Such a chain could also exist between the conclusion of the
proof and the rule for topmost expression. All proofs must have
the so sketched shape.

Because the only choice in a proof with respect of rule selection are the
&lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt; chains, the
form of the proof suggests the question whether it can be made more precise,
where these chains might be needed. This is in fact possible and leads to a
variant of the rules system with no such rules.

|}

A contemporary treatment of HM uses a purely [[syntax-directed]] rule system due to
Clement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Clement | date = 1986 | title = A Simple Applicative Language: Mini-ML | conference = LFP'86 | publisher = ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as an intermediate step. In this system, the specialization is located directly after the original &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt; rule
and merged into it, while the generalization becomes part of the &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; rule. There the generalization is
also determined to always produce the most general type by introducing the function &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, which quantifies
all monotype variables not bound in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, to validate, that this new rule system &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the original &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt;, one has
to show that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Leftrightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, which falls apart into two sub-proofs:

* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Leftarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt; ([[Consistency]])
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Rightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt; ([[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]])

While consistency can be seen by decomposing the rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt;
of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; into proofs in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt;, it is likely visible that &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; is incomplete, as
one cannot show &lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.x:\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, for instance, but only
&lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.x:\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  An only slightly weaker version of completeness is provable
&lt;ref name=x&gt;{{cite journal | first = Jeff | last = Vaughan | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120324105848/http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~jeff/docs/hmproof.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-24 | url = http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~jeff/docs/hmproof.pdf | title = A proof of correctness for the Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm | origyear = May 5, 2005 | date = July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though, namely

* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Rightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\tau \wedge \bar{\Gamma}(\tau)\sqsubseteq\sigma&lt;/math&gt;

implying, one can derive the principal type for an expression in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; allowing us to generalize the proof in the end.

Comparing &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, note that now only monotypes appear in the judgments of all rules. Additionally, the shape of any possible proof with the deduction system is now identical to the shape of the expression (both seen as [[Term (logic)#Formal definition|trees]]). Thus the expression fully determines the shape of the proof. In &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; the shape would likely be determined with respect to all rules except &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;, which allow building arbitrarily long branches (chains) between the other nodes.

=== Degrees of freedom instantiating the rules ===

Now that the shape of the proof is known, one is already close to formulating a type inference algorithm.
Because any proof for a given expression must have the same shape, one can assume the monotypes in the
proof's judgements to be undetermined and consider how to determine them.

Here, the substitution (specialisation) order comes into play. Although at the first glance one cannot determine the types locally, the hope is that it is possible to refine them with the help of the order while traversing the proof tree, additionally assuming, because the resulting algorithm is to become an inference method, that the type in any premise will be determined as the best possible. And in fact, one can, as looking at the rules of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; suggests:

* &lt;math&gt;[Abs]&lt;/math&gt;: The critical choice is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. At this point, nothing is known about &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, so one can only assume the most general type, which is &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The plan is to specialize the type if it should become necessary. Unfortunately, a polytype is not permitted in this place, so some &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has to do for the moment. To avoid unwanted captures, a type variable not yet in the proof is a safe choice. Additionally, one has to keep in mind that this monotype is not yet fixed, but might be further refined.
* &lt;math&gt;[Var]&lt;/math&gt;: The choice is how to refine &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Because any choice of a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; here depends on the usage of the variable, which is not locally known, the safest bet is the most general one. Using the same method as above one can instantiate all quantified variables in &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; with fresh monotype variables, again keeping them open to further refinement.
* &lt;math&gt;[Let]&lt;/math&gt;: The rule does not leave any choice. Done.
* &lt;math&gt;[App]&lt;/math&gt;: Only the application rule might force a refinement to the variables "opened" so far.

The first premise forces the outcome of the inference to be of the form &lt;math&gt;\tau \rightarrow \tau'&lt;/math&gt;.
* If it is, then fine. One can later pick its &lt;math&gt;\tau'&lt;/math&gt; for the result.
* If not, it might be an open variable. Then this can be refined to the required form with two new variables as before.
* Otherwise, the type checking fails because the first premise inferred a type which is not and cannot be made into a function type.

The second premise requires that the inferred type is equal to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of the first premise. Now there are two possibly different types, perhaps with open type variables, at hand to compare and to make equal if it is possible. If it is, a refinement is found, and if not, a type error is detected again. An effective method is known to "make two terms equal" by substitution, [[John Alan Robinson|Robinson's]] [[Unification (computing)|Unification]] in combination with the so-called [[Disjoint-set data structure|Union-Find]] algorithm.

To briefly summarize the union-find algorithm, given the set of all types in a proof, it allows one to group them together into [[equivalence class]]es by means of a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{union}&lt;/math&gt;
procedure and to pick a representative for each such class using a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{find}&lt;/math&gt; procedure. Emphasizing the word [[Procedure (computer science)|procedure]] in the sense of [[Side effect (computer science)|side effect]], we're clearly leaving the realm of logic in order to prepare an effective algorithm. The representative of a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{union}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is determined such that, if both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are type variables then the representative is arbitrarily one of them, but while uniting a variable and a term, the term becomes the representative. Assuming an implementation of union-find at hand, one can formulate the unification of two monotypes as follows:

 unify(ta,tb):
   ta = find(ta)
   tb = find(tb)
   '''if''' both ta,tb are terms of the form D p1..pn with identical D,n '''then'''
     unify(ta[i],tb[i]) for each corresponding ''i''th parameter
   '''else'''
   '''if''' at least one of ta,tb is a type variable '''then'''
     union(ta,tb)
   '''else'''
     error 'types do not match'

Now having a sketch of an inference algorithm at hand, a more formal presentation is given in the next section. It is described in Milner&lt;ref name="Milner"/&gt; P. 370 ff. as algorithm J.

=== Algorithm J ===

\begin{array}{cl}

\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The presentation of Algorithm J is a misuse of the notation of logical rules, since it includes side effects but allows a direct comparison with &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; while expressing an efficient implementation at the same time. The rules now specify a procedure with parameters &lt;math&gt;\Gamma, e&lt;/math&gt; yielding &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in the conclusion where the execution of the premises proceeds from left to right.

The procedure &lt;math&gt;inst(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; specializes the polytype &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; by copying the term and replacing the bound type variables consistently by new monotype variables. '&lt;math&gt;newvar&lt;/math&gt;' produces a new monotype variable. Likely, &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; has to copy the type introducing new variables for the quantification to avoid unwanted captures. Overall, the algorithm now proceeds by always making the most general choice leaving the specialization to the unification, which by itself produces the most general result. As noted [[#Syntax driven Rule System|above]], the final result &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; has to be generalized to &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; in the end, to gain the most general type for a given expression.

Because the procedures used in the algorithm have nearly O(1) cost, the overall cost of the algorithm is close to linear in the size of the expression for which a type is to be inferred. This is in strong contrast to many other attempts to derive type inference algorithms, which often came out to be [[NP-hard]], if not [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] with respect to termination. Thus the HM performs as well as the best fully informed type-checking algorithms can. Type-checking here means that an algorithm does not have to find a proof, but only to validate a given one.

Efficiency is slightly reduced because the binding of type variables in the context has to be maintained to allow computation of &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; and enable an [[occurs check]] to prevent the building of recursive types during &lt;math&gt;union(\alpha,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.
An example of such a case is &lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.(x\ x)&lt;/math&gt;, for which no type can be derived using HM.  Practically, types are only small terms and do not build up expanding structures.  Thus, in complexity analysis, one can treat comparing them as a constant, retaining O(1) costs.

==Proving the algorithm==

In the previous section, while sketching the algorithm its proof was hinted at with metalogical argumentation.  While this leads to an efficient algorithm J, it is
not clear whether the algorithm properly reflects the deduction systems D or S
which serve as a semantic base line.

The most critical point in the above argumentation is the refinement of monotype
variables bound by the context. For instance, the algorithm boldly changes the
context while inferring e.g. &lt;math&gt;\lambda f . (f\ 1)&lt;/math&gt;,
because the monotype variable added to the context for the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; later needs to be refined
to &lt;math&gt;int \rightarrow \beta&lt;/math&gt; when handling application.
The problem is that the deduction rules do not allow such a refinement.
Arguing that the refined type could have been added earlier instead of the
monotype variable is an expedient at best.

The key to reaching a formally satisfying argument is to properly include
the context within the refinement. Formally,
typing is compatible with substitution of free type variables.

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_S e : \tau \quad\Longrightarrow\quad S \Gamma \vdash_S e : S \tau&lt;/math&gt;

To refine the free variables thus means to refine the whole typing.

=== Algorithm W ===
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Algorithm W'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{cl}
\displaystyle\frac{x:\sigma \in \Gamma \quad \tau = \mathit{inst}(\sigma)}{\Gamma \vdash_W x:\tau,\emptyset}&amp;[\mathtt{Var}]\\ \\
\displaystyle\frac{\begin{array}{ll}\Gamma \vdash_W e_0 : \tau_0, S_0 &amp; S_0 \Gamma \vdash_W e_1 : \tau_1, S_1\\ \tau'=\mathit{newvar} &amp; S_2 = \mathsf{mgu}(S_1 \tau_0,\ \tau_1 \rightarrow \tau')\end{array} }{\Gamma \vdash_W e_0\ e_1 : S_2 \tau', S_2 S_1 S_0}&amp;[\mathtt{App}]\\ \\
\displaystyle\frac{\tau = \mathit{newvar} \quad \Gamma,\;x:\tau\vdash_W e:\tau',S}{\Gamma \vdash_W \lambda\ x\ .\ e : S\tau \rightarrow \tau',S}&amp;[\mathtt{Abs}]\\ \\
\displaystyle\frac{\Gamma \vdash_W e_0:\tau,S_0 \quad S_0\Gamma,\,x:\overline{S_0\Gamma}(\tau) \vdash_W e_1:\tau',S_1}{\Gamma \vdash_W \mathtt{let}\ x = e_0\ \mathtt{in}\ e_1 : \tau', S_1 S_0 }&amp;[\mathtt{Let}]
\end{array}

&lt;/math&gt;
|}
From there, a proof of algorithm J leads to algorithm W, which only makes the
side effects imposed by the procedure &lt;math&gt;\textit{union}&lt;/math&gt; explicit by
expressing its serial composition by means of the substitutions
&lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. The presentation of algorithm W in the sidebar still makes use of side effects
in the operations set in italic, but these are now limited to generating
fresh symbols. The form of judgement is &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e : \tau, S&lt;/math&gt;,
denoting a function with a context and expression as parameter producing a monotype together with
a substitution. &lt;math&gt;\textsf{mgu}&lt;/math&gt; is a side-effect free version
of &lt;math&gt;\textit{union}&lt;/math&gt; producing a substitution which is the [[Unification (computer science)#Syntactic unification of first-order terms|most general unifier]].

While algorithm W is normally considered to be ''the'' HM algorithm and is
often directly presented after the rule system in literature, its purpose is
described by Milner&lt;ref name="Milner"/&gt; on P. 369 as follows:

: ''As it stands, W is hardly an efficient algorithm; substitutions are applied too often. It was formulated to aid the proof of soundness. We now present a simpler algorithm J which simulates W in a precise sense.''

While he considered W more complicated and less efficient, he presented it 
in his publication before J. It has its merits when side effects are unavailable or unwanted.
By the way, W is also needed to prove completeness, which is factored by him into the soundness proof.

=== Proof obligations ===

Before formulating the proof obligations, a deviation between the rules systems
D and S and the algorithms presented needs to be emphasized.

While the development above sort of misused the monotypes as "open" proof variables, the possibility that proper monotype variables might be harmed was sidestepped by introducing fresh variables and hoping for the best. But there's a catch: One of the promises made was that these fresh variables would be "kept in mind" as such. This promise is not fulfilled by the algorithm.

Having a context &lt;math&gt;1 : int,\ f : \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the expression &lt;math&gt;f\ 1&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be typed in either &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, but the algorithms come up with
the type &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, where W additionally delivers the substitution &lt;math&gt;\left\{\alpha \mapsto int \rightarrow \beta\right\}&lt;/math&gt;,
meaning that the algorithm fails to detect all type errors. This omission can easily be fixed by more carefully distinguishing proof
variables and monotype variables.

The authors were well aware of the problem but decided not to fix it. One might assume a pragmatic reason behind this.
While more properly implementing the type inference would have enabled the algorithm to deal with abstract monotypes,
they were not needed for the intended application where none of the items in a preexisting context have free
variables. In this light, the unneeded complication was dropped in favor of a simpler algorithm.
The remaining downside is that the proof of the algorithm with respect to the rule system is less general and can only be made
for contexts with &lt;math&gt;free(\Gamma) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; as a side condition.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
\text{(Correctness)}  &amp;\Gamma |-_W e : \tau, S &amp;\quad\Longrightarrow\quad \Gamma \vdash_S e : \tau \\
\text{(Completeness)} &amp;\Gamma |-_S e : \tau   &amp;\quad\Longrightarrow\quad  \Gamma \vdash_W e : \tau', S \quad\quad \text{forall}\ \tau\ \text{where}\ \overline\emptyset(\tau') \sqsubseteq \tau
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The side condition in the completeness obligation addresses how the deduction may give many types, while the algorithm always produces one. At the same time, the side condition demands that the type inferred is actually the most general.

To properly prove the obligations one needs to strengthen them first to allow activating the substitution lemma threading the substitution &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vdash_W&lt;/math&gt;. From there, the proofs are by induction over the expression.

Another proof obligation is the substitution lemma itself, i.e. the substitution of the typing, which finally establishes the all-quantification. The later cannot formally be proven, since no such syntax is at hand.

== Extensions ==

=== Recursive definitions ===

To make [[Turing completeness|programming practical]] recursive functions are needed.
A central property of the lambda calculus is that recursive definitions
are not directly available, but can instead be expressed with a [[fixed point combinator]].
But unfortunately, the fixpoint combinator cannot be formulated in a typed version
of the lambda calculus without having a disastrous effect on the system as outlined
below.

==== Typing rule ====

The original paper&lt;ref name="Damas"/&gt; notes that recursion can be realized by a combinator
&lt;math&gt;\mathit{fix}:\forall\alpha.(\alpha\rightarrow\alpha)\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. A possible recursive definition could thus be formulated as
&lt;math&gt;\mathtt{rec}\ v = e_1\ \mathtt{in}\ e_2\ ::=\mathtt{let}\ v = \mathit{fix}(\lambda v.e_1)\ \mathtt{in}\ e_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively an extension of the expression syntax and an extra typing rule is possible:

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{
\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash e_1:\tau_1\quad\dots\quad\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash e_n:\tau_n\quad\Gamma, \Gamma'' \vdash e:\tau
}{
\Gamma\ \vdash\ \mathtt{rec}\ v_1 = e_1\ \mathtt{and}\ \dots\ \mathtt{and}\ v_n = e_n\ \mathtt{in}\ e:\tau
}\quad[\mathtt{Rec}]&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma' = v_1:\tau_1,\ \dots,\ v_n:\tau_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma'' = v_1:\bar\Gamma(\ \tau_1\ ),\ \dots,\ v_n:\bar\Gamma(\ \tau_n\ )&lt;/math&gt;
basically merging &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; while including the recursively defined
variables in monotype positions where they occur to the left of the &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{in}&lt;/math&gt; but as polytypes to the right of it. This
formulation perhaps best summarizes the essence of [[#Let-polymorphism|let-polymorphism]].

==== Consequences ====

While the above is straightforward it does come at a price.

[[Type theory]] connects lambda calculus computation and logic.
The easy modification above has effects on both:

* The [[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|strong normalisation property]] is spoiled.
* The logic [[Consistency|collapses]].

Programs in simply typed lambda calculus are guaranteed to always terminate. Moreover, they
are even guaranteed to terminate under any evaluation strategy, be it top down, bottom up, breadth first, whatever. The same is true for expressions that have types in HM. It is well-known that separating
terminating from non-terminating programs is most difficult, and especially in lambda calculus,
which is so expressive that it can formulate recursion with just a few symbols. Thus the initial
inability of HM to provide recursive functions was not an omission, but a feature. Adding
recursion enables normal programming but the guarantee is not longer valid.

Another reading of the typing is given by the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]. Here
the types are interpreted as logical expressions. Let's look at the type of the fixpoint combinator from this
perspective, assuming the variables to have logical value:
: &lt;math&gt;
(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha  \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad 
\textsf{true} \rightarrow \alpha  \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad  \alpha
&lt;/math&gt;
But this is [[Validity (logic)|invalid]].
Adding an invalid axiom will break the logic in the sense that
every formula can then be shown to be true in it, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\text{true} \Leftrightarrow \text{false}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the ability to distinguish even two simple things is no longer given. Everything is the same and
collapses into [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything|42]]. The fixpoint
combinator that came in so handy above also plays a role in [[Curry's paradox#Lambda calculus|Curry's paradox]].

Logic aside, does this matter for typing programs? It does. Since one is now able to formulate
non-terminating functions, one can make a function that would return whatever one wants&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
To make a function that works just like [[Aladdin]]'s wonderful lamp, one can define: &lt;math&gt;\text{iwisha} \equiv \text{fix id}&lt;/math&gt;
and formulate the wish in a slightly more expressive type language like: "(iwisha ([[flying carpet]]))" passing the type explicitly as
in the introduction. When the function returns, it delivers the wish, but no longer as a type (i.e. specification), but as something
real, a value of that type. This implementation at least does not return. Many have dreamed of such a useful device, and if it exists it could do wonders even if only in computing. The type &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha.\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is so general, that its values belong to the realm of imagination.&lt;/ref&gt; but never really returns:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{fix}\ \text{id} : \forall a . a&lt;/math&gt;.
In practical programming such a function can come in handy when breaking out of a computation,
like with &lt;code&gt;exit(1)&lt;/code&gt; in [[C (programming language)|C]], while silencing the type checker in
the current branch by returning essentially nothing but with a suitable type.

Less desirable is that the type checker (type inferencer) now succeeds with a type for a function that in fact never returns any value, like &lt;math&gt;\text{fix}\ \text{id}&lt;/math&gt;. The function ''would'' return a value of this type, but it ''cannot'' because no terminating function with this type exists. The type checker's claim that everything is ok thus has to be taken with a grain of salt. The types might only be ''claimed'' to be checked, but the program can still be typed wrong. Only if all functions are terminating does &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the logic above have a ''true'' value, and the assertions of the type checker become strong again.

=== Overloading ===

{{main|Type class}}

Overloading means, that different functions still can be defined and used with the same name. Most programming languages at least provide overloading with the built-in arithmetic operations (+,&lt;,etc.), to allow the programmer to write arithmetic expressions in the same form, even for different numerical types like &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;. Because a mixture of these different types within the same expression also demands for implicit conversion, overloading especially for these operations is often built into the programming language itself. In some languages, this feature is generalized and made available to the user, e.g. in C++.

While [[Ad hoc polymorphism|ad-hoc overloading]] has been avoided in functional programming for the computation costs both in type checking and inference{{Citation needed|reasoning=I remember Huet wrote an article on this topic|date=June 2018}}, a means to systematise overloading has been introduced that resembles both in form and naming to object oriented programming, but works one level upwards. "Instances" in this systematic are not objects (i.e. on value level), but rather types.
The quicksort example mentioned in the introduction uses the overloading in the orders, having the following type annotation in Haskell:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
quickSort :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
&lt;/source&gt;
Herein, the type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not only polymorphic, but also restricted to be an instance of some type class &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt;, that provides the order predicates &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; used in the functions body. The proper implementations of these predicates are then passed to quicksorts as additional parameters, as soon as quicksort is used on more concrete types providing a single implementation of the overloaded function quickSort.

Because the "classes" only allow a single type as their argument, the resulting type system can still provide inference. Additionally, the type classes can then be equipped with some kind of overloading order allowing one to arrange the classes as a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]].

=== Meta types ===

{{main|Type_class#Higher-kinded_polymorphism}}

Parametric polymorphism implies that types themselves are passed as parameters as if they were proper values. Passed as arguments into a proper functions as in the introduction, but also into "type functions" as in the "parametric" type constants, leads to the question how to more properly type types themselves. A meta type,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
The term "higher-order" has been so overused, that "meta type" is preferred here.
&lt;/ref&gt; the "type of types" would be useful to create an even more expressive type system.

Though this would be a straight forward extension, unfortunately, only [[Unification (computer science)#Higher-order unification|unification]] is not longer decidable in the presence of meta types, rendering type inference impossible in this extend of generality.
Additionally, assuming a type of all types that includes itself as type leads into a paradox, as in the set of all sets, so one must proceed in steps of levels of abstraction.
Research in [[second order lambda calculus]], one step upwards, showed, that type inference is undecidable in this generality.

Parts of one extra level has been introduced into Haskell named [[Kind (type theory)|kind]], where it is used helping to type [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]]. Kinds are left implicit, working behind scene in the inner mechanics of the extended type system.

=== Subtyping ===

{{main|Subtyping}}

Attempts to combine subtyping and type inference have caused quite some frustration. While type inference is needed in object-oriented programming for the same reason as in functional languages, methods like HM cannot be made going for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is not difficult to setup a type system with subtyping enabling object-oriented style, as
e.g. [[Cardelli]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
  | first = Luca
  | last = Cardelli |author2=Martini, Simone |author3=Mitchell, John C. |author4=Scedrov, Andre

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; shows in [[System F-sub|his system]] &lt;math&gt;F_{&lt;:}&lt;/math&gt;.

* The type equivalence can be broken up into a subtyping relation "&lt;:".
* Extra type rules define this relation e.g. for the [[Subtyping#Function types|functions]].
* A suiting [[Subtyping#Record types|record type]] is then added whose values represent the objects.

Such objects would be immutual in a functional language context, but the type system would enable object-oriented programming style and the type inference method could be reused in imperative languages.

The subtyping rule for the record types is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\displaystyle\frac{
n \le m\quad\quad \tau_1 &lt;: \tau_1' \quad \dots \quad \tau_n &lt;: \tau_n'
}{
\Gamma\ \vdash\ \mathbf{Record}\ v_1 : \tau_1\ \dots\  v_n : \tau_n\ \mathbf{end} &lt;: \mathbf{Record}\ v_1 : \tau_1'\ \dots\  v_m : \tau_m'\ \mathbf{end}
}\quad[\mathtt{Record}]
&lt;/math&gt;
Syntatically, record expressions would have form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{record}\ v_1 = e_1,\ \dots\ \mathbf{end}&lt;/math&gt;
and have a type rule leading to the above type.
Such record values could then be used the same way as objects in object oriented programming.

'''''Homo sacer''''' (Latin for "the sacred man" or "the accursed man") is a figure of [[Roman law]]: a person who is [[ban (law)|banned]] and may be killed by anybody, but may not be [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] in a religious ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Agamben, Giorgio. Heller-Roazen, trans. ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The meaning of the term ''sacer'' in [[Ancient Roman religion]] is not fully congruent with the meaning it took after Christianization, and which was adopted into English as ''sacred''. In early Roman religion ''sacer'', much like the Hebrew [[:wikt:קדש|{{Hebrew|קָדוֹש}}]] ''qadoš'', denotes anything "set apart" from common society and encompasses both the sense of "hallowed" and that of "cursed". This concept of the sacred is more in line with the Islamic notion of ''[[haram]]''. The ''homo sacer'' could thus also simply mean a person expunged from society and deprived of all [[rights]] and all functions in [[civil religion]]. ''Homo sacer'' is defined in legal terms as someone who can be killed without the killer being regarded as a murderer; and a person who cannot be sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben - Homo Sacer, 1995 (Valdisholm publishing company, Norwegian translation), 2. part (Homo Sacer) 1.1.  citing [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred human may thus be understood as someone outside the law, or beyond it. With respect to certain monarchs, in certain western legal traditions, the concepts of the sovereign and of the Homo Sacer have been conflated.&lt;ref&gt;§ 5 Constitution of Norway -&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sacred man'' could also have been used because the condemned could only rely on protection of gods.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.pl/books?id=3tTfzsdmbl4C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=prescription+homo+sacer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3c-aTIegvb&amp;sig=v2CFrKQJ7oGUQfEZe_ysaSHyU80&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIhZiL8YTcAhUmLsAKHTvHByYQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=prescription%20homo%20sacer&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of ''homo sacer'' could fall upon one as a consequence of oath-breaking. An [[oath]] in antiquity was essentially a conditional self-cursing, i.e. invoking one or several deities and asking for their punishment in the event of breaking the oath. An oathbreaker was consequently considered the property of the gods whom he had invoked and then deceived. If the oathbreaker was killed, this was understood as the revenge of the gods into whose power he had given himself. Since the oathbreaker was already the property of the oath deity, he could no longer belong to human society, or be consecrated to another deity.

A direct reference to this status is found in the [[Twelve Tables]] (8.21), laws of the early Roman Republic written in the 5th century BC. The paragraph states that a [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]] who deceives his clients is to be regarded as ''sacer''.

The idea of the status of an [[outlaw]], a criminal who is declared as unprotected by the law and can consequently be killed by anyone with impunity, persists throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Medieval perception condemned the entire human intrinsic moral worth of the outlaw, dehumanizing the outlaw literally as a "wolf" or "wolf's-head" (in an era where hunting of wolves existed strongly, including a commercial element)&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Gerstein, Berkeley, Ca., 1974, "Germanic Warg: The Outlaw as Werwolf", in G.J. Larson, ed., ''Myth in Indo-European Antiquity'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and is first revoked only by the English ''[[Habeas Corpus]]'' act of 1679 which declares that any criminal must be judged by a tribunal before being punished.

Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] takes the concept as the starting point of his main work ''[[Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life]]'' (1998).

"The Century of the Intellectual: From Dreyfus to Salman Rushdie", ''Intellectuals in Politics'', Routledge: New York (1997) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Coming from the world of [[culture]], either as a creator or as a mediator, the intellectual participates in politics either to defend a concrete proposition or to denounce an injustice, usually by rejecting, producing or extending an [[ideology]], and by defending a system of [[value theory|values]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pascal Ory]] and Jean-François Sirinelli, ''Les Intellectuels en France. De l'affaire Dreyfus à nos jours'' (''The Intellectuals in France: From the Dreyfus Affair to Our Days''), Paris: Armand Colin, 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Socially, intellectuals constitute the [[intelligentsia]], a [[Status group|status class]] organised either by [[ideology]] ([[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Fascism|fascist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[reactionary]], [[revolution]]ary, [[Democracy|democratic]], [[Communism|communist]] intellectuals, ''et al.''), or by nationality (American intellectuals, French intellectuals, Ibero–American intellectuals, ''et al.''). The contemporary intellectual class originated from the ''intelligentsiya'' of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] ({{circa|1860s}}–1870s), the [[Social stratification|social stratum]] of those possessing intellectual formation (schooling, education, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and who were Russian society's counterpart to the German ''Bildungsbürgertum'' and to the French ''bourgeoisie éclairée'', the [[Bourgeoisie|enlightened middle classes]] of those realms.&lt;ref name="Williams, Raymond 1983 pp. 169"&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983), pp. 169–71.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In ''[[The Twilight of Atheism]]'' (2004, p. 53), the theologian [[Alister McGrath]] said that "the emergence of a socially alienated, theologically literate, anti-establishment lay intelligentsia is one of the more significant phenomena of the social history of Germany in the 1830s ... three or four theological graduates in ten might hope to find employment in a Church post". In the essay, "The High Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature", the cultural historian [[Robert Darnton]] said that the politically radical thinkers who had participated in the French Revolution (1789–1799), were not social outsiders, rather they were respectable, domesticated, and assimilated men. (pp. 1–40.) ''[[Grub Street in France|The Literary Underground of the Old Régime]]'', 1982.}}

In the late 19th century, amidst the [[Dreyfus affair]] (1894–1906), an identity crisis of [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] nationalism for the [[French Third Republic]] (1870–1940), the [[reactionary]] anti–Dreyfusards ([[Maurice Barrès]], [[Ferdinand Brunetière]], ''et al.'') used the terms ''intellectual'' and ''the intellectuals'' to deride the liberal Dreyfusards ([[Émile Zola]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], [[Anatole France]], ''et al.'') as political dilettantes from the realms of French culture, art, and science, who had become involved in politics, by publicly advocating for the exoneration and liberation of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish French artillery captain falsely accused of betraying France to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', Second Edition. (1958) pp. 89–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the term ''Intellectual'' acquired positive connotations of [[Reputation|social prestige]], derived from possessing [[intellectualism|intellect]] and [[intelligence]], especially when the intellectual's activities exerted positive consequences in the [[public sphere]] and so increased the intellectual understanding of the public, by means of [[Morality|moral]] responsibility, [[altruism]], and [[solidarity]], without resorting to the [[psychological manipulation|manipulations]] of [[demagoguery]], [[paternalism]], and [[incivility]] (condescension).&lt;ref name="Williams, Raymond 1983 pp. 169"/&gt;{{efn|In the newspaper column, "Pilot Fish Among Sharks" (''El País'', 14 June 2014), the Spanish philosopher of ethics [[Fernando Savater|Fernando Fernández-Savater Martín]] explained the social function of the public intellectual with an anecdote about the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] philosopher [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], at whose public conferences, in different cities, there always was present the same uneducated woman, who answered his query about her presence, by saying: "It's just that I like to listen to you, because you speak to us as if we were all intelligent."&lt;poem&gt;

Effectively so, that is precisely the specific function of the intellectual: To treat everyone else as if they, too, were intellectuals. That is to say, to not attempt to hypnotise them, to intimidate them, or to seduce them, but to awaken in them the mechanism of intelligence that weighs, evaluates, and comprehends. One must start from the Socratic premise that everyone in the world reveals himself, herself intelligent when treated as if intelligent. Is that social function compatible with the offices of politicians? Because, more often than not, they tend to govern themselves by the cynical principle that: "One must not treat the public as if they were imbeciles, nor forget that they are imbeciles", which was established by the novelist [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] (who, not in vain, began his career as an advertising man); it is plainly obvious that those are opposite approaches. What is bad, is that the first approach demands effort from the interlocutors—attention, reflection, and dubious sizings-up, while the second approach flatters the primitive emotions of enthusiasm or revenge, and converts critical thinking to satire or to swearing curses, and social problems into notorious scandal... .

Of course, the advocates of [[Atavism|atavistic]] formulas periodically return to the charge, because those emotional formulas are easily assumed out of ignorance (populism, as you already know, is democracy for the mentally lazy), and, as such, are more necessary than ever; thus, if there be no intellectuals in politics, at the least, there should be intellectual ethos in public and in social discourse. Nonetheless, the lesson of personal experience often is negative, and the honest intellectuals whom I know always have returned crestfallen [from politics], like the pioneer Plato returned from Syracuse... ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2014/06/13/actualidad/1402681916_575638.html ''Peces piloto entre tiburones''], el País, 15 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}} Hence, for the educated person of a society, participating in the public sphere—the political affairs of the city-state—is a civic responsibility dating from the [[Classical antiquity|Græco–Latin Classical era]]:

{{Quotation|align=center|I am a human; I reckon nothing human to be foreign to me. (''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto''.) |''[[Heauton Timorumenos|The Self-Tormentor]]'' (163&amp;nbsp;BC), [[Terence]]&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, M.C. (Ed.) ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'', Second Edition. Oxford University Press. 1993. "Heau'ton timōrū'menos", 77, pp. 260–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://linguistlist.org/issues/4/4-1053.html|title=LINGUIST List 4.1053: Jakobson quotation|author=|date=|website=linguistlist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The determining factor for ''a Thinker'' (historian, philosopher, scientist, writer, artist, ''et al.'') to be considered a public intellectual is the degree to which he or she is [[Logical consequence|implicated]] and [[Engaged theory|engaged]] with the vital reality of the contemporary world; that is to say, participation in the public affairs of society. Consequently, being designated as a public intellectual is determined by the degree of influence of the designator's [[motivation]]s, opinions, and options of action (social, political, ideological), and by affinity with the given thinker; therefore:{{efn|In the essay "[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]" (1946), Jean-Paul Sartre explains the philosophical concepts of [[Logical consequence|implication]] and [[Engaged theory|engagement]]. In ''Notas para una lectura'' (''Notes for a Lecture''), the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] philosopher [[:ca:Ramon Alcoberro i Pericay|Ramón Alcoberro i Pericay]] explains Sartre's opinion of not being engaged with one's times, and the consequent implications: ... once one comprehends his [Sartre's] idea of "Man as Situation", it is easier to understand the concepts of "responsibility" and "engagement". To become engaged in a concrete situation—"to become embarked", said [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]—is the consequence of presuming that one cannot live in pure, conceptual abstraction; everyone always is in a given "situation", and it corresponds to us to be responsible (to respond) to that situation; simply put, neutrality is not possible. In an editorial opinion in ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in 1945, Sartre wrote, "I consider [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and the [[Goncourt brothers|Brothers Goncourt]] responsible for the [[Political repression|repression]] that followed the [[Paris Commune|Commune]], because they never wrote, even a line, to impede it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcoberro.info/planes/sartre3.htm|title=Sartre. El existencialismo es un humanismo|author=|date=|website=www.alcoberro.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[What Is literature?|What is Literature?]]'' (1947)}}

{{Quotation|align=center|The Intellectual is someone who meddles in what does not concern them. (''L'intellectuel est quelqu'un qui se mêle de ce qui ne le regarde pas''.)|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]&lt;ref&gt;Annie Cohen-Solal, ''Sartre'', Gallimard, 1989, pp. 588–89.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Analogously, the application and the conceptual value of the terms ''Intellectual'' and ''the Intellectuals'' are socially negative when the practice of [[Intellectualism|intellectuality]] is exclusively in service to [[The Establishment]] who wield [[Power (social and political)|power]] in a society, as such:

{{Quotation|align=center|The Intellectuals are specialists in [[defamation]], they are basically [[political commissar]]s, they are the ideological administrators, the most threatened by [[Dissident|dissidence]].|[[Noam Chomsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Peter R. and Schoeffel, Michael John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEzG68PlBl4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Noam+Chomsky+Peter+R.+Mitchell+John+Schoeffel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mLlfTujyE-z34QTs-2E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intelectual%20disidencia&amp;f=false ''Chomsky''], Crítica, 2002, {{ISBN|8484323781}}, pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noam Chomsky's negative view of the Establishment Intellectual suggests the existence of another kind of intellectual one might call "the public intellectual," which is:

{{Quotation|... someone able to speak the truth, a ... courageous and angry individual for whom no worldly power is too big and imposing to be criticised and pointedly taken to task. The real or true intellectual is therefore always an outsider, living in self-imposed exile, and on the margins of society. He or she speaks to, as well as for, a public, necessarily in public, and is properly on the side of the dispossessed, the un-represented and the forgotten.|[[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]]&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Jeremy and Kemp–Welch, Anthony. (Eds.) ''Intellectuals in Politics: From the Dreyfus Affair to Salman Rushdie'', 1997. pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terms and endeavours==
The intellectual is a type of intelligent person, who is associated with [[reason]] and [[critical thinking]]. Many everyday roles require the application of intelligence to skills that may have a [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] component, for example, in the fields of medicine or the arts, but these do not necessarily involve the practitioner in the "world of ideas". The distinctive quality of the intellectual person is that the mental skills, which one demonstrates, are not simply intelligent, but even more, they focus on thinking about the abstract, philosophical and [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] aspects of human inquiry and the value of their thinking.{{Citation needed|reason=sounds elitist|date=October 2013}}

The intellectual and the [[Scholarly method|scholarly]] classes are related; the intellectual usually is not a teacher involved in the production of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], but has an academic background, and works in a profession, practices an art, or a science. The intellectual person is one who applies [[critical thinking]] and reason in either a professional or a personal capacity, and so has [[authority]] in the public sphere of their society; the term ''intellectual'' identifies three types of person, one who:

# is [[erudition|erudite]], and develops abstract ideas and theories
# a professional who produces [[cultural capital]], as in [[philosophy]], [[literary criticism]], [[sociology]], [[law]],  [[medicine]], [[science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge and Decisions|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Sowell|year=1980|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
# an [[artist]] who [[Writing|writes]], [[Musical composition|composes]], [[Painting|paints]], etc.

==="Man of letters"===
{{anchor|Man of Letters}}
The term "man of letters" derives from the French term ''[[Belles-lettres|belletrist]]'' or ''homme de lettres'' but is not synonymous with "an academic".&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Reference Dictionary'' Second Edition, (1996) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cassel's French–English, English–French Dictionary'' (1962) p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A "man of letters" was a literate man ("able to read and write") as opposed to an [[illiterate]] man, in a time when [[literacy]] was a rare form of cultural capital. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the ''Belletrists'' were the ''literati'', the French "citizens of the [[Republic of Letters]]", which evolved into the [[salon (gathering)|salon]], a social institution, usually run by a hostess, meant for the edification, education, and cultural refinement of the participants.

==Historical background==
In English, the term ''intellectual'' identifies a "literate thinker"; its earlier usage, as in the book title ''The Evolution of an Intellectual'' (1920), by [[John Middleton Murry]], denotes literary activity, rather than the activities of the public intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Collini p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century===
[[File:J’accuse.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[L'Aurore (1944 newspaper)|L'Aurore]]'' (13 January 1898) featured [[Émile Zola]]'s open letter, ''[[J'Accuse…!]]'', asking the French President, [[Félix Faure]], to resolve the [[Dreyfus affair]].]]

====Britain====
In the late 19th century, when literacy was relatively common in European countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], the "Man of Letters" (''littérateur'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Littérateur, n. |title=Discover the Story of English|edition=Second (1989)|date=June 2012|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/109241 |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|orig-year=First published in New English Dictionary, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; denotation broadened to mean "specialized", a man who earned his living writing intellectually (not creatively) about literature: the [[essay]]ist, the [[journalist]], the [[critic]], et al. In the 20th century, such an approach was gradually superseded by the academic method, and the term "Man of Letters" became disused, replaced by the generic term "intellectual", describing the intellectual person. In late 19th century, the term ''intellectual'' became common usage to denote the defenders of the falsely accused artillery officer [[Alfred Dreyfus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross (1969); see also Pierson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Continental Europe====
In early 19th century Britain, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] coined the term ''clerisy'', the intellectual class responsible for upholding and maintaining the national culture, the secular equivalent of the Anglican clergy. Likewise, in [[Tsar]]ist Russia, there arose the ''[[intelligentsia]]'' (1860s–70s), who were the [[Status group|status class]] of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] workers. The theologian [[Alister McGrath]] said that "the emergence of a socially alienated, [[theology|theologically]] literate, antiestablishment lay intelligentsia is one of the more significant phenomena of the social history of [[Germany]] in the 1830s", and that "three or four theological graduates in ten might hope to find employment" in a church post.&lt;ref&gt;''The Twilight of Atheism'' (2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, politically radical thinkers already had participated in the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799); [[Robert Darnton]] said that they were not societal outsiders, but "respectable, domesticated, and assimilated".&lt;ref&gt;From "The High Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature", in ''The Literary Underground of the Old Regime'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thenceforth, in Europe, an intellectual class was socially important, especially to self-styled intellectuals, whose participation in society's arts, politics, journalism, and education—of either [[Nationalism|nationalist]], [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]], or ethnic sentiment—constitute "vocation of the intellectual". Moreover, some intellectuals were anti-academic, despite universities (the Academy) being synonymous with [[intellectualism]].

In France, the [[Dreyfus affair]] marked the full emergence of the "intellectual in public life", especially [[Émile Zola]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], and [[Anatole France]] directly addressing the matter of French [[antisemitism]] to the public; thenceforward, "intellectual" became common, yet occasionally derogatory, usage; its French noun usage is attributed to [[Georges Clemenceau]] in 1898.

====Germany====
Habermas' ''Structural Transformation of Public Sphere'' (1963) made significant contribution to the notion of public intellectual by historically and conceptually delineating the idea of private and public.

===In the East===
{{expand section|date=October 2017|small=no}}
In [[Imperial China]], in the period from 206&amp;nbsp;BC until AD&amp;nbsp;1912, the intellectuals were the ''[[Scholar-official]]s'' ("Scholar-gentlemen"), who were civil servants appointed by the [[Emperor of China]] to perform the tasks of daily governance. Such civil servants earned academic degrees by means of [[imperial examination]], and also were skilled [[calligraphy|calligraphers]], and knew [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy. Historian Wing-Tsit Chan concludes that:

{{quote|Generally speaking, the record of these scholar-gentlemen has been a worthy one. It was good enough to be praised and imitated in 18th century Europe. Nevertheless, it has given China a tremendous handicap in their transition from government by men to government by law, and personal considerations in Chinese government have been a curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Alexander Moore, ed.|title=The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DoyN2h56ucC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1967|publisher=U of Hawaii Press|page=22|isbn=9780824800758}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]] (1392–1910), the intellectuals were the ''literati'', who knew how to read and write, and had been designated, as the [[chungin]] (the "middle people"), in accordance with the Confucian system. Socially, they constituted the  [[petite bourgeoisie]], composed of scholar-bureaucrats (scholars, professionals, and technicians) who administered the dynastic rule of the Joseon dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The Korea Foundation|title=Koreana - Winter 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkmOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT73|date=February 12, 2016|pages=73–74|isbn=9791156041573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligentsia==
{{See also|Manufacturing Consent}}
Addressing their role as a social class, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] said that intellectuals are the moral conscience of their age; that their moral and ethical responsibilities are to observe the socio-political moment, and to freely speak to their society, in accordance with their consciences.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993:119&lt;/ref&gt; Like Sartre and [[Noam Chomsky]], public intellectuals usually are [[polymath]]s, knowledgeable of the [[International relations|international order]] of the world, the political and economic organization of contemporary society, the institutions and laws that regulate the lives of the layman citizen, the educational systems, and the private networks of [[Mass communication|mass communication media]] that [[Manufacturing Consent|control]] the broadcasting of information to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999:xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas, intellectuals (political scientists and sociologists), liberals, and democratic socialists usually hold, advocate, and support the principles of democracy (liberty, equality, fraternity, human rights, social justice, social welfare, environmental conservation), and the improvement of socio-political relations in domestic and international politics, the [[Conservatism|conservative]] public-intellectuals usually defend the social, economic, and political ''[[status quo]]'' as the realisation of the "perfect ideals" of [[Platonism]], and present a static [[dominant ideology]], in which utopias are unattainable and politically destabilizing of society.

===Marxist perspective===
In [[Marxist philosophy]], the [[social class]] function of the intellectuals (the [[intelligentsia]]) is to be the source of progressive ideas for the transformation of society; to provide advice and counsel to the political leaders; to interpret the country's politics to the mass of the population (urban workers and peasants); and, as required, to provide leaders from within their own ranks.

The Italian Communist theoretician [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937) developed Karl Marx's conception of the intelligentsia to include political leadership in the public sphere. That, because "all knowledge is [[Existentialism|existentially]]-based", the intellectuals, who create and preserve knowledge, are "spokesmen for different social groups, and articulate particular social interests". That intellectuals occur in each social class and throughout the right wing, the centre, and the left wing of the political spectrum. That, as a social class, the "intellectuals view themselves as autonomous from the [[ruling class]]" of their society. That, in the course of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] meant to achieve political power, every social class requires a native intelligentsia who shape the [[ideology]] (world view) particular to the social class from which they originated. Therefore, the leadership of intellectuals is required for effecting and realizing social change, because:

{{Quotation|A human mass does not "distinguish" itself, does not become independent, in its own right, without, in the widest sense, organising itself; and there is no organisation without intellectuals, that is, without organisers and leaders, in other words, without ... a group of people "specialised" in [the] conceptual and philosophical elaboration of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997:210.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the pamphlet ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' (1902), [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] (1870–1924) said that [[Leninism|vanguard-party revolution]] required the participation of the intellectuals to explain the complexities of [[socialism|socialist]] ideology to the uneducated [[proletariat]] and the urban industrial workers, in  order to integrate them to the revolution; because "the history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own efforts, is able to develop only [[Trade union|trade-union]] consciousness", and will settle for the limited, socio-economic gains so achieved. In Russia, as in [[Continental Europe]], Socialist theory was the product of the "educated representatives of the propertied classes", of "revolutionary socialist intellectuals", such as were Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Blanc, Paul. ''Revolution, Democracy, Socialism: Selected Writings of Lenin'' (Pluto Press, London: 2008) pp. 31, 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the formal codification of [[Leninism]], the Hungarian Marxist philosopher, [[György Lukács]] (1885–1971) identified the intelligentsia as the privileged social class who provide revolutionary leadership. By means of intelligible and accessible interpretation, the intellectuals explain to the workers and peasants the "Who?", the "How?", and the "Why?" of the social, economic, and political ''[[status quo]]''—the ideological totality of society—and its practical, revolutionary application to the transformation of their society.

The term '''public intellectual'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; describes the intellectual participating in the public-affairs [[discourse]] of society, in addition to an academic career.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai. Ed., ''Public Intellectuals'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the [[Academy|academic]] field or the [[profession]]al expertise, the public intellectual addresses and responds to the [[normative]] problems of society, and, as such, is expected to be an impartial critic who can "rise above the partial preoccupation of one's own profession—and engage with the global issues of [[truth]], judgment, and [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, 1987: 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furedi, 2004: 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Representations of the Intellectual]]'' (1994), In summarizing a quote by [[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]], Jennings and Kemp-Welch state that the "… true intellectual is, therefore, always an outsider, living in self-imposed exile, and on the margins of society".&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp Welch, 1997: 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

An intellectual usually is associated with an [[ideology]] or with a [[philosophy]]; e.g., the [[Third Way]] centrism of [[Anthony Giddens]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] of [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;McLennan, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech intellectual [[Václav Havel]] said that politics and intellectuals can be linked, but that moral responsibility for the intellectual's ideas, even when advocated by a politician, remains with the intellectual. Therefore, it is best to avoid [[utopia]]n intellectuals who offer 'universal insights' to resolve the problems of [[political economy]] with [[Public policy|public policies]] that might harm and that have harmed civil society; that intellectuals be mindful of the social and cultural ties created with their words, insights, and ideas; and should be heard as social critics of [[politics]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997"&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997: 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social background===
The American academic [[Peter H. Smith]] describes the intellectuals of Latin America as people from an identifiable social class, who have been conditioned by that common experience, and thus are inclined to share a set of [[Value (ethics)|common assumptions]] (values and ethics); that ninety-four per cent of intellectuals come either from the [[middle class]] or from the [[upper class]], and that only six per cent come from the [[working class]]. In ''The Intellectual'' (2005), philosopher [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steven Fuller]] said that, because [[cultural capital]] confers [[power (social and political)|power]] and social status, as a status group, they must be autonomous in order to be credible as intellectuals:

{{Quotation|It is relatively easy to demonstrate autonomy, if you come from a wealthy or [an] [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] background. You simply need to disown your [[social status|status]] and champion the poor and [the] downtrodden ... autonomy is much harder to demonstrate if you come from a poor or [[Proletariat|proletarian]] background ... [thus] calls to join the wealthy in common cause appear to betray one's class origins.|source=&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, 2005: pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The political importance and effective consequence of [[Émile Zola]] in the [[Dreyfus affair]] (1894–1906) derived from his being a leading French thinker; thus, ''[[J'accuse…!|J'accuse]]'' (I Accuse), his open letter to the French government and the nation proved critical to achieving the exoneration of Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the false charges of treason, which were facilitated by institutional [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], among other ideological defects of the French Establishment.

===Academic background===
In journalism, the term ''intellectual'' usually connotes "a university academic" of the [[humanities]]—especially a [[philosophy|philosopher]]—who addresses important social and political matters of the day. Hence, such an academic functions as a public intellectual who explains the theoretic bases of said problems and communicates possible answers to the policy makers and executive leaders of society. The sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] said that "Intellectuals are not defined according to the jobs they do, but [by] the manner in which they act, the way they see themselves, and the [social and political] values that they uphold.&lt;ref&gt;Furedi (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Public intellectuals usually arise from the educated élite of a society; although the North American usage of the term "intellectual" includes the university academics.&lt;ref&gt;McKee (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between "intellectual" and "academic" is participation in the realm of public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public policy role===
In the matters of [[Public policy doctrine|public policy]], the public intellectual connects scholarly research to the practical matters of solving societal problems. The British sociologist [[Michael Burawoy]], an exponent of [[public sociology]], said that professional sociology has failed, by giving insufficient attention to resolving social problems, and that a dialogue between the academic and the layman would bridge the gap.&lt;ref&gt;Gattone 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An example is how [[Chile]]an intellectuals worked to reestablish [[democracy]] within the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] governments of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)]], the Pinochet régime allowed professional opportunities for some liberal and left-wing social scientists to work as politicians and as consultants in effort to realize the theoretical economics of the [[Chicago Boys]], but their access to [[Power (social and political)|power]] was contingent upon political [[pragmatism]], abandoning the political neutrality of the academic intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Sorkin (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Sociological Imagination]]'' (1959), [[C. Wright Mills]] said that academics had become ill-equipped for participating in public discourse, and that journalists usually are "more politically alert and knowledgeable than sociologists, economists, and especially ... political scientists".&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, 1959: 99.&lt;/ref&gt; That, because the universities of the U.S. are bureaucratic, private businesses, they "do not teach [[Critical thinking|critical reasoning]] to the student", who then does not "how to gauge what is going on in the general struggle for power in modern society".&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; Likewise, [[Richard Rorty]] criticized the participation of intellectuals in public discourse as an example of the "civic irresponsibility of [[Intellectualism|intellect]], especially academic intellect".&lt;ref&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?169625-1/public-intellectuals ''Booknotes'' interview with Posner on ''Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline'', June 2, 2002], [[C-SPAN]]}}
The American legal scholar [[Richard Posner]] said that the participation of academic public intellectuals in the public life of society is characterized by logically untidy and politically biased statements of the kind that would be unacceptable to academia. That there are few ideologically and politically independent public intellectuals, and disapproves that public intellectuals limit themselves to practical matters of public policy, and not with [[Value (ethics)|values]] or [[public philosophy]], or public [[ethics]], or [[public theology]], not with matters of moral and spiritual outrage.

==Criticism==
[[Image:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The economist [[Milton Friedman]] identified the intelligentsia and the business class as interfering with the economic functions of a society.]]
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]] proposed for philosophers a private monopoly of knowledge separate from the public sphere. (the Louvre)]]

[[image:Bertrand Russell transparent bg.png|thumb|upright|As an intellectual, [[Bertrand Russell]] was a pacifist who advised Britain against re-arming for [[World War I]].]]

In "An Interview with Milton Friedman" (1974), the American [[libertarian]] economist [[Milton Friedman]] said that businessmen and the intellectuals are enemies of capitalism; the intellectuals, because most believed in socialism, while the businessman expected economic privileges:

{{Quotation|The two, chief enemies of the free society or [[free enterprise]] are intellectuals, on the one hand, and businessmen, on the other, for opposite reasons. Every intellectual believes in freedom for himself, but he's opposed to freedom for others. ... He thinks ... [that] there ought to be a central planning board that will establish social priorities. ... The businessmen are just the opposite—every businessman is in favor of freedom for everybody else, but, when it comes to himself that's a different question. He's always "the special case". He ought to get special privileges from the government, a [[tariff]], this, that, and the other thing. ...&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reason Magazine]]'', "[http://reason.com/archives/1974/12/01/an-interview-with-milton-fried An Interview with Milton Friedman]". December 1974&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "The Intellectuals and Socialism" (1949), the British libertarian economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], said that "journalists, teachers, ministers, lecturers, publicists, radio commentators, writers of fiction, cartoonists, and artists", are the intellectual social class whose function is to communicate the complex and specialized knowledge of the [[scientist]] to the general public. That, in the twentieth century, the intellectuals were attracted to socialism and to [[social democracy]], because the socialists offered "broad visions; the spacious comprehension of the social order, as a whole, which a [[Planned economy|planned system]] promises" and that such broad-vision philosophies "succeeded in inspiring the imagination of the intellectuals" to change and improve their societies.&lt;ref&gt;"The Intellectuals and Socialism", ''The University of Chicago Law Review'' (Spring 1949),&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hayek, intellectuals disproportionately support socialism for [[idealistic]] and [[utopia]]n reasons that cannot be realized in practical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/etexts/hayekintellectuals.pdf|title=Papers of Interest|work=Mises Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the article "Why Socialism?" (1949), [[Albert Einstein]] said that [[Political economy|the economy]] of the world is not private property because it is a "planetary community of production and consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php |title=Why Socialism? [1949] |author=Albert Einstein |work=Monthly Review |volume=61 |issue=1 |date=May 2009 |origyear=May 1949|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S. society, the intellectual status class are [[demographic]]ally characterized as people who hold [[Liberalism|liberal]]-to-[[leftist]] political perspectives about [[Guns versus butter model|guns-or-butter]] [[fiscal policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1549 |title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media: Section 4: Scientists, Politics and Religion - Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |publisher=People-press.org |date=9 July 2009|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Heartless Lovers of Humankind" (1987), the journalist and [[popular historian]] [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] said:
{{Quotation|It is not the formulation of ideas, however misguided, but the desire to impose them on others that is the deadly sin of the intellectuals. That is why they so incline, by temperament, to [[Left-wing politics|the Left]]. For capitalism merely occurs; if no-one does anything to stop it. It is [[socialism]] that has to be constructed, and, as a rule, forcibly imposed, thus providing a far bigger role for intellectuals in its genesis. The [[Progressivism|progressive]] intellectual habitually entertains [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty|Walter Mitty]] visions of exercising power.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul. "The Heartless Lovers of Humankind", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 5 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The public- and private-knowledge dichotomy originated in [[Ancient Greece]], from [[Socrates]]'s rejection of the [[Sophist]] concept that the pursuit of knowledge ([[truth]]) is a "public market of ideas", open to all men of the city, not only to philosophers. In contradiction to the Sophist's public market of knowledge, Socrates proposed a knowledge monopoly for and by the philosophers; thus, "those who sought a more penetrating and rigorous intellectual life rejected, and withdrew from, the general culture of the city, in order to embrace a new model of professionalism"; the private market of ideas.&lt;ref name=Bender12/&gt;

In the 19th century, addressing the societal place, roles, and functions of intellectuals in American society, the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] theologian [[Edwards Amasa Park]] said, "We do wrong to our own minds, when we carry out scientific difficulties down to the arena of popular dissension".&lt;ref name=Bender12&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; That for the stability of society (social, economic, political) it is necessary "to separate the serious, [[Social engineering (political science)|technical role]] of professionals from their responsibility [for] supplying [[Public policy|usable philosophies]] for the general public"; thus operated Socrate's cultural dichotomy of public-knowledge and private-knowledge, of "civic culture" and "professional culture", the social constructs that describe and establish the [[Intellectualism|intellectual sphere of life]] as separate and apart from the civic sphere of life.&lt;ref name=Bender12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligentsia===
The American historian [[Norman Stone]] said that the intellectual [[social class]] misunderstand the reality of society and so are doomed to the errors of [[logical fallacy]], ideological stupidity, and poor planning hampered by ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp Welch, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoirs, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Margaret Thatcher]] said that the anti-monarchical [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) was "a [[utopia]]n attempt to overthrow a traditional order ... in the name of [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|abstract ideas]], formulated by vain intellectuals".&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, 1993:753.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as Prime Minister, Thatcher asked Britain's academics to help her government resolve the social problems of British society—whilst she retained the [[populist]] opinion of "The Intellectual" as being a man of un-British character, a [[Intellectualism|thinker]], not a doer; Thatcher's anti-intellectualist perspective was shared by the mass media, especially  ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspapers, whose reportage documented a "lack of intellectuals" in Britain.&lt;ref name="Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 2006: 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "Why do intellectuals oppose capitalism?" (1998), [[libertarian]] philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] of the [[Cato Institute]] argued that intellectuals become embittered [[leftist]]s because their academic skills, much rewarded at school and at university, are under-valued and under-paid in the capitalist [[market economy]]; so, the intellectuals turned against capitalism—despite enjoying a more economically and financially comfortable life in a capitalist society than they might enjoy in either a [[socialist]] or a [[communist society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/cpr-20n1-1.html |title=Why do intellectuals oppose capitalism? |first=Robert |last=Nozick |journal=Cato Policy Report |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=January–February 1998 |pages=1, 9–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[post-Communist]] Europe, the social attitude perception of the intelligentsia became [[anti-intellectual]]; in the [[Netherlands]], the word "intellectual" negatively connotes an overeducated person of "unrealistic visions of the World". In [[Hungary]], the intellectual is perceived as an "egghead", a person who is "too-clever" for the good of society. In the [[Czech Republic]], the intellectual is a cerebral person, aloof from reality. Such derogatory connotations of "intellectual" are not definitive, because, in the "case of English usage, positive, neutral, and pejorative uses can easily coexist"; the example is [[Václav Havel]] who, "to many outside observers, [became] a favoured instance of The Intellectual as National Icon" in the early history of the post-Communist Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 2006: 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'' (2010), the economist [[Thomas Sowell]] said that, lacking [[disincentive]]s in professional life, the intellectual (producer of knowledge, not material goods) tends to speak outside his or her area of expertise, and expects social and professional benefits from the [[halo effect]], derived from possessing professional expertise. That, in relation to other professions, the public intellectual is socially detached from the negative and [[unintended consequences]] of [[public policy]] derived from his or her ideas. As such, the philosopher and mathematician [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) advised the British government against national rearmament in the years before [[World War I]] (1914–1918), while the [[German Empire]] prepared for war. Yet, the post-war intellectual reputation of Bertrand Russell remained almost immaculate and his opinions respected by the general public because of the halo effect.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (2010). ''Intellectuals and Society'', Basic Books {{ISBN|0-465-01948-X}}, pp. 218–276 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Criminal law */ the change of 2010 to 2009 was because that was the date the new law was passed. In addition, the sentence "increased from 15 to 20 years, or exceptionally more" doesn't make sense because it is irrelevant and misleading. A felony in the Czech Republic carries a sentence of at least 5 years. The numbers given in the sentence are unnecessary and have no significance.</comment>

'''Czech law''', often referred to as the '''legal order of the Czech Republic''' (''{{lang|cs|právní řád České republiky}}''), is the [[Law|system of legal rules]] in force in the [[Czech Republic]], and in the international community it is a member of. Czech [[List of national legal systems|legal system]] belongs to the Germanic branch of continental legal culture ([[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]).&lt;ref name="bobek"&gt;Bobek, Michal. [http://www.nyulawglobal.org/Globalex/Czech_Republic1.htm "UPDATE: An Introduction to the Czech Legal System and Legal Resources Online. "] ''GlobaLex''. Hauser Global Law School Program, New York University School of Law, Sept. 2009. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Major areas of [[Public law|public]] and [[private law]] are divided into branches, among them civil, criminal, administrative, procedural and labour law, and systematically codified.

Written law is the basis of the legal order, and the most important [[Sources of law|source of law]] are: [[Regulation|legal regulations]] ([[Act of Parliament|acts of parliament]], as well as [[delegated legislation]]), [[Treaty|international treaties]] (once they have been [[Ratification|ratified]] by the parliament and [[Promulgation|promulgated]]), and such findings of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]], in which a statute or its part has been nullified as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. It is [[government gazette|made public]] by the periodically published ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated ''Sb.'' (“Collection of Law”, “Coll.”), and ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'' (“Collection of International Treaties”).

The system of law and justice in the Czech Republic has been in constant development since the [[Velvet Revolution|1989 regime change]]. In 1993, the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been enacted, which postulates the [[Rechtsstaat|rule of law]], outlines the [[Politics of the Czech Republic|structure and principles of democratic government]], and declares human rights and rights of the citizen. Since 2004, the membership in the EU means the priority of  [[European Union law]] over Czech law in some areas. Recently, a brand new Criminal Code entered into force in 2010, and the Civil Code followed in 2014.

== Sources of law ==

Sources of Czech law are (in this hierarchical order):&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

* the Constitution (''{{lang|cs|Ústava}}'') and constitutional acts (''{{lang|cs|ústavní zákony}}'')
* international treaties ratified by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|mezinárodní smlouvy ratifikované parlamentem}}'')
* statutes adopted by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|zákony přijaté parlamentem}}''), published decisions of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]
* derived legislation: government orders&lt;ref&gt;also translated as government decrees&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|nařízení vlády}}'') and notifications of ministries&lt;ref&gt;sometimes orders of ministries&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|vyhlášky ministerstev}}''); legislative acts of territorial self-government bodies: regional ordinances&lt;ref&gt;or [[by-law|byelaws]], if you prefer&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|krajské vyhlášky}}'') and municipal ordinances (''{{lang|cs|obecní vyhlášky}}'')

Acts of parliament and other legal regulations enter into force on the day they are [[Promulgation|promulgated]] (published) in the official ''Collection of Law'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated as ''{{lang|cs|Sb.}}'' – ''Coll.'' – when referring to statutes), although they may take effect at a later date. International treaties are similarly published in the ''Collection of International Treaties'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://aplikace.mvcr.cz/sbirka-zakonu/ Official online version of Collection of Law and Collection of International Treaties]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sbírka zákonů 1993 částka 001 strana 01.png|thumb|The Constitution of the Czech Republic as published in the Collection of Laws]]

=== Constitutional law ===

Czech [[constitution]] is written, and it consists of several [[Constitutional act of the Czech Republic|constitutional acts]] (one of them [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|the Constitution of the Czech Republic]]), together they are known as the [[constitutional order of the Czech Republic]] (''{{lang|cs|ústavní pořádek}}'').

The constitution can be viewed as [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]], because constitutional statutes are more difficult to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal them than ordinary laws of the country. A special majority (constitutional supermajority) is required of three-fifths of all Deputies and a qualified majority of three-fifths of all Senators present.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="concourt1"&gt;Czech Republic. Constitutional Court. [http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/2092 "Constitutional Order of the Czech Republic. "] ''The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. '' Ústavní soud ČR, n.d. Web. 03 Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is to promote continuity and stability of the political system.

Most important constitutional acts are:

* Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll. the Constitution of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40450&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=1~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb. Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resolution No. 2/1993 Coll. [...] incorporating Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms [...]&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40453&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=2~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Usnesení č. 2/1993 Sb. Předsednictva České národní rady o vyhlášení LISTINY ZÁKLADNÍCH PRÁV A SVOBOD jako součásti ústavního pořádku České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In full: Resolution no. 2/1993 Coll. of the Presidium of the Czech National Council of 16 December 1992 on the declaration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms as a part of the constitutional order of the Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Coll. on the Security of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=46612&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=110~2F1998&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 110/1998 Sb. o bezpečnosti České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constitutional Act No. 347/1997 Coll. on the Creation of Higher Territorial Self-Governing Units&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=45807&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=347~2F1997&amp;rpp=15#local-content Zákon č. 347/1997 Sb. o vytvoření vyšších územních samosprávných celků a o změně ústavního zákona České národní rady č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] declares sovereignty (self-government) of the people and the values of freedom and democracy. It defines the separation of the three powers in a system of [[Separation of powers|Checks and balances]]. It gives the legislative power to the popularly elected [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Parliament]] consisting of two chambers, the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]]. The executive power is divided between the [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] and the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]]. It describes the functioning of the [[Judiciary of the Czech Republic|judiciary]], especially the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]. Two more institutions are established, the [[Czech National Bank]] and the [[Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic|Supreme Audit Office]].

The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] (''{{lang|cs|Listina základních práv a svobod}}'') is a [[bill of rights]] document enacted in 1991 by the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic|Czechoslovak Federative Republic]]. In the Czech Republic it was kept in its entirety and forms a part of the constitutional order (i.e. has the same legal force as the Constitution). It postulates the sanctity of natural human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as citizens' (political) rights, the equality before the law, rights of minorities and so on.

The Constitution has been seriously modified in February 2012, introducing a controversial popular vote of the [[President of the Czech Republic]]:&lt;ref name="concourt1" /&gt;

* Constitutional Act No. 71/2012 Coll.&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=77110&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=71~2F2012&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 71/2012 Sb., kterým se mění ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky, ve znění pozdějších ústavních zákonů]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;which amends the Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll., the Constitution of the Czech Republic as amended by subsequent constitutional acts&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International treaties ===

On joining the [[European Union]], the Czech Republic committed itself to respect the principle of the supremacy of [[Community acquis|European law]] over Czech law in defined areas.&lt;ref&gt;Czech Republic. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "[http://www.czech.cz/en/Life-Work/How-things-work-here/Law/The-system-of-independent-courts The System of Independent Courts]. " ''[http://www.czech.cz Hello Czech Republic (Czech Republic - The Official Website)]''. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 01 Jan. 2010. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important treaty in this category is the [[Council of Europe]]’s [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

=== Statutes adopted by the Parliament ===

Major areas of Czech law are codified in a systematic manner.

==== Criminal law ====

Most important statutes in the criminal justice field are:

* Act No. 40/2009 Coll., the Criminal Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=68040&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=40~2F2009&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 40/2009 Sb trestní zákoník]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Criminal Procedure Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=30139&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=141~2F1961&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 141/1961 Sb. o trestním řízení soudním (trestní řád)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;sometimes rendered as Code of Criminal Justice&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 218/2003 Coll., on Juvenile Criminal Justice&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=55745&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=218~2F2003&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 218/2003 Sb. o odpovědnosti mládeže za protiprávní činy a o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže a o změně některých zákonů (zákon o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Czech [[criminal law]] is regulated mainly, though not only, by the Criminal Code Act 2009 (''{{lang|cs|trestní zákoník}}''), which codifies substantive criminal law. The comprehensive regulatory statute for criminal procedure is the Criminal Proceedings Code Act 1961 (''{{lang|cs|trestní řád}}''). The two codes are complemented by the Juvenile Criminal Justice Act 2003, which deals with alleged offenders aged between 15 (the threshold of criminal liability as well as [[Age of consent|age of legal consent]]) and 17.

Until 2009, the criminal code statute in force dated back to 1961. In spite of numerous amendments made since the 1989, it still conformed to the communist ideology, oriented on punishment of perceived enemies of the socialist regime. As a part of an effort to comprehensively reform law and justice, a brand new codification has been written. The Ministry of Justice announced it as an "elaborate piece of work boiled down from the experience and knowledge of foremost expert on criminal law", which can be proudly compared to modern criminal codes of other democratic countries.&lt;ref name="moj"&gt;Czech Republic. Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR. [http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html "Obecně o trestním zákoníku. "] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217044737/http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html |date=2013-02-17 }} ''Reforma justice. '' Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR, n.d. Web. 12 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the 2009 codification was to bring the criminal justice system in line with the rest of Europe. The main change introduced by the code was transition from material to formal conception of criminal offence. Another thing the lawyers drafting the 2009 code had in mind, and expressed it in the area of sentencing tariffs, was a new balance of punishment against rehabilitation effect on the criminal. On one hand we see the sentences for felony (''{{lang|cs|zločin}}'') which carry a sentence of at least 5 years. On the other a newly created category of misdemeanour (''{{lang|cs|přečin}}'') introduces a host of community sentences (''{{lang|cs|alternativní tresty}}''), including community payback (''{{lang|cs|veřejně prospěšné práce}}'') or house arrest (''{{lang|cs|domácí vězení}}''). The code also outlaws doping.&lt;ref name="moj" /&gt;

Less serious breaches of law are called [[contravention]]s (''{{lang|cs|přestupek}}'').&lt;ref&gt;The word ''přestupek'' (pl. ''přestupky'') can be found translated variously, even in official translations, as ''infraction'', ''administrative infraction'', ''administrative offence'', ''offence'' (!), ''offence'', ''transgression'', ''misdemeanour'', or ''violation''.&lt;/ref&gt; These are not normally dealt with by the courts of law, but rather punished either by the police on the spot, or through a procedure in front of a committee at the local or municipal authority, or sometimes other administration body. The result is not a conviction, and so such a punishment will not blemish the culprit's criminal record. Like with other administrative acts, the outcome of this procedure can be challenged through the administrative justice process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novotný|first=Václav|title=Administrative Justice in Europe – Report for the Czech Republic|date=n.d.|publisher=Association of Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions|url=http://www.juradmin.eu/en/eurtour/i/countries/czech/czech_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical example of contraventions in Czech law this are driving offences. (In the common law world, acts falling into this category would be classed as [[summary offence]]s.)
* Act No. 200/1990 on Contraventions&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=38544&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=p~C5~99estupky&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 200/1990 Sb. o přestupcích]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, Czech law also recognizes [[Corporate liability|criminal liability of corporations]] for offences committed by employees of a corporation, when acting on its behalf, being instructed by the board of directors or other representative of the company, or through lack of their action. In such cases, not only individuals will be prosecuted, but the corporation can be prosecuted as well for the same offence and punished by a host of measures, starting from cetrain injunctions, through fines a forfeitures, to liquidation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trubač|first=Ondeřej|title=Trestní odpovědnost právnické osoby|url=http://finance.idnes.cz/trestni-odpovednost-pravnickych-osob-dhf-/pravo.aspx?c=A120305_210154_pravo_vr|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=iDNES.cz|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skalická|first=Hana|title=Corporate Criminal Liability in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.terralex.org/publication/p58cf9663e3/corporate-criminal-liability-in-the-czech-republic|work=Newsletter - TerraLex Practice Groups|publisher=TerraLex|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil law ====

Main statutes regulating this area are:

* Act No. 89/2012 Coll. the Civil Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/sqw/sbirka.sqw?r=2012&amp;cz=89 Zákon č. 89/2012 Sb. občanský zákoník]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Code codifies core areas of [[private law]]. It has five parts. The first part is dedicated to a legal status of a person as an individual. The second regulates family law – e.g. the institute of marriage and the rights and obligations of husband and wife, parents and children.&lt;ref name="novyoz" /&gt; Although the Code does include [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Czech Republic|registered partnership]], it explicitly prohibits adoption to a person in a registered partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/tinymce-storage/files/sb0033-2012.pdf "Zákon 89/2012 občanský zákoník.

The civil code regulation effective since 1 January 2014 is a result of eleven years of work of the recodification committee of the [[Ministry of Justice (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Justice]]. Together with the Commercial Corporations Act and the Private International Law Act it constitutes a complete recodification of private law in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="novyoz"&gt;Czech Republic.

=== Case law ===

Theoretically, case law is not defined as a source of law in the Czech Republic. Despite that, the decisions of courts, namely supreme courts and the Constitutional Court, have a significant influence over the Czech legal system since 1989.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt; Findings of the Constitutional Court are considered a source of law, and are binding for general courts.&lt;ref&gt;"Enforceable rulings of the Constitutional Court shall be binding for all agencies and individuals. " – Constitution, Art. 89&lt;/ref&gt; If a lower court is to rule against "consistent adjudications" of the Supreme Court on the point of law, it must give detailed reasoning, and this can often be a reason for a successful appeal. This system is largely based on judiciary's own interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it gives citizens predictability and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fetter|first=Richard W.|title=Musejí nižší soudy poslouchat Nejvyšší soud?|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/paragrafy/zpravy/museji-nizsi-soudy-poslouchat-nejvyssi-soud/453253|accessdate=7 January 2013|newspaper=České noviny|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant judgements of both courts are published in the official Collection of Laws.&lt;ref name="concourt2"&gt;Czech Republic.

== History ==
[[File:Theresiana-Titel.jpg|thumb|[[Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana]], 1768]]
In [[Czech lands]], the process of formation of modern legislation dates back to the era of [[enlightened absolutism]], when they were a core part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. Reforms of government were to a large extent the work of empress [[Maria Theresa]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], who participated in creating the first [[civil code]] of the country in 1787, called [[Josephinisches Gesetzbuch]]. This was a forbearer to the comprehensive codification of civil law in 1811, known as the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] (ABGB). ABGB was [[Reception statute|received]] in 1918 by Czechoslovakia, among other successor states, but only for Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia), while Slovakia kept the customary law of Hungary. Albeit updated many times, this Austrian law was kept in Czechoslovakia, along with the legal duality, until 1950, when the "Middle Civil Code" was promulgated, soon to be superseded by the civil code of 1964, which will be in force until the "New Civil Code", enacted in 2009, will enter in force in 2014.

Following in the tracks of their enlightenment predecessors, the [[Constitutio criminalis Josephina]] of 1707 and the [[Constitutio criminalis Theresiana]] of 1768, the most important Czechoslovakian [[criminal code]]s were enacted in 1950, 1961 and 2009.

The history of Czechoslovak constitutionality starts with the formation of independent [[Czechoslovakia]] out of the ruins of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1918, the [[Interim Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] has been enacted hastily, establishing the republic with its president and temporary parliament. The [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920]] succeeded it, inspired by western democratic constitutions, and, controversially, postulating the [[Czechoslovakism|Czechoslovak nation]]. This lasted over the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|First Republic]] and the second world war. In 1948, the so-called [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]] was enacted after the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|communist coup]] – preserving some democratic institutions (human rights, partial division of the three powers, independent judiciary), though the political reality of the country departed from it radically. The [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]], influenced by soviet constitutions, is often dubbed the "Socialist Constitution". It changed the name of the country to [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak ''Socialist'' Republic]] and defined socialist, rather than democratic, character of the state, and introduced the leading role of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. The 1960 constitution remained in force until 1992, although in 1968 it was substantially modified by the [[Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation]] – this transformed the unitary state into a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. Further radical modifications were enacted after the [[Velvet Revolution|regime change of 1989]], but they turned out to be short-lived, as in 1992 the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been promulgated after the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|division of Czechoslovakia]], and entered into force in 1993.

[[File:Pablo picasso 1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pablo Picasso]] 1962]]
'''Avant-garde''' ({{IPA-fr|avɑ̃ ɡaʁd}}) is [[French language|French]] for "vanguard".&lt;ref name="dictref"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=avant-garde|title=Avant-garde definitions|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in French, English, and German to refer to people or works that are [[experiment]]al or innovative, particularly with respect to [[art]] and [[culture]].

Avant-garde represents a pushing of the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The notion of the existence of the avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]]. Postmodernism posits that the age of the constant pushing of boundaries is no longer with us and that avant-garde has little to no applicability in the age of [[Postmodern art]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4205">'''MERODE'''&lt;ref&gt;Snoeck, M. (2014). Enterprise Information Systems Engineering: The MERODE approach: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Object-oriented modeling|Object Oriented]] [[Enterprise modelling|Enterprise Modeling]] method developed at [[KU Leuven]] (Belgium). Its name is the abbreviation of '''M'''odel driven, '''E'''xistence dependency '''R'''elation, '''O'''bject oriented '''DE'''velopment. MERODE is a method for creating [[domain model]]s (also called conceptual models) as basis for building information systems making use of two prominent [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagramming techniques - [[class diagram]] and [[state diagram]]s. Starting from a high-level [[Platform-independent model|PIM]] (close to a Computational Independent Model ([[Computational Independent Model|CIM]])) allows removing or hiding details irrelevant for a [[conceptual model]]ling view which makes the approach easier to understand. 
The method is grounded in process algebra, which enables mathematical reasoning on models. Thanks to this, models can be checked for internal consistency and mutual completeness, i.e. inter/intra model consistency and syntactical quality. The automated reasoning ("consistency by construction") &lt;ref&gt;Snoeck, M., Michiels, C., &amp; Dedene, G. (2003). Consistency by construction: The case of MERODE. In M. A. Jeusfeld, Pastor, Oscar (Ed.), Conceptual modeling for novel application domains, LNCS (Vol. 2814, pp. 105-117).&lt;/ref&gt; also caters for autocomplete functionality, which allows creating correct models faster.

A typical MERODE analysis or conceptualisation consists of three views or diagrams: a so-called existence dependency graph (EDG) similar to a [[UML class metamodel|UML class diagram]], a proprietary concept namely an object event table (OET) and a group of [[finite-state machine|finite state machine]]s.

MERODE fosters a [[model-driven engineering]] approach to software development. It targets platform independent domain models that are sufficiently complete for execution, i.e. transformation to platform-specific models and to code. In order to achieve automated transformation of models, MERODE limits the use of UML to a number of well-defined constructs with clear semantics and complements this with the notion of "existence dependency" &lt;ref&gt;Snoeck M, Dedene G (1998) Existence Dependency: the key to semantic integrity between structural and behavioral aspects of object types. IEEE Trans Softw Eng 24(24):233–251&lt;/ref&gt; and a proprietary approach to object interaction modelling.

MERODE-models can be created with the opensource case tool JMermaid.&lt;ref&gt;http://merode.econ.kuleuven.ac.be/mermaid.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The tool also allows checking the models for consistency and readiness for transformation.

One-click prototype production lowers the required skill-set for its useful application. By embedding the models into the application, the behaviour of the prototype can be traced back to the models, i.e. making it possible to validate the semantic [[quality of models]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21697">In [[theoretical physics]], particularly in [[discussions]] of [[:Category:Theories of gravitation|gravitation theories]],  '''Mach's principle''' (or '''Mach's conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Von Bayer, ''The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science'', Courier Dover Publications (2001), {{ISBN|0-486-41707-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VhJr9Qx8ohsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=mach's+conjecture&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Scny_DNMuM&amp;sig=Wm2-2sWSkBltjREyyxNkh1g-wFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result page 79].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name given by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to an imprecise hypothesis often credited to the [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach#Philosophy of science|Ernst Mach]]. The idea is that the existence of [[absolute rotation]] (the distinction of local [[inertial frame]]s vs. [[rotating reference frame]]s) is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |last=Steven |first=Weinberg |publisher= Wiley |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-471-92567-5 |location=USA |pages= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mach's principle says that this is not a coincidence—that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here". A very general statement of Mach's principle is "local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe".&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time |author1=Stephen W. Hawking  |author2=George Francis Rayner Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-0-521-09906-6 |date=1973 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QagG_KI7Ll8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ellis+inauthor:Hawking#PPA1,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the [[general theory of relativity]]. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[Gödel metric|Gödel rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Berkeley | title=The Principles of Human Knowledge | date=1726}} See paragraphs 111–117, 1710.&lt;/ref&gt; The book  ''Absolute or Relative Motion?'' (1896) by [[Benedict Friedländer]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

== Einstein's use of the principle ==
There is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.

In Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub. Co. |date=1960 |lccn= 60010179 }} This is a reprint of the English translation by Thomas H. MCormack (first published in 1906) with a new introduction by [[Karl Menger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe.There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.}}

[[Albert Einstein]] seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines of:&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;A. Einstein, letter to Ernst Mach, Zurich, 25 June 1913, in {{cite book |author1=Misner, Charles |author2=Thorne, Kip S. |author3=Wheeler, John Archibald |last-author-amp=yes |title= Gravitation |location= San Francisco |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}

In this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.

The writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was "The Science of Mechanics", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called "Newton's [[bucket argument]]".

In his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that:

{{quote|one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.}}

Mach, in his book, says that:

{{quote|the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and "absolute" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.}}

This same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere "redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) | title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the former way, originating a long-lasting debate.

Most physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect. It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |place=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7|pages=9–57}} (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].

== Mach's principle in general relativity ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by "Mach's principle" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location= Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=530}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.

Einstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:
{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;}}

The Lense–Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that "matter there influences inertia here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that "inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.

More fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as "the fixed stars".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.

A stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler–Mach–Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space |compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where "a particular moment in the universe" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=188–207}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in Tübingen in 1993, when asked the question "Is general relativity perfectly Machian?", 3 respondents replied "yes", and 22 replied "no".  To the question "Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?" the result was 14 "yes" and 7 "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7 |page=106}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:
{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:
# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.
# The principle of equivalence.
# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): … that the ''g&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;''. 
In 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, 
"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however."

It must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther. It must also be said that the origin of inertia is and remains the most obscure subject in the theory of particles and fields. Mach's principle may therefore have a future – but not without the quantum theory.

== Variations in the statement of the principle ==
The broad notion that "mass there influences inertia here" has been expressed in several forms.
[[Hermann Bondi]] and Joseph Samuel have listed eleven distinct statements that can be called Mach principles, labelled by ''Mach0'' through ''Mach10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bondi, Hermann |author2=Samuel, Joseph |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |volume=228 |issue=3 |journal=Physics Letters A |pages=121–126 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B}}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles", which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  Though their list is not necessarily exhaustive, it does give a flavor for the variety possible.

* ''Mach0'': The universe, as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies, does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames.
* ''Mach1'': Newton’s [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is a [[dynamical field]].
* ''Mach2'': An isolated body in otherwise empty space has no inertia.
* ''Mach3'': Local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter.
* ''Mach4'': The universe is spatially closed.
* ''Mach5'': The total energy, angular and linear momentum of the universe are zero.
* ''Mach6'': Inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter.
* ''Mach7'': If you take away all matter, there is no more space.
* ''Mach8'': &lt;math&gt;\Omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ 4 \pi \rho G T^2&lt;/math&gt; is a definite number, of order unity, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mean density of matter in the universe, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble time]].
* ''Mach9'': The theory contains no absolute elements.
* ''Mach10'': Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7909">A '''McKenzie friend''' assists a [[litigant in person]] in a court of law in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Australia. This person does not need to be legally qualified. The crucial point is that litigants in person (known as ''party litigants'' in Scotland) are entitled to have assistance, lay or professional, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

Their role was set out most clearly in the eponymous 1970 case ''McKenzie v McKenzie''.&lt;ref&gt;[1971] P 33; [1970] 3 [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting|WLR]] 472; [1970] 3 All ER 1034, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Although in many cases a McKenzie friend may be an actual friend, it is often somebody with knowledge of the area, and the trend is heavily in favour of admitting McKenzie friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed1568 McKenzie Friends], ''[[Family Law Week]]'', Retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  He or she may be liable for any misleading advice given to the litigant in person{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} but is not covered by [[professional indemnity]] insurance.

The role is distinct from that of a [[next friend]] or of an ''[[amicus curiae]]''.  A similar, modified principle exists in Singapore.

==Origin==
''McKenzie v. McKenzie'' was a [[divorce]] case in England.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/little-help-from-my-friends-1-1036759|title=Little help from my friends|last=Forsyth |first=John|date=4 May 2009 |work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levine McKenzie, who was petitioning for divorce, had been [[Legal Aid|legally aided]] but the legal aid had been withdrawn before the case went to court. Unable to fund legal representation, McKenzie had broken off contact with his solicitors, Geoffrey Gordon &amp; Co.. However, one day before the hearing, Geoffrey Gordon &amp; Co. sent the case to an Australian barrister in London, Ian Hanger, whose qualifications in law in Australia did not allow him to practise as a barrister in London. Hanger hoped to sit with his client to prompt him, take notes and suggest questions in cross-examination, thereby providing what quiet assistance he could from the [[bar table]] to a man representing himself. The trial judge ordered Hanger not to take any active part in the case (except to advise McKenzie during [[Adjournment#Law|adjournments]]) and to sit in the public gallery of the [[court]].  Hanger assumed his limited role was futile and did not return for the second day of the trial.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"/&gt;

The case went against McKenzie, who then appealed to the [[England and Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] on the basis that he had been denied representation. On 12 June 1970, the Court of Appeal ruled that the judge's intervention had deprived McKenzie of the assistance to which he was entitled and ordered a retrial.&lt;ref name="McKenzie v McKenzie"&gt;"Litigant In Person Has Right To Assistance" (Law report), ''[[The Times]]'', 17 June 1970, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Hanger [[Order of Australia|AM]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], the original McKenzie friend, is now a [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC) at the [[Queensland]] Bar.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nadrac.gov.au_CommitteeMembers_Hanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadrac.gov.au/www/nadrac/nadrac.nsf/Page/About_NADRACCouncil_Members|title=Council Members|publisher=[[National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Committee]]|accessdate=26 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403083531/http://www.nadrac.gov.au/www/nadrac/nadrac.nsf/Page/About_NADRACCouncil_Members|archivedate=3 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In specific jurisdictions==

===Singapore===
In September 2006, the [[Judicial system of Singapore|Subordinate Courts of Singapore]] started a pilot project called the Lay Assistant Scheme in which persons, usually with some legal knowledge, attend hearings with litigants who are not represented by lawyers to advise them on non-legal issues and help them with administrative tasks. The scheme, a modification of the U.K.'s McKenzie friend system, is intended to assist litigants who are not eligible for legal aid as they have an annual salary exceeding S$10,000 but cannot afford a lawyer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} For the litigant to qualify, the other party must be legally represented.

Lay assistants are not allowed to act as lawyers and may not address the court; any breach of court rules may render them liable to a maximum fine of $1,000 or imprisonment of up to six months.

Plans for introducing McKenzie friends in court proceedings were first announced by [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Chan Sek Keong]] in May 2006. Students from the Pro Bono Group of the [[National University of Singapore#Law|Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore]], have been participating in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Ansley Ng, "[http://www.todayonline.com/articles/164112.asp Law Undergrads in Court's Pilot Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312054050/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/164112.asp|date=2007-03-12}}", ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' [http://www.todayonline.com] (5 January 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
In English courts, where a case is being heard in private, the use of a McKenzie friend has sometimes been contentious. This is a particular problem in [[family court]] hearings, where it has been held that the nature of the case is so confidential that no one other than the litigants and their professional legal representatives should be admitted to the court.

A 2005 Court of Appeal case, ''In the matter of the children of Mr O'Connell, Mr Whelan and Mr Watson'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | court = EWCA | division = Civ | year = 2005 | num = 759 | litigants = O'Connel &amp; Ors (Children) Rev 2 | date = 22 June 2005 | parallelcite = [2005] 3 WLR 1191, [2006] Fam 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; clarified the law in this area. The result of the appeal has legitimised the use of McKenzie friends in the family court and allowed the litigant to disclose confidential court papers to the McKenzie friend.

England and Wales allow fee charging McKenzie friends, who may charge for their services, including the giving of legal advice. A recent report by the Legal Service Consumer Panel found that fee charging McKenzie friends were a net benefit. The report stated, "They should be viewed as providing valuable support that improves access to justice in the large majority of cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/apr/17/legal-watchdog-culture-shift-fee-charding-mckenzie-friends |title=Legal watchdog urges culture shift over fee-charging McKenzie friends |first=Owen |last=Bowcott |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/practice/culture-change-needed-to-embrace-fee-charging-mckenzie-friends/5040875.fullarticle ‘Culture change’ needed to embrace fee-charging McKenzie friends], [[The Law Society Gazette]], Retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Scotland has a separate legal system from England and Wales. The first recorded use of McKenzie friends in Scotland was in April 2007 in the case ''TB &amp; AM v. [[Scottish Children's Reporter Administration|The Authority Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment-search?indexCatalogue=sheriff-court-judgments&amp;searchQuery=tb+%26+am+v+the+authority+reporter&amp;wordsMode=0&lt;/ref&gt; The one major difference between England and Scotland is that in Scotland McKenzie friends are not permitted to receive remuneration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19188">In the mathematical field of [[real analysis]], the '''monotone convergence theorem''' is any of a number of related theorems proving the [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of [[monotonic sequence]]s (sequences that are [[increasing]] or [[decreasing]]) that are also [[Bounded function|bounded]]. Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a [[supremum]], then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an [[infimum]], it will converge to the infimum.

==Convergence of a monotone sequence of real numbers==

===Lemma 1===
If a sequence of real numbers is increasing and bounded above, then its [[supremum]] is the limit.

===Proof===
Let &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; be such a sequence. By assumption, &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty and bounded above. By the [[least-upper-bound property]] of real numbers, &lt;math&gt;c = \sup_n \{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is finite. Now, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_N &gt; c - \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;, since otherwise &lt;math&gt;c - \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts to the definition of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Then since &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is increasing, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is its upper bound, for every &lt;math&gt;n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|c - a_n| \leq |c - a_N| &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by definition, the limit of &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sup_n \{a_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lemma 2===
If a sequence of real numbers is decreasing and bounded below, then its [[infimum]] is the limit.

===Proof===
The proof is similar to the proof for the case when the sequence is increasing and bounded above,

===Theorem===
If &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is a monotone [[sequence]] of [[real number]]s (i.e., if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''n'' ≥ 1 or ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''n'' ≥ 1), then this sequence has a finite limit if and only if the sequence is [[bounded sequence|bounded]].&lt;ref&gt;A generalisation of this theorem was given by {{cite journal |first=John |last=Bibby |year=1974 |title=Axiomatisations of the average and a further generalisation of monotonic sequences |journal=[[Glasgow Mathematical Journal]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=63–65 |doi=10.1017/S0017089500002135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof===
* "If"-direction: The proof follows directly from the lemmas.
* "Only If"-direction: By [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|definition of limit]], every sequence &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; with a finite limit &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily bounded.

==Convergence of a monotone series==

===Theorem===
If for all natural numbers ''j'' and ''k'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-negative real number and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1,''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, then&lt;ref&gt;See for instance {{cite book |first=J. |last=Yeh |title=Real Analysis: Theory of Measure and Integration |location=Hackensack, NJ |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 |isbn=981-256-653-8 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{j\to\infty} \sum_k a_{j,k} = \sum_k \lim_{j\to\infty} a_{j,k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem states that if you have an infinite matrix of non-negative real numbers such that
#the columns are weakly increasing and bounded, and
#for each row, the [[series (mathematics)|series]] whose terms are given by this row has a convergent sum,
then the limit of the sums of the rows is equal to the sum of the series whose term ''k'' is given by the limit of column ''k'' (which is also its [[supremum]]). The series has a convergent sum if and only if the (weakly increasing) sequence of row sums is bounded and therefore convergent.

As an example, consider the infinite series of rows

::&lt;math&gt; \left( 1+ \frac1 n\right)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n \binom nk/n^k = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac1{k!} \times \frac nn \times \frac{n-1}n\times\cdots\times\frac{n-k+1}n,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' approaches infinity (the limit of this series is [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]). Here the matrix entry in row ''n'' and column ''k'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk/n^k=\frac1{k!}\times\frac nn\times\frac{n-1}n\times\cdots\times\frac{n-k+1}n;&lt;/math&gt;

the columns (fixed ''k'') are indeed weakly increasing with ''n'' and bounded (by 1/''k''!), while the rows only have finitely many nonzero terms, so condition 2 is satisfied; the theorem now says that you can compute the limit of the row sums &lt;math&gt;(1+1/n)^n&lt;/math&gt; by taking the sum of the column limits, namely&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac1{k!}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem for Lebesgue integral==
The following result is due to [[Beppo Levi]] and [[Henri Lebesgue]]. In what follows, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of Borel sets on &lt;math&gt;[0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;.  By definition, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt; contains the set &lt;math&gt;\{+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; and all Borel subsets of &lt;math&gt;\R_{\geq 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[measure (mathematics)|measure space]], and &lt;math&gt;X\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a pointwise non-decreasing sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_k\}^\infty_{k=1}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-[[Measurable function|measurable]] non-negative functions &lt;math&gt;f_k:X\to [0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., for every &lt;math&gt;{k\geq 1}&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;{x\in X}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq f_k(x) \leq f_{k+1}(x)\leq\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Set the pointwise limit of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. That is, for every  &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; f(x):= \lim_{k\to\infty} f_k(x). &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable and

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k\to\infty} \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \int_X f \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark 1.''' The integrals may be finite or infinite.

'''Remark 2.''' The theorem remains true if its assumptions hold &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-almost everywhere. In other words, it is enough that there is a [[null set]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; non-decreases for every &lt;math&gt;{x\in X\setminus N}.&lt;/math&gt; To see why this is true, we start with an observation that allowing the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ f_n \}&lt;/math&gt; to pointwise non-decrease almost everywhere causes its pointwise limit &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be undefined on some null set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. On that null set, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may then be defined arbitrarily, e.g. as zero, or in any other way that preserves measurability. To see why this will not affect the outcome of the theorem, note that since &lt;math&gt;{\mu(N)=0},&lt;/math&gt; we have, for every &lt;math&gt;k,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \int_{X \setminus N} f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_X f \,d\mu = \int_{X \setminus N} f \,d\mu, &lt;/math&gt;

provided that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable.&lt;ref name="SCHECHTER1997"&gt;See for instance {{cite book |first=Erik |last=Schechter |title=Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-12-622760-8 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=section 21.38}} (These equalities follow directly from the definition of Lebesgue integral for a non-negative function).

'''Remark 3.''' Under assumptions of the theorem,
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
| &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x) = \liminf_k f_k(x) = \limsup_k f_k(x) = \sup_k f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \liminf_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \textstyle \limsup_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \sup_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
}}

(Note that the second chain of equalities follows from Remark 5).

'''Remark 4.''' The proof below does not use any properties of Lebesgue integral except those established here. The theorem, thus, can be used to prove other basic properties, such as linearity, pertaining to Lebesgue integration.

'''Remark 5 (monotonicity of Lebesgue integral).''' In the proof below, we apply the monotonic property of Lebesgue integral to non-negative functions only. Specifically (see Remark 4), let the functions &lt;math&gt;f,g : X \to [0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable.

*If &lt;math&gt;f \leq g&lt;/math&gt; everywhere on &lt;math&gt;X,&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu \leq \int_X g\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

*If &lt;math&gt; X_1,X_2 \in \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_1 \subseteq X_2, &lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{X_1} f\,d\mu \leq \int_{X_2} f\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof.''' Denote &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SF}(h)&lt;/math&gt; the set of simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, \operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable functions &lt;math&gt;s:X\to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;0\leq s\leq h&lt;/math&gt; everywhere on &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt; 

'''1.''' Since &lt;math&gt;f \leq g,&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SF}(f) \subseteq \operatorname{SF}(g). &lt;/math&gt;

By definition of Lebesgue integral and the properties of supremum,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu = \sup_{s\in {\rm SF}(f)}\int_X s\,d\mu \leq \sup_{s\in {\rm SF}(g)}\int_X s\,d\mu = \int_X g\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

'''2.''' Let &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf 1}_{X_1}&lt;/math&gt; be the indicator function of the set &lt;math&gt;X_1.&lt;/math&gt; It can be deduced from the definition of Lebesgue integral that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{X_2} f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \,d\mu = \int_{X_1} f \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

if we notice that, for every &lt;math&gt;s \in {\rm SF}(f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1}),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt; outside of &lt;math&gt;X_1.&lt;/math&gt; Combined with the previous property, the inequality &lt;math&gt; f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \leq f&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{X_1} f \,d\mu = \int_{X_2} f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \,d\mu \leq \int_{X_2} f \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
This proof does ''not'' rely on [[Fatou's lemma]]. However, we do explain how that lemma might be used.

For those not interested in independent proof, the intermediate results below may be skipped.
====Intermediate results====
=====Lebesgue integral as measure=====
'''Lemma 1.''' Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a measurable space. Consider a simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable non-negative function &lt;math&gt;s:\Omega\to{\mathbb R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt;. For a subset &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;\nu(S)=\int_Ss\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is a measure on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

======Proof======
Monotonicity follows from Remark 5. Here, we will only prove countable additivity, leaving the rest up to the reader. Let &lt;math&gt;S=\cup^\infty_{i=1}S_i&lt;/math&gt;, where all the sets &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint. Due to simplicity,
:&lt;math&gt;s=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;,
for some finite non-negative constants &lt;math&gt;c_i\in{\mathbb R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; and pairwise disjoint sets &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\cup^n_{i=1}A_i=\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. By definition of Lebesgue integral,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nu(S)&amp;=\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu(S\cap A_i)\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl((\cup^\infty_{j=1}S_j)\cap A_i\bigr)\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl(\cup^\infty_{j=1}(S_j\cap A_i)\bigr)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since all the sets &lt;math&gt;S_j\cap A_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint, the countable additivity of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;
gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl(\cup^\infty_{j=1}(S_j\cap A_i)\bigr)=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\sum^\infty_{j=1}\mu(S_j\cap A_i).
&lt;/math&gt;
Since all the summands are non-negative, the sum of the series, whether this sum is finite or infinite, cannot change if summation order does. For that reason,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\sum^\infty_{j=1}\mu(S_j\cap A_i)&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot
\mu(S_j\cap A_i)\\
&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\int_{S_j} s\,d\mu\\
&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\nu(S_j),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

====="Continuity from below"=====
The following property is a direct consequence of the definition of measure.

'''Lemma 2.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be a measure, and &lt;math&gt;S=
\cup^\infty_{i=1}S_i&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;
S_1\subseteq\ldots\subseteq S_i\subseteq S_{i+1}\subseteq\ldots\subseteq S
&lt;/math&gt;
is a non-decreasing chain with all its sets &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-measurable. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(S)=\lim_i\mu(S_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof of theorem====
'''Step 1.''' We begin by showing that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; (\Sigma, \operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}) &lt;/math&gt;–measurable.&lt;ref name="SCHECHTER1997"/&gt;{{rp|at=section 21.3}}

'''Note.''' If we were using Fatou's lemma, the measurability would follow easily from Remark 3(a).

To do this ''without'' using Fatou's lemma, it is sufficient to show that the inverse image of an interval &lt;math&gt;[0,t]&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the [[Sigma-algebra|sigma-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, because (closed) intervals generate the [[Borel sigma algebra]] on the reals. Since &lt;math&gt;[0,t]&lt;/math&gt; is a closed interval, and, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0\le f_k(x) \le f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;0\leq f(x)\leq t\quad \Leftrightarrow\quad \Bigl[\forall k\quad 0\leq f_k(x)\leq t\Bigr].&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in X \mid 0\leq f(x)\leq t\} = \bigcap_k \{x\in X \mid 0\leq f_k(x)\leq t\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Being the inverse image of a [[Borel set]] under a &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable function &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;, each set in the countable intersection is an element of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras are, by definition, closed under countable intersections, this shows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable, and the integral &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int_X f \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt; is well defined (and possibly infinite).

'''Step 2.''' We will first show that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int_X f \,d\mu \geq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

The definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and monotonicity of &lt;math&gt;\{f_k\}&lt;/math&gt; imply that &lt;math&gt;f(x)\geq f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. By monotonicity (or, more precisely, its narrower version established in Remark 5; see also Remark 4) of Lebesgue integral,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu\geq\int_X f_k\,d\mu,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu\geq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the limit on the right exists (finite or infinite) because, due to monotonicity (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), the sequence is non-decreasing.

'''End of Step 2.'''

We now prove the reverse inequality. We seek to show that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu \leq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof using Fatou's lemma.''' Per Remark 3, the inequality we want to prove is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \liminf_k f_k(x) \,d\mu \leq \liminf_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
But the latter follows immediately from Fatou's lemma, and the proof is complete.

'''Independent proof.''' To prove the inequality ''without'' using Fatou's lemma, we need some extra machinery. Denote &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt; the set of simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable functions &lt;math&gt;s:X\to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;0\leq s\leq f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Step 3.''' Given a simple function &lt;math&gt;s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt; and a real number &lt;math&gt;t\in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k=\{x\in X\mid t\cdot s(x)\leq f_k(x)\}\subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k\subseteq B^{s,t}_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X=\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Step 3a.''' To prove the first claim, let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle s=\sum^m_{i=1}c_i\cdot{\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;, for some finite collection of pairwise disjoint measurable sets &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X=\cup^m_{i=1}A_i&lt;/math&gt;, some (finite) non-negative constants &lt;math&gt;c_i\in {\mathbb R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt; denoting the indicator function of the set &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For every &lt;math&gt; x\in A_i, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;t\cdot s(x)\leq f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; holds if and only if &lt;math&gt; f_k(x) \in [t\cdot c_i, +\infty].&lt;/math&gt; Given that the sets &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint,

:&lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k=\bigcup^m_{i=1}\Bigl(f^{-1}_k\Bigl([t\cdot c_i,+\infty]\Bigr)\cap A_i\Bigr)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the pre-image &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}_k\Bigl([t\cdot c_i,+\infty]\Bigr)&lt;/math&gt; of the Borel set
&lt;math&gt;[t\cdot c_i,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt; under the measurable function &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; is measurable, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras, by definition, are closed under finite intersection and unions, the first claim follows.

'''Step 3b.''' To prove the second claim, note that, for each &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_k(x)\leq f_{k+1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 3c.''' To prove the third claim, we show that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X\subseteq\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, if, to the contrary, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X\not\subseteq\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;, then an element
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_0\in X\setminus\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k=\bigcap_k(X\setminus B^{s,t}_k)&lt;/math&gt;
exists such that &lt;math&gt;f_k(x_0)&lt;t\cdot s(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;k\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_0)\leq t\cdot s(x_0)&lt;s(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
But by initial assumption, &lt;math&gt;s\leq f&lt;/math&gt;. This is a contradiction.

'''Step 4.''' For every simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable non-negative function &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_n\int_{B^{s,t}_n}s_2\,d\mu=\int_Xs_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
To prove this, define &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\nu(S)=\int_S s_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;. By Lemma 1, &lt;math&gt;\nu(S)&lt;/math&gt; is a measure on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. By "continuity from below" (Lemma 2),
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_n\int_{B^{s,t}_n}s_2\,d\mu=\lim_n\nu(B^{s,t}_n)=\nu(X)=\int_Xs_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
as required.

'''Step 5.''' We now prove that, for every &lt;math&gt;s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, using the definition of &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;, the non-negativity of &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;, and the monotonicity of Lebesgue integral (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), we have
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{B^{s,t}_k}t\cdot s\,d\mu\leq\int_{B^{s,t}_k} f_k\,d\mu\leq\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
for every &lt;math&gt;k\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. In accordance with Step 4, as &lt;math&gt;k\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the inequality becomes
:&lt;math&gt;t\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;t\uparrow 1&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
as required.

'''Step 6.''' We are now able to prove the reverse inequality, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu \leq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, by non-negativity, &lt;math&gt;f_+ = f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_- = 0.&lt;/math&gt; For the calculation below, the non-negativity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is essential. Applying the definition of Lebesgue integral and the inequality established in Step 5, we have
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu=\sup_{s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)}\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
The proof is complete.

==General introduction==
Multimodal perception is a scientific term that describes how humans form coherent, valid, and robust perception by [[sensory processing|processing sensory]] stimuli from various modalities.  Surrounded by multiple objects and receiving multiple sensory stimulations, the brain is faced with the decision of how to categorize the stimuli resulting from different objects or events in the physical world.  The nervous system is thus responsible for whether to integrate or segregate certain groups of temporally coincident sensory signals based on the degree of spatial and structural congruence of those stimulations.  Multimodal perception has been widely studied in cognitive science, behavioral science, and neuroscience.

===Stimuli and sensory modalities===
There are four attributes of stimulus: modality, intensity, location, and duration. The [[neocortex]] in the mammalian brain has parcellations that primarily process sensory input from one modality. For example, primary visual area, V1, or primary [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]] area, S1. These areas mostly deal with low-level stimulus features such as brightness, orientation, intensity, etc. These areas have extensive connections to each other as well as to higher association areas that further process the stimuli and are believed to integrate sensory input from various modalities. However, recently multisensory effects have been shown to occur in primary sensory areas as well.&lt;ref name="Lemus 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemus L, Hernández A, Luna R, Zainos A, Romo R |title=Do sensory cortices process more than one sensory modality during perceptual judgments? |journal=Neuron |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=335–48 |date=July 2010 |pmid=20670839 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.06.015 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binding problem===
{{main|Binding problem}}
The relationship between the binding problem and multisensory perception can be thought of as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from unanswered questions about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent perception of their surroundings from the cacophony of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]], chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the [[visual system|visual domain]] (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory [[perception]].&lt;ref name="Zmigrod 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zmigrod | first1 = S. | last2 = Hommel | first2 = B. | title = Temporal dynamics of unimodal and multimodal feature binding. | journal = Atten Percept Psychophys | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 142–52 |date=Jan 2010 | doi = 10.3758/APP.72.1.142 | pmid = 20045885 |url = http://www.bernhard-hommel.eu/The%20temporal%20dynamics.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, considerations of how unified conscious representations are formed are not the full focus of multisensory Integration research. It is obviously important for the senses to interact in order to maximize how efficiently people interact with the environment. For perceptual experience and behavior to benefit from the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sensory modalities, integration of the information from these modalities is necessary. Some of the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon and its subsequent effects on cognitive and behavioural processes will be examined hereafter. Perception is often defined as one's conscious experience, and thereby combines inputs from all relevant senses and prior knowledge. Perception is also defined and studied in terms of feature extraction, which is several hundred milliseconds away from conscious experience. Notwithstanding the existence of [[Gestalt psychology]] schools that advocate a holistic approach to the operation of the brain,&lt;ref name="Wagemans 2012a"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Wagemans | first1 = J. | last2 = Elder | first2 = JH. | last3 = Kubovy | first3 = M. | last4 = Palmer | first4 = SE. | last5 = Peterson | first5 = MA. | last6 = Singh | first6 = M. | last7 = von der Heydt | first7 = R. | title = A century of Gestalt psychology in visual perception: I.

Nevertheless, burgeoning neuroscience research continues to enrich our understanding of the many details of the brain, including neural structures implicated in multisensory integration such as the [[superior colliculus|superior colliculus (SC)]]&lt;ref name="Stein 2011"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Stein | first1 = BE. | last2 = Rowland | first2 = BA. | title = Organization and plasticity in multisensory integration: early and late experience affects its governing principles. | journal = Prog Brain Res | volume = 191 | issue =  | pages = 145–63 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-53752-2.00007-2 | pmid = 21741550 | pmc = 3245961 | series = Progress in Brain Research | isbn = 9780444537522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and various cortical structures such as the [[superior temporal gyrus|superior temporal gyrus (GT)]] and visual and auditory association areas. Although the structure and function of the SC are well known, the cortex and the relationship between its constituent parts are presently the subject of much investigation. Concurrently, the recent impetus on integration has enabled investigation into perceptual phenomena such as the [[ventriloquism]] effect,&lt;ref name="Recanzone 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Recanzone | first1 = GH. | title = Interactions of auditory and visual stimuli in space and time. | journal = Hear Res | volume = 258 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 89–99 |date=Dec 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.heares.2009.04.009 | pmid = 19393306 | pmc = 2787663}}&lt;/ref&gt; rapid localization of stimuli and the [[McGurk effect]];&lt;ref name="Smith 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Smith| first1=E.| last2=Duede| first2=S.| last3=Hanrahan| first3=S.| last4=Davis| first4=T.| last5=House| first5=P.| last6=Greger| first6=B.| title= Seeing is believing: neural representations of visual stimuli in human auditory cortex correlate with illusory auditory perceptions.| journal=PLoS ONE| volume=8| issue=9 | pages=e73148| year=2013 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0073148 | pmid=24023823 | pmc=3762867}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in a more thorough understanding of the human brain and its functions.

===History===
Studies of sensory processing in humans and other animals has traditionally been performed one sense at a time,&lt;ref name="Fodor 1983"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fodor, Jerry A. |title=Modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1983 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-06084-4 |oclc=551957787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the present day, numerous academic societies and journals are largely restricted to considering sensory modalities separately ([[Vision science|'Vision Research']], [[Audiology|'Hearing Research']] etc.). 
However, there is also a long and parallel history of multisensory research. An example is the  [[George M. Stratton|Stratton's]] (1896) experiments on the somatosensory effects of wearing vision-distorting prism glasses.&lt;ref name="Stratton 1896"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stratton| first1=George M.| title=Some preliminary experiments on vision without inversion of the retinal image. |journal=Psychological Review| volume=3|issue=6| year=1896| pages=611–617 |doi=10.1037/h0072918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratton 1897"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stratton| first1=George M.| title=Vision without inversion of the retinal image. |journal=Psychological Review| volume=4| issue=4| year=1897| pages=341–360, 463–481 | doi = 10.1037/h0075482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multisensory interactions or [[crossmodal]] effects
in which the perception of a stimulus is influenced by
the presence of another type of stimulus are  referred since very
early in the past. They were reviewed by Hartmann&lt;ref name="Hartman1935"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hartmann| first1=G.M.| title=Gestalt Psychology | publisher = The Ronald Press | year = 1935 | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a fundamental book where, among several
references to different types of multisensory interactions,
reference is made to the work of Urbantschitsch in 1888&lt;ref name="Urbantschitsch1888"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Urbantschitsch| first1=V.| title=Über den Einfluss einer Sinneserregung auf die übrigen Sinnesempfindungen. |journal=Pflügers Archiv| volume=42| year=1888| pages=154–182| doi=10.1007/bf01669354}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reported on the improvement of visual acuity by auditive stimuli in subjects
with damaged brain. This effect was also found latter in normals by Krakov&lt;ref name="Kravkov1930"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kravkov| first1=S.V.| title=Über die Abhängigkeit der Sehschärfe vom Schallreiz. |journal=Arch.

Exp. Psychol.| volume=16| issue=3| year=1933| pages=393–407| doi=10.1037/h0074549}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the fact that the visual acuity could be improved  by
other type of stimuli.&lt;ref name="Hartmann1933" /&gt;  It is also noteworthy the amount
of work in the early thirties on intersensory relations in Soviet
Union, reviewed by London.&lt;ref name="London1954"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=London| first1=I.D.| title=Research of sensory interaction in the Soviet Union. |journal=Psychol.

In this syndrome,  all the sensory functions are affected, and with symmetric bilaterality, in spite of being a unilateral lesion where the primary areas were not involved. A feature of this syndrome is the great permeability to crossmodal effects between visual, tactile, auditive stimuli as well as muscular effort to improve the perception, also decreasing the reaction times. The improvement by crossmodal effect was found to be greater as
the primary stimulus to be perceived was weaker, and as the cortical lesion was greater (Vol I and II  of reference&lt;ref name=Dinamica /&gt;). This author interpreted these phenomena under a dynamic physiological concept, and from a model based on functional gradients through the cortex and scaling laws of dynamical systems, thus highlighting the functional unity of the cortex. According to the functional cortical gradients,  the specificity of the cortex would be distributed in gradation, and the overlap of different specific gradients would be related to multisensory interactions.&lt;ref name=Gradients&gt;[[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo, J.]] (1952).

Multisensory research has recently gained enormous interest and popularity.

===Example of spatial congruent and structural congruent===
When we hear a [[vehicle horn|car honk]], we would determine which car triggers the honk by which car we see is the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, the sound and the pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.

==Theories and approaches==

===Visual dominance===
Literature on spatial [[crossmodal]] biases suggests that visual modality often influences information from other senses.&lt;ref name="Witten 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Witten | first1 = IB. | last2 = Knudsen | first2 = EI. | title = Why seeing is believing: merging auditory and visual worlds. | journal = Neuron | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–96 |date=Nov 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.020 | pmid = 16269365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that vision dominates what we hear, when varying the degree of spatial congruency. This is known as the ventriloquist effect.&lt;ref name="Shams 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Shams | first1 = L. | last2 = Beierholm | first2 = UR. | title = Causal inference in perception. | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 425–32 |date=Sep 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.001 | pmid = 20705502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of visual and haptic integration, children younger than 8 years of age show visual dominance when required to identify object orientation. However, haptic dominance occurs when the factor to identify is object size.&lt;ref name="Gori 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gori | first1 = M. | last2 = Del Viva | first2 = M. | last3 = Sandini | first3 = G. | last4 = Burr | first4 = DC. | title = Young children do not integrate visual and haptic form information. | journal = Curr Biol | volume = 18 | issue = 9 | pages = 694–8 |date=May 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.036 | pmid = 18450446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gori 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gori | first1 = M. | last2 = Sandini | first2 = G. | last3 = Burr | first3 = D. | title = Development of visuo-auditory integration in space and time. | journal = Front Integr Neurosci | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 77 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3389/fnint.2012.00077 | pmid = 23060759 | pmc = 3443931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modality appropriateness===
According to Welch and Warren (1980), the Modality Appropriateness Hypothesis states that the influence of perception in each modality in multisensory integration depends on that modality's appropriateness for the given task. Thus, vision has a greater influence on integrated localization than hearing, and hearing and touch have a greater bearing on timing estimates than vision.&lt;ref name="Welch 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Welch RB, Warren DH |title=Immediate perceptual response to intersensory discrepancy |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=638–67 |date=November 1980 |pmid=7003641 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.88.3.638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederman and Klatzky 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lederman|first1=Susan J.|last2=Klatzky|first2=Roberta L.|editor1-last=Calvert|editor1-first=Gemma A.|editor2-last=Spence|editor2-first=Charles|editor3-last=Stein|editor3-first=Barry E.|title=The Handbook of Multisensory Processing|date=2004|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-03321-3|pages=107–122|chapter=Multisensory Texture Perception}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies refine this early qualitative account of multisensory integration. Alais and Burr (2004), found that following progressive degradation in the quality of a visual stimulus, participants' perception of spatial location was determined progressively more by a simultaneous auditory cue.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alais D, Burr D |title=The ventriloquist effect results from near-optimal bimodal integration |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=257–62 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14761661 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.01.029 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also progressively changed the temporal uncertainty of the auditory cue; eventually concluding that it is the uncertainty of individual modalities that determine to what extent information from each modality is considered when forming a percept.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"/&gt; This conclusion is similar in some respects to the 'inverse effectiveness rule'. The extent to which multisensory integration occurs may vary according to the ambiguity of the relevant stimuli. In support of this notion, a recent study shows that weak senses such as olfaction can even modulate the perception of visual information as long as the reliability of visual signals is adequately compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuang|first1=S.|last2=Zhang|first2=T.|title=Smelling directions: Olfaction modulates ambiguous visual motion perception|journal=Scientific Reports|date=2014|volume=4|pages=5796|doi=10.1038/srep05796|pmid=25052162|pmc=4107342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayesian integration===
The theory of Bayesian integration is based on the fact that the brain must deal with a number of inputs, which vary in reliability.&lt;ref name="Deneve 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deneve S, Pouget A |title=Bayesian multisensory integration and cross-modal spatial links |journal=J. Physiol. Paris |volume=98 |issue=1–3 |pages=249–58 |year=2004 |pmid=15477036 |doi=10.1016/j.jphysparis.2004.03.011 |url=http://www.gnt.ens.fr/reprints/deneve_jphysparis_2004.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.133.7694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with these inputs, it must construct a coherent representation of the world that corresponds to reality. The Bayesian integration view is that the brain uses a form of [[Bayesian inference]].&lt;ref name="Pouget 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pouget A, Deneve S, Duhamel JR |title=A computational perspective on the neural basis of multisensory spatial representations |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=741–7 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12209122 |doi=10.1038/nrn914 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been backed up by computational modeling of such a Bayesian inference from signals to coherent representation, which shows similar characteristics to integration in the brain.&lt;ref name="Pouget 2002"/&gt;

====Cue combination vs. causal inference models====
With the assumption of independence between various sources, traditional cue combination model is successful in modality integration. However, depending on the discrepancies between modalities, there might be different forms of stimuli fusion: integration, partial integration, and segregation. To fully understand the other two types, we have to use causal inference model without the assumption as cue combination model. This freedom gives us general combination of any numbers of signals and modalities by using Bayes' rule to make causal inference of sensory signals.&lt;ref name="Vilares 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Vilares | first1 = I. | last2 = Kording | first2 = K. | title = Bayesian models: the structure of the world, uncertainty, behavior, and the brain. | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1224 | issue =  | pages = 22–39 |date=Apr 2011 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.05965.x | pmid = 21486294 | pmc=3079291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical models====
The difference between two models is that hierarchical model can explicitly make causal inference to predict certain stimulus while non-hierarchical model can only predict joint probability of stimuli. However, hierarchical model is actually a special case of non-hierarchical model by setting joint prior as a weighted average of the prior to common and independent causes, each weighted by their prior probability. Based on the correspondence of these two models, we can also say that hierarchical is a mixture modal of non-hierarchical model.

====Independence of likelihoods and priors====
For [[Bayesian network|Bayesian model]], the prior and likelihood generally represent the statistics of the environment and the sensory representations. The independence of priors and likelihoods is not assured since the prior may vary with likelihood only by the representations. However, the independence has been proved by Shams with series of parameter control in multi sensory perception experiment.&lt;ref name="Beierholm 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Beierholm | first1 = UR. | last2 = Quartz | first2 = SR. | last3 = Shams | first3 = L. | title = Bayesian priors are encoded independently from likelihoods in human multisensory perception. | journal = J Vis | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 23.1–9 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1167/9.5.23 | pmid = 19757901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The contributions of Barry Stein, Alex Meredith, and their colleagues (e.g."The merging of the senses" 1993,&lt;ref name="Stein 1993"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stein, Barry |author2=Meredith, M. Alex |title=The merging of the senses |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-19331-3 |oclc=25869284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are widely considered to be the groundbreaking work in the modern field of multisensory integration. Through detailed long-term study of the neurophysiology of the superior colliculus, they distilled three general principles by which multisensory integration may best be described.

===Perceptual and behavioral consequences ===
A unimodal approach dominated scientific literature until the beginning of this century. Although this enabled rapid progression of neural mapping, and an improved understanding of neural structures, the investigation of perception remained relatively stagnant, with a few exceptions.  The recent revitalized enthusiasm into perceptual research is indicative of a substantial shift away from reductionism and toward gestalt methodologies. Gestalt theory, dominant in the late 19th and early 20th centuries espoused two general principles: the 'principle of totality' in which conscious experience must be considered globally, and the 'principle of psychophysical isomorphism' which states that perceptual phenomena are correlated with cerebral activity. Just these ideas were already applied by [[Justo Gonzalo]] in his work of brain dynamics, where a sensory-cerebral correspondence is considered in the formulation of the  "development of the sensory field due to a psychophysical isomorphism" (pag. 23 of the English translation of ref.&lt;ref name=Gradients /&gt;).  Both ideas 'principle of totality' and 'psychophysical isomorphism' are particularly relevant in the current climate and have driven researchers to investigate the behavioural benefits of multisensory integration.

===Decreasing sensory uncertainty===
It has been widely acknowledged that uncertainty in sensory domains results in an increased dependence of multisensory integration.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"/&gt; Hence, it follows that cues from multiple modalities that are both temporally and spatially synchronous are viewed neurally and perceptually as emanating from the same source. The degree of synchrony that is required for this 'binding' to occur is currently being investigated in a variety of approaches. It should be noted here that the integrative function only occurs to a point beyond which the subject can differentiate them as two opposing stimuli. Concurrently, a significant intermediate conclusion can be drawn from the research thus far. Multisensory stimuli that are bound into a single percept, are also bound on the same receptive fields of multisensory neurons in the SC and cortex.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"/&gt;

===Decreasing reaction time===
Responses to multiple simultaneous sensory stimuli can be faster than responses to the same stimuli presented in isolation. Hershenson (1962) presented a light and tone simultaneously and separately, and asked human participants to respond as rapidly as possible to them. As the asynchrony between the onsets of both stimuli was varied, it was observed that for certain degrees of asynchrony, reaction times were decreased.&lt;ref name="Hershenson 1962"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hershenson M |title=Reaction time as a measure of intersensory facilitation |journal=J Exp Psychol |volume=63 |issue= 3|pages=289–93 |date=March 1962 |pmid=13906889 |doi= 10.1037/h0039516|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These levels of asynchrony were quite small, perhaps reflecting the temporal window that exists in multisensory neurons of the SC. Further studies have analysed the reaction times of saccadic eye movements;&lt;ref name="Hughes 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hughes | first1 = HC. | last2 = Reuter-Lorenz | first2 = PA. | last3 = Nozawa | first3 = G. | last4 = Fendrich | first4 = R. | title = Visual-auditory interactions in sensorimotor processing: saccades versus manual responses. | journal = J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 131–53 |date=Feb 1994 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.20.1.131 | pmid = 8133219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently correlated these findings to neural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallace|first1=Mark T.|title=The development of multisensory processes|journal=Cognitive Processing|volume=5|issue=2|year=2004|pages=69–83|issn=1612-4782|doi=10.1007/s10339-004-0017-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In patients studied by  [[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo]],&lt;ref name=Dinamica /&gt;  with lesions in the parieto-occipital cortex, the decrease in the reaction time to a given stimulus by means of intersensory facilitation was shown to be very remarkable.

====Redundant target effects====
The redundant target effect is the observation that people typically respond faster to double targets (two targets presented simultaneously) than to either of the targets presented alone. This difference in latency is termed the redundancy gain (RG).&lt;ref name="Ridgway 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ridgway N, Milders M, Sahraie A |title=Redundant target effect and the processing of colour and luminance |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=187 |issue=1 |pages=153–60 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18264703 |doi=10.1007/s00221-008-1293-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by Forster, Cavina-Pratesi, Aglioti, and Berlucchi (2001), normal observers responded faster to simultaneous visual and
tactile stimuli than to single visual or tactile stimuli. RT to simultaneous visual and tactile stimuli was also faster than RT to simultaneous dual visual or tactile stimuli. The advantage for RT to combined visual-tactile stimuli over RT to the other types of stimulation could be accounted for by intersensory neural facilitation rather than by probability summation. These effects can be ascribed to the convergence of tactile and visual inputs onto neural centers which contain flexible multisensory representations of body parts.&lt;ref name="Forster 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster B, Cavina-Pratesi C, Aglioti SM, Berlucchi G |title=Redundant target effect and intersensory facilitation from visual-tactile interactions in simple reaction time |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=143 |issue=4 |pages=480–7 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11914794 |doi=10.1007/s00221-002-1017-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multisensory illusions===

====McGurk effect====
It has been found that two converging bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude than the sum of its parts, but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the [[McGurk effect]],&lt;ref name="McGurk 1976"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGurk H, MacDonald J |title=Hearing lips and seeing voices |journal=Nature |volume=264 |issue=5588 |pages=746–8 |year=1976 |pmid=1012311 |doi=10.1038/264746a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different phoneme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Nath| first1=AR.| last2=Beauchamp| first2=MS.| title=A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion.| journal=NeuroImage| volume=59| issue =1| pages=781–7|date=Jan 2012| doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024| pmid=21787869| pmc=3196040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.&lt;ref name="McGurk 1976"/&gt;

====Ventriloquism====
Ventriloquism has been used as the evidence for the modality appropriateness hypothesis. Ventriloquism describes the situation in which auditory location perception is shifted toward a visual cue. The original study describing this phenomenon was conducted by Howard and Templeton, (1966) after which several studies have replicated and built upon the conclusions they reached.&lt;ref name="Hairston 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hairston WD, Wallace MT, Vaughan JW, Stein BE, Norris JL, Schirillo JA |title=Visual localization ability influences cross-modal bias |journal=J Cogn Neurosci |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=20–9 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12590840 |doi=10.1162/089892903321107792 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conditions in which the visual cue is unambiguous, [[visual capture]] reliably occurs. Thus to test the influence of sound on perceived location, the visual stimulus must be progressively degraded.&lt;ref name="Alais 2004"/&gt; Furthermore, given that auditory stimuli are more attuned to temporal changes, recent studies have tested the ability of temporal characteristics to influence the spatial location of visual stimuli. Some types of EVP – [[electronic voice phenomenon]], mainly the ones using sound bubles are considered a kind of modern ventriloquism technique and is played by the use of sophisticated software, computers and sound equipment.

====Double-flash illusion====
The double flash illusion was reported as the first illusion to show that visual stimuli can be qualitatively altered by audio stimuli.&lt;ref name="Shams 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shams L, Kamitani Y, Shimojo S |title=Illusions. What you see is what you hear |journal=Nature |volume=408 |issue=6814 |pages=788 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11130706 |doi=10.1038/35048669 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the standard paradigm participants are presented combinations of one to four flashes accompanied by zero to 4 beeps. They were then asked to say how many flashes they perceived. Participants perceived illusory flashes when there were more beeps than flashes. fMRI studies have shown that there is crossmodal activation in early, low level visual areas, which was qualitatively similar to the perception of a real flash. This suggests that the illusion reflects subjective perception of the extra flash.&lt;ref name="Watkins 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watkins S, Shams L, Josephs O, Rees G |title=Activity in human V1 follows multisensory perception |journal=NeuroImage |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=572–8 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17604652 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.05.027 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, studies suggest that timing of multisensory activation in unisensory cortexes is too fast to be mediated by a higher order integration suggesting feed forward or lateral connections.&lt;ref name="Shams 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shams L, Iwaki S, Chawla A, Bhattacharya J |title=Early modulation of visual cortex by sound: an MEG study |journal=Neurosci.

====Rubber hand illusion====
In the rubber hand illusion (RHI),&lt;ref name="Botvinick 1998"/&gt; human participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while they feel a series of identical brushstrokes applied to their own hand, which is hidden from view. If this visual and tactile information is applied synchronously, and if the visual appearance and position of the dummy hand is similar to one's own hand, then people may feel that the touches on their own hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand.&lt;ref name="Botvinick 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Botvinick M, Cohen J |title=Rubber hands 'feel' touch that eyes see |journal=Nature |volume=391 |issue=6669 |pages=756 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9486643 |doi=10.1038/35784 |url=http://www.pni.princeton.edu/ncc/publications/1998/BotvinickCohen1998Nature.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an early form of [[body transfer illusion]]. The RHI is an illusion of vision, touch, and posture (proprioception), but a similar illusion can also be induced with touch and proprioception.&lt;ref name="Ehrsson 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ehrsson HH, Holmes NP, Passingham RE |title=Touching a rubber hand: feeling of body ownership is associated with activity in multisensory brain areas |journal=J.

====Body transfer illusion====
[[Body transfer illusion]] typically involves the use of virtual reality devices to induce the illusion in the subject that the body of another person or being is the subject's own body.

==Neural mechanisms==

===Subcortical areas===

====Superior colliculus====
[[File:Slide5ff.JPG|thumb|Superior colliculus]]
The [[superior colliculus]] (SC) or optic tectum (OT) is part of the tectum, located in the midbrain, superior to the brainstem and inferior to the thalamus. It contains seven layers of alternating white and grey matter, of which the superficial contain topographic maps of the visual field; and deeper layers contain overlapping spatial maps of the visual, auditory and somatosensory modalities.&lt;ref name="Affifi"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bergman, Ronald A. |author2=Afifi, Adel K. |title=Functional neuroanatomy: text and atlas |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=978-0-07-140812-7 |oclc=475017241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure receives afferents directly from the retina, as well as from various regions of the cortex (primarily the occipital lobe), the [[spinal cord]] and the inferior colliculus. It sends efferents to the spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus and occipital lobe via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The structure contains a high proportion of multisensory neurons and plays a role in the motor control of orientation behaviours of the eyes, ears and head.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"/&gt;

Receptive fields from somatosensory, visual and auditory modalities converge in the deeper layers to form a two-dimensional multisensory map of the external world. Here, objects straight ahead are represented caudally and objects on the periphery are represented rosterally. Similarly, locations in superior sensory space are represented medially, and inferior locations are represented laterally.&lt;ref name="Stein 1993"/&gt;

However, in contrast to simple convergence, the SC integrates information to create an output that differs from the sum of its inputs. Following a phenomenon labelled the 'spatial rule', neurons are excited if stimuli from multiple modalities fall on the same or adjacent receptive fields, but are inhibited if the stimuli fall on disparate fields.&lt;ref name="Giard 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giard MH, Peronnet F |title=Auditory-visual integration during multimodal object recognition in humans: a behavioral and electrophysiological study |journal=J Cogn Neurosci |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=473–90 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10511637 |doi= 10.1162/089892999563544|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excited neurons may then proceed to innervate various muscles and neural structures to orient an individual's behaviour and attention toward the stimulus. Neurons in the SC also adhere to the 'temporal rule', in which stimulation must occur within close temporal proximity to excite neurons. However, due to the varying processing time between modalities and the relatively slower speed of sound to light, it has been found the neurons may be optimally excited when stimulated some time apart.&lt;ref name="Miller 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller LM, D'Esposito M |title=Perceptual fusion and stimulus coincidence in the cross-modal integration of speech |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=25 |pages=5884–93 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15976077 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0896-05.2005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Putamen====
Single neurons in the macaque putamen have been shown to have visual and somatosensory responses closely related to those in the polysensory zone of the premotor cortex and area 7b in the parietal lobe.&lt;ref name="Graziano 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graziano MS, Gross CG |title=A bimodal map of space: somatosensory receptive fields in the macaque putamen with corresponding visual receptive fields |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=96–109 |year=1993 |pmid=8131835 |doi=10.1007/BF00228820 |url=http://neuroinformatics.usc.edu/mediawiki/images/3/39/Graziano_Gross_1993.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentile 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gentile | first1 = G. | last2 = Petkova | first2 = VI. | last3 = Ehrsson | first3 = HH. | title = Integration of visual and tactile signals from the hand in the human brain: an FMRI study. | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | pages = 910–22 |date=Feb 2011 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00840.2010 | pmid = 21148091 | pmc = 3059180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cortical areas===
Multisensory neurons exist in a large number of locations, often integrated with unimodal neurons. They have recently been discovered in areas previously thought to be modality specific, such as the somatosensory cortex; as well as in clusters at the borders between the major cerebral lobes, such as the occipito-parietal space and the occipito-temporal space.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace Ramachandran 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallace MT, Ramachandran R, Stein BE |title=A revised view of sensory cortical parcellation |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=7 |pages=2167–72 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14766982 |pmc=357070 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0305697101 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in order to undergo such physiological changes, there must exist continuous connectivity between these multisensory structures. It is generally agreed that information flow within the cortex follows a hierarchical configuration.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clavagnier S, Falchier A, Kennedy H |title=Long-distance feedback projections to area V1: implications for multisensory integration, spatial awareness, and visual consciousness |journal=Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=117–26 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15460918 |doi=10.3758/CABN.4.2.117 |url=http://www.seco-project.eu/dev/labo/files/publications/clavagnier%2004%20cabneuro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubel and Wiesel showed that receptive fields and thus the function of cortical structures, as one proceeds out from V1 along the visual pathways, become increasingly complex and specialized.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"/&gt; From this it was postulated that information flowed outwards in a feed forward fashion; the complex end products eventually binding to form a percept. However, via fMRI and intracranial recording technologies, it has been observed that the activation time of successive levels of the hierarchy does not correlate with a feed forward structure. That is, late activation has been observed in the striate cortex, markedly after activation of the prefrontal cortex in response to the same stimulus.&lt;ref name="Foxe 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foxe JJ, Simpson GV |title=Flow of activation from V1 to frontal cortex in humans. A framework for defining "early" visual processing |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=139–50 |date=January 2002 |pmid=11797091 |doi=10.1007/s00221-001-0906-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementing this, afferent nerve fibres have been found that project to early visual areas such as the lingual gyrus from late in the dorsal (action) and ventral (perception) visual streams, as well as from the auditory association cortex.&lt;ref name="Macaluso 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macaluso E, Frith CD, Driver J |title=Modulation of human visual cortex by crossmodal spatial attention |journal=Science |volume=289 |issue=5482 |pages=1206–8 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10947990 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5482.1206 |citeseerx=10.1.1.420.5403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback projections have also been observed in the opossum directly from the auditory association cortex to V1.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"/&gt; This last observation currently highlights a point of controversy within the neuroscientific community. Sadato ''et al.'' (2004) concluded, in line with Bernstein ''et al.'' (2002), that the primary auditory cortex (A1) was functionally distinct from the auditory association cortex, in that it was void of any interaction with the visual modality. They hence concluded that A1 would not at all be effected by [[cross modal plasticity]].&lt;ref name="Sadato 2004"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sadato N, Yamada H, Okada T, etal |title=Age-dependent plasticity in the superior temporal sulcus in deaf humans: a functional MRI study |journal=BMC Neurosci |volume=5 |issue= |pages=56 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15588277 |pmc=539237 |doi=10.1186/1471-2202-5-56 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein LE, Auer ET, Moore JK, Ponton CW, Don M, Singh M |title=Visual speech perception without primary auditory cortex activation |journal=NeuroReport |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=311–5 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11930129  |url=http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2002&amp;issue=03040&amp;article=00013&amp;type=abstract |doi=10.1097/00001756-200203040-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concurs with Jones and Powell's (1970) contention that primary sensory areas are connected only to other areas of the same modality.&lt;ref name="Jones 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones EG, Powell TP |title=An anatomical study of converging sensory pathways within the cerebral cortex of the monkey |journal=Brain |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=793–820 |year=1970 |pmid=4992433 |doi=10.1093/brain/93.4.793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the dorsal auditory pathway, projecting from the temporal lobe is largely concerned with processing spatial information, and contains receptive fields that are topographically organized. Fibers from this region project directly to neurons governing corresponding receptive fields in V1.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"/&gt; The perceptual consequences of this have not yet been empirically acknowledged. However, it can be hypothesized that these projections may be the precursors of increased acuity and emphasis of visual stimuli in relevant areas of perceptual space. Consequently, this finding rejects Jones and Powell's (1970) hypothesis&lt;ref name="Jones 1970"/&gt; and thus is in conflict with Sadato ''et al.'''s (2004) findings.&lt;ref name="Sadato 2004"/&gt; A resolution to this discrepancy includes the possibility that primary sensory areas can not be classified as a single group, and thus may be far more different from what was previously thought.

The multisensory syndrome with symmetric bilaterality, characterized
by [[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo]] and called by this author `central syndrome of the cortex',&lt;ref name=Dinamica /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gradients /&gt; was originated from a unilateral parieto-occipital cortical lesion equidistant from the visual, tactile, and auditory projection areas
(the middle of area 19, the anterior part of area 18 and the most posterior of area 39, in Brodmann terminology) that was called `central zone'. The gradation observed between syndromes led this author to propose a functional gradient scheme in which the specificity of the cortex is distributed with a continuous variation,&lt;ref name=Gradients /&gt; the overlap of the specific gradients would be high or maximum  in that ` central zone'.

Further research is necessary for a definitive resolution.

Rostral lateral suprasylvian sulcus (rLS) in cats&lt;ref name="Jiang 2001"/&gt;

===Cortical-subcortical interactions===
The most significant interaction between these two systems (corticotectal interactions) is the connection between the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES), which lies at the junction of the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes, and the SC. The AES is divided into three unimodal regions with multisensory neurons at the junctions between these sections.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiang W, Stein BE |title=Cortex controls multisensory depression in superior colliculus |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=2123–35 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14534263 |doi=10.1152/jn.00369.2003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jiang &amp; Stein, 2003). Neurons from the unimodal regions project to the deep layers of the SC and influence the multiplicative integration effect. That is, although they can receive inputs from all modalities as normal, the SC can not enhance or depress the effect of multisensory stimulation without input from the AES.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2003"/&gt;

Concurrently, the multisensory neurons of the AES, although also integrally connected to unimodal AES neurons, are not directly connected to the SC. This pattern of division is reflected in other areas of the cortex, resulting in the observation that cortical and tectal multisensory systems are somewhat dissociated.&lt;ref name="Wallace 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallace MT, Meredith MA, Stein BE |title=Converging influences from visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices onto output neurons of the superior colliculus |journal=J.

==Development of multisensory operations==

=== Theories of development ===

All species equipped with multiple sensory systems, utilize them in an integrative manner to achieve action and perception.&lt;ref name="Stein 1993"/&gt; However, in most species, especially higher mammals and humans, the ability to integrate develops in parallel with physical and cognitive maturity. Children until certain ages do not show mature integration patterns.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008" /&gt; Classically, two opposing views that are principally modern manifestations of the nativist/empiricist dichotomy have been put forth. The integration (empiricist) view states that at birth, sensory modalities are not at all connected. Hence, it is only through active exploration that plastic changes can occur in the nervous system to initiate holistic perceptions and actions. Conversely, the differentiation (nativist) perspective asserts that the young nervous system is highly interconnected; and that during development, modalities are gradually differentiated as relevant connections are rehearsed and the irrelevant are discarded.&lt;ref name="Lewkowicz 2004"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lewkowicz | first1 = D | last2 = Kraebel | first2 = K | title = The value of multisensory redundancy in the development of intersensory perception | editors = Gemma Calvert; Charles Spence; Barry E Stein | work = The Handbook of multisensory processes | publisher = MIT Press, cop.  | year = 2004 | location = Cambridge, Mass | pages = 655–78 | isbn = 9780262033213 | oclc = 803222288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the SC as a model, the nature of this dichotomy can be analysed. In the newborn cat, deep layers of the SC contain only neurons responding to the somatosensory modality. Within a week, auditory neurons begin to occur, but it is not until two weeks after birth that the first multisensory neurons appear. Further changes continue, with the arrival of visual neurons after three weeks, until the SC has achieved its fully mature structure after three to four months. Concurrently in species of monkey, newborns are endowed with a significant complement of multisensory cells; however, along with cats there is no integration effect apparent until much later.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"/&gt; This delay is thought to be the result of the relatively slower development of cortical structures including the AES; which as stated above, is essential for the existence of the integration effect.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2003"/&gt;

Furthermore, it was found by Wallace (2004) that cats raised in a light deprived environment had severely underdeveloped visual receptive fields in deep layers of the SC.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2004"/&gt; Although, receptive field size has been shown to decrease with maturity, the above finding suggests that integration in the SC is a function of experience. Nevertheless, the existence of visual multisensory neurons, despite a complete lack of visual experience, highlights the apparent relevance of nativist viewpoints. Multisensory development in the cortex has been studied to a lesser extent, however a similar study to that presented above was performed on cats whose optic nerves had been severed. These cats displayed a marked improvement in their ability to localize stimuli through audition; and consequently also showed increased neural connectivity between V1 and the auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Clavagnier 2004"/&gt;  Such plasticity in early childhood allows for greater adaptability, and thus more normal development in other areas for those with a sensory deficit.

In contrast, following the initial formative period, the SC does not appear to display any neural plasticity. Despite this, habituation and sensititisation over the long term is known to exist in orientation behaviors. This apparent plasticity in function has been attributed to the adaptability of the AES. That is, although neurons in the SC have a fixed magnitude of output per unit input, and essentially operate an all or nothing response, the level of neural firing can be more finely tuned by variations in input by the AES.

Although there is evidence for either perspective of the integration/differentiation dichotomy, a significant body of evidence also exists for a combination of factors from either view. Thus, analogous to the broader nativist/empiricist argument, it is apparent that rather than a dichotomy, there exists a continuum, such that the integration and differentiation hypotheses are extremes at either end.

=== Psychophysical development of integration ===
Not much is known about the development of the ability to integrate multiple estimates such as vision and touch.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010"/&gt; Some multisensory abilities are present from early infancy, but it is not until children are eight years or older before they use multiple modalities to reduce sensory uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010"/&gt;
 
One study demonstrated that cross-modal visual and auditory integration is present from within 1 year of life.&lt;ref name="Neil et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neil|first=PA|author2=Chee-Ruiter, C |author3=Scheier, C |author4=Lewkowicz, DJ |author5= Shimojo, S |title=Development of multisensory spatial integration and perception in humans.|journal=Developmental Science|date=Sep 2006|volume=9|issue=5|pages=454–64|pmid=16911447|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00512.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study measured response time for orientating towards a source. Infants who were 8–10 months old showed significantly decreased response times when the source was presented through both [[visual perception|visual]] and [[Hearing|auditory]] information compared to a single [[Stimulus modality|modality]]. Younger infants, however, showed no such change in response times to these different conditions. Indeed, the results of the study indicates that children potentially have the capacity to integrate sensory sources at any age. However, in certain cases, for example [[visual cues#visual cues|visual cues]], intermodal integration is avoided.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another study found that cross-modal integration of [[Haptic perception|touch]] and [[visual perception|vision]] for distinguishing size and [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]] is available from at least 8 years of age.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gori|first=M |author2=Del Viva, M |author3=Sandini, G |author4=Burr, DC |title=Young children do not integrate visual and haptic form information.|journal=Current Biology|date=May 6, 2008|volume=18|issue=9|pages=694–8|pmid=18450446|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For pre-integration age groups, one sense dominates depending on the characteristic discerned (see [[#Visual dominance|visual dominance]]).&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt;

A study investigating sensory integration ''within'' a single [[Stimulus modality|modality]] ([[Visual perception|vision]]) found that it cannot be established until age 12 and above.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nardini|first=M|author2=Bedford, R |author3=Mareschal, D |title=Fusion of visual cues is not mandatory in children.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Sep 28, 2010|volume=107|issue=39|pages=17041–6|pmid=20837526|doi=10.1073/pnas.1001699107|pmc=2947870}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular study assessed the integration of [[Binocular disparity|disparity]] and [[Texture gradient|texture]] cues to resolve surface slant. Though younger age groups showed a somewhat better performance when combining disparity and texture cues compared to using only disparity or texture cues, this difference was not statistically significant.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010"/&gt; In adults, the sensory integration can be mandatory, meaning that they no longer have access to the individual sensory sources.&lt;ref name="Hills et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillis|first=JM|author2=Ernst, MO |author3=Banks, MS |author4= Landy, MS |title=Combining sensory information: mandatory fusion within, but not between, senses.|journal=Science|date=Nov 22, 2002|volume=298|issue=5598|pages=1627–30|pmid=12446912|doi=10.1126/science.1075396|citeseerx=10.1.1.278.6134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging these variations, many hypotheses have been established to reflect why these observations are task-dependent. Given that different senses develop at different rates, it has been proposed that cross-modal integration does not appear until both [[Stimulus modality|modalities]] have reached maturity.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ernst|first=MO|title=Multisensory integration: a late bloomer.|journal=Current Biology|date=Jun 24, 2008|volume=18|issue=12|pages=R519–21|pmid=18579094|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human body undergoes significant physical transformation throughout childhood. Not only is there growth in size and [[human height|stature]] (affecting viewing height), but there is also change in inter-ocular distance and [[eyeball]] length. Therefore, sensory signals need to be constantly re-evaluated to appreciate these various physiological changes.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt; Some support comes from animal studies that explore the neurobiology behind integration. Adult monkeys have deep inter-neuronal connections within the [[superior colliculus]] providing strong, accelerated visuo-auditory integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stein|first=BE|author2=Meredith, MA |author3=Wallace, MT |title=The visually responsive neuron and beyond: multisensory integration in cat and monkey.|journal=Progress in Brain Research|year=1993|volume=95|pages=79–90|pmid=8493355|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(08)60359-3|isbn=9780444894922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young animals conversely, do not have this enhancement until unimodal properties are fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=BE|author2=Labos, E |author3=Kruger, L |title=Sequence of changes in properties of neurons of superior colliculus of the kitten during maturation.|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=Jul 1973|volume=36|issue=4|pages=667–79|pmid=4713313|doi=10.1152/jn.1973.36.4.667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=MT|author2=Stein, BE|title=Sensory and multisensory responses in the newborn monkey superior colliculus.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=Nov 15, 2001|volume=21|issue=22|pages=8886–94|pmid=11698600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, to rationalize sensory dominance, Gori et al. (2008) advocates that the brain utilises the most direct source of information during sensory immaturity.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt; In this case, [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]] is primarily a visual characteristic. It can be derived directly from the object image that forms on the [[retina]], irrespective of other visual factors. In fact, data shows that a functional property of [[neurons]] within [[primate]] [[visual cortex|visual cortices']] are their discernment to orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tootell|first=RB|author2=Hadjikhani, NK |author3=Vanduffel, W |author4=Liu, AK |author5=Mendola, JD |author6=Sereno, MI |author7= Dale, AM |title=Functional analysis of primary visual cortex (V1) in humans.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Feb 3, 1998|volume=95|issue=3|pages=811–7|pmid=9448245|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.811 |pmc=33802}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[haptic perception|haptic]] orientation judgements are recovered through collaborated patterned stimulations, evidently an indirect source susceptible to interference. Likewise, when size is concerned [[haptic perception|haptic]] information coming from positions of the fingers is more immediate. Visual-size perceptions, alternatively, have to be computed using parameters such as [[angle|slant]] and [[distance]]. Considering this, sensory dominance is a useful instinct to assist with calibration. During sensory immaturity, the more simple and robust information source could be used to tweak the accuracy of the alternate source.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt; Follow-up work by Gori et al. (2012) showed that, at all ages, vision-size perceptions are near perfect when viewing objects within the [[haptic perception|haptic]] workspace (i.e. at arm's reach).&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gori|first=M|author2=Giuliana, L |author3=Sandini, G |author4= Burr, D |title=Visual size perception and haptic calibration during development.|journal=Developmental Science|date=Nov 2012|volume=15|issue=6|pages=854–62|pmid=23106739|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.2012.01183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, systematic errors in perception appeared when the object was positioned beyond this zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granrud|first=CE|author2=Schmechel, TT|title=Development of size constancy in children: a test of the proximal mode sensitivity hypothesis.|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=Nov 2006|volume=68|issue=8|pages=1372–81|pmid=17378423|doi=10.3758/bf03193736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children younger than 14 years tend to underestimate object size, whereas adults overestimated. However, if the object was returned to the haptic workspace, those visual biases disappeared.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2012"/&gt; These results support the hypothesis that haptic information may educate visual perceptions. If sources are used for cross-calibration they cannot, therefore, be combined (integrated). Maintaining access to individual estimates is a trade-off for extra [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]] over accuracy, which could be beneficial in retrospect to the developing body.&lt;ref name="Gori et al. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst 2008"/&gt;
 
Alternatively, Ernst (2008) advocates that efficient integration initially relies upon establishing correspondence – which sensory signals belong together.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2008"/&gt; Indeed, studies have shown that visuo-haptic integration fails in adults when there is a perceived [[space|spatial]] separation, suggesting sensory information is coming from different targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gepshtein|first=S|author2=Burge, J |author3=Ernst, MO |author4= Banks, MS |title=The combination of vision and touch depends on spatial proximity.|journal=Journal of Vision|date=Dec 28, 2005|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1013–23|pmid=16441199 |doi=10.1167/5.11.7 |pmc=2632311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, if the separation can be explained, for example viewing an object through a [[mirror]], integration is re-established and can even be optimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helbig|first=HB|author2=Ernst, MO|title=Optimal integration of shape information from vision and touch.|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=Jun 2007|volume=179|issue=4|pages=595–606|pmid=17225091|doi=10.1007/s00221-006-0814-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helbig|first=HB|author2=Ernst, MO|title=Knowledge about a common source can promote visual- haptic integration.|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=36|issue=10|pages=1523–33|pmid=18265835|doi=10.1068/p5851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst (2008) suggests that adults can obtain this knowledge from previous experiences to quickly determine which sensory sources depict the same target, but young children could be deficient in this area.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2008"/&gt; Once there is a sufficient bank of experiences, confidence to correctly integrate sensory signals can then be introduced in their behaviour.

Lastly, Nardini et al. (2010) recently hypothesised that young children have optimized their sensory appreciation for speed over accuracy.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt; When information is presented in two forms, children may derive an estimate from the fastest available source, subsequently ignoring the alternate, even if it contains redundant information. Nardini et al. (2010) provides evidence that children's (aged 6 years) response latencies are significantly lower when stimuli are presented in multi-cue over single-cue conditions.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt; Conversely, adults showed no change between these conditions. Indeed, adults display mandatory fusion of signals, therefore they can only ever aim for maximum accuracy.&lt;ref name="Nardini et al. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hills et al. 2002" /&gt; However, the overall mean latencies for children were not faster than adults, which suggests that speed optimization merely enable them to keep up with the mature pace. Considering the haste of real-world events, this strategy may prove necessary to counteract the general slower processing of children and maintain effective vision-action coupling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kail|first=RV|author2=Ferrer, E|title=Processing speed in childhood and adolescence: longitudinal models for examining developmental change.|journal=Child Development|date=Nov–Dec 2007|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1760–70|pmid=17988319|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kail|first=R|title=Developmental change in speed of processing during childhood and adolescence.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=May 1991|volume=109|issue=3|pages=490–501|pmid=2062981|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.109.3.490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ballard|first=DH|author2=Hayhoe, MM |author3=Pook, PK |author4= Rao, RP |title=Deictic codes for the embodiment of cognition.|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=Dec 1997|volume=20|issue=4|pages=723–42; discussion 743–67|pmid=10097009|doi=10.1017/s0140525x97001611|citeseerx=10.1.1.49.3813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the developing sensory system may preferentially adapt for different goals – ''speed and detecting sensory conflicts'' – those typical of objective learning.

The late development of efficient integration has also been investigated from computational point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reward Maximization Justifies the Transition from Sensory Selection at Childhood to Sensory Integration at Adulthood|journal = PLoS ONE|pmc = 4110011|pmid = 25058591|volume = 9|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0103143|first = Pedram|last = Daee|first2 = Maryam S.|last2 = Mirian|first3 = Majid Nili|last3 = Ahmadabadi|pages=e103143|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daee et al. (2014) showed that having one dominant sensory source at early age, rather than integrating all sources, facilitates the overall development of cross-modal integrations.

==== Prosthesis ====

Prosthetics designers should carefully consider the nature of dimensionality alteration of sensorimotor signaling from and to the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] when designing prothesitic devices. As reported in literatures, neural signaling from the CNS to the motors is organized in a way that the dimensionalities of the signals are gradually increased as you approach the muscles, also called muscle synergies. In the same principal, but in opposite ordering, on the other hand, signals dimensionalities from the sensory receptors are gradually integrated, also called sensory synergies, as they approaches the CNS. This bow tie like signaling formation enables the CNS to process abstract yet valuable information only. Such as process will decrease complexity of the data, handle the noises and guarantee to the CNS the optimum energy consumption. 
Although the current commercially available prosthetic devices mainly focusing in implementing the motor side by simply uses EMG sensors to switch between different activation states of the prosthesis. Very limited works have proposed a system to involve by integrating the sensory side. The integration of tactile sense and proprioception is regarded as essential for implementing the ability to perceive environmental input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rincon-Gonzalez L, WarrenJ P | year = 2011 | title = Haptic interaction of touch and proprioception: implications for neuroprosthetics | url = | journal = IEEE Trans.

{{Nihongo|'''Net café refugees'''|ネットカフェ難民|''netto kafe nanmin''}}, also known as {{Nihongo|'''cyber-homeless'''|サイバーホームレス|''saibā hōmuresu''}}, are a class of [[homeless]] people in [[Japan]] who do not own or rent a residence (thus having no [[Japanese addressing system|permanent address]]) and sleep in 24-hour [[Internet café]]s or [[manga café]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/28/japan.socialexclusion|title=Tokyo dreaming|publisher=Guardian|language=English|author=Justin McCurry|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such cafés originally provided only Internet services, some have expanded their services to include food, drink, and showers.  They are often used by commuters who miss the last train; however, the net café refugee trend has seen large numbers of people use them as their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]]. [http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/eyeonasia/archives/2007/08/japans_net_refu.html Japan's Net Café Refugees]. August 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
A [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] study estimated that over 5,400 people are spending at least half of their week staying in net cafés.&lt;ref&gt;Water Week. [http://waterweek.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/new-japanese-underclass-net-cafe-refugees-emerges-homeless-and-low-paid-living-in-cubicles-and-net-lounges/ New Japanese underclass, “net cafe refugees”, emerges: homeless and low-paid, living in cubicles, and net lounges]. 17 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that this phenomenon is part of an increasing [[wealth gap]] in Japan, which has historically boasted of having a very [[economic inequality|economically equal]] society.&lt;ref name=motherboard&gt;{{cite news |last1=Paul |first1=Kari |title=The Japanese Workers Who Live in Internet Cafes |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mgbkdy/the-japanese-workers-who-live-in-internet-cafes |work=Motherboard |date=18 March 2015 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coin-Locker Japan 1.jpg|thumb|right|A coin locker in Japan, costing 100 yen per day]]

==Economics==
According to the Japanese government survey, those staying have little interest in manga or the Internet, and are instead using the place because of the low price relative to any of the competition for temporary housing, [[business hotel]]s, [[capsule hotel]]s, [[hostel]]s, or any other option besides sleeping on the street.  It was also estimated that about half of those staying have no job, while the other half work in low-paid temporary jobs, which paid around 100,000 [[Japanese yen|yen]] ($1000) per month – lower than what is needed to rent an apartment and pay for transportation in a city like [[Tokyo]].

==Facilities==
Some internet cafés offer free showers and sell underwear and other personal items, enabling net café refugees to use the internet cafés like a hotel or hostel.&lt;ref name=motherboard/&gt;

==Cyber-homeless==
Another word for Net café refugees is ''cyber-homeless'', a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word [[List of gairaigo and wasei-eigo terms|based on English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/world_news_america/7951800.stm Japan's recession] [[BBC News]], [[Tokyo]] 18 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the cyber-homeless are [[unemployed]] or [[underemployment|underemployed]] and cannot afford to rent even the cheapest apartment, which is more than the cost per month to rent an internet booth daily. The cyber-homeless may even use the address of the internet café on [[resume]]s when applying for jobs to conceal their present form of accommodation.

The fee of around ¥1400 to ¥2400 [[Japanese yen|yen]] for a night – which may include free soft drinks, TV, [[manga|comics]] and internet access – is less than for [[capsule hotel]]s. Some cyber-homeless may also be [[freeter]]s.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_1106434"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425822/1106434 |title=Cyber cafes a homeless haven |date=7 May 2007 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Japan==

Internet cafés in [[Dublin]], Ireland are also known to allow homeless people to sleep in chairs or on desks overnight, typically charging [[€]]6–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1121/661637-homelessness-dublin/|title=21% rise in numbers sleeping rough in Dublin|date=21 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lennyantonelli.ie/lenny-antonelli-1/dot-com-boom|title=Dot com boom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/internet-cafes-prove-an-unlikely-refuge-for-city-s-homeless-1.6235|title=Internet cafes prove an unlikely refuge for city's homeless|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/internet-caf-exploiting-homeless-by-charging-10-a-night-to-sleep-on-chairs-and-floors-35470069.html|title=Internet café 'exploiting' homeless by charging €10 a night to sleep on chairs and floors – Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">'''Nielsen theory''' is a branch of mathematical research with its origins in [[topological]] [[fixed point theory]]. Its central ideas were developed by Danish mathematician [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]], and bear his name.

The theory developed in the study of the so-called ''minimal number'' of a [[map (mathematics)|map]] ''f'' from a [[compact (topology)|compact]] space to itself, denoted ''MF''[''f'']. This is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MF}[f] = \min \{ \# \mathrm{Fix}(g) \, | \, g \sim f \},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''~'' indicates [[homotopy]] of mappings, and #Fix(''g'') indicates the number of fixed points of ''g''. The minimal number was very difficult to compute in Nielsen's time, and remains so today. Nielsen's approach is to group the fixed point set into classes, which are judged "essential" or "nonessential" according to whether or not they can be "removed" by a homotopy.

Nielsen's original formulation is equivalent to the following:
We define an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of fixed points of a self-map ''f'' on a space ''X''. We say that ''x'' is equivalent to ''y'' if and only if there exists a [[path (topology)|path]] ''c'' from ''x'' to ''y'' with ''f''(''c'') homotopic to ''c'' as paths. The equivalence classes with respect to this relation are called the '''Nielsen classes''' of ''f'', and the '''Nielsen number''' ''N''(''f'') is defined as the number of Nielsen classes having non-zero [[fixed point index]] sum.

Nielsen proved that
:&lt;math&gt;N(f) \le \mathit{MF}[f],&lt;/math&gt;
making his invariant a good tool for estimating the much more difficult ''MF''[''f'']. This leads immediately to what is now known as the '''Nielsen fixed point theorem:''' ''Any map f has at least N(f) fixed points.''

Because of its definition in terms of the [[fixed point index]], the Nielsen number is closely related to the [[Lefschetz number]]. Indeed, shortly after Nielsen's initial work, the two invariants were combined into a single "generalized Lefschetz number" (more recently called the [[Reidemeister trace]]) by [[Wecken]] and [[Reidemeister]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3989">'''Norton's dome''' is a [[thought experiment]] that exhibits a [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] system within the bounds of [[Newtonian mechanics]]. It was devised by John D. Norton and first discussed in his 2003 paper "Causation as Folk Science".&lt;ref name="orginalpaper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=John D.|title=Causation as Folk Science|journal=Philosopher's Imprint|date=November 2003 |volume=3|issue=4|hdl=2027/spo.3521354.0003.004|pages=1–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11229-012-0105-z | title=On Norton’s dome | journal=Synthese | date=2013 | volume=190 | issue=14 | pages=2925–2941 | first=Jon Pérez | last=Laraudogoitia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton's dome problem can be regarded as a problem in physics, mathematics, or philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Theory of Causation in the Social and Biological Sciences|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2013|isbn=9781137281043|page=109|last1=Reutlinger|first1=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Mark |date=2009 |title=Determinism and the Mystery of the Missing Physics |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=173–193 |doi=10.1093/bjps/axn052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=Samuel Craig|date=2011|title=What counts as a Newtonian system? The view from Norton’s dome|journal=European Journal for Philosophy of Science|volume=2|issue=3|pages=275–297|doi=10.1007/s13194-011-0040-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It poses interesting philosophical questions about the concepts of [[causality]], [[determinism]], and [[probability theory]].

The model consists of an idealized particle initially sitting motionless at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] of an idealized radially symmetrical frictionless dome described by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;h = {\frac {2}{3g}}r^{\frac 3 2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''h'' is the vertical displacement from the top of the dome to a point on the dome, ''r'' is the [[geodesic]] distance from the dome's apex to that point (in other words, a radial coordinate ''r'' is "inscribed" on the surface),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/Goodies/Dome/ John Norton's webpage for the Norton dome problem]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''g'' the acceleration due to gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''Causal Determinism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton shows that there are two classes of mathematical solutions to the system under Newtonian physics. In the first, the particle stays sitting at the apex of the dome forever. In the second, the particle sits at the apex of the dome for a while, and then after an arbitrary period of time starts to slide down the dome in an arbitrary direction. The apparent paradox in this second case is that this would seem to occur for no discernible reason, and without any radial force being exerted on it by any other entity, apparently contrary to both physical intuition and normal intuitive concepts of [[causality|cause and effect]], yet the motion is still entirely consistent with the mathematics of [[Newton's laws of motion]].

While many criticisms have been made of Norton's thought experiment, such as it being a violation of the principle of [[Lipschitz continuity]] (the 2nd solution type, where the ball starts rolling after an arbitrary period of time, is not Lipschitz continuous), or in violation of the principles of [[symmetry (physics)|physical symmetry]]{{cn|date=February 2018}}, or that it is somehow in some other way "unphysical"{{cn|date=February 2018}}, there is no consensus among its critics as to why they regard it as invalid.

'''Occasionalism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory about [[Causality|causation]] which says that created substances cannot be [[efficient cause]]s of events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by [[God]]. (A related theory, which has been called "occasional causation", also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events, but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, 'The Occasionalism of Louis de la Forge', in Nadler (ed.), ''Causation in Early Modern Philosophy'' (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993), 57–73;  Nadler, 'Descartes and Occasional Causation', ''British Journal for the History of Philosophy'', 2 (1994) 35–54.&lt;/ref&gt;) The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of God's causing of one event after another. However, there is no necessary connection between the two: it is not that the first event ''causes'' God to cause the second event: rather, God first causes one and then causes the other.

== Islamic theological schools ==
The doctrine first reached prominence in the [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] schools of [[Iraq]], especially in [[Basra]]. The ninth century theologian [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] argued that there is no [[Secondary Causation]] in the created order.  The world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation. As such the world is in a constant state of recreation by God.

The most famous proponent of the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] occasionalist doctrine was [[Al-Ghazali|Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali]], an 11th-century theologian based in [[Baghdad]]. In ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frank | last = Griffel | title = Al-Ghazali's Philosophical Theology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}} Al-Ghazali launched a philosophical critique against [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]]-influenced [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Islamic philosophers]] such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]. In response to the philosophers' claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes (God being, as it were, the Primary and Final Cause in an [[ontological]] and logical sense), Ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind of constant and continual regularity. There is no independent necessitation of change and becoming, other than what God has ordained. To posit an independent causality outside of God's knowledge and action is to deprive Him of true agency, and diminish his attribute of power. In his famous example, when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire, but through God's direct intervention, a claim which he defended [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|using logic]]. In the 12th century, this theory was defended and further strengthened by the Islamic theologian [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], using his expertise in the [[Science in medieval Islam|natural sciences]] of [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], [[Islamic cosmology|cosmology]] and [[Physics in medieval Islam|physics]].

Because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the [[physical law|laws of nature]]. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) — in other words, his rational will. This is not, however, an essential element of an occasionalist account, and occasionalism can include positions where God's behaviour (and thus that of the world) is viewed as ultimately inscrutable, thus maintaining God's essential transcendence. On this understanding, apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such: they are simply God behaving in a way that ''appears'' unusual ''to us''. Given his transcendent freedom, he is not bound even by his own nature. Miracles, as breaks in the rational structure of the universe, can occur, since God's relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles.

In 1993, Karen Harding's paper "Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory" described several "remarkable" similarities between Ghazali's concept of occasionalism and the (disputed) [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. She stated: "In both cases, and contrary to common sense, objects are viewed as having no inherent properties and no independent existence. In order for an object to exist, it must be brought into being either by God (al Ghazili) or by an observer (the Copenhagen Interpretation)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harding | first = Karen | title = Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory | date = Summer 1993 | journal = The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences | url = http://www.ghazali.org/articles/harding-V10N2-Summer-93.pdf | volume = 10 | number = 2 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1978 article in ''[[Studia Islamica]]'', Lenn Goodman asks the question, "Did Al-Ghazâlî Deny Causality?"&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Lenn Evan. “Did Al-Ghazâlî Deny Causality?” Studia Islamica, no. 47, 1978, pp. 83–120. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1595550.&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrates that Ghazali did not deny the existence of observed, "worldly" causation. According to Goodman's analysis, Ghazali does not claim that there is never any link between observed cause and observed effect: rather, Ghazali argues that there is no ''necessary'' link between observed cause and effect.

== Dualism ==
One of the motivations for the theory is the [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their [[essence]]s that one cannot affect the other. Thus, a person's mind cannot be the true cause of his hand's moving, nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish. In other words, the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa. Also, occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either, for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects. The will of God is taken to be necessary.

The doctrine is, however, more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] school. There are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in [[René Descartes|Descartes's]] own writings, but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 299–305.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position. In one form or another, the doctrine can be found in the writings of: [[Johannes Clauberg]], [[Claude Clerselier]], [[Gerauld de Cordemoy]], [[Arnold Geulincx]], [[Louis de La Forge]], [[François Lamy (theologian)|François Lamy]], and (most notably), [[Nicolas Malebranche]].

== Hume's arguments, Berkeley and Leibniz ==
These occasionalists' negative argument, that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events, was anticipated by certain arguments of [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] in the fourteenth century, and were later taken up by [[David Hume]] in the eighteenth. Hume, however, stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory, where God was called upon to replace such connections, complaining that "We are got into fairy land [...] Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding'', sect. 7, pt. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself. [[George Berkeley]] was also inspired by the occasionalists, and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies. For Berkeley, bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds, and all such ideas were, as he put it, "visibly inactive".&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''A Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', sect. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances, but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all. On the contrary, every simple substance had the power to produce changes in ''itself''. The illusion of transeunt efficient causation, for Leibniz, arose out of the [[pre-established harmony]] between the alterations produced immanently within different substances.

'''Open-source appropriate technology''' ('''OSAT''') is [[appropriate technology]] developed through the principles of the [[open-design movement]]. OSAT refers to, on the one hand, technology designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economic aspects of the community it is intended for. On the other hand, OSAT is developed in the open and licensed in such a way as to allow their designs to be used, modified and distributed freely.&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. (2014). Free and open source appropriate technology. in ''The Routledge Companion to Alternative Organization'', 308. {{ISBN|9780415782265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Open source is a development method for [[appropriate technology]] that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. [[appropedia:|Appropedia]] is an example of open-source appropriate technology. There anyone can both learn how to make and use AT free of concerns about patents. At the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive [[applied sustainability]] is enormous.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt; The built in continuous [[peer-review]] can result in better quality, higher reliability, and more flexibility than conventional design/patenting of technologies. The free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs, particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture. Finally, OSAT also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in. This is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the [[developing world]].

The "open-source" model can act as a driver of [[sustainable development]]. Reasons include:

* It enables localization for communities that do not have the resources to tempt commercial developers to provide local versions of their products. It thus minimizes the need to ship materials over long distances and organizes material activities accordingly;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"&gt;Kostakis, Vasilis. Roos, Andreas. [https://hbr.org/2018/06/new-technologies-wont-reduce-scarcity-but-heres-something-that-might New Technologies Won’t Reduce Scarcity, but Here’s Something That Might]. ''Harvard Business Review'', 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local manufacturing also makes maintenance easier and also encourages manufacturers to design products to last as long as possible;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;
* It can be free as in "gratis" as well as free as in "libre", an important consideration for developing communities.&lt;ref&gt;

Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/9013667/Innovation_Through_Collaboration_Scaling_up_Technological_Solutions_for_Sustainable_Development Innovation Through Collaboration: Scaling up Technological Solutions for Sustainable Development], ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'' 16(6): 1299-1316 (2014). {{doi|10.1007/s10668-014-9528-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the lateral scaling concepts of [[Jeremy Rifkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy. The zero marginal cost society: The internet of things, the collaborative commons, and the eclipse of capitalism. Macmillan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1137278463}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus optimizes the sharing of knowledge and design as there are no patent costs to pay for.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==

For solutions, many researchers, companies, and academics do work on products meant to assist [[sustainable development]]. [[Vinay Gupta]] has suggested that those developers agree to three principles:&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

# I will not permit any human being to be deprived of life-giving technology by the profit motive.
# Any works that I patent I will make available to others who are engaged in humanitarian activity for free, except where this would breach other contractual responsibilities.
# I will not use patent law to slow the pace of innovation or service delivery to the needy under any circumstances.

The ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, P. (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133/1/Phillipa_Shea_Thesis.pdf Community arts and appropriate internet technology: participation, materiality, and the ethics of sustainability in the digitally networked era].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, C. M. (2014). [http://www.ejisdc.org/Ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/viewFile/1233/510 Exploring information ethics for inclusive open development]. The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support in the literature ==

* It has been investigated how open sharing of designs, specifications, and technical information can enhance effectiveness, widespread use, and innovation of appropriate technology.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt;
* OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Zelenika" /&gt;
* OSAT has been claimed to assist in development of medical technology particularly for the developing world.&lt;ref name="Kapczynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sali" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, S.R. and Barry, M., 2011. Health technologies and innovation in the global health arena. New England Journal of Medicine, 365(9), pp.779-782.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been claimed that the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt; In addition, it is claimed that this sharing will require the appropriate-technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt;
* OSAT can be used to generate [[renewable energy]]&lt;ref&gt;Louie H. Experiences in the construction of open source low technology off-grid wind turbines. In2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011 Jul 24 (pp. 1-7). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In education ==

* At the university level, the use of open-source-appropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging  the connection between physics and social benefit:&lt;ref name="Pearce-2" /&gt;  This approach has the potential to use university students' access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology. Similarly OSAT has been used as a tool for improving [[service learning]].&lt;ref name="Pearce-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saleh" /&gt; [[MIT]] has completed a study looking at the usefulness of using [[appropriate technology]] education and its relation to OSAT.&lt;ref name="Grue" /&gt;
* It has been proposed that the evolution of the open-source [[3D printer]]s can enable a new method of development for OSAT&lt;ref name="Villumsen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Zovko" /&gt;

==Open source scientific equipment==
* [[Open source hardware]] for science can also be considered OSAT. Hundreds of scientific tools have already been developed and shared. Recently (2014) [[Open Source Lab (book)|open source labs]] have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, [[Open Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs]], Elsevier, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Appropriate technology is designed to promote [[Decentralization|decentralized]], [[labor-intensive]], [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] and [[environmentally sound]] businesses.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll Pursell says that the movement declined from 1965 to 1985, due to an inability to counter advocates of agribusiness, large private utilities, and multinational construction companies.&lt;ref name="Pursell" /&gt; Recently (2011), several barriers to OSAT deployment have been identified:&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Pearce" /&gt;
* AT seen as inferior or "poor person's" technology
* Technical transferability and robustness of AT
* Insufficient funding
* Weak institutional support
* The challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty.

'''Osram ne nsoromma''' is one of the [[Asante dialect|Asante]] [[Adinkra symbols]], which is interpreted to mean "Osram" [[Moon]] "Ne" and "Nsoromma" [[Star]]. This symbol signifies love, bonding and faithfulness in marriage. The symbol is represented by a half moon with a star slightly hanging within the [[circumference]] of the moon. Adinkra are symbols that carry a message or a concept. They are very much used by the Ashantis of the [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti kingdom]] and the [[Baoulé people|Baoulés]] of [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]]. Osram ne nsoromma symbols are incorporated into walls and other architectural features and quite recently has become common with tattoo designers. The most common ways through which the Adinkra messages are carried out or conveyed is having them printed extensively in fabrics and used in pottery. Adinkra is an [[Akan people|Akan]] name which means farewell or goodbye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adinkra.org/htmls/adinkra/osra.htm|title=Adinkra Symbols of West Africa: Osram Ne Nsoromma|website=www.adinkra.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ghanaculturepolitics.com/history-and-origin-of-adinkra-symbols/|title=History and Origin of Adinkra Symbols|date=25 April 2015|work=GhanaCulturePolitics|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adinkrasymbols.org/osram-ne-nsoromma/|title=Osram ne Nsoromma Adinkra Symbol, Meaning, Pronunciation, Discussion|work=Adinkra Symbols|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://obrunithroughghana.blogspot.com/2010/09/akan-symbols.html|title=Adventures in Ghana: Akan Symbols|last=Adventure|first=Rachel|date=16 September 2010|website=Adventures in Ghana|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ghanaculturepolitics.com/history-and-origin-of-adinkra-symbols/|title=History and Origin of Adinkra Symbols|date=25 April 2015|work=GhanaCulturePolitics|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentsanddesigns.com/resources/symbols-meanings-religion-ethnic-culture/adinkra-symbols/|title=Adinkra Symbols of West Africa – Documents and Designs|website=www.documentsanddesigns.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osram ne nsoromma are two different powerful objects of creation put together (Moon and Star). Both co exist in the [[sky]] to produce magnificent light or brightness at night. There are some wise sayings closely related to the Osram ne nsoromma symbol,often linked with [[proverb]]s

== Related proverbs ==
The [[Akan people|Akans]] of [[Ghana]] use an Adinkra symbol to express proverbs and other philosophical ideas or traditional [[wisdom]], aspects of life or the environment.

Some of the familiar proverbs are:

''Awaree nye nsafufuo na waka ahwe'', which means marriage is not [[Palm wine|palm-wine]] that you can decide to have a taste before you get served. It can also be interpreted to mean marriage is not a venture,committee or an organization that you can be a member today and withdraw your membership tomorrow. This proverb frowns upon break ups or separations in marriages or relationships.

''Woreko awaree a bisa'', This proverb talks about [[due diligence]] before marriage. it is wise to do a background check on your partner before marriage or the worse will happen. Making the wrong choice is sometimes costly. Similarly,most of the proverbs seem to put value on the object being addressed. This symbol signifies Love,bonding and faithfulness but one must carefully choose the right partner.

''Ahwenepa nkasa,'' can be interpreted to mean ''"Ahwenepa"''( Good waist [[bead]]s) "''nkasa''" (makes no noise). This can be related to mean a good man or a good woman needs no introduction to be known. You can notice them when you find them. This proverb talks about the character of the would be partner. Good man or woman is hard to find but when you meet that special person,you will notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.design233.com/oldhtml/Art/akan_proverbs_as_message_making_tools_in_graphic_design.html#.WhVvXnnLfIV |title=Design233 {{!}} Akan Proverbs as Message-Making Tools in Graphic Design|last=Larbi|first=Korantemaa|website=www.design233.com|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adinkrasymbols.org/osram-ne-nsoromma/|title=Osram ne Nsoromma Adinkra Symbol, Meaning, Pronunciation, Discussion|work=Adinkra Symbols|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[information technology]] a '''reasoning system''' is a [[software system]] that generates conclusions from available [[knowledge]] using [[logic]]al techniques such as [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Reasoning systems play an important role in the implementation of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge-based systems]].

By the everyday usage definition of the phrase, all computer systems are reasoning systems in that they all automate some type of logic or decision. In typical use in the [[Information Technology]] field however, the phrase is usually reserved for systems that perform more complex kinds of reasoning. For example, not for systems that do fairly straightforward types of reasoning such as calculating a sales tax or customer discount but making logical inferences about a medical diagnosis or mathematical theorem. Reasoning systems come in two modes: interactive and batch processing. Interactive systems interface with the user to ask clarifying questions or otherwise allow the user to guide the reasoning process. Batch systems take in all the available information at once and generate the best answer possible without user feedback or guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wos|first1=Larry|last2=Owerbeek|first2=Ross|last3=Ewing|first3=Lusk|last4=Boyle|first4=Jim|title=Automated Reasoning: Introductions and Applications|date=1984|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-054453-1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasoning systems have a wide field of application that includes [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]], [[Business rules approach|business rule processing]], [[problem solving]], [[complex event processing]], [[intrusion detection]], [[predictive analytics]], [[robotics]], [[computer vision]], and [[natural language processing]].

==History==
The first reasoning systems were theorem provers, systems that represent axioms and statements in First Order Logic and then use rules of logic such as [[modus ponens]] to infer new statements. Another early type of reasoning system were general problem solvers. These were systems such as the [[General Problem Solver]] designed by [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herb Simon|Simon]]. General problem solvers attempted to provide a generic planning engine that could represent and solve structured problems. They worked by decomposing problems into smaller more manageable sub-problems, solving each sub-problem and assembling the partial answers into one final answer. Another example general problem solver was the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|SOAR]] family of systems.

In practice these theorem provers and general problem solvers were seldom useful for practical applications and required specialized users with knowledge of logic to utilize. The first practical application of [[automated reasoning]] were [[expert system]]s. Expert systems focused on much more well defined domains than general problem solving such as medical diagnosis or analyzing faults in an aircraft. Expert systems also focused on more limited implementations of logic. Rather than attempting to implement the full range of logical expressions they typically focused on modus-ponens implemented via IF-THEN rules. Focusing on a specific domain and allowing only a restricted subset of logic improved the performance of such systems so that they were practical for use in the real world and not merely as research demonstrations as most previous automated reasoning systems had been. The engine used for automated reasoning in expert systems were typically called [[inference engine]]s. Those used for more general logical inferencing are typically called [[Automated theorem provers|theorem provers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=AddisonWesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas| last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise in popularity of expert systems many new types of automated reasoning were applied to diverse problems in government and industry. Some such as case-based reasoning were off shoots of expert systems research. Others such as constraint satisfaction algorithms were also influenced by fields such as decision technology and linear programming. Also, a completely different approach, one not based on symbolic reasoning but on a connectionist model has also been extremely productive. This latter type of automated reasoning is especially well suited to pattern matching and signal detection types of problems such as text searching and face matching.

==Use of logic==
The term reasoning system can be used to apply to just about any kind of sophisticated decision system as illustrated by the specific areas described below. However, the most common use of the term reasoning system implies the computer representation of logic.  Various implementations demonstrate significant variation in terms of [[Formal system|systems of logic]] and formality. Most reasoning systems implement variations of [[Propositional calculus|propositional]] and [[Symbolic logic|symbolic]] ([[Predicate logic|predicate]]) logic.  These variations may be mathematically precise representations of formal logic systems (e.g., [[First-order logic|FOL]]), or extended and [[Hybrid logic|hybrid]] versions of those systems (e.g., Courteous logic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin N. |last=Grosof |title=Courteous Logic Programs: Prioritized Conflict Handling For Rules |date=30 December 1997 |work=IBM Research Report |id=RC 20836 (92273) |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/iagents/paps/rc20836.ps |format=Postscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   Reasoning systems may explicitly implement additional logic types (e.g., [[Modal logic|modal]], [[Deontic logic|deontic]], [[Temporal logic|temporal]] logics).  However, many reasoning systems implement imprecise and semi-formal approximations to recognised logic systems.  These systems typically support a variety of procedural and semi-[[Declarative programming|declarative]] techniques in order to model different reasoning strategies.  They emphasise pragmatism over formality and may depend on custom extensions and attachments in order to solve real-world problems.

Many reasoning systems employ [[deductive reasoning]] to draw [[inference]]s from available knowledge.  These inference engines support forward reasoning or backward reasoning to infer conclusions via [[modus ponens]].   The [[Recursion|recursive]] reasoning methods they employ are termed ‘[[forward chaining]]’ and ‘[[backward chaining]]’, respectively. Although reasoning systems widely support deductive inference, some systems employ [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[Defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] and other types of reasoning. [[Heuristic]]s may also be employed to determine acceptable solutions to [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable problems]].

Reasoning systems may employ the [[closed world assumption]] (CWA) or [[open world assumption]] (OWA).  The OWA is often associated with [[Ontology|ontological]] knowledge representation and the [[Semantic Web]].   Different systems exhibit a variety of approaches to [[negation]].  As well as [[Logical complement|logical]] or [[bitwise complement]], systems may support existential forms of strong and weak negation including [[Negation as failure|negation-as-failure]] and ‘inflationary’ negation (negation of non-[[Ground expression|ground atoms]]).   Different reasoning systems may support [[Monotonic function#Monotonic logic|monotonic]] or [[Non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] reasoning, [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] and other logical techniques.

==Reasoning under uncertainty==

Many reasoning systems provide capabilities for reasoning under [[uncertainty]]. This is important when building [[situated]] [[Distributed Multi-Agent Reasoning System|reasoning agents]] which must deal with uncertain representations of the world.  There are several common approaches to handling uncertainty.  These include the use of certainty factors, [[Probability|probabilistic]] methods such as [[Bayesian inference]] or [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], multi-valued (‘[[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]]’) logic and various [[Connectionism|connectionist]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Yoram |last1=Moses |first2=Moshe Y |last2=Vardi |first3=Ronald |last3=Fagin |first4=Joseph Y |last4=Halpern |title=Reasoning About Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHmlRamoszMC |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56200-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of reasoning system==

This section provides a non-exhaustive and informal categorisation of common types of reasoning system.  These categories are not absolute.  They overlap to a significant degree and share a number of techniques, methods and [[algorithm]]s.

===Constraint solvers===
Constraint solvers solve [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s (CSPs).  They support [[constraint programming]].  A [[Constraint (information theory)|constraint]] is a condition which must be met by any valid [[Problem solving|solution to a problem]].  Constraints are defined declaratively and applied to [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] within given domains.  Constraint solvers use [[Search algorithm|search]], [[backtracking]] and [[Local consistency|constraint propagation]] techniques to find solutions and determine optimal solutions.  They may employ forms of [[Linear programming|linear]] and [[nonlinear programming]].  They are often used to perform [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] within highly [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] problem spaces.  For example, they may be used to calculate optimal scheduling, design efficient [[integrated circuit]]s or maximise productivity in a manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Schalkoff |title=Intelligent Systems: Principles, Paradigms and Pragmatics: Principles, Paradigms and Pragmatics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80FXUtF5kRoC |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-8017-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theorem provers===
[[Automated theorem proving|Theorem provers]] use [[automated reasoning]] techniques to determine [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] of mathematical theorems.  They may also be used to verify existing proofs.  In addition to academic use, typical applications of theorem provers include verification of the correctness of integrated circuits, software programs, engineering designs, etc.

===Logic programs===
[[Logic programming|Logic programs]] (LPs) are [[Computer program|software programs]] written using [[programming language]]s whose [[Language primitive|primitives]] and [[Expression (programming)|expressions]] provide direct representations of constructs drawn from mathematical logic.  An example of a general-purpose logic programming language is [[Prolog]].  LPs represent the direct application of logic programming to solve problems.   Logic programming is characterised by highly declarative approaches based on formal logic, and has wide application across many disciplines.

===Rule engines===
[[Business rules engine|Rule engines]] represent conditional logic as discrete rules.  Rule sets can be managed and applied separately to other functionality.  They have wide applicability across many domains.  Many rule engines implement reasoning capabilities.  A common approach is to implement [[Production system (computer science)|production system]]s to support forward or backward chaining.  Each rule (‘production’) binds a conjunction of [[Clause|predicate clauses]] to a list of executable actions.  At run-time, the rule engine matches productions against facts and executes (‘fires’) the associated action list for each match.  If those actions remove or modify any facts, or assert new facts, the engine immediately re-computes the set of matches.  Rule engines are widely used to model and apply [[business rule]]s, to control [[Decision making|decision-making]] in automated processes and to enforce business and technical policies.

===Deductive classifier===
[[Deductive classifier]]s arose slightly later than rule-based systems and were a component of a new type of artificial intelligence knowledge representation tool known as [[frame language]]s. A frame language describes the problem domain as a set of classes, subclasses, and relations among the classes. It is similar to the [[Object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented]] model. Unlike object-oriented models however, frame languages have a formal semantics based on first order logic. They utilize this semantics to provide input to the deductive classifier. The classifier in turn can analyze a given model (known as an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and determine if the various relations described in the model are consistent. If the ontology is not consistent the classifier will highlight the declarations that are inconsistent. If the ontology is consistent the classifier can then do further reasoning and draw additional conclusions about the relations of the objects in the ontology. For example, it may determine that an object is actually a subclass or instance of additional classes as those described by the user. Classifiers are an important technology in analyzing the ontologies used to describe models in the [[Semantic web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|accessdate=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34–43|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine learning systems===
[[Machine learning]] systems evolve their behavior over time based on [[experience]].   This may involve reasoning over observed events or example data provided for training purposes.  For example, machine learning systems may use [[inductive reasoning]] to generate [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] for observed facts.  Learning systems search for generalised rules or functions that yield results in line with observations and then use these generalisations to control future behavior.

===Case-based reasoning systems===
[[Case-based reasoning]] (CBR) systems provide solutions to problems by analysing similarities to other problems for which known solutions already exist.  They use [[Analogy|analogical]] reasoning to infer solutions based on case histories.  CBR systems are commonly used in customer/[[technical support]] and [[call centre]] scenarios and have applications in [[Manufacturing|industrial manufacture]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[law]] and many other areas.

===Procedural reasoning systems===
A [[Procedural Reasoning System|procedural reasoning system]] (PRS) uses reasoning techniques to select [[plan]]s from a [[procedural knowledge]] base.  Each plan represents a course of action for achievement of a given [[goal]].  The PRS implements a [[Belief-Desire-Intention software model|belief-desire-intention model]] by reasoning over facts (‘[[belief]]s’) to select appropriate plans (‘[[intention]]s’) for given goals (‘desires’).  Typical applications of PRS include management, monitoring and [[Fault detection and isolation|fault detection]] systems.

[[File:Repair Cafe by Ilvy Njiokiktjien.jpg|thumb|280px|Repair café Amsterdam-West]]
A '''repair café''' is a meeting in which people repair household electrical and mechanical devices, computers, bicycles, clothing, etc. They are organised by and for local residents. Repair cafés are held at a fixed location where tools are available and where they can fix their broken goods with the help of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wackman|first1=John|title='Repair Café' Gets Stuff Fixed|url=http://www.rethinklocal.org/blog/2013/07/repair-cafe-gets-stuff-fixed/|website=Rethink Local website|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives are to reduce waste, to maintain repair skills and to strengthen [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-85913052.html Global Village: Warum eine neue Bewegung aus den Niederlanden Toaster und Bügeleisen repariert ]" [[Der Spiegel]], 26 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www1.wdr.de/themen/ratgeber/repaircafe114.html Mehr reparieren, weniger konsumieren] [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], 29 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sz-WohLQyQ Repair Cafe nu ook doorgedrongen in Duitsland]" [[heute]], 26 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2012/07/201271654749156813.html Dutch group mends broken items for free]" [[Al Jazeera]], 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nieuws.vtm.be/binnenland/2013010832354-repareren-weer Repareren is weer in]" [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]], 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.brusselnieuws.be/artikel/repair-cafe-verhuist-naar-elzenhof-opent-cafe-molenbeek Repair Café naar Elzenhof]" Brusselnieuws, 3 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept was devised by Martine Postma in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Sally McGrane, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/world/europe/amsterdam-tries-to-change-culture-with-repair-cafes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; An Effort to Bury a Throwaway Culture One Repair at a Time]" [[The New York Times]], 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2009, the first Repair Café was held at Fijnhout Theater, [[Amsterdam-West]]. On 2 March 2010, the Repair Café Foundation was set up. The foundation was formed to support local groups around the world in setting up their own Repair Cafés.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/17/how-to-set-up-your-own-repair-cafe | date = 17 September 2014 | accessdate = 14 November 2016 | first1 = Katherine | last1 = Purvis | first2 = Nell | last2 = Card | first3 = Lucy | last3 = Palmer | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = How to set up your own repair café}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of Repair Cafés has grown quickly. In March 2016 Postma registered more than 1,000 Repair Cafés worldwide, 327 in the Netherlands, 309 in Germany, 22 in the UK, 21 in the US, 15 in Canada, four Australia and one in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319022011/http://repaircafe.org/bezoeken Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 19 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017 the number of Repair Cafés climbed over 1,200, in March 2018 the number reached 1,500 in 33 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170130020242/https://repaircafe.org/en/visit/ Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the first [[International Repair Day]] was announced. It is intended to be an annual event, taking place on the third Saturday of October each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voicemag.uk/blog/3325/dialogues-and-debates-ugo-vallauri|title=Dialogues and Debates: Ugo Vallauri|work=Voice Magazine|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection==
In 2017, the Repair Café Foundation developed an online tool - the [http://RepairMonitor.org RepairMonitor] - enabling volunteers to collect and share repair data via a central database. In March 2018, information about almost 4,000 repairs had been entered into this system, aiming to promote reparability and durability of products.   

==3D printing of broken parts==
Some repair cafés have begun to use 3D printers for replicating broken parts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hbvl.be/cnt/aid1565685/repair-cafe-maakt-onvindbare-wisselstukken-met-3d-printer Repair café maakt onvindbare wisselstukken met 3D-printer]" [[Het Belang van Limburg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Broken pieces of domestic appliances may be able to be pieced or glued back together, after which they can be scanned with a [[3D scanner#Hand-held laser scanners|3D scanner]]. Examples of 3D scanners include David Starter-Kit, [[3D Systems]] Sense, [[MakerBot]] Digitizer, Fuel 3D, Microsoft [[Kinect]], and [[Asus]] Xtion.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Microsoft Kinect and Asus Xtion can be used together with ReconstructMe software for 3D scanning&lt;/ref&gt; Once the physical object is scanned, the 3D model is rendered. It can be converted to a .stl or .obj format and revised using [[geometry processing]] software such as makeprintable, netfabb, [[MeshLab]], Meshmixer, [[Ultimaker|Cura]], or [[Slic3r]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Cura and Slic3r have some fixup tools, despite being mainly a slicer program&lt;/ref&gt; It is printed using a [[3D printer client]], creating a physical part using the 3D printer. The complete process takes some time to complete.

To reduce the time needed in the repair café, people might choose to use a pre-made part from a website with 3D models (skipping the scanning step),&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Examples of such websites are [[Thingiverse]], [[CGTrader]], [[GrabCAD]], and Google [[3D Warehouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; or make the 3D model themselves by taking many photographs of the part and using something like [[Autodesk 123D|123D Catch]], and/or choose (in the event the repair café does not have its own 3D printer) to have the 3D ''model'' made in the repair café, but printed using a 3D printer elsewhere. Alternatively a 3D printing service like [[Ponoko]], [[Shapeways]], and others can be used, and a person then return to the repair café to have the new part fitted to the broken equipment.

[[Image:Mitbat-2007-bracket-large.png|thumb|250px|Example of a single-elimination tournament bracket]]

A '''single-elimination''', '''knockout''', or '''sudden death tournament''' is a type of [[elimination tournament]] where the loser of each match-up is immediately eliminated from the tournament. Each winner will play another in the next round, until the final match-up, whose winner becomes the tournament champion. Each match-up may be a single match or several, for example [[two-legged tie]]s in European football or [[best-of series]] in American pro sports. Defeated competitors may play no further part after losing, or may participate in "consolation" or "classification" matches against other losers to determine the lower final rankings; for example, a [[third place playoff]] between losing semi-finalists. In a shootout [[poker tournament]], there are more than two players competing at each table, and sometimes more than one progressing to the next round. Some competitions are held with a pure single-elimination tournament system. Others have many phases, with the last being a single-elimination final stage, often called [[playoffs]].

==Nomenclature==
In [[English language|English]], the round in which only eight competitors remain is generally called (with or without hyphenation) the ''quarter-final'' round; this is followed by the ''semi-final'' round, in which only four are left, the two winners of which then meet in the final or ''championship round''.

The round before the quarterfinals has multiple designations. Often it's called the ''round of sixteen'', ''last sixteen'', or (in South Asia) ''pre quarter-finals''. In many other languages the term used to describe these eight matches translates to ''eighth-final'', though this term is rare in English itself.

Earlier rounds are typically numbered counting forwards from the first round, or by the number of remaining competitors. If some competitors get a bye, the round at which they enter may be named the ''first round'', with the earlier matches called a ''preliminary round'', ''qualifying round'', or the ''play-in games"''.

==Classification==
When matches are held to determine places or prizes lower than first and second (the loser of the final-round match gaining the latter position), these typically include a match between the losers of the semifinal matches called [[Third place playoff|third place playoffs]], the winner therein placing third and the loser fourth. Many Olympic single-elimination tournaments feature the bronze medal match if they do not award bronze medals to both losing semifinalists. The [[FIFA World Cup]] has long featured the third place match, though the [[UEFA Euro]] has not held one since the [[Euro 1980|1980 edition]].

Sometimes, contests are also held among the losers of the quarterfinal matches to determine fifth to eighth places – this is most commonly encountered in the [[Olympic Games]], with the exception of [[boxing]], where both fighters are deemed to be third place. In one scenario, two "consolation semifinal" matches may be conducted, with the winners of these then facing off to determine fifth and sixth places and the losers playing for seventh and eighth; those are used often in qualifying tournaments where only the top five teams advance to the next round; or some method of ranking the four quarterfinal losers might be employed, in which case only one round of additional matches would be held among them, the two highest-ranked therein then playing for fifth and sixth places and the two lowest for seventh and eighth.

The number of distinct ways of arranging a single-elimination tournament (as an abstract structure, prior to seeding the players into the tournament) is given by the [[Wedderburn–Etherington number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Maurer | first = Willi
 | journal = The Annals of Statistics
 | jstor = 2958441
 | mr = 0371712
 | pages = 717–727
 | title = On most effective tournament plans with fewer games than competitors
 | volume = 3
 | year = 1975
 | doi = 10.1214/aos/1176343135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for instance, there are three different arrangements for five players:
*The players may be divided into brackets of two and three players, the winners of which meet in the final game
*The bottom four players may play a two-round tournament, the winner of which plays the top player
*The bottom two players may meet, after which each subsequent game pairs the winner of the previous game with the next player
However, the number of arrangements grows quickly for larger numbers of players and not all of them are commonly used.

==Seeding==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[FA Cup]] --&gt;
{{main|Seed (sports)}}

Opponents may be allocated randomly (such as in the FA Cup); however, since the "luck of the draw" may result in the highest-rated competitors being scheduled to face each other early in the competition, ''seeding'' is often used to prevent this. Brackets are set up so that the top two seeds could not possibly meet until the final round (should both advance that far), none of the top four can meet prior to the semifinals, and so on. If no seeding is used, the tournament is called a random knockout tournament.

One version of seeding is where brackets are set up so that the quarterfinal pairings (barring any upsets) would be the 1 seed vs. the 8 seed, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 6 and 4 vs. 5; however, this is not the procedure that is followed in most tennis tournaments, where the 1 and 2 seeds are placed in separate brackets, but then the 3 and 4 seeds are assigned to their brackets randomly, and so too are seeds 5 through 8, and so on. This may result in some brackets consisting of stronger players than other brackets, and since only the top 32 players are seeded at all in [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Tennis Grand Slam]] tournaments, it is conceivable that the 33rd-best player in a 128-player field could end up playing the top seed in the first round. A good example of this occurring was when World No. 33 [[Florian Mayer]] was drawn against (and eventually defeated by) then-World No. 1 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the first round of the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Men's Singles|2013 Wimbledon Championships]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://novakdjokovic.com/en/news/tennis/wimbledon-novak-vs-mayer-in-r1-andy-roger-and-rafa-all-in-bottom-half/ Wimbledon: Novak vs Mayer in R1; Andy, Roger, Rafa all in bottom half], ''[[Novak Djokovic]] official website'', 21 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in what was also a rematch of [[2012 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Gentlemen's Singles#Finals|a quarterfinal from the previous year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/06/22/wimbledon-2013-possible-mens-matches-to-watch-out-for/ Wimbledon 2013: Men's matches to watch out for], ''The Roar'', 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; While this may seem unfair to a casual observer, it should be pointed out that rankings of tennis players are generated by computers, and players tend to change ranking positions very gradually, so that a more equitable method of determining the pairings might result in many of the same head-to-head matchups being repeated over and over again in successive tournaments.

Sometimes the remaining competitors in a single-elimination tournament will be "re-seeded" so that the highest surviving seed is made to play the lowest surviving seed in the next round, the second-highest plays the second-lowest, etc. This may be done after each round, or only at selected intervals. In American team sports, for example, the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]], [[NFL]] and [[WNBA]] employ this tactic, but the [[NBA]] does not (and neither does the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA college basketball tournament]]). [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] does not have enough teams (10) in its playoff tournament where re-seeding would make a large difference in the matchups; ([[Major League Soccer|MLS]] and NFL are at the minimum, which is six from each conference [or league in MLB] for a total of 12). The NBA's format calls for the winner of the first-round series between the first and eighth seeds (within each of the two conferences the league has) to face the winner of the first-round series between the fourth and fifth seeds in the next round, even if one or more of the top three seeds had been upset in their first-round series; critics have claimed that this gives a team fighting for the fifth and sixth seeding positions near the end of the regular season an incentive to [[match fixing|tank]] (deliberately lose) games, so as to finish sixth and thus avoid a possible matchup with the top seed until one round later.

In some situations, a seeding restriction may be implemented; from 1975 until 1989 in the [[National Football League|NFL]], and from 1994 until 2011 in [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] there was a rule where at the conference or league semifinal, should the top seed and last seed (wild card) be from the same division, they could not play each other; in that case, the top seed plays the worst division champion; the second-best division champion plays the wild card team. This is due to the scheduling employed for the regular season, in which a team faces any given divisional opponent more often than any given non-divisional opponent &amp;ndash; the tournament favors matchups that took place fewer times in the regular season (or did not take place, in some cases). {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In international [[fencing]] competitions, it is common to have a [[group stage]]. Participants are divided in groups of 6–7 fencers who play a round-robin tournament, and a ranking is calculated from the consolidated group results. Single elimination is seeded from this ranking.

==Evaluation==
The single-elimination format enables a relatively large number of competitors to participate. There are no "dead" matches (perhaps excluding "classification" matches), and no matches where one competitor has more to play for than the other.

The format is less suited to games where [[tie (draw)|draws]] are frequent. In [[chess]], each fixture in a single-elimination tournament must be played over multiple matches, because [[draw (chess)|draws are common]], and because white has an advantage over black. In [[association football]], games ending in a draw may be settled in extra time and eventually by a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] or by replaying the fixture.

Another perceived disadvantage is that most competitors are eliminated after relatively few games. Variations such as the [[double-elimination tournament]] allow competitors a single loss while remaining eligible for overall victory.

In a random knockout tournament (single-elimination without any seeding), awarding the second place to the loser of the final is unjustified: any of the competitors knocked out by the tournament winner might have been the second strongest one, but they never got the chance to play against the losing finalist. In general, it is only fair to use a single-elimination tournament to determine first place. To fairly determine lower places requires some form of [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] in which each player/team gets the opportunity to face every other player/team.

Also, if the competitors' performance is variable, that is, it depends on a small, varying factor in addition to the actual strength of the competitors, then not only will it become less likely that the strongest competitor actually wins the tournament, in addition the seeding done by the tournament organizers will play a major part in deciding the winner.&lt;ref name="ryv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerge.cuni.cz/pdf/wp/Wp252.pdf|title=The Predictive Power of Noisy Elimination Tournaments|last=Ryvkin|first=Dmitry|date=March 2005|publisher=CERGE-EI|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1061783|title=Who Can Win a Single-Elimination Tournament?|last1=Kim|first1=Michael P.|last2=Suksompong|first2=Warut|last3=Vassilevska Williams|first3=Virginia|author3-link= Virginia Vassilevska Williams |year=2017|journal=SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics|volume=31|issue=3|pages=1751–1764|doi=10.1137/16M1061783}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a random factor is always present in a real-world competition, this might easily cause accusations of unfairness.

==Other tournament systems==
Variations of the single-elimination tournament include:
* [[Double-elimination tournament]]
* [[McIntyre System]], a group of tournament formats that combine features of single- and double-elimination tournaments. Varieties of this system include:
** [[Page playoff system]] (four teams)
** [[Top five play-offs]]
** [[Top six play-offs]]
** [[McIntyre Final Eight System]]
** [[Super League play-offs]], which formerly used a McIntyre Final Eight variant
** [[AFL final eight system]], another variant of the McIntyre Final Eight, currently used by the Australian Football League
Other common tournament types include:
* [[Round-robin tournament]]
* [[Swiss-system tournament]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2837">{{About|tire behavior in vehicle dynamics|the phenomenon in fluid dynamics|Slip ratio (gas-liquid flow)}}
'''Slip ratio''' is a means of calculating and expressing the slipping behavior of the wheel of an [[automobile]]. It is of fundamental importance in the field of vehicle dynamics, as it allows to understand the relationship between the deformation of the [[tire]] and the longitudinal forces (i.e. the forces responsible for forward [[acceleration]] and braking) acting upon it. Furthermore, it is essential to the effectiveness of any [[anti-lock braking system]]. 

When accelerating or braking a vehicle equipped with tires, the observed angular velocity of the tire does not match the expected velocity for pure [[rolling]] motion, which means there appears to be apparent [[:wikt:sliding|sliding]] between outer surface of the rim and the road in addition to rolling due to deformation of the part of tire above the area in contact with the road. When driving on dry pavement the fraction of slip that is caused by actual sliding taking place between road and tire contact patch is negligible in magnitude and thus does not in practice make slip ratio dependent on speed. It is only relevant in soft or slippery surfaces, like snow, mud, ice, etc and results constant speed difference in same road and load conditions independently of speed, and thus fraction of slip ratio due to that cause is inversely related to speed of the vehicle. The difference between theoretically calculated forward speed based on angular speed of the rim and rolling radius, and actual speed of the vehicle, expressed as a percentage of the latter, is called ‘slip ratio’. This slippage is caused by the forces at the contact patch of the tire, not the opposite way, and is thus of fundamental importance to determine the accelerations a vehicle can produce.

There is no universally agreed upon definition of slip ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Milliken |first1=William |last2=Milliken |first2=Douglas |date=December 1, 1994 |title=Race Car Vehicle Dynamics |url=http://books.sae.org/r-146/ |isbn=978-1-56091-526-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAE J670 definition is, for tires pointing straight ahead:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=SAE Vehicle Dynamics Standards Committee |date=January 24, 2008 |title=Vehicle Dynamics Terminology |url=http://standards.sae.org/j670_200801/  |publisher= Society of Automotive Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Slip\ Ratio\ \% = \left ( \frac{\Omega\,R_C}{V} - 1 \right ) \times 100\%&lt;/math&gt;

Where Ω is the angular velocity of the wheel, R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective radius of the corresponding free-rolling tire, which can be calculated from the revolutions per kilometer, and V is the forward velocity of the vehicle.

The Certificate of Incorporation (dated October 29, 1957) of the society states that:

{{quotation|The purpose and objects of this corporation shall be to encourage, foster, and promote the advancement of the science of experimental analysis of behavior; the promotion of research in the said science and the increase and diffusion of knowledge of the said science by the conduct of a program of education by meetings, conferences and symposia, and by the publication of journals, papers, periodicals and reports.}}

The ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'' was established to meet the needs of those who were attracted to the behavior-analytic approach but were unhappy with the lack of a journal specializing in that rapidly growing area. As described on its inside front page ever since, the journal is "primarily for the original publication of experiments relevant to the behavior of individual organisms." It started as a quarterly in 1958 but has appeared bimonthly since 1964. The initial [[Editorial board|Board of Editors]] also served as the first Board of Directors of the society.

In 1968, the society established the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'' for "the original publication of reports of experimental research involving applications of the experimental analysis of behavior to problems of social importance." It appears quarterly.

{{Antisemitism}}
'''Strasserism''' ({{lang-de|Strasserismus}} or ''Straßerismus'') is a strand of [[Nazism]] that calls for a more radical, mass-action and worker-based form of Nazism—hostile to [[Jews]] not from a racial, ethnic, cultural or religious perspective, but from an [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] basis—to achieve a [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|national rebirth]]. It derives its name from [[Gregor Strasser|Gregor]] and [[Otto Strasser]], the two Nazi brothers initially associated with this position. 

Opposed on strategic views to [[Adolf Hitler]], Otto Strasser was expelled from the [[Nazi Party]] in 1930 and went into [[exile]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] while Gregor Strasser was murdered in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] on 30 June 1934 during the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. Strasserism remains an active position within strands of [[neo-Nazism]].

== Strasser brothers ==
=== Gregor Strasser ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1721, Gregor Strasser crop.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gregor Strasser]] in 1928]]
[[Gregor Strasser]] (1892–1934) began his career in [[ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] politics by joining the ''[[Freikorps]]'' after serving in [[World War I]]. Strasser was involved in the [[Kapp Putsch]] and formed his own ''[[Völkisch movement|völkischer]] Wehrverband'' ("popular defense union") which he merged into the NSDAP in 1921. Initially a loyal supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]], he took part in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and held a number of high positions in the [[Nazi Party]]. However, Strasser soon became a strong advocate of the [[Right-wing socialism|socialist]] wing of the party, arguing that the national revolution should also include strong action to tackle poverty and should seek to build [[working class]] support. After [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Hitler's rise to power]], [[Ernst Röhm]], who headed the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), then the most important paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, called for a second revolution aimed at removing the elites from control. This was opposed by the [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative movement]] as well as by some [[Nazism|Nazis]] who preferred an ordered authoritarian regime to the radical and disruptive program proposed by the party's left-wing.

=== Otto Strasser ===
[[File:Otto Strasser crop.jpg|thumb|left|203px|[[Otto Strasser]] giving a speech shortly after his return to Germany after World War II]]
[[Otto Strasser]] (1897–1974) had also been a member of the ''Freikorps'', but he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and fought against the Kapp Putsch. Strasser joined the Nazi Party in 1925, but he nonetheless retained his ideas about the importance of socialism. Considered more of a radical than his brother, Strasser was expelled by the Nazi Party in 1930 and set up his own dissident group, the [[Black Front]], which called for a specifically [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] form of socialist revolution. Strasser fled Germany in 1933 to live firstly in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and then [[Canada]] before returning to [[West Germany]] in later life, all the while writing prolifically about Hitler and what he saw as his betrayal of [[national socialist]] ideals.

== Ideology ==
The name Strasserism came to be applied to the form of Nazism that developed around the Strasser brothers. Although they had been involved in the creation of the [[National Socialist Program]] of 1920, both called on the party to commit to "breaking the shackles of finance capital".&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, 'Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany' in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson &amp; M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Economic antisemitism|opposition to Jewish finance capitalism]], which they contrasted to "[[Producerism|productive capitalism]]”, was shared by [[Political views of Adolf Hitler|Hitler himself]], who borrowed it from [[Gottfried Feder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', first chapter (London, 1991, rev. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Populism|populist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] form of anti-capitalism was further developed in 1925 when Otto Strasser published the ''Nationalsozialistische Briefe'', which discussed notions of [[class conflict]], [[Redistribution of income and wealth|wealth redistribution]] and a possible alliance with the [[Soviet Union]]. His 1930 follow-up ''Ministersessel oder Revolution'' (''Cabinet Seat or Revolution'') went further by attacking Hitler's betrayal of the socialist aspect of Nazism as well as criticizing the notion of the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], ''The German Dictatorship'', 1973, pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Gregor Strasser echoed many of the calls of his brother, his influence on the ideology is less, owing to his remaining in the Nazi Party longer and to his early death. Meanwhile, Otto Strasser continued to expand his argument, calling for the break-up of large estates and the development of something akin to a [[Gremialismo|guild system]] and the related establishment of a ''Reich'' [[cooperative]] chamber to take a leading role in [[Planned economy|economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolte|first=Ernst|title=[[Three Faces of Fascism]]: Action Française, Italian fascism, National Socialism|year=1969|publisher=Mentor|location=New York|authorlink=Ernst Nolte|pages=425–426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strasserism therefore became a distinct strand of Nazism that whilst holding on to previous Nazi ideals such as [[palingenetic ultranationalism]] and antisemitism, added a strong [[Criticism of capitalism|critique of capitalism]] and framed this in the demand for a more socialist-based approach to economics.

However, it is disputed whether Strasserism was a distinct form of Nazism. According to historian [[Ian Kershaw]], "the leaders of the SA [which included Gregor Strasser] did not have another vision of the future of Germany or another politic to propose". The Strasserites advocated the radicalization of the [[Nazi regime]] and the toppling of the [[Junker (Prussia)|German elites]], calling Hitler's rise to power a half-revolution which needed to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], 1991, chapter III, first section.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
=== In Germany ===
During the 1970s, the ideas of Strasserism began to be referred to more in European far-right groups as younger members with no ties to Hitler and a stronger sense of anti-capitalism came to the fore. Strasserite thought in Germany began to emerge as a tendency within the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]] (NPD) during the late 1960s. These Strasserites played a leading role in securing the removal of [[Adolf von Thadden]] from the leadership and after his departure the party became stronger in condemning Hitler for what it saw as his move away from socialism in order to court business and army leaders.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History'', 2003, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially adopted by the NPD, Strasserism soon became associated with more peripheral extremist figures, notably [[Michael Kühnen]] who produced a 1982 pamphlet ''Farewell to Hitler'', which included a strong endorsement of the idea. The [[Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit|People's Socialist Movement of Germany/Labour Party]] (a minor extremist movement that was outlawed in 1982) adopted the policy while its successor movement, the [[Nationalist Front (Germany)|Nationalist Front]], did likewise, with its ten-point programme calling for an "anti-materialist cultural revolution" and an "anti-capitalist social revolution" to underline its support for the idea.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, "Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany" in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Free German Workers' Party]] also moved towards these ideas under the leadership of [[Friedhelm Busse]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, "Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany" in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The flag of the Strasserite movement [[Black Front]] and its symbol a crossed hammer and a sword has been used by German and other European [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] abroad as a substitute for the more infamous [[Nazi flag]] which is banned in some countries such as Germany.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== In the United Kingdom ===
Strasserism emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and centred on the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF) publication ''Britain First'', the main writers of which were [[David McCalden]], [[Richard Lawson (UK politician)|Richard Lawson]] and [[Denis Pirie]]. Opposing the leadership of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], they formed an alliance with [[John Kingsley Read]] and ultimately followed him into the [[National Party (UK, 1976)|National Party]] (NP).&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy'', 2004, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The NP called for British workers to seize the right to work and offered a fairly Strasserite economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;M. Walker, ''The National Front'', 1977, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the NP failed to last for very long. Due in part to Read's lack of enthusiasm for Strasserism, the main exponents of the idea drifted away.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The idea was reintroduced to the NF by [[Andrew Brons]] in the early 1980s when he decided to make the party's ideology clearer.&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy'', 2004, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Strasserism was soon to become the province of the radicals in the [[Official National Front]], with Richard Lawson brought in a behind-the-scenes role to help direct policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerry Gable|G. Gable]], 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain' in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson &amp; M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Political Soldier]] wing ultimately opted for the indigenous alternative of [[distributism]], but their strong anti-capitalist rhetoric as well as that of their [[International Third Position]] successor demonstrated influences from Strasserism. From this background, [[Troy Southgate]] emerged, whose own ideology and those of related groups such as the [[English Nationalist Movement]] and [[National Revolutionary Faction]] were influenced by Strasserism. He has also described himself as a post-Strasserite.

=== Elsewhere ===
[[Third Position]] groups, whose inspiration is generally more Italian in derivation, have often looked to Strasserism, owing to their strong opposition to capitalism. This was noted in France, where the student group ''[[Groupe Union Droit|Groupe Union Défense]]'' and the more recent ''[[Renouveau français]]'' both extolled Strasserite economic platforms.&lt;ref&gt;R. Griffin, ''The Nature of Fascism'', 1993, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to reinterpret Nazism as having a left-wing base have also been heavily influenced by this school of thought, notably through the work of [[Povl Riis-Knudsen]], who produced the Strasser-influenced work ''National Socialism: A Left-Wing Movement'' in 1984.

In the United States, [[Tom Metzger]] also flirted with Strasserism, having been influenced by Kühnen's pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Lee|M.A. Lee]], ''[[The Beast Reawakens]]'', 1997, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}

The '''three poisons''' (Sanskrit: ''triviṣa''; Tibetan: ''dug gsum'') or the '''three unwholesome roots''' (Sanskrit: ''akuśala-mūla''; Pāli: ''akusala-mūla''), in [[Buddhism]], refer to the three root [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]] of ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|Moha]]'' (delusion, confusion), ''[[Raga (Buddhism)|Raga]]'' (greed, sensual attachment), and ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|Dvesha]]'' (aversion, ill will).&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

==Brief description==
In the [[Buddhist]] teachings, the three poisons (of ignorance, attachment, and aversion) are the primary causes that keep sentient beings trapped in [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]. These three poisons are said to be the root of all of the other [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman (2003), pages 106, 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khenchen Konchog Gyaltshen (2010), p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three poisons are represented in the hub of the [[bhavacakra|wheel of life]] as a pig, a bird, and a snake (representing ignorance, attachment, and aversion, respectively).&lt;ref name=davidloyp28&gt;{{cite book|author=David Loy |title=The Great Awakening: A Buddhist Social Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwF6-sgB-UkC |year=2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-86171-366-0 |pages=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the [[bhavacakra|wheel of life]] (Sanskrit: ''bhavacakra''), the three poisons lead to the creation of [[karma]], which leads to rebirth in the six realms of samsara.&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Webster |title=The Philosophy of Desire in the Buddhist Pali Canon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLPGFoLED7sC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-34652-8 |pages=100–105, 177, 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1992), p. 4, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanskrit/Pali/Tibetan terms and translations==
The three kleshas of ignorance, attachment and aversion are referred to as the ''three poisons'' (Skt. ''triviṣa''; Tibetan: ''dug gsum'')  in the [[Mahayana]] tradition and as the ''three unwholesome roots'' (Pāli, ''akusala-mūla''; Skt. ''akuśala-mūla'' )  in the [[Theravada]] tradition.

The Sanskrit, Pali, and Tibetan terms for each of the three poisons are as follows:

In the Mahayana tradition ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' is identified as a subcategory of ''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|avidya]]''.  Whereas ''avidya'' is defined as a fundamental ignorance, ''moha'' is defined as delusion, confusion and incorrect beliefs. In the Theravada tradition, ''moha'' and ''avidya'' are equivalent terms, but they are used in different contexts; ''moha'' is used when referring to mental factors, and ''avidya'' is used when referring to the [[Twelve Nidanas|twelve links]].&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

'''Trance''' is an abnormal state of wakefulness in which a person is not self-aware and is either altogether unresponsive to external stimuli but is nevertheless capable of pursuing and realizing an aim, or is selectively responsive in following the directions of the person who has induced the trance. Trance states may occur involuntarily and unbidden.

The term ''trance'' may be associated with [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[flow (psychology)|flow]], and [[prayer]]. It may also be related to the earlier generic term, [[altered states of consciousness]], which is no longer used in "[[transpersonal psychology|consciousness studies]]" discourse.

==Etymology==

Trance in its modern meaning comes from an earlier meaning of "a dazed, half-conscious or insensible condition or state of fear", via the Old French ''transe'' "fear of evil", from the [[Latin]] ''transīre'' "to cross", "pass over". This definition is now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trance |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working models==

Wier, in his 1995 book, ''Trance: from magic to technology'', defines a simple trance (p.&amp;nbsp;58) as a state of mind being caused by cognitive loops where a cognitive object (thoughts, images, sounds, intentional actions) repeats long enough to result in various sets of disabled cognitive functions. Wier represents all trances (which include sleep and watching television) as taking place on a dissociated trance plane where at least some cognitive functions such as volition are disabled; as is seen in what is typically termed a 'hypnotic trance'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trance.edu/drupal/node/26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208040631/http://www.trance.edu/drupal/node/26 |archivedate=8 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this definition, meditation, hypnosis, addictions and charisma are seen as being trance states. In Wier's 2007 book, ''The Way of Trance'', he elaborates on these forms, adds ecstasy as an additional form and discusses the ethical implications of his model, including magic and government use which he terms "trance abuse".

[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] in ''Rational Mysticism'' (2003) explores the neurological mechanisms and psychological implications of trances and other [[mystical]] manifestations. Horgan incorporates literature and case-studies from a number of disciplines in this work: [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[radiology]] and [[theology]].

==Working definitions==
The following are some examples of trance states:
* [[Incantation|Enchantment]]: a [[psychological]] state induced by (or as if induced by) a magical [[incantation]]
* A state of mind in which consciousness is fragile and voluntary action is poor or missing
* A state resembling deep [[sleep]]
* Capture: attract; cause to be enamored; "She/he captured all the men's hearts"; in the sense of entranced
* A condition of apparent sleep or unconsciousness, with marked physiological characteristics, in which the body of the subject is thought by certain people to be liable to [[spirit possession|possession]]
* An [[out-of-body experience]] in which one feels they have passed out of the body into another state of [[being]], a [[rapture]], an [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]]. In a general way, the entranced conditions thus defined are divided into varying degrees of a negative, [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] state, and into progressive gradations of a positive, conscious, illumining condition.
* A state of hyper or enhanced [[suggestibility]].
* An induced or [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneous]] sleep-like condition of an [[altered state of consciousness]], which is thought by certain people to permit the subject's physical body to be utilized by disembodied spirits or entities as a means of [[Symbolic expression|expression]]
* An altered state of awareness induced via [[hypnosis]] in which unconscious or dissociated responses to suggestion are enhanced in quality and increased in degree
* A state induced by the use of [[hypnosis]]; the person accepts the suggestions of the hypnotist
* A state of consciousness characterized by extreme [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] often to the point of appearing [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].

Trance conditions include all the different states of [[mind]], [[emotion]]s, [[mood (psychology)|moods]] and [[daydream]]s that human beings experience. All activities which engage a human involve the filtering of information coming into sense modalities, and this influences brain functioning and consciousness. Therefore, trance may be understood as a way for the mind to change the way it filters information in order to provide more efficient use of the mind's resources.

Trance states may also be accessed or induced by various [[wikt:modality|modalities]] and is a way of accessing the [[unconscious mind]] for the purposes of [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[healing]], [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]. There is an extensive documented history of trance as evidenced by the case-studies of anthropologists and ethnologists and associated and derivative disciplines. Hence trance may be perceived as endemic to the [[human condition]] and a [[cultural universal|Human Universal]]. Principles of trance are being explored and documented as are methods of trance induction. Benefits of trance states are being explored by medical and scientific inquiry. Many traditions and rituals employ trance. Trance also has a function in religion and mystical experience.

Castillo (1995) states that: "Trance phenomena result from the behavior of intense focusing of attention, which is the key psychological mechanism of trance induction. Adaptive responses, including institutionalized forms of trance, are 'tuned' into neural networks in the brain and depend to a large extent on the characteristics of culture. Culture-specific organizations exist in the structure of individual neurons and in the organizational formation of neural networks."

Hoffman (1998: p.&amp;nbsp;9) states that: "Trance is still conventionally defined as a state of reduced [[consciousness]], or a somnolent state. However, the more recent [[anthropological]] definition, linking it to '[[altered states of consciousness]]' ([[Charles Tart]]), is becoming increasingly accepted."

Hoffman (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;9) asserts that: "...the trance state should be discussed in the plural, because there is more than one altered state of consciousness significantly different from everyday consciousness."

==Origins and history==

===Temple of Epidaurus: healing sleep===
According to Hoffman (1998: p.&amp;nbsp;10), [[pilgrims]] visited the [[Temple]] of [[Epidaurus]], an [[asclepeion]], in [[Greece]] for healing sleep. Seekers of healing would make [[pilgrimage]] and be received by a [[priest]] who would welcome and [[blessing|bless]] them. This temple housed an ancient [[religious]] [[ritual]] promoting [[dreams]] in the seeker that endeavored to promote healing and the solutions to problems, as did the [[oracles]]. This temple was built in honor of [[Asclepios]], the Greek god of medicine. The Greek treatment was referred to as [[incubation (ritual)|incubation]], and focused on [[prayers]] to Asclepios for healing. The [[asclepion]] at [[Epidaurus]] is both extensive and well-preserved, and is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of [[Asclepius]]. (For a comparable modern tool see [[Dreamwork]].)

The [[Pythia|Oracle at Delphi]] was also famous for trances in the ancient Greek world;  priestesses there would make [[divination|predictions about the future]] in exchange for [[gold]].

===Oral lore and storytelling===
Stories of the [[saints]] in the [[Middle Ages]], [[mythology|myths]], [[parables]], [[fairy tales]], [[oral lore]] and [[storytelling]] from different cultures are themselves potentially inducers of trance. Often [[rhetorical device|literary devices]] such as [[repetition (rhetorical)|repetition]] are employed which is evident in many forms of trance induction. [[Milton Erickson]] used stories to induce trance as do many [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]] practitioners.

===Military===
From at least the 16th century it was held that [[march music]] may induce soldiers marching in unison into trance states where according to apologists, they bond together as a unit engendered by the rigors of training, the ties of comradeship and the chain of command. This had the effect of making the soldiers become automated, an effect which was widely evident in the 16th, 17th and 18th century due to the increasing prevalence of firearms employed in warcraft. Military instruments, especially the [[snare drum]] and other drums were used to entone a monotonous [[ostinato]] at the pace of march and heartbeat. High-pitched [[fife (musical instrument)|fifes]], [[flute]]s and [[bagpipe]]s were used for their "piercing" effect to play the melody. This would assist the morale and solidarity of soldiers as they marched to battle.

[[Joseph Jordania]] recently proposed a term battle trance for this mental state, when [[combatant]]s do not feel [[fear]] and [[pain]], and when they lose their [[Personal identity|individual identity]] and acquire a [[collective identity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jordania]], [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]. Logos, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berserker|Norse Berserkers]] induced a trance-like state before battle, called ''Berserkergang''. It is said to have given the warriors superhuman strength and made them impervious to pain during battle. This form of trance could have been induced partly due to ingestion of [[Amanita muscaria|hallucinogenic mushrooms]].

===Mystics===
As the mystical experience of [[mysticism|mystics]] generally entails direct connection, communication and communion with [[Deity]], Godhead and/or [[god]]; trance and cognate experience are endemic. (see [[Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Shaman]], [[Umbanda]], [[Crazy Horse]], etc.)

As shown by [[Jonathan Garb]],&lt;ref&gt;(Shamanic Trance in Modern Kabbalah, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; trance techniques also played a role in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the mystical life of the circle of [[Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto]] and [[Hasidism]].

===Christian mystics===
Many [[Christian mystics]] are documented as having experiences that may be considered as cognate with trance, such as: [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[John of the Cross]], [[Meister Eckhart]], Saint Theresa (as seen in the Bernini sculpture) and [[Francis of Assisi]].

===Mesmer and the origin of hypnotherapy===
* [[Mesmer]], an influential but discredited promoter of trance states and their curative powers.
* [[Milton Erickson]], the founder of [[hypnotherapy]] who died in 1980, introduced trance and hypnosis to orthodox medicine and psychotherapy—hypnosis here is something different from traditional [[clinical hypnosis]].

===Trance in American Christianity===
[[Ann Taves|Taves]] (1999) charts the synonymic language of trance in the American Christian traditions: ''power'' or ''presence'' or ''indwelling'' of God, or Christ, or the Spirit, or spirits. Typical expressions include "the indwelling of the Spirit" ([[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]), "the witness of the Spirit" ([[John Wesley]]), "the power of God" (early American [[Methodists]]), being "filled with the Spirit of the Lord" (early [[Adventists]]; see [[charismatic Adventism]]), "communing with spirits" ([[Spiritualists]]), "the Christ within" ([[New Thought]]), "streams of holy fire and power" (Methodist [[Holiness movement|holiness]]), "a religion of the Spirit and Power" (the [[Emmanuel Movement]]), and "the baptism of the Holy Spirit" (early [[Pentecostal]]s). (Taves, 1999: 3)

===Trance and Anglo-American Protestants===
Taves (1999) well-referenced book on trance charts the experience of Anglo-American Protestants and those who left the Protestant movement beginning with the transatlantic awakening in the early 18th century and ending with the rise of the [[psychology of religion]] and the birth of [[Pentecostalism]] in the early 20th century. This book focuses on a class of seemingly involuntary acts alternately explained in [[religious]] and [[secular]] terminology. These involuntary experiences include uncontrolled bodily movements ([[Seizure|fits]], bodily exercises, falling as dead, [[catalepsy]], [[convulsions]]); spontaneous vocalizations (crying out, shouting, [[speaking in tongues]]); unusual sensory experiences (trances, [[hallucination|visions]], voices, [[clairvoyance]], [[out-of-body experiences]]); and alterations of [[consciousness]] and/or [[memory]] ([[dream]]s, [[wikt:somnium|somnium]], [[somnambulism]], mesmeric trance, mediumistic trance, [[hypnosis]], [[spirit possession|possession]], alternating personality) (Taves, 1999: 3).

==Trance induction and sensory modality==
Trance-like states are often interpreted as [[religious ecstasy]] or [[vision (religion)|visions]] and can be deliberately induced using a variety of techniques, including [[prayer]], [[religious ritual]]s, [[meditation]], [[pranayama]] ([[breathwork]] or breathing exercises), [[physical exercise]], [[coitus]] (and/or [[sex]]), [[music]], [[dancing]], [[sweating]] (e.g. [[sweat lodge]]), [[fasting]], [[thirst]]ing, and the consumption of [[psychotropic]] drugs such as [[spiritual use of cannabis|cannabis]]. [[Sensory modality]] is the [[Mediumship|channel]] or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for the induction of the trance. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place in occasion of contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely [[beauty|beautiful]] or [[holy]]. It may also happen without any known reason. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually one that is associated with that individual's particular [[religious]] and [[cultural]] [[traditions]]. As a result, an ecstatic experience is usually interpreted within the context of a particular individual's religious and cultural traditions. These interpretations often include statements about contact with [[supernatural]] or [[spiritual beings]], about receiving new information as a [[revelation]], also religion-related explanations of subsequent change of [[values]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behavior]] (e.g. in case of [[religious conversion]]).

Benevolent, neutral and malevolent trances may be induced (intentionally, spontaneously and/or accidentally) by different methods:
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] by [[chanting]], auditory [[story telling]], [[mantra]], [[overtone singing]], [[drum]]ming, [[music]], etc.;,
* [[Kinesthetic]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[feeling]] and movement through the [[Laban Movement Analysis|kinesphere]] by [[ecstatic dance]], [[story telling]] by movement, [[mudra]], embodying [[ritual]]s, [[yoga]], [[breathwork]], [[oxygen]] deprivation, sexual stimulation etc.;
* Visual: driving through the [[sense]] of [[Visual perception|sight]] by [[yantra]], visual [[story telling]], [[mandala]], [[film|cinema]], [[theater]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[beauty]], [[strobe lights]], [[form constants]], [[symmetry]];
* [[Olfactory]]: driving via [[scent]] through the [[sense]] of [[olfaction|smell]] by [[perfume]], [[pheromones]], [[incense]], [[flowers]], [[pollen]], indeed any scent for which we have an association or memory, etc.;
* [[Gustatory]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[taste]] and [[indigestion]]; including: [[starvation]], [[herbs]], [[hallucinogens]] and [[drugs]]. As the intake of food and beverage entails intra-bodily chemical reactions through [[digestion]], some infer that all food may be considered medicine or drugs and therefore contribute to the induction of discernible psycho-physical states (see [[Ancient Medicine]]). Trance states can be attained through the ingestion of [[psychoactive drugs]], particularly [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], such as [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[Peyote]], [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[MDMA]].
* Disciplines: [[Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]]; [[meditation]];
* Miscellaneously: [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] accident, [[sleep deprivation]], [[nitrogen narcosis]] (deep diving), [[fever]], by the use of a [[sensory deprivation]] tank or mind-control techniques, [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]];
* Naturally occurring: [[dreams]], [[lucid dreaming|lucid dreams]], [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], [[ecstasy (state)|ecstasy]], [[psychosis]] as well as purported [[premonitions]], [[out-of-body experience]]s, and [[Mediumship|channeling]].

===Auditory driving and auditory art===
[[Charles Tart]] provides a useful working definition of auditory driving. It is the induction of trance through the sense of hearing. Auditory driving works through a process known as [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The usage of repetitive [[rhythms]] to induce trance states is an ancient phenomenon. Throughout the [[world]], shamanistic practitioners have been employing this method for [[millennia]]. [[Anthropologists]] and other researchers have documented the similarity of shamanistic auditory driving [[rituals]] among different cultures.

Said simply, entrainment is the synchronization of different rhythmic cycles. Breathing and heart rate have been shown to be affected by auditory stimulus, along with brainwave activity. The ability of rhythmic sound to affect human brainwave activity, especially [[theta rhythm|theta brainwaves]], is the essence of auditory driving, and is the cause of the altered states of consciousness that it can induce.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Visual driving and visual art===

Nowack and Feltman have recently published an article entitled "Eliciting the Photic Driving Response" which states that the EEG photic driving response is a sensitive neurophysiological measure which has been employed to assess chemical and drug effects, forms of epilepsy, neurological status of Alzheimer's patients, and physiological arousal. Photic driving also impacts upon the psychological climate of a person by producing increased visual imagery and decreased physiological and subjective arousal. In this research by Nowack and Feltman, all participants reported increased visual imagery during photic driving, as measured by their responses to an imagery questionnaire.

Dennis Wier (https://web.archive.org/web/20060915232957/http://www.trance.edu/papers/theory.htm Accessed: 6 December 2006) states that over two millennia ago [[Ptolemy]] and [[Apuleius]] found that differing rates of flickering lights affected states of awareness and sometimes induced epilepsy. Wier also asserts that it was discovered in the late 1920s that when light was shined on closed eyelids it resulted in an echoing production of brainwave frequencies. Wier also opined that in 1965 Grey employed a [[stroboscope]] to project rhythmic light flashes into the eyes at a rate of 10–25&amp;nbsp;Hz (cycles per second). Grey discovered that this stimulated similar brainwave activity.

Research by [[Thomas Budzynski]], [[Oestrander]] et al., in the use of brain machines suggest that [[photic]] driving via the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] and direct electrical stimulation and driving via other mechanisms and modalities, may [[entrainment (physics)|entrain]] processes of the brain facilitating [[learning theory (education)|rapid and enhanced learning]], produce deep [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], an increase in [[creativity]], [[problem solving]] propensity and may be associated with enhanced concentration and accelerated learning. The [[theta rhythm|theta]] range and the border area between [[alpha wave|alpha]] and [[theta rhythm|theta]] has generated considerable research interest.

===Kinesthetic driving and somatic art===
[[Charles Tart]] provides a useful working definition of [[kinesthetic]] driving. It is the induction of trance through the [[sense]] of [[touch]], [[feeling]] or [[emotions]]. Kinesthetic driving works through a process known as [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]].

The [[rituals]] practiced by some [[sportsperson|athletes]] in preparing for contests are dismissed as [[superstition]], but this is a [[tool|device]] of [[sport psychologist]]s to help them to attain an ecstasy-like state. [[Joseph Campbell]] had a peak experience whilst [[running]]. [[Roger Bannister]] on breaking the four-minute mile (Cameron, 1993: 185): "No longer conscious of my movement, I discovered a new unity with nature. I had found a new source of power and beauty, a source I never dreamt existed." Roger Bannister later became a distinguished [[neurologist]].

Mechanisms and [[discipline]]s that include kinesthetic driving may include: [[dancing]], [[walking meditation]], [[yoga]] and [[asana]], [[mudra]], [[juggling]], [[poi (juggling)]], etc.

[[Sufism]] (the [[mystical]] branch of [[Islam]]) has [[theoretical]] and [[metaphoric]] [[writing|texts]] regarding [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] as a state of connection with [[Allah]]. [[Sufi]] practice [[rituals]] (''[[dhikr]]'', ''[[sema]]'') use body movement and music to achieve the state.

==Types and varieties==
* ''[[Maenads]]'' and ''[[Bacchae]]'': in [[Greek mythology]], ''Maenads'' were female [[worshipper]]s of [[Dionysus]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god of [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery]], [[wine]] and [[substance intoxication|intoxication]], and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. The word literally translates as "raving ones". They were known as wild, insane women who could not be reasoned with. The mysteries of Dionysus inspired the women to [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] frenzy; they indulged in copious amounts of violence, bloodletting, sexual activity, self-intoxication, and mutilation. They were usually pictured as crowned with [[vine]] leaves, clothed in [[deer|fawnskins]] and carrying the [[thyrsus]], and dancing with wild abandon. They were also characterized as entranced women, wandering through the forests and hills.&lt;ref&gt;Wiles, David (2000). ''Greek Theatre Performance: An Introduction''. Cambridge University Press. Source: [http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052164027X]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Maenads'' were also known as ''Bassarids'' (or ''Bacchae'' or ''Bacchantes'') in [[Roman mythology]], after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, Bacchus, to wear a [[fox]]-skin, a ''bassaris''.
* [[berserker|Norse berserkers]] were said to have often entered battle entrenched in a state of primal rage, biting their shields and howling like wolves. This fanaticism was so powerful that they were known to continue fighting even after having lost limbs or being otherwise deeply wounded.
* ''[[Samādhi]]'': [[yoga]] provides techniques to attain a state of [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] called ''samādhi''. According to practitioners, there are various stages of ecstasy, the highest of which is called ''[[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa samādhi]]''. Different traditions have different understanding of ''Samādhi''.
* ''[[Bhakti]]'': ([[Devanāgarī]]: भक्ति) is a word of Sanskrit origin meaning "devotion" and also "the path of devotion" itself, as in ''[[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti-yoga]]''. Within [[Hinduism]] the word is used exclusively to denote devotion to a particular [[deity]] or form of [[God]]. Within [[Vaishnavism]] ''bhakti'' is only used in conjunction with [[Vishnu]] or one of his associated [[incarnation]]s, it is likewise used towards [[Shiva]] by followers of [[Shaivism]]. Saints in these traditions exhibit different trance states or ecstasy.
* ''[[Agape]]'' or "Divine Love": the term ''agape'' appears in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' twice, where the word describes something that creates contentedness within the speaker.
* Communion: In the [[monotheistic]] [[tradition]], [[religious ecstasy]] is usually associated with communion and [[henosis|oneness]] with [[God]]. Indeed, ecstasy is the primary vehicle for the type of [[prophetic]] [[hallucination|visions]] and [[revelation]]s found in the [[Bible]]. However, such experiences can also be personal [[mystical]] experiences with no significance to anyone but the person experiencing them.
* [[Rapture]] or [[religious ecstasy]]: is an [[altered state of consciousness]] characterized by greatly reduced external [[awareness]] and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness which is frequently accompanied by [[hallucination|visions]] and emotional/intuitive (and sometimes physical) [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]]. Although the experience is usually brief in physical time, there are records of such experiences lasting several days or even more, and of recurring experiences of ecstasy during one's lifetime. [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] [[perception]] of [[time]], [[space]] and/or [[self (philosophy)|self]] may strongly change or disappear during ecstasy.
* [[Peak experiences]]: is a term developed by [[Abraham Maslow]] and used to describe certain extra-personal and [[ecstatic states]], particularly ones tinged with themes of unification, [[harmonization]] and [[Oneness (metaphysics)|interconnectedness]]. Participants characterize these experiences, and the revelations imparted therein, as possessing an ineffably [[mystical]] (or overtly [[religious]]) quality or essence.
* In [[Christianity]], the ecstatic experiences of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 10:10, 11:5 and 22:17.
* Some [[Charismatic movement|charismatic Christians]] practice ecstatic states (called, e.g., "being [[slain in the Spirit]]") and interpret these as given by the [[Holy Spirit]].
* In [[hagiography]] (writings on the subject of Christian [[saint]]s) many instances are recorded in which saints are granted ecstasies. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05277a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ecstasy|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; religious ecstasy (called ''supernatural ecstasy'') includes two elements: one, interior and invisible, in which the mind rivets its attention on a religious subject, and another, corporeal and visible, in which the activity of the senses is suspended, reducing the effect of external sensations upon the subject and rendering him or her resistant to awakening.
* Trance states have also long been used by [[shamans]], [[mysticism|mystics]], and [[fakirs]] in [[healing]] [[rituals]], being particularly cultivated in some [[religions]], such as [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Australian shamanism has been observed&lt;ref&gt;Lawlor (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;374) states that:
"The supernormal, super sensory powers of Aboriginal wise woman and men of high degree, by their own accounts, comes directly from initiations administered by the ancestral sky heroes themselves and by the totemic spirits. Those who have gone through these initiations alone, in a deep trance that makes them lose their personal identities and confront manifestations of the ancestral powers, are held in the highest regard."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawlor (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;303) states that: "One such animal dance ceremony was observed and photographed by Gillen and Spencer. More than 30 naked men gathered in a large circle. One by one, each man performed the dance of the animal to be hunted while the others sang and slapped their buttocks to create a percussive beat for the dancer. The slapping sound was so loud that it could be heard for miles across the surrounding desert. The dance continued for hours, with each man dancing frenetically until he dropped from exhaustion. The eyes of the onlookers soon became glazed with entrancement; their penises were erect in a state of ecstatic arousal. Finally, after the last man had performed the animal dance and collapsed in exhaustion, the entire group leaped on him, emitting a loud abandoned cry. The next day the hunt began."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination==
[[Divination]] is a cultural universal which [[anthropologists]] have observed as being present in many [[religions]] and [[cultures]] in all ages up to the present day (see [[sibyl]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Divination may be defined as a mechanism for [[fortune-telling]] by ascertaining information by interpretation of [[omens]] or an alleged supernatural agency. Divination often entails [[ritual]], and is often facilitated by trance.

===Nechung Oracle===
In [[Tibet]], [[oracle]]s have played, and continue to play, an important part in [[religion]] and [[government]]. The word ''oracle'' is used by Tibetans to refer to the [[spirit]], [[deity]] or [[entity]] that enters those men and women who act as [[mediumship|media]] between the natural and the spiritual realms. The media are, therefore, known as ''kuten'', which literally means, "the physical basis".

The [[Dalai Lama]], who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the ''[[Nechung Oracle]]'', which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet. He gives a complete description of the process of trance and possession in his book ''Freedom in Exile''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nechung_hh.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205234136/http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nechung_hh.html |archivedate=5 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific disciplines==
Convergent disciplines of [[neuroanthropology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[neurotheology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], amongst others, are conducting research into the trance induction of [[altered states of consciousness]] resulting from [[brainwave entrainment|neuron entrainment]] with the driving of sensory modalities, for example [[polyharmonics]], [[multiphonics]], and [[percussive]] [[polyrhythms]] through the channel of the auditory and [[kinesthetic]] [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]].

[[Neuroanthropology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] are conducting research into the trance induction of [[altered states of consciousness]] (possibly engendering [[higher consciousness]]) resulting from [[neuron]] firing [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]] with these [[polyharmonics]] and [[multiphonics]]. Related research has been conducted into neural entraining with [[percussive]] [[polyrhythms]]. The [[timbre]] of traditional singing bowls and their [[polyrhythms]] and [[multiphonics]] are considered meditative and calming, and the harmony inducing effects of this [[tool]] to potentially alter consciousness are being explored by scientists, medical professionals and therapists.

==Brainwaves and brain rhythms==

{{see also|Neural oscillation}}

Scientific advancement and new technologies such as computerized [[EEG]], [[positron emission tomography]], regional cerebral blood flow, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, are providing measurable tools to assist in understanding trance phenomena.

Though a source of contention, there appear to be three current streams of inquiry: [[neurophysiology]], [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive behaviorism]]. The [[neurophysiological]] approach is awaiting the development of a mechanism to map physiological measurements to human thought. The social-psychological approach currently measures gross subjective and social effects of thoughts and some critique it for lack of precision. Cognitive behaviorialists employ [[systems theory]] concepts and analytical techniques.

There are four principal brainwave states that range from high-amplitude, low-frequency delta to low-amplitude, high-frequency beta. These states range from deep dreamless sleep to a state of high arousal. These four brainwave states are common throughout humans. All levels of brainwaves exist in everyone at all times, even though one is foregrounded depending on the activity level. When a person is in an aroused state and exhibiting a beta brainwave pattern, their brain also exhibits a component of alpha, theta and delta, even though only a trace may be present.

The University of Philadelphia study on some Christians at the Freedom Valley Worship Center in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], revealed that [[glossolalia]]-speaking (vocalizing or praying in unrecognizable form of language which is seen in members of certain Christian sects) activates areas of the brain out of voluntary control. In addition, the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain, which monitors speech, significantly diminished in activity as the study participants spoke glossolalia. Dr. [[Andrew B. Newberg]], in analysis of his earlier studies as opposed to the [[MRI scans]] of the test subjects, stated that Buddhist monks in meditation and Franciscan nuns in prayer exhibited increased activity in the frontal lobe, and subsequently their behaviors, very much under voluntary control. The investigation found this particular beyond-body-control characteristic only in tongue-speakers (also see [[xenoglossia]]).

The '''Transnational Radical Party''' ('''TRP'''), whose official name is '''Nonviolent Radical Party, Transnational and Transparty''' ('''NRPTT'''), is a political association of citizens, members of parliament and members of government of various national and political backgrounds who intend to adopt [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] means to create an effective body of [[international law]] with respect for individuals, [[human rights|human]], [[civil and political rights]], as well as the affirmation of [[democracy]] and [[political freedom]] in the world.

The TRP does not participate in elections, and despite being named "party", is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), adept in building synergies among political forces aimed at achieving the goals of its congressional motions.

The TRP is the direct evolution of the Italian [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] (1955–89) and is separate from the once-connected [[Italian Radicals]] party (founded in 2001), has been an NGO at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) of the [[United Nations]] (UN) since 1995, listed in the general consultative status' category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/coordination/ngo/search/DisplayOrgInfo.asp?OrgID=655|title=1 June is the last day to apply for consultative status with ECOSOC|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRP often advocates the international use of [[Esperanto]] in its literature.&lt;ref name="eo"&gt;[http://en.nitobe.info/ld/dokumentujo/dokumento.php?id=30&amp;priskribolingvo=en The International Politics of Esperanto] at the Nitobe Center for Language Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|Pannella List|Bonino List|Italian Radicals}}

The TRP's forerunner, the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] (PR), was established in 1955 by a left-wing splinter group from the centre-right [[Italian Liberal Party]] (PLI). In 1989 the PR was transformed into the TRP. In 1992 a majority of the Radicals formed, at the national-level in Italian politics, the [[Pannella List]], as its most senior figure was [[Marco Pannella]]. Since 1999 the List ran in elections under the banner of [[Bonino List]], named after [[Emma Bonino]]. In 2001 the Radicals in Italy formed the [[Italian Radicals]] (RI).

===Background and foundation===
In the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (Italy)|first European Parliament election in 1979]] the PR obtained its best result ever countrywide (3.7% of the vote, resulting in the election of three [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s, including Pannella). Following the election, the PR was involved with the [[European Green Party|Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties]] (CEGRP) and its unsuccessful efforts to create a single pan-European platform for green and radical politics.&lt;ref name="Bomberg2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bomberg|title=Green Parties and Politics in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7WIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70|date=2 August 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-85145-4|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, since then, the party projected itself into international politics.

In 1988, after a decade during which transnational issues and values were emphasised, the PR's congress decided that the party would be transformed during 1989 into the TRP and that the latter would not present itself in elections (in order to avoid competition with the other parties and stimulate cooperation instead), while permitting "dual membership" with other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Un programma politico|author=Sergio Stanzani|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/un-programma-politico|journal=Notizie Radicali|issue=51|date=11 March 1988|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new symbol featuring the stylised face of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/il-simbolo-di-gandhi-fa-la-differenza|title=Il simbolo di Gandhi fa la differenza|author=Gianfranco Spadaccia|journal= Atti del convegno “I radicali e la nonviolenza: un metodo, una speranza”|location=Roma|date=29-30 April 1988|access-date=26 February 2016|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the point of no return in the transformation of the PR into an instrument of political fight completely at disposal of issue-oriented campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lettera aperta di Mauro Mellini al Primo segretario del Partito Radicale Sergio Stanzani|journal=Notizie Radicali|date=30 November 1988|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lettera-aperta-di-mauro-mellini-al-primo-segretario-del-partito-radicale-sergio-stanzani|issue=262|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Massimo Teodori|title=L'illusione transnazionale e transpartitica|journal=Marco Pannella — un eretico liberale nella crisi della repubblica|publisher=Casa editrice Marsilio|location=Venezia|date=1996|url=http://www.eclettico.org/cr/libri/teodori/diaspora.htm#_Toc490915674|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All this provoked great controversy among Radicals. Some long-time members left in order to continue their own activity in other parties or retire from public life. However, also most TRP Radicals continued to be actively engaged in politics, sometimes supported by the TRP itself, sometimes seeking hospitality in traditional parties or creating entirely new electoral lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/lorganizzazione-politica-dellantiproibizionismo|title=L'organizzazione politica dell'antiproibizionismo|date=1 July 1991|access-date=26 February 2016|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isimbolidelladiscordia.it/2016/05/in-memoria-di-marco-pannella-una-storia.html|title=In memoria di Marco Pannella: una storia, tanti simboli|date=19 May 2016|access-date=26 February 2017|author=Gabriele Maestri|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament election, 1989 (Italy)|1989 European Parliament election]] Pannella stood as a successful candidate of the joint list between the PLI (his former party) and the [[Italian Republican Party]], some Radicals formed the "Anti-prohibition List on Drugs" (1 MEP), while others joined the [[Rainbow Greens]] (2 MEPs). In the run-up of the [[Italian general election, 1992|1992 general election]] the Pannella List was formed.

[[Sergio Stanzani]] and [[Emma Bonino]] were the first secretary and president of the party, respectively. In 1993 Bonino, who would be appointed to the [[European Commission]] in 1995, replaced Stanzani, and Pannella became president.

===International activities and ECOSOC recognition===
The TRP was soon involved in comparing the conditions of the [[rule of law]] among different democracies throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN= 9788840400587|first=Massimo|last= Lensi|title=Oltre Chiasso|publisher=Nardini Editore|location= Firenze|year=2016|url=http://www.nardinieditore.it/prodotto/oltre-chiasso-il-mio-viaggio-con-marco-pannella-e-il-partito-radicale-transnazionale/|quote=The Transnational Radical Party is one of Marco Pannella's most interesting insights.

In 1995, after an intense institutional work, the TRP became a non-governmental organization for the promotion of human rights' legislation and the affirmation of democracy and freedom worldwide. As such, it was granted the general consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) of the [[United Nations]] (UN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Onu/riconoscimento ngo del partito radicale|author=Marino Busdachin|date=21 June 1995|journal= appunto di Marino Busdachin per la conferenza segreteria e per Marco Pannella|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/onu-riconoscimento-ngo-del-partito-radicale-0|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1995 [[Olivier Dupuis]], a long-time Radical from [[Belgium]] and founding member of the TRP who had moved to [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] in 1988 and from there had coordinated TRP's activities in Eastern Europe, was elected secretary of the party, while [[Jean-François Hory]], a [[France|French]] MEP of the [[Radical Party of the Left]] within the TRP-sponsored [[European Radical Alliance]] group, was president. In 1996 Dupuis took Pannella's seat in the European Parliament.

Within the UN, the party has carried out high-profile battles on several issues: the [[United Nations moratorium on the death penalty|moratorium on the death penalty]] and the proposal of his complete abolition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La pena di morte a fronte del diritto internazionale vigente.|author=Caterina Caravaggi|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/la-pena-di-morte-a-fronte-del-diritto-internazionale-vigente|date= 25 October 1991 |access-date=26 February 2016|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-prohibition against global mafias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Droga: Il Partito radicale e l'iniziativa contro il traffico clandestino delle droghe|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/droga-il-partito-radicale-e-liniziativa-contro-il-traffico-clandestino-delle-droghe|author=Stanzani Sergio|date=1 February 1989|journal=“I costi del proibizionismo sulle droghe” - Atti del colloquio internazionale sull’antiproibizionismo, Bruxelles 28 September - 1 October 1988|publisher=Ed.

==="Italian plague", decline and internal crisis===
Despite its successes worldwide, the TRP and its initiaves mostly failed to find space on the local press in Italy, which has often focused merely on the internal conflicts within the Radical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luca Gelmini|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2006/10_Ottobre/31/radicali.shtml|title=Radicali, scontro Pannella-Capezzone|journal=Corriere della Sera|date=1 November 2006|access-date=20 March 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formiche.net/2013/10/29/pannella-staderini-ecco-quanto-si-amano-si-odiano-i-radicali-italiani/|title=Pannella e Staderini, quanto si amano (e si odiano) i Radicali italiani|author=Paolo Falliro|date=2013-10-29|access-date=2017-03-20|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/Pannella-caccia-la-Bonino-lei-replica-Siete-scemi-38bd6015-d105-4a47-b58d-2cc150dc6b14.html|title=Pannella caccia la Bonino, lei replica: "Siete scemi?"|access-date=5 December 2017|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inadequate information on Radical initiatives by the Italian media has been meticulously verified by the TRP-sponsored ''Centro d'Ascolto dell'Informazione Radiotelevisiva''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrodiascolto.it/content/la-storia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621073456/http://www.centrodiascolto.it/content/la-storia|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 June 2008|title=Centro d’Ascolto dell’Informazione Radiotelevisiva|quote=|access-date=20 March 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced several sentences featuring compensations to be paid by [[RAI]], the Italian public broadcaster, and commercial TV as well. Some confusion came from the fact that since the 2000s, rather than highlighting its expansion abroad, the TRP has preferred to focus on the "Case Italy", emblematic of the decadence of a constitutional political system into a "real democracy", that is to say a formal democracy in which its very institutions substantially act in contrast with the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/il-caso-italia-1-introduzione-lo-stato-della-giustizia-in-europa-i-convegno|title=IL CASO ITALIA: (1) Introduzione - LO STATO DELLA GIUSTIZIA IN EUROPA - I· CONVEGNO|access-date=2017-03-20|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marco Pannella|date=10 October 1989|title=Diritti democratici nella "Democrazia reale"|journal=IL GIORNALE D’ITALIA|access-date=20 March 2017|quote=|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/diritti-democratici-nella-democrazia-reale|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the TRP, Italy has become a "[[Particracy|partycratic]] regime" and, as such, has started to spread the "plague" of "real democracy" around the democratic world. That was denounced by Radicals within international organisations and though the publication of a "yellow book" on the "Italian plague".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gruppo di Iniziativa di Satyagraha 2009 per lo Stato di diritto e la Democrazia cancellati in Italia|title=La Peste Italiana|url=http://www.radicali.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/peste_italiana.pdf|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the TRP effectively suffered internal problems too. In 2003 Dupuis resigned from secretary because of serious political differences with Pannella. In 2011–14 [[Demba Traoré (politician)|Demba Traoré]], a politician from [[Mali]], served briefly as secretary: he left the party without officially resigning, after being returned to the government of his own country. The TRP was later provisionally run by a committee, known as the "Senate" (''Senato''), led by Pannella and composed of the party's leading members.

===Re-organisation and split of the Italian Radicals===
After the death of Pannella in May 2016, an extraordinary congress was convened in September to overcome the long inactivity due to the absence of the secretary, as well as the economic problems undermining the party's viability. The congress adopted with 178 votes in favour, 79 against and 13 abstentions on the final resolution:
*set three main goals (1. affirmation of the rule of law and the human right of knowledge; 2. justice reform in Italy, including pardon, amnesty, abolition of the [[article 41-bis prison regime]] and of life sentences; 3. formation of the [[United States of Europe]], inspired on the [[Ventotene Manifesto]]);
*set a membership target of 3,000 members for 2017 and 2018 in order to pay for the party's debts, otherwise the TRP would be dissolved;
*suspended the party's organs (president, secretary, treasurer, senate, etc.), with the exception of the congress;
*elected a collective leadership led by [[Rita Bernardini]], [[Antonella Casu]], [[Sergio D'Elia]] and [[Maurizio Turco]] (legal representative).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/mozione-generale-del-40esimo-congresso-straordinario-del-partito-radicale-nonviolento-transn|title=MOZIONE GENERALE DEL 40ESIMO CONGRESSO STRAORDINARIO DEL PARTITO RADICALE NONVIOLENTO, TRANSNAZIONALE E TRANSPARTITO|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/i-furbetti-del-partitino-consulenza-i-compagni-espulsi-o-di-espulsione|title=I furbetti del partitino (consulenza per i compagni espulsi o in via di espulsione)|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vigilance committee''' was a group formed of private citizens to administer law and order where they considered governmental structures to be inadequate. The term is commonly associated with the frontier areas of the [[American Old West|American West]] in the mid-19th century, where groups attacked cattle rustlers and gangs, and people at [[gold mining]] claims.  As non-state organizations no functioning checks existed to protect against excessive force or safeguard due process from the committees.  In the years prior to the Civil War, some committees worked to free slaves and transport them to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/blackhistorymonth/19990222arthur.asp |title=Arthursville abolitionists ran Underground Railroad through Pittsburgh |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the West==

In the [[western United States]], both before and after the Civil War, the primary purpose of these committees was to maintain law and order and administer [[Extrajudicial punishment|summary justice]] where governmental law enforcement was inadequate. In the newly settled areas, vigilance committees provided security, and mediated land disputes. In ranching areas, they ruled on ranch boundaries, registered brands, and protected cattle and horses. In the mining districts,  they protected claims,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} settled claim disputes, and attempted to protect miners and other residents. In [[California]], some residents formed vigilance committees to take control from officials whom they considered to be corrupt. This took place during the trial of Charles Cora (Husband of [[Belle Cora (Arabella Ryan)|Belle Cora]]) and James Casey in [[San Francisco]] during 1856.&lt;ref&gt;"Eyewitness: San Francisco Committee of Vigilance - 1856." Accessed February 26, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist6/woolley.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disbandment ==
Vigilance committees were generally abandoned when the conditions favoring their creation ceased to exist. In the west, as governmental jurisdiction increased to the degree that courts could dispense justice, residents abandoned the committees.

== Nature ==
Vigilance committees, by their nature, lacked an outside set of ''[[checks and balances]]'', leaving them open for excesses and abuse.

In the West, the speed of the vigilance committees and lack of safeguards sometimes led to the innocent being hanged or to their just disappearing. A few committees were taken over by fraudulent individuals seeking profit or political office.

== United States Vigilance Committees ==
&lt;!--This list needs work. It needs expanding as well as paring. Not all of the several hundred vigilance committees that existed in the 19th century were of historic significance. Some lasted no more than a few days and others accomplished nothing of note. Some were not peaceful committees concerned with eliminating crime, but had malevolent political or racial motives.--&gt;

* An Oxford Vigilance Committee was formed during [[World War I]] in [[Oxford]], UK, a town whose own men of military age had gone to war, and where soldiers were stationed. The Committee ran volunteer patrols of women to discourage, observe, and report on what was perceived as "immoral" behaviour of the town's women. In November 1916, the Committee issued a report "on the Moral Condition of Oxford," warning that the town's streets were "crowded with young girls, whose dress [and] behaviour show that they are deliberately laying themselves out to attract men." Their reports included detailed accounts of casual or adulterous sexual liaisons in the town. Births out of wedlock in Oxford decreased from 1914 to 1920, but the Committee attributed the reduction to "forced marriages" and [[abortion]]s.&lt;ref name="Graham2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Graham|title=Oxford in the Great War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv5sBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|date=30 November 2014|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78346-297-1|pages=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Ride in the Whirlwind" (1966) is a movie directed by Monte Hellman, written by Jack Nicholson, that tells the story of innocent men, who are thought to be part of a gang, on the run from members of a vigilance committee.

== Other uses of the term ==
* Vigilance Committee is also a term used by some interest groups who monitor the actions of others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1964">'''Well-founded phenomena''' ({{lang-la|phenomena bene fundata}}), in the [[philosophy]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], are ways in which the world falsely appears to us, but which are grounded in the way the world is (as opposed to [[dream]]s or [[hallucination]]s, which are false appearances that are not thus grounded).

For Leibniz, the universe is made up of an infinite number of simple [[Substance theory|substance]]s or [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s, each of which contains a representation of the entire universe (past, present, and future), and which are all causally isolated from one another ("Monads have no windows through which anything could enter or depart."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, "The Monadology" (1714), §7.&lt;/ref&gt;)  For the most part the monads' perceptions are more or less confused and obscure, but some of them correspond either to the ways in which other monads are related or to the ways that the representation is genuinely ordered; these are the well-founded phenomena.

In the world of ordinary experience we might call a [[rainbow]] a well-ordered phenomenon; it appears to us to be a coloured arch in the sky, though there is in fact no arch there.  We are not suffering from hallucinations, though, for the appearance is grounded in the way the world is ordered&amp;nbsp;– in the behaviour of light, dust motes, water particles, etc.

For Leibniz, there are two main categories of well-founded phenomena: the ordinary world of individual objects and their interactions, and more abstract phenomena such as [[space]], [[time]], and [[causality]]. This is also found in his expression of [[pre-established harmony]] being the basis of causation.

[[File:Wood plastic composite.JPG|right|thumb|Wood plastic composite]]
'''Wood-plastic composites''' (WPCs) are [[composite material]]s made of [[Wood fibre|wood fiber]]/[[wood flour]] and thermoplastic(s) (includes [[Polythene|PE]], [[polypropylene|PP]], [[PVC]], [[Polylactic acid|PLA]] etc.).

In addition to wood fiber and plastic, WPCs can also contain other ligno-cellulosic and/or inorganic filler materials. WPCs are a subset of a larger category of materials called natural fiber plastic composites (NFPCs), which may contain no [[cellulose]]-based fiber fillers such as pulp fibers, [[peanut]] hulls, [[bamboo]], [[straw]], [[digestate]], etc.

Chemical additives seem practically "invisible" (except mineral fillers and pigments, if added) in the composite structure. They provide for integration of polymer and wood flour (powder) while facilitating optimal processing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpc-composite-decking.blogspot.com/p/what-is-wood-plastic-composite-wpc.html|title=WPC machines &amp; equipment. WPC pellets and additives. Composite decking lumber.|work=wpc-composite-decking.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, people in the flooring industry starts referring to '''WPC''' as a type of floor that has a basic structure of top vinyl veneer plus a rigid extruded core (the core can be made without any wood fiber). WPC is now an established product category within LVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruise|first1=Mallory|title=WPC gains ground at Domotex Hannover 2016|url=http://www.dgmfloors.com/new_detail/nid/2992.html|accessdate=30 April 2016|agency=Floor Covering Weekly|issue=FCW Global February 2016|publisher=Floor Covering Weekly|date=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of WPC is different than the WPC decking and is not intended for outdoor usage.

== Uses ==
Wood-plastic composites are still new materials relative to the long history of natural lumber as a building material.

== Production ==
Wood-plastic composites (WPCs) are produced by thoroughly mixing ground wood particles and heated [[thermoplastic]] resin. The most common method of production is to extrude the material into the desired shape, though [[injection molding]] is also used. WPCs may be produced from either virgin or recycled thermoplastics including [[high-density polyethylene|HDPE]], [[low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[Polystyrene|PS]], and [[Polylactic acid|PLA]]. Polyethylene-based WPCs are by far the most common. Additives such as [[plastic colorant|colorants]], [[coupling agent]]s, [[UV stabilizer]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, [[foaming agent]]s, and [[lubricant]]s help tailor the end product to the target area of application. Extruded WPCs are formed into both solid and hollow profiles. A large variety of injection molded parts are also produced, from automotive door panels to cell phone covers.

In some manufacturing facilities, the constituents are combined and processed in a pelletizing extruder, which produces pellets of the new material. The pellets are then re-melted and formed into the final shape. Other manufacturers complete the finished part in a single step of mixing and extrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktron.com/industries_served/plastics/woodplastic.cfm|title=Wood-Plastic Composites production requires high formulation quality the feeding system|work=ktron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the addition of organic material, WPCs are usually processed at far lower temperatures than traditional plastics during extrusion and injection molding. WPCs tend to process at temperatures of about 50&amp;nbsp;°F (28&amp;nbsp;°C) lower than the same, unfilled material, for instance. Most will begin to burn at temperatures around 400&amp;nbsp;°F (204&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.greendotpure.com/materials/wood-composites/|title = Wood Plastic Composites – Green Dot|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing WPCs at excessively high temperatures increases the risk of shearing, or burning and discoloration resulting from pushing a material that’s too hot through a gate which is too small, during injection molding. The ratio of wood to plastic in the composite will ultimately determine the melt flow index (MFI) of the WPC, with larger amounts of wood generally leading to a lower MFI.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
[[File:Trex Transcend Decking and Railing stairs.png|thumb|right|[[Trex Company, Inc.|Trex Composite Decking]]]]
WPCs do not corrode and are highly resistant to rot, decay, and [[Gribble|Marine Borer]] attack, though they do absorb water into the wood fibers embedded within the material.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, N. (2001) “Influence of Moisture Absorption on Mechanical Properties of Wood Flour-Polypropylene Composites.” '' Journal of Thermoplastic Composite Materials'' 14&lt;/ref&gt; Water absorption is more pronounced in WFCs with a hydrophilic matrix such as PLA and also leads to decreased mechanical stiffness and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joffre|first=Thomas|last2=Segerholm|first2=Kristoffer|last3=Persson|first3=Cecilia|last4=Bardage|first4=Stig L.|last5=Luengo Hendriks|first5=Cris L.|last6=Isaksson|first6=Per|date=2017-01|title=Characterization of interfacial stress transfer ability in acetylation-treated wood fibre composites using X-ray microtomography|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.10.009|journal=Industrial Crops and Products|volume=95|pages=43–49|doi=10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.10.009|issn=0926-6690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical performance in a wet environment can be enhanced by an acetylation treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsson|first=P.|last2=Simonson|first2=R.|date=1994-04-01|title=A study of strength, hardness and deformation of acetylated Scandinavian softwoods|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02615470|journal=Holz als Roh- und Werkstoff|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=83–86|doi=10.1007/BF02615470|issn=0018-3768}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFCs have good workability and can be shaped using conventional woodworking tools. WPCs are often considered a sustainable material because they can be made using [[recycled plastic]]s and the waste products of the [[wood industry]]. Although these materials continue the lifespan of used and discarded materials, they have their own considerable half life; the polymers and adhesives added make wood-plastic composite difficult to recycle again after use.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Scott (2008). “Synthetic Decking” [http://www.remodeling.hw.net/remodeling/synthetic-decking.aspx]. Remodeling Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; They can however be recycled easily in a new wood-plastic composite, much like concrete. One advantage over wood is the ability of the material to be molded to meet almost any desired shape. A WPC member can be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves. Another major selling point of these materials is their lack of need for paint. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, but are widely available in grays and earth tones. Despite up to 70 percent cellulose content (although 50/50 is more common), the mechanical behavior of WPCs is most similar to neat polymers. Neat polymers are polymerized without added solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are Ultra Polymers? |publisher=Solvay |date=2014

(2011) '' Modeling the Time-dependent Flexural Response of Wood-plastic Composite Materials '' Dissertation, University of Wisconsin–Madison&lt;/ref&gt; The wood particles are susceptible to fungal attack, though not as much so as solid wood, and the polymer component is vulnerable to UV degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, J et al.(2006) “Durability of wood-plastic composites.” ''Wood Design Focus'' 16(3)&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the strength and stiffness may be reduced by freeze-thaw cycling, though testing is still being conducted in this area. Some WPC formulations are sensitive to staining from a variety of agents.

== WPC sandwich boards ==
WPC boards show good set of performance but monolithic composite sheets are relatively heavy (most often heavier than pure plastics) which limits their use to applications where low weight is not essential. WPC in a [[sandwich-structured composite]] form allow for combination of the benefits of traditional wood polymer composites with the lightness of a sandwich panel technology. WPC sandwich boards consist of wood polymer composite skins and usually low density polymer core which leads to a very effective increase of panel's rigidity. WPC sandwich boards are used mainly in automotive, transportation and building applications, but furniture applications are also being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renolit.com/composites/en/products/automotive/honeycomb-structure/|title=WPC honeycomb panels|publisher=Renolit.com |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; New efficient and often in-line integrated production processes allow to produce stronger and stiffer WPC sandwich boards at lower costs compared to traditional plastic sheets or monolithic WPC panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econcore.com/en/technology/thermhex|title=Sandwich Panel Technology |publisher=EconCore.com |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Environmental impact===
The [[environmental impact]] of WPCs is directly affected by the ratio of renewable to [[non-renewable]] materials. The commonly used [[petroleum]]-based polymers have a negative environmental impact because they rely on non-renewable raw materials and the non-[[biodegradability]] of plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=A. Kutnar and S.S. Muthu|title=Environmental Impacts of Traditional and Innovative Forest-based Bioproducts, Environmental Footprints and Eco-design of Products and Processes|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-0655-5_2|chapter=Wood-Plastic Composites—Performance and Environmental Impacts|url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789811006531-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1554323-p179867938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire hazards ===
The types of plastic normally used in WPC formulations have higher [[fire hazard]] properties than wood alone, as plastic has a higher chemical [[heat content]] and can melt. The inclusion of plastic as a portion of the composite results in the potential for higher fire hazards in WPCs as compared with wood. Some code officials are becoming increasingly concerned with the fire performance of WPCs.&lt;ref&gt;http://wpcinfo.org/techinfo/Fire_Studies.html Washington State University Wood Plastic Composites Information Center, "Fire Issues in Engineered Wood Composites for Naval Waterfront Facilities", 46th International SAMPE Symposium and Exhibition, Long Beach, California, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enn.com/business/article/24261 Environmental News Network, "California Fire Codes Put Focus on Plastic Decking Concerns" 5 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zermelo set theory''' (sometimes denoted by '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;'''-'''&lt;/sup&gt;), as set out in an important paper in 1908 by [[Ernst Zermelo]], is the ancestor of modern [[set theory]].  It bears certain differences from its descendants, which are not always understood, and are frequently misquoted.  This article sets out the original axioms, with the original text (translated into English) and original numbering.

== The axioms of Zermelo set theory ==

Zermelo's axioms are stated for a model some (but not necessarily all) of whose objects are called sets, and the remaining objects are [[urelements]] and do not contain any elements. Zermelo's  language implicitly includes a membership relation ∈, an equality relation = (if it is not included in the underlying logic), and a unary predicate saying whether an object is a set. Later versions of set theory often assume that all objects are sets so there are no urelements and there is no need for the unary predicate.

: AXIOM I. [[Axiom of extensionality]] (''Axiom der Bestimmtheit'') "If every element of a set ''M'' is also an element of ''N'' and vice versa ... then ''M'' &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; ''N''.  Briefly, every set is determined by its elements."
: AXIOM II. Axiom of elementary sets (''Axiom der Elementarmengen'') "There exists a set, the null set, ∅, that contains no element at all. If ''a'' is any object of the domain, there exists a set {''a''} containing ''a'' and only ''a'' as an element.  If ''a'' and ''b'' are any two objects of the domain, there always exists a set {''a'', ''b''} containing as elements ''a'' and ''b'' but no object ''x'' distinct from them both."  See [[Axiom of pairing|Axiom of pairs]].
: AXIOM III. [[Axiom of separation]] (''Axiom der Aussonderung'') "Whenever the [[propositional function]] &amp;ndash;(''x'') is definite for all elements of a set ''M'', ''M'' possesses a subset ''M'&amp;nbsp;'' containing as elements precisely those elements ''x'' of ''M'' for which &amp;ndash;(''x'') is true."
: AXIOM IV.  [[Axiom of power set|Axiom of the power set]] (''Axiom der Potenzmenge'') "To every set ''T'' there corresponds a set ''T'&amp;nbsp;'', the [[power set]] of ''T'', that contains as elements precisely all subsets of ''T''&amp;nbsp;."
: AXIOM V. [[Axiom of union|Axiom of the union]] (''Axiom der Vereinigung'') "To every set ''T'' there corresponds a set ''∪T'', the union of ''T'', that contains as elements precisely all elements of the elements of ''T''&amp;nbsp;."
: AXIOM VI. [[Axiom of choice]] (''Axiom der Auswahl'') "If ''T'' is a set whose elements all are sets that are different from ∅ and mutually disjoint, its union ''∪T'' includes at least one subset ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; having one and only one element in common with each element of ''T''&amp;nbsp;."
: AXIOM VII.  [[Axiom of infinity]] (''Axiom des Unendlichen'') "There exists in the domain at least one set ''Z'' that contains the null set as an element and is so constituted that to each of its elements ''a'' there corresponds a further element of the form {''a''}, in other words, that with each of its elements ''a'' it also contains the corresponding set {''a''} as element."

== Connection with standard set theory ==

The most widely used and accepted set theory is known as ZFC, which consists of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the addition of the [[axiom of choice]].  The links show where the axioms of Zermelo's theory correspond.  There is no exact match for "elementary sets".  (It was later shown that the singleton set could be derived from what is now called "Axiom of pairs".  If ''a'' exists, ''a'' and ''a'' exist, thus {''a'',''a''} exists.  By extensionality {''a'',''a''} = {''a''}.)  The empty set axiom is already assumed by axiom of infinity, and is now included as part of it.

Zermelo set theory does not include the axioms of [[axiom of replacement|replacement]] and [[axiom of regularity|regularity]]. The axiom of replacement was first published in 1922 by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]], who had independently discovered that Zermelo's axioms cannot prove the existence of the set {''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...} where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of [[natural number]]s and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[power set]] of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. They both realized that the axiom of replacement is needed to prove this. The following year, [[John von Neumann]] pointed out that this axiom is necessary to build [[von Neumann ordinal|his theory of ordinals]]. The axiom of regularity was stated by von Neumann in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreirós 2007, pp. 369, 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern ZFC system, the "propositional function" referred to in the axiom of separation is interpreted as "any property definable by a first order formula with parameters", so the separation axiom is replaced by an axiom scheme.   The notion of "first order formula" was not known in 1904 when Zermelo published his axiom system, and he later rejected this interpretation as being too restrictive. Zermelo set theory is usually taken to be a first-order theory with the separation axiom replaced by an axiom scheme with an axiom for each first-order formula. It can also be considered as a theory in [[second-order logic]], where now the separation axiom is just a single axiom. The second-order interpretation of Zermelo set theory is probably closer to Zermelo's own conception of it, and is stronger than the first-order interpretation.

In the usual [[Von Neumann universe|cumulative hierarchy]] ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; of ZFC set theory (for ordinals α), any one of the sets
''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; for α a limit ordinal larger than the first infinite ordinal ω (such as ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&amp;middot;2&lt;/sub&gt;) forms a model of Zermelo set theory. So the consistency of Zermelo set theory is a theorem of ZFC set theory. Zermelo's axioms do not imply the existence of &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt; or larger infinite cardinals, as the model ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&amp;middot;2&lt;/sub&gt;  does not contain such cardinals. (Cardinals have to be defined differently in Zermelo set theory, as the usual definition of cardinals and ordinals does not work very well: with the usual definition it is not even possible to prove the existence of the ordinal &amp;omega;2.)

The [[axiom of infinity]] is usually now modified to assert the existence of the first infinite
von Neumann [[ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;;  the original Zermelo
axioms cannot prove the existence of this set, nor can the modified Zermelo axioms prove Zermelo's
axiom of infinity.  Zermelo's axioms (original or modified) cannot prove the existence of &lt;math&gt;V_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; as a set nor of any rank of the cumulative hierarchy of sets with infinite index.

Zermelo allowed for the existence of [[urelements]] that are not sets and contain no elements; these are now usually omitted from set theories.

==Mac Lane set theory==

Mac Lane set theory, introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Mac Lane|year=1986|authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane}}, is Zermelo set theory with the axiom of separation restricted to first-order formulas in which every quantifier is bounded,
Mac Lane set theory is similar in strength to [[topos theory]] with a [[natural number object]], or to the system in [[Principia mathematica]]. It is strong enough to carry out almost all ordinary mathematics not directly connected with set theory or logic.

== The aim of Zermelo's paper ==
The introduction states that the very existence of the discipline of set theory "seems to be threatened by certain contradictions or "antinomies", that can be derived from its principles &amp;ndash; principles necessarily governing  our thinking, it seems &amp;ndash; and to which no entirely satisfactory solution has yet been found".  Zermelo is of course referring to the "[[Russell's paradox|Russell antinomy]]".

He says he wants to show how the original theory of [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Richard Dedekind]] can be reduced to a few definitions and seven principles or axioms.  He says he has ''not'' been able to prove that the axioms are consistent.

A non-constructivist argument for their consistency goes as follows. Define ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; for &amp;alpha; one of the [[Ordinal number|ordinals]] 0, 1, 2, ...,&amp;omega;, &amp;omega;+1, &amp;omega;+2,..., &amp;omega;·2 as follows:
* V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the empty set.
* For &amp;alpha; a successor of the form &amp;beta;+1, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the collection of all subsets of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;/sub&gt;.
* For &amp;alpha; a limit (e.g. &amp;omega;, &amp;omega;·2) then ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the union of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;/sub&gt; for &amp;beta;&lt;&amp;alpha;.
Then the axioms of Zermelo set theory are consistent because they are true in the model ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;·2&lt;/sub&gt;. While a non-constructivist might regard this as a valid argument, a constructivist would probably not: while there are no problems with the construction of the sets up to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt;, the construction of  ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;+1&lt;/sub&gt; is less clear because one cannot constructively define every subset of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt;. This argument can be turned into a valid proof in Zermelo–Frenkel set theory, but this does not really help because the consistency of Zermelo–Frenkel set theory is less clear than the consistency of Zermelo set theory.

== The axiom of separation ==
Zermelo comments that Axiom III of his system is the one responsible for eliminating the antinomies.  It differs from the original definition by Cantor, as follows.

Sets cannot be independently defined by any arbitrary logically definable notion.  They must be constructed in some way from previously constructed sets. For example, they can be constructed by taking powersets, or they can be ''separated'' as subsets of sets already "given".  This, he says, eliminates contradictory ideas like "the set of all sets" or "the set of all ordinal numbers".

He disposes of the [[Russell paradox]] by means of this Theorem:  "Every set &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; possesses at least one subset &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; that is not an element of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; ".  Let &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; be the subset of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for which, by AXIOM III, is separated out by the notion "&lt;math&gt;x \notin x&lt;/math&gt;".  Then &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; cannot be in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  For

# If &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; contains an element ''x'' for which ''x'' is in ''x'' (i.e. &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; itself), which would contradict the definition of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is not in &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;, and assuming &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is an element of ''M'', then &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is an element of ''M'' that satisfies the definition "&lt;math&gt;x \notin x&lt;/math&gt;", and so is in &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the assumption that &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is wrong, proving the theorem.  Hence not all objects of the universal domain ''B'' can be elements of one and the same set.  "This disposes of the Russell [[antinomy]] as far as we are concerned".

This left the problem of "the domain ''B''" which seems to refer to something.  This led to the idea of a [[proper class]].

== Cantor's theorem ==
Zermelo's paper is notable for what may be the first mention of [[Cantor's theorem]] explicitly and by name.  This appeals strictly to set theoretical notions, and is thus not exactly the same as Cantor's [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]].

Cantor's theorem: "If ''M'' is an arbitrary set, then always ''M'' &lt; P(''M'') [the power set of ''M''].  Every set is of lower cardinality than the set of its subsets".

Zermelo proves this by considering a function φ: ''M'' → P(''M'').  By Axiom III this defines the following set ''M'&amp;nbsp;'':

:''M'&amp;nbsp;''  =  {''m'':  ''m'' ∉ φ(''m'')}.

But no element ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' of ''M&amp;nbsp;'' could correspond to ''M'&amp;nbsp;'', i.e. such that φ(''m'&amp;nbsp;'') = ''M'&amp;nbsp;''.  Otherwise we can construct a contradiction:

:1) If ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' is in ''M'&amp;nbsp;'' then by definition ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' ∉ φ(''m'&amp;nbsp;'') = ''M'&amp;nbsp;'', which is the first part of the contradiction

:2) If ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' is not in ''M'&amp;nbsp;'' but in ''M&amp;nbsp;'' then by definition ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' ∉ ''M'&amp;nbsp;'' = φ(''m'&amp;nbsp;'') which by definition implies that ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' is in ''M'&amp;nbsp;'', which is the second part of the contradiction.

so by contradiction ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' does not exist. Note the close resemblance of this proof to the way Zermelo disposes of Russell's paradox.
