      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2922">The '''1980 Entumbane clashes''', also known as '''Entumbane I''', occurred in and around [[Bulawayo]], [[Zimbabwe]] between 9 and 10 November 1980, amid political tensions in the months immediately following Zimbabwean independence.{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=383–384}}

Fighting broke out in the city's western suburb of Entumbane between groups of guerrillas from the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) and others from the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), days after the two factions were put into coterminous assembly camps there to await integration into the new [[Zimbabwe National Army]].{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=383–384}} A four-hour firefight, precipitated by a speech by government minister [[Enos Nkala]] threatening that ZANLA would ultimately destroy ZIPRA,{{sfn|Hill|2007|p=76}} ended when the largely [[White people in Zimbabwe|white-led]] [[BSAP Support Unit]], numbering over 280 men from Echo Troop, Juliet Troop, Hotel Troop, Charlie Troop and Lima Troop, intervened on behalf of the government.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} (The [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] at that time were confined to barracks due to disagreements about integration into the new Zimbabwean National Army. They were officially on "reaction standby".){{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Officers from both guerrilla forces then called for a ceasefire.

Official government figures counted 58 dead (15 combatants and 43 civilians) and over 500 wounded, but eyewitness accounts describe a death toll running into the hundreds.{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=383–384}} The conflict was followed four months later by the larger [[1981 Entumbane Uprising]], also known as Entumbane II, which nearly developed into a new civil war.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|p=77}}

The year '''555 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 199 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''. The denomination 555 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{2020 Summer Olympics}}
There were a total of six bids which were initially submitted for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]]. [[Tokyo]] was ultimately elected as the host city at the [[125th IOC Session]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], on 7 September 2013.

==Bidding process==
The Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city's application to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) by its [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session. The process is governed by the [[Olympic Charter]], as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.&lt;ref name="Charter"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf | title = Olympic Charter | publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2008-06-04 | date = 1 September 2004 | format = PDF | isbn = 92-9149-001-6 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080609022618/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf| archivedate= 9 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, the process has consisted of two phases. During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the "applicant cities" are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organization. This information allows the IOC to analyze the cities' hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as "candidate cities") are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file.&lt;ref name="CityElectionProc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/cities_uk.asp | title = Host City Election Procedure | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619122311/http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/cities_uk.asp| archivedate= 19 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of [[List of international sport federations|international sport federations]], NOCs, athletes, the [[International Paralympic Committee]], and international experts in various fields.&lt;ref name="EvalCommis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/commission_uk.asp | title = Role and composition of the Evaluation Commission | work = 117th IOC Session | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080613200643/http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/commission_uk.asp| archivedate= 13 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is chaired by Sir [[Craig Reedie]]. The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of the themes covered in the candidature file. The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session.&lt;ref name="CityElectionProc"/&gt;

The IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics.&lt;ref name="CityElectionProc"/&gt; The election is made by the assembled active IOC members (excluding honorary and honor members), each possessing one vote. Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running. The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an [[absolute majority]] of votes; if this does not happen in the first round, the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a special runoff vote is carried out, with the winner proceeding to the next round. After each round, the eliminated bid is announced.&lt;ref name="ElectionProc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/utilities/faq_detail_uk.asp?rdo_cat=24_55_0 | title = FAQ – Election of an Olympic Games Host City – Host city election | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080717043751/http://www.olympic.org/uk/utilities/faq_detail_uk.asp?rdo_cat=24_55_0| archivedate= 17 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SingElectionProc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/election_uk.asp | title = Election procedure | work = 117th IOC Session | publisher = International Olympic Committee | accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080601234735/http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/election_uk.asp| archivedate= 1 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement of the host city, the successful bid delegation signs the "Host City Contract" with the IOC, which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC.&lt;ref name="HostCityContract"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/ocog/index_uk.asp | title = The Organizing Committees of the Olympic Games | work = The Movement | publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2008-06-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080606065920/http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/ocog/index_uk.asp| archivedate= 6 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bidding timeline===

The timeline of the host city selection process was approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) executive board as follows:&lt;ref name="olympic.org"&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/content/press-release/six-applicant-cities-for-the-2020-olympic-games/ Six Applicant Cities for the 2020 Olympic Games] – 2 September 2011 – ''[[International Olympic Committee]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ioc" &gt;[http://www.olympic.org/media?articleid=112731&amp;articlenewsgroup=-1 Executive Board concludes first meeting of the new year] 13 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of applicant cities===

Six cities were put forward by their respective [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) to apply to host the Games initially, but Rome withdrew its bid shortly before the applicant files were due.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/content/press-release/six-applicant-cities-for-the-2020-olympic-games/ Six Applicant Cities for the 2020 Olympic Games] – ''[[International Olympic Committee]]'' press release – 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The bidding cities come from two continents, Europe and Asia (Istanbul is considered to be located on the border between Asia and Europe). In 2020 it will be twelve years since an Asian city hosted the Summer Olympics ([[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing 2008]]) and eight years since a European city hosted the Summer Olympics ([[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012]]). Out of the six bidders, Tokyo had previously hosted the Summer Olympic Games in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The other four bidders have made bids in the past. It is the first time in 20 years that no city in the Americas bid to host the Summer Olympic Games. [[Rio de Janeiro]] was awarded the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. Baku and Doha bid for the 2016 Games but failed to become candidate cities, while Tokyo and Madrid also bid for the 2016 Games and became candidate cities.

===Final selection process===

{{main article|125th IOC Session}}
The IOC voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013 at the [[125th IOC Session]] at the [[Buenos Aires Hilton]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. An [[exhaustive ballot]] system was used. No city won over 50% of the votes in the first round, and Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place. A run-off vote between these two cities was held to determine which would be eliminated. In the final vote, a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul, Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36 votes.

'''Books-A-Million, Inc.''', also known as '''BAM!''', owns and operates the second largest bookstore chain in the United States, operating 260 stores in 32 states.&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.booksamillion.com/aboutus | title=Books-A-Million: About Us | publisher=Books-A-Million}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stores range in size from 4,000 to 30,000 square feet and sell books, magazines, collectibles, toys, technology, and gifts.&lt;ref name=aboutus/&gt; Most Books-A-Million stores feature "Joe Muggs" [[cafés]], a coffee and espresso bar.&lt;ref name=aboutus/&gt;

Stores operate under the names Books-A-Million, Bookland, Books &amp; Company, and 2nd &amp; Charles.&lt;ref name=goprivate&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151210006077/en/Books-A-Million-Completes-Go-Private-Transaction | title=Books-A-Million, Inc.

The company owns Yogurt Mountain Holding, a [[frozen yogurt]] retailer and franchisor with 40 locations. The company also owns Preferred Growth Properties, which develops and manages commercial real estate investments.&lt;ref name=goprivate/&gt;

The company also owns and operates American Wholesale Book Company (AWBC), an e-commerce division operating as booksamillion.com, and an internet development and services company, NetCentral, in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=aboutus/&gt;

In December 2015, the company was acquired by its chairman, Clyde B. Anderson, and his family, for $21 million.&lt;ref name=goprivate/&gt;&lt;ref name=21buyout&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/books-a-million-in-21-million-buyout-deal-with-chairman-1436833186 | title=Books-A-Million in $21 Million Buyout Deal With Chairman | first=Josh | last=Beckerman | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=July 13, 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Books-A-Million was founded in 1917 in [[Florence, Alabama]]&lt;ref name=10K/&gt; as a newsstand by 14-year old Clyde B. Anderson, who dropped out of school to support his family after his father died.&lt;ref name=alabama&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1619 | title=Books-A-Million | first=Herbert Jim | last=Lewis | publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Alabama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson saw a business opportunity after workers on the nearby [[Wilson Dam]] complained that they could not get their hometown newspapers.

In 1950, Charles C. Anderson, the founder's son, inherited the store and expanded it into a chain.&lt;ref name=alabama/&gt; The company incorporated as Bookland in 1964.&lt;ref name=alabama/&gt;

By 1980, the company had 50 stores.&lt;ref name=alabama/&gt;

In 1988, Bookland acquired the Gateway Books retail chain based in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. The same year, the company opened its first superstore format store.&lt;ref name=alabama/&gt;

In 1992, the company changed its name to Books-A-Million, Inc. and became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]] of 2.6 million shares at a price of $13 per share.&lt;ref name=alabama/&gt;&lt;ref name=netfever&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXUOASHVf_YC&amp;pg=PA170 | title=How Net Fever Sent Shares of a Firm on a 3 Day Joy Ride | first1=Carrick | last1=Mollencamp | first2=Karen | last2=Lundergaard | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=December 9, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the company launched its [[website]], booksamillion.com.&lt;ref name=alabama/&gt;

On November 25, 1998, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the stock price soared from $3 per share to $38.94 on November 27, 1998 and an intra-day high of $47.00 on November 30, 1998 after the company announced an updated website. Two weeks later, the share price was back down to $10. By 2000, the share price had returned to $3. Those days included suspenseful times for [[day trader]]s, such as when the stock moved up 6 points in 13 minutes. During this time, insiders sold hundreds of thousands of shares.&lt;ref name=netfever/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CNNfn market movers | url=http://money.cnn.com/1998/11/25/markets/hotstox2p/ | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=November 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the company acquired NetCentral, the designer of its website, and began operating American Wholesale Book Company, a book wholesaler and distributor.&lt;ref name=alabama/&gt;

In April 2010, the company paid $3 million for a 40% stake in [[Yogurt Mountain]], a [[frozen yogurt]] retailer and franchisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2010/04/12/daily48.html | title=Books-A-Million paid $3M for Yogurt Mountain stake | first=Jimmy | last=DeButts | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the company opened Yogurt Mountain locations in its bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theledger.com/news/20101025/yogurt-mountain-coming-soon-to-books-a-million | title=Yogurt Mountain Coming Soon to Books-a-Million | first=Sarah | last=Stegall | work=[[The Ledger]] | date=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the company launched 2nd &amp; Charles, a trader of used media, with its first store in [[Hoover, Alabama]] across from [[Riverchase Galleria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.al.com/businessnews/2010/09/new_idea_in_used_books_2nd_and.html | title=New idea in used books: 2nd and Charles opens with recycling theme | first=Dawn | last=Kent Azok | work=[[The Birmingham News]] | date=September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it opened its first store in [[North Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2017/05/books-a-million_division_2nd_c.html | title=Books-A-Million division 2nd &amp; Charles opening store soon in Madison | first=Lucy | last=Berry | work=[[The Birmingham News]] | date=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the company was acquired by its chairman, Clyde B. Anderson, and his family, for $21 million.&lt;ref name=goprivate/&gt;&lt;ref name=21buyout/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2015/07/books-a-million_private_again.html | title=Books-A-Million may go private again: Anderson family buying company, pending shareholder approval | first=Kelly | last=Poe | work=[[The Birmingham News]] | date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the company began to sell [[Self-publishing|self-published]] books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2016/11/books-a-million_distributing_s.html | title=Books-A-Million to begin selling self-published books | first=Kelly | last=Poe | work=[[The Birmingham News]] | date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the English custom of chasing a bull to slaughter|the continental European custom of running in front of groups of bulls|Running of the bulls}}
'''Bull running''' was a medieval custom practiced in England until the 19th century.{{efn|Griffin-Kremer has suggested that bull running, as distinct from bull baiting, may also have occasionally occurred in Waterford, Ireland; however, the release of the bull through the town seems to have been a protest at the failure of newly-elected mayors to provide the traditional rope, collar and buckle "at the charge of the city revenue" for the annual bull baiting.{{sfn|Griffin-Kremer|2003|pages=107-8}}}} It involved chasing a bull through the streets of a town until it was weakened, then slaughtering the animal and butchering it for its meat.{{sfn|Peacock|1904|page=199}} Bull running became illegal in 1835, and the last bull run took place in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], in 1839.{{sfn|Malcolmson|1973|page=133}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Stamford Bull Running|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=17 November 1838|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was not confined to any particular region, with bull runs also documented at [[Axbridge]] in the [[South West England|south west]], [[Canterbury]] and [[Wokingham]] in the [[South East England|south east]], [[Tutbury]] in the [[West Midlands (region)|midlands]], and [[Wisbech]] in the [[East of England|east]].{{sfn|Bushaway|1993|page=76}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Country News|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=18 August 1788|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the custom are uncertain, and the date of observance varied across the country. In Stamford, the bull run took place on [[Brice of Tours|St Brice]]'s Day (13 November); in Tutbury, it was held on the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]] (15 August); and in Axbridge on [[Guy Fawkes Day]] (5 November).{{sfn|Peacock|1904|page=199}}{{sfn|Bushaway|1993|pages=77, 79}}{{efn|Peacock notes that in Stamford, "So fond were the people of the sport that a second bull was frequently subscribed for and run in some of the streets on the Monday after Christmas."{{sfn|Peacock|1904|pages=200-201}}}}

==Origins==
The earliest documented instance of bull running appears in 1389, among medieval guild records collected by [[Joshua Toulmin Smith]]. The document—from Stamford's "Gild of St. Martin"—states that "on the feast of St. Martin, this gild, by custom beyond reach of memory, has a bull; which bull is hunted [not ''baited''] by dogs, and then sold; whereupon the bretheren and sisteren sit down to feast."{{sfn|Walsh|1996|page=240}} The phrase "custom beyond reach of memory" leaves uncertainty about whether the custom pre-dated the guild—which was established by 1329—or was instituted by the guild itself. Local folklore in Stamford maintained that the tradition was begun by [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey]], during the reign of [[John, King of England|King John]] (1199—1216). The story, recorded by Richard Butcher in his ''The Survey and Antiquitie of Stamford Towne'' (1646), and described by Walsh as "patently fictional", relates how Warenne:{{quote|...was looking out of his castle window one 13 November and spied out on the meadow two bulls fighting over a cow. The Stamford butchers then came with their dogs to part the bulls, enraging them further and causing them to stampede through the town tossing about men, women and children. Earl Warenne joined the wild mêlée on horseback and so enjoyed himself that he gave to the butchers of Stamford that piece of mating ground, thereafter called "Bull-meadow", on condition that they replicate the event yearly thereafter.{{sfn|Walsh|1996|page=238}}{{efn|Walsh writes of the story: "[T]he most this actually tells us is that Stamford’s folk-imagination (if we can talk of such a thing) could not imagine anything earlier than the reign of King John."{{sfn|Walsh|1996|page=240}}}}}}
A similar origin-story involving a noble is found at Tutbury, Staffordshire, where the tradition was said to have been started by [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] shortly after he married his Spanish wife, [[Constance of Castile]], in 1372, in an effort to remind her of her home.{{sfn|Bushaway|1993|page=81}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=38}} The story was first advanced—purely as speculation—by [[Robert Plot]] in his ''The Natural History of Stafford-Shire'' (1686), where he writes:{{quote|...through the emulation in point of ''manhood'', that has long been cherish't between the ''Staffordshire'' and ''Derbyshire'' men, perhaps as much mischief may have been done in the triall between them, as in the ''Jeu de Taureau'' or ''Bull-fighting'' practised at ''Valentia'', ''Madrid'', and many other places in ''Spain'', whence perhaps this our Custom of ''Bull-running'' might be derived, and set up here by ''John'' of ''Gaunt'', who was King of ''Castile'' and ''Leon'', and ''Lord'' of the ''Honour'' of ''Tutbury''; for why might not we receive this sport from the ''Spanyards'', as well as they from the ''Romans'' and the ''Romans'' from the ''Greeks''?{{sfn|Plot|1686|page=440}}}}
[[Samuel Pegge]], addressing the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1765, dismissed Plot's conjecture as "entirely mistaken", while lamenting that it had become [[received wisdom]] in the interim.{{sfn|Pegge|1773|page=86-8}} While John of Gaunt had established a Court of Minstrels at Tutbury in 1381, the bull running appears instead to have been instituted by the prior of [[Tutbury Priory]] (founded c.1080 as a dependency of the abbey at [[Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives]]) as part of the Feast of the Assumption celebrations which, as early as 1230, required the prior to provide "a great feast".{{sfn|Bushaway|1993|page=81}} Pegge also notes that the bull used for running was provided by the prior, and that the animal "was turned out antiently at the abbey-gate, and by the prior; John of Gaunt or his officers being no way employed in that service."{{sfn|Pegge|1773|page=89}}

Walsh observed that the bull running that took place in November occurred in the calendar around [[Martinmas]], which "traditionally marked the slaughtering time for the beef, swine and geese not being maintained through the winter on stored feed."{{sfn|Walsh|1996|page=241}} During the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] period, November was called ''[[Blōtmōnaþ]]'' ("sacrifice month") or ''Blōdmōnaþ'' ("blood month").{{sfn|Hone|1826|page=710}}{{sfn|Langeslag|2015|page=50}} Langeslag cautions: "Whether the [Anglo-Saxons'] slaughter was accompanied by a celebration, and whether such a celebration would have been secular or religious, is not known, although a twelfth-century reader of [[Bede]] gave the month name the explanation 'because this is when they offered the cattle to be killed to their gods'. Whether this should be read as speculation or report, it is certain that the necessary conditions for a gathering, secular or religious, were in place at this time of year."{{sfn|Langeslag|2015|pages=50-51}} [[William Fitzstephen]], writing in 1173, indicates that, in London at least, the animals to be slaughtered were often first used for sport: "[T]he youth are entertained in a morning with boars fighting to the last gasp, as likewise with hogs full tusked, intended to be converted into bacon; or game-bulls, and bears of a large bulk, are baited with dogs."{{sfn|Fitzstephen|1772|page=50}}

'''CubeSat for Solar Particles''' ('''CuSP''') is a planned [[nanosatellite]] spacecraft that will study the dynamic [[Solar energetic particles|particles]] and [[Sun#Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] that stream from the Sun.&lt;ref name="NASA CuSP"&gt; {{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/heliophysics-cubesat-to-launch-on-nasa-s-sls |title=Heliophysics CubeSat to Launch on NASAs SLS |work=NASA |date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=2016-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Messier 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Messier |first=Doug |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2016/02/05/swri-cubesat-explore-deep-space/ |title=SwRI CubeSat to Explore Deep Space |work=Parabolic ARC |date=February 5, 2016 |accessdate=2016-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CuSP is a low-cost 6U [[CubeSat]] nanosatellite that once deployed, will orbit the Sun, measuring [[Solar irradiance|incoming radiation]] that can create a wide variety of effects at Earth, from interfering with radio communications to tripping up satellite electronics to creating electric currents in power grids. The principal investigator for CuSP is Mihir Desai, at the [[Southwest Research Institute]] in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref name="NASA CuSP"/&gt; It will fly as a secondary payload mission on the first flight of the [[Space Launch System]], [[Exploration Mission 1]] (EM-1) scheduled to launch in 2019.&lt;ref name=2019-slip/&gt;

==Objective==
To create a network of [[space weather]] stations would require many instruments scattered throughout space millions of miles apart, but the cost of such a system is prohibitive.&lt;ref name="NASA CuSP"/&gt;  Though the [[CubeSat]]s can only carry a few instruments, they are relatively inexpensive to launch because of their small mass and standardized design. So, CuSP also serves as a test for creating a network of space science stations.&lt;ref name="NASA CuSP"/&gt;

==Payload==
This CubeSat will carry three scientific instruments:&lt;ref name="NASA CuSP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Messier 2016"/&gt;
#The Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph ('''SIS'''), is built by the [[Southwest Research Institute]] to detect and characterize low-energy solar energetic particles. 
#Miniaturized Electron and Proton Telescope ('''MERiT'''), will return counts of high-energy solar energetic particles.
#Vector Helium Magnetometer ('''VHM'''), being built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields.

;Propulsion
The satellite features a [[cold gas thruster]] system for propulsion, [[attitude control]] (orientation) and orbital maneuvering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubesat-propulsion.com/cusp-propulsion-system/ CuSP Propulsion].. ''VACCO Propulsion Systems''. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro''' (also known as the '''Festival de Avándaro''' or simply '''Avándaro''') was a historic [[Mexican rock music|Mexican rock]] festival held on September 11–12, 1971, on the shores of Lake Avándaro near the [[Avándaro Golf Club]], in a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] called [[:es:Tenantongo|Tenantongo]], near the town of [[Valle de Bravo]] in the central [[State of Mexico]]. The festival, organized by brothers Eduardo and Alfonso Lopez Negrete's company Promotora Go, [[McCann Erickson]] executive and sports promoter [[:es:Justino Compeán|Justino Compean]] and [[Telesistema Mexicano]] producer [[Luis de Llano Macedo]], took place at the height of [[La Onda]] and celebrated life, youth, ecology, music, peace and [[free love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jimenez Izquierdo|first1=Juan|title=Avandaro, mas que drogas y desnudos|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/815718.html|accessdate=24 June 2014|publisher=El Universal|date=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monsivais|first=Carlos|editor1-first=Ana del |editor1-last=Sarto|editor2-first=Alicia|editor2-last=Ríos|editor3-first= Abril|editor3-last=Trigo|title=The Latin American Cultural Studies Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NW1CXsOKRc8C&amp;pg=PA219|year=2004|publisher=Duke UP|isbn=9780822333401|pages=203–32|chapter=Would So Many Millions of People Not End Up Speaking English?: The North American Culture and Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been compared to the American [[Woodstock]] festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramer|first=Michael J.|title=The Republic of Rock: Music and Citizenship in the Sixties Counterculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yahvEERWHXsC&amp;pg=PA220|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195384864|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[psychedelic music]], [[counterculture]] imagery and artwork, and open drug use.

The festival originally scheduled 12 bands booked by music impresarios Waldo Tena and Armando Molina Solis' agency, but a total of 18 acts performed outdoors during the first, sometimes rainy weekend, before a massive crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nava Durand|first1=Pepe Nayeli|title=Lo que siempre quiso saber de Avandaro|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/107117.html|accessdate=24 June 2014|publisher=El Universal|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was captured in film by, among others, Cinematográfica Marco Polo, Telesistema Mexicano, [[Izzi Telecom|Cablevision]] and [[:es:Raúl Candiani|Peliculas Candiani]]. Audio was captured by [[Polydor Records]] and a live radio broadcast was sponsored by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Images of the festival were captured by photographers like [[Graciela Iturbide]], [[Pedro Meyer]] and others.

==Before Avandaro: Massive events, student repression and ''La Onda''==
By 1971 Mexico, ruled by the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]], had organized two of the most important sporting events in the world: the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], gaining a fresh and modern image its government wanted to show to the outside world. At the same time, its government had violently repressed political youth movements known as the ''[[Tlatelolco massacre]]'' and the ''[[Corpus Christi massacre|Halconazo]]'', which in turn gave way to the so-called [[Dirty War (Mexico)|Mexican Dirty War]] of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forero|first1=Juan|title=Details of Mexico's Dirty Wars From 1960s to 1980s Released|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112101740.html|accessdate=26 September 2014|publisher=The Washington Post|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican hippies, called "[[jipitecas]]" by [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] and scholar [[Enrique Marroquin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marroquin|first1=Enrique|title=La contracultura como protesta|year=1975|publisher=Ed. Joaquín Mortiz|location=Mexico|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a multidisciplinary movement called ''[[La Onda]]'' (The wave). In accordance to their hippie values, La Onda did not advocate a violent overthrow of the PRI, but it did advocate change. By 1969 the government had already banned the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' after a unique performance of it in [[Acapulco]], censuring the rock band ''Los Shakes'' (which included stars [[Pixie Hopkin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pixie Hopkin|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0394093/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mayita Campos]] and [[Nono Zaldivar]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goff|first1=Charlie|title=Pixie: A versatile star.|url=http://www.thenews.com.mx/index.php/ch-th-articles/15601-pixie-a-versatile-star|accessdate=30 September 2014|agency=The News|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating impresario [[Alfredo Elias Calles]] (grandson of late president [[Plutarco Elias Calles]]) and deporting foreign actors and producers like [[Michael Butler (producer)|Michael Butler]], [[Gerome Ragni]] and [[James Rado]].

The violent incidents after the White concert, which were extensively covered by the media, seriously damaged then [[Nuevo Leon]] governor [[:es:Eduardo A.

The opportunity arrived in the spring of 1971.

==History==
Trying to resurrect their popular [[auto racing]] spot, ''Circuito Avándaro'', after being cancelled in 1969 as a result of the fatal accident of [[racing driver]] [[Moisés Solana]], ''Promotora Go'' owners brothers Eduardo and Alfonso López Negrete in partnership with [[McCann (company)|McCann]] executive and sports promoter [[:es:Justino Compeán|Justino Compeán]] decided to organize a massive auto race with live rock music acts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zolov|first1=Eric|title=Refried Elvis|date=1999|page=202|edition=1st|url=https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5q2nb3w6&amp;brand=ucpress|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=EDGAR VALERO Y ENRIQUE BERMÚDEZ|title=Sería un suicidio alejar a las familias de los estadios: Justino Compeán|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2007/283868.html|accessdate=20 November 2017|agency=Cronica|date=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gomez Zuniga |first1=Anahi |title=Avandaro tenia aval de Televisa y del gobierno. |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/colaboracion/mochilazo-en-el-tiempo/nacion/sociedad/avandaro-tenia-aval-de-televisa-y-del-gobierno |accessdate=28 August 2018 |agency=El Universal |date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ochoa|first1=Raúl|title=Las andanzas de Compeán|journal=Proceso|date=September 3, 2006|url=http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&amp;a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=94751&amp;rl=wh|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consulted then [[Telesistema Mexicano]] promoter [[Luis de Llano Macedo]] to video-record the motoring event and to hire [[:es:Javier Batiz|Javier Bátiz]] and [[La Revolución de Emiliano Zapata]], two of the most popular Mexican rock acts of the time. Luis de Llano was at the time producing a section named ''La onda de Woodstock'' in the [[Jacobo Zabludovsky]]'s program ''Hoy Domingo'' (Today Sunday). De Llano assembled a team of around 330 individuals to organize the music part of the festival, among them reporter/musicologist Jaime Almeida, screenwriter [[Armando Molina|Armando Molina Solis]], publicist [[Carlos Alazraki]], and [[Master of ceremonies|MCs]] Roberto Naranjo and Eduardo Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Almeida|first1=Jaime|title=Avándaro: 40 años de mito y leyenda|url=http://lastresyuncuarto.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/jaime-almeida-avandaro-40-anos-de-mito-y-leyenda%E2%80%8F/|accessdate=7 October 2014|agency=Las Tres y un cuarto|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molina, himself an impresario and musician from ''[[La Maquina del Sonido]]'' fame, was appointed Music Coordinator.&lt;ref name="Hernandez"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Ricardo|title=Avándaro, a 40 años de distancia|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elmexicano/notas/n2222229.htm|accessdate=24 June 2014|agency=Organizacion Editorial Mexicana|publisher=El sol de Mexico|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music coordination was in the hands of the company ArTe, owned by Molina and Waldo Tena (of [[:es:Los Rebeldes del Rock|Los rebeldes del Rock]] fame).

==The venue==

===Expectations===
As was reported in the [[Corpus Christi Caller-Times]], a maximum of 25,000 attendees, 122 pilots with their staff (with their number expected to reduce after the technical inspections) and 12 Mexican bands with a possible last-minute inclusion of American bands to bolster the event was expected. The bands were going to play from Saturday 7 pm to Sunday 7 am, making way for the auto race to start in public roads around the lake. 2 weeks before the event, the 5 hotels in town were already booked.&lt;ref name="Mexican village set for youths"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexican village set for youths|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/21063832/|accessdate=30 September 2014|agency=Corpus Christi Caller-Times|date=11 September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[TV Azteca]] documentary "Historias Engarzadas: Alex Lora" [[Alex Lora]] explained that this possible "''inclusion of American bands''" was going to be a surprise visit by [[Santana (band)|Santana]].

===Live Radio Broadcasting===
Sports promoter Justino Compean and Radio Juventud General Manager Ramiro Garza made a deal with then [[Coca-Cola Company]] Marketing Director, [[Vicente Fox Quezada]], to sponsor the live broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=El festival de rock y ruedas en Avandaro, en el olvido.|journal=Proceso|date=Sep 16, 2006|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/221358/platos-laser-el-festival-de-rock-y-ruedas-en-avandaro-en-el-olvido|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lighting and sound systems===
Héctor Yaber from Telesistema Mexicano was in charge of the lighting system and Gustavo Cota from the company Audiorama S.A. of the [[PA system]]. All equipments were transported by the company Mudanzas Galván of José C. Galván Castro.

===Security===
The security was going to be in charge of the State of Mexico's Judicial Police chief Cuauhtémoc Cardenas, who was going to receive support from 200 state troopers, 120 army troops and 50 Special Agents from the Secretariat of the Interior. Nevertheless, reports of the total amount of security agents were mixed.''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported a total of 700 law-enforcement agents.&lt;ref name="Mexican village set for youths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zolov|first1=Eric|title=Refried Elvis|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=USA|isbn=0520215141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms between the organizers and mayor Montes de Oca===
The festival president Eduardo Lopez Negrete and Valle de Bravo's then-mayor Juan Montes de Oca Loza agreed that no liquor was going to be sold. Beer would be sold only with a meal.&lt;ref name="Mexican village set for youths"/&gt; In an in-depth radio/video interview with radio host Rafael Catana, Armando Molina stated that mayor Montes de Oca suggested to Valle de Bravo's inhabitants to be polite with the hippie crowd as they felt being overwhelmed by the excessive numbers of them. In the end, not a single Valle de Bravo inhabitant complained about the hippies.

==Cancellation of the auto race==
Early Saturday morning it was decided, as stated by Alfonso Lopez Negrete, in an on-site interview made by a Telesistema Mexicano, to cancel the auto race due to the quantity of festival attendees which surpassed all expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castellanos G.|first1=Ernesto|title=Avándaro, a 39 años|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n1778125.htm|accessdate=24 June 2014|agency=OEM|publisher=Esto|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Circuito Avandaro'' auto-race was going to be suspended for decades to come since authorities tied the sport with massive crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jalife Villalon|first1=Carlos E.|title=Avándaro: primera pista internacional mexicana y último concierto masivo del siglo XX|journal=Scuderia Hnos.

==The music==

===Pre-festival===
As stated by Armando Nava, Alex Lora and De Llano in the "Memorias de un cierto dia: Avandaro" documentary, tens of thousands of jipitecas were already on-site so activities started September 9 (Thursday) with special shows and even some brief concerts some bands like El Amor, Dug Dug's and Three Souls in my Mind offered while at the same time doing their sound-check for Saturday. By Saturday 11 at 6AM, hundreds of thousands of attendees were already on-site so Molina and De Llano decided to formally start the festival with a "Pre-festival". The acts which performed were:

*[[Carlos Baca]] ([[Yoga]] session and [[ecology]] lecture)
*[[Eduardo Ruiz Saviñón]] and [[UNAM]]'s experimental theater troupe with [[Carlos Steward]]. (Performed [[The Who]]'s "[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]" [[rock opera]])
*La Ley de Herodes (band of the famous [[Alfonso Arau|Arau]] family.)
*Zafiro
*[[La Sociedad Anonima]]
*[[Los Soul Masters]]
*[[La Fachada de Piedra]] with [[Larry Sanchez (39.4)]]

===Festival===
La Fachada de Piedra concluded their act at approx. 5pm. After a brief pause the festival resumed as follows:
*[[Los Dug Dug's]]
*El Epilogo
*[[La División del Norte]]
*[[Tequila (Mexican rock band)|Tequila]]
*[[Peace &amp; Love (Mexican rock band)|Peace &amp; Love]]
*[[El Ritual]]
*[[Bandido (Mexican jazz-rock band)|Bandido]]
*[[Los Yaki]] with Mayita Campos
*[[Tinta Blanca]]
*[[El Amor (Mexican rock band)|El Amor]]
*[[:es:Three Souls In My Mind|Three Souls in my Mind]]

At around Sunday 9am, Three Souls in my Mind finished their act and the massive exodus started.

==Festival development==
As stated by Armando Molina in the official soundtrack (narration part)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Molina|first1=Armando|title=Por fin...32 años después|year=2003|publisher=Bakita-Ludell Records|location=Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by his then assistant Jaime Almeida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Almeida|first1=Jaime|title=Avándaro: 40 años de mito y leyenda|url=http://lastresyuncuarto.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/jaime-almeida-avandaro-40-anos-de-mito-y-leyenda%E2%80%8F/|accessdate=24 June 2014|publisher=Milenio|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the whole festival was held in peace with the only problem being that the attendees destroyed the barricade and invaded reserved areas of the light towers and even the stage. In the official soundtrack desperate calls for order from Molina's assistant Roberto Naranjo and band members from ''Dug Dug's'', ''El Epilogo'', and ''Peace and Love'' can be heard. At one point, an attendee fainted and Tequila's world-class Mexican-American singer, Maricela Durazo, ordered the crowd to take good care and protect her. As many thousands of jipitecas were on-site since Friday 10, co-organizer Luis de Llano stated the famous phrase: "They survived for three days sharing rain and mud; that was in attempt to have an identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pepe Navar|first1=Nayeli Durand|title=Lo que siempre quiso saber de Avandaro|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/107117.html|accessdate=26 June 2014|publisher=El Universal|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco Martinez Gallardo, chief of the medical team and voluntaries of the improvised in-site hospital stated: "There was one case of acute appendicitis, 20 intoxicated with pills, 50 with marijuana, 5 with alcoholic congestion, 5 cases of gastroenteritis and some with wounded heads, ankle fractures and burns."&lt;ref name="El Universal"&gt;{{cite web|title=A 40 años, las otras anécdotas de Avándaro|url=http://blogs.eluniversal.com.mx/weblogs_detalle14781.html|publisher=El Universal|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exodus==
President Luis Echeverria agreed to send 300 buses to pick up some of the attendees. The news were cheered with a rarely seen approval for a Mexican president from his country's youth. As one of the organizers yelled, with heavy use of slangs, through the audio system:
"Lets cheer up Luis Echeverria, who is gonna send 300 buses of 50 seats each so we can go back...is a good guy that fella" (un aplauso para Luis Echeverría que nos va a mandar 300 camiones de 50 pasajeros para el regreso ... a todo dar el chavo ese).&lt;ref name="El Universal"/&gt;
As can be seen in the Gurrola film, thousands upon thousands of hippies were walking from the site and many of them were overwhelming the  buses.

==Aftermath: ''Avandarazo'' and controversies==
As can be heard in the soundtrack, the band ''Peace and Love'' performed the songs "Marihuana" and "We got the power," that were considered controversial to Mexican society. At the same time, Peace and Love front-man Ricardo Ochoa used some foul language in order to cheer up the crowd, echoing what [[Country Joe McDonald]] did at Woodstock. Since the festival was being broadcast live through ''Radio Juventud'' and relay stations all over the country, some segments of society took this as a direct threat to the establishment ("Marihuana" for advocating open drug-use and "We got the power" for wrongly associating it with a possible popular uprising). The possible association of jipitecas with subversive and radical political movements is what caused the so-called ''Avandarazo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rock|first1=Chava|title=Aváaaandaroooooooooo.

In the aftermath of the post-festival turmoil, several interviewed Avandaro attendees declared that the whole festival was held in peace and not a single major accident happened&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arana|first1=Federico|title=Guaraches de ante azul|year=1986|publisher=Ed.

Opinions from the world of politics, religion and academia were deeply divided.
While influential university professors and La Onda writers such as [[:es:Parménides García Saldaña|Parménides García]] and [[José Agustín]], mostly gave the festival a positive review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez Rodriguez|first1=Jorge|title=Opinan profesores de la Universidad|url=http://robquero.tripod.com/Opinion.htm|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some intellectuals like [[Paco Ignacio Taibo I]], [[Elena Poniatowska]] (herself an attendee), [[Octavio Paz]] and [[José Emilio Pacheco]] gave a fairly positive evaluation too,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schelonka (edited by Alejandro Madrid and Ignacio Corona)|first1=Greg|title=RockIn' La Frontera (from the book Postnational Musical Identities)|date=2008|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-1821-8|pages=151–173|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c2tu6oXxmkYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; others criticized it negatively like [[:es:Roberto Blanco Moheno|Roberto Blanco Moheno]] and [[Rius|Eduardo "Rius" del Rio]]. Writer and political activist [[Carlos Monsiváis]] initially gave the festival a negative review but changed his mind soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Figueroa|first1=Fernando|title=Avandaro segun tres Monsivais|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/66353.html|accessdate=25 June 2014|publisher=El Universal|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guadalajara|Guadalajara Cardinal]] [[José Garibi y Rivera]] condemned it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enérgica condena al festival de musica y vicio, en Avandaro|url=http://hemeroteca.informador.com.mx/|accessdate=21 March 2015|agency=Excélsior|publisher=El Informador|date=15 September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; popular liberal priest and festival attendee Enrique Marroquin praised it, publishing in Piedra Rodante a controversial article in its defense called "God wants the rain so we can unite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marroquin|first1=Enrique|title=Dios quiere que llueva para unirnos|journal=Piedra Rodante|date=30 October 1971|url=http://robquero.tripod.com/Avandaro.htm|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a notable incident at [[Temple of San Felipe Neri "La Profesa"|La Profesa]], when during mass in homage to Mexico's Independence figure [[Agustin de Iturbide]], a group of about 250 individuals belonging to a conservative civil movement left the building in protest as mass was being served by [[Monsignor]] Rafael Vazquez Corona, a strong supporter of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exaltacion de Iturbide como autor de la consumacion de la Independencia.|url=http://hemeroteca.informador.com.mx/|accessdate=20 March 2015|agency=Excelsior|publisher=El Informador|date=27 September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsignor Vazquez Corona was then heavily criticized by then rector of the [[Universidad de Guadalajara|University of Guadalajara]], Dr. Garibay Gutiérrez, in his 1972 book about the festival "El gran desafio: Volver a pensar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garibay Gutiérrez|first1=Luis|title=El gran desafio: Volver a pensar.|date=1972|publisher=UAG|location=ITESO|edition=1st|url=http://148.201.128.23:8991/F/AX3NJJBX67G77VUKU2VLLCQH5SKXV2B1CBTTKYSI3LHA5MYT9A-66111?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=000287&amp;set_entry=000006&amp;format=999|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Union leader [[Fidel Velazquez]] simply called the festival "a [[Bacchanalia]]", [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General]] [[:es:Pedro Ojeda Paullada|Ojeda Paullada]] labelled it as a "[[witches' Sabbath]]" and President of the [[Senate of the Republic (Mexico)|Senate]], [[Enrique Olivares Santana]], yelled in a press conference: "Let there be no more Avandaros in the republic!". Finally and under pressure, president [[Luis Echeverría]] made a strong statement against the festival, saying: "While we regret and condemn the phenomenon of Avándaro, it also encourages us in our belief that only a small part of our youth are in favor of such acts and entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bizbera|first1=Andrea|title=Cifras con historia|url=http://www.loshijosdelamalinche.com/opinion/cifras-con-historia-20112014|website=Los hijos de la Malinche|publisher=REFORMA|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Echeverria then proceeded to crack down La Onda. Some early 1970s hit-songs like "Avandaro" from Rosario, "Seguir al sol" by Pajaro Alberto and others which commemorated the event, were banned from radio air play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poniatowska|first1=Elena|title=El poeta Alberto Blanco|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/11/18/index.php?section=opinion&amp;article=a04a1cul|accessdate=27 September 2014|agency=La Jornada|date=18 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doggett|first1=Peter|title=There's A Riot Going On: Revolutionaries, Rock Stars, and the Rise and Fall of '60s Counter-Culture|date=4 October 2007|publisher=Canongate Books Ltd.|location=UK|isbn=978-1847671141|page=431|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilcher|first1=Jeffrey M.|title=The human tradition in Mexico|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=USA|isbn=978-0842029766|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jbeXAsUsxyMC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=luis+echeverria+avandaro#v=onepage&amp;q=luis%20echeverria%20avandaro&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez Segura|first1=Eduardo|title=Avandaro y el festival de rock de 1971|url=http://noticieros.televisa.com/mexico/1309/avandaro-festival-rock-1971/|accessdate=24 June 2014|agency=Noticieros Televisa|publisher=Televisa|date=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Juventud DJs Félix Ruano Mendez, Jaime Marin and Agustín Meza de la Peña were temporarily suspended but, contrary to popular belief, they were not terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galvan|first1=Hugo|title=Rock Impop|date=2013|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H1Dy_LrCTPUC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=alfredo+gurrola+habla+sobre+avandaro#v=onepage&amp;q=ruano&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Javier|title=Avándaro y la mentada que detuvo el tiempo|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/09/13/index.php?section=opinion&amp;article=a10o1esp|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=La Jornada|date=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the influential Piedra Rodante magazine was indeed terminated in early 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cabrera Lopez|first1=Patricia|title=Una inquietud de amanecer|date=2006|publisher=UNAM|location=UNAM|isbn=970-722-485-1|pages=184–191|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Imz1bZ5jNm4C&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=la+nacion+de+avandaro#v=onepage&amp;q=Manuel%20Aceves&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinez|first1=Jose Luis|title=Recuerdos de la inquisición|url=http://www.milenio.com/cultura/Recuerdos-inquisicion_0_241176112.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=MILENIO|date=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinez Renteria|first1=Carlos|title=Desagravio a la Piedra Rodante|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/09/18/10an1esp.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=La Jornada|date=14 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and festival co-organizer Justino Compean left the country for a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molina|first1=Armando|title=PLATOS LASER: El Festival de Rock y Ruedas en Avándaro, en el olvido|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=221358|accessdate=25 June 2014|publisher=Proceso|date=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band Tinta Blanca and other rock musicians tried unsuccessfully to hold a meeting with president Echeverria with a famous protest outside [[Los Pinos]].

==Films and TV==

===Short films===
*''Avandaro''. A 1971 Super 8 short film of approximately 20 minutes of footage with live soundtrack, produced by Luis Gutiérrez y Prieto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IMDB|title=Luis Gutierrez y Prieto|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1646261/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and directed/edited by [[Alfredo Gurrola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IMDB|title=Alfredo Gurrola|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0348735/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographers were awarded-filmmakers Héctor Abadie, David Celestinos and [[Sergio Garcia Michel]]. Facing government pressure in the aftermath of the festival, the film was briefly screened in selected theaters, cultural centers and international Super 8 film festivals only. By the end of the 1970s, the film was acquired by ''[[Cablevision (Mexico)|Cablevision]]'' thanks to the efforts of Gutiérrez y Prieto. As stated in Garcia Michel essay ''Toward a fourth cinema'': "Apart from the technical achievements, Luis always sympathized with this Movement, sponsoring films such as Avándaro, Pasiones [Passions] and La lucha [The Struggle]; the first two were transferred from super-8 to videotape and belong to Cablevisión."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia Michel|first1=Sergio|title=Toward a fourth cinema|journal=Wide Angle|year=1999|volume=21|issue=3|url=https://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/lerner/wide_angle/21_3/213garcia_s.htm|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the company Video Grupo Empresarial included it as a DVD-extra in the release of the 1983 Sergio Garcia film ''Three Souls in my mind: Una larga experiencia''.

==Curiosities==

===''La encuerada de Avandaro''===
In spite the spirit of the age and that many people were completely naked swimming in the lake, walking in the middle of the crowd or even on stage without a problem as can be seen in the film, one woman, as the band La Division del Norte was playing, performed a [[striptease]] and caught the attention of the cameras. Her strip-tease was captured in the Gurrola film and shots of her appeared in many other media. When the footage and pictures were shown, the public baptized the woman as ''La encuerada''(the naked woman).&lt;ref name="Woldberg"/&gt; The woman was interviewed on-site by Elena Poniatowska;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los muchachos de entonces, entrevista con Elena Poniatowska|url=http://www.nexos.com.mx/?p=5033|website=NEXOS|publisher=Nexos|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, another interview, thought to have been real for decades, was published in the rock magazine ''Piedra Rodante'' in late 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benitez|first1=José Luis|title=Entrevista a la encuerada de Avandaro|url=http://www.chilango.com/musica/nota/2014/03/25/la-entrevista-original-a-la-encuerada-de-avandaro|publisher=Piedra Rodante|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a bitter dispute between the owner of ''Piedra Rodante'' Manuel Aceves and then collaborator and music critic Oscar Sarquiz about the veracity of the interview took place in ''La Jornada'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sarquiz|first1=Oscar|title=De Sarquiz a Aceves-De Aceves a Sarquiz.

A few years after the festival the band Three Souls in my Mind composed a song called ''La encuerada de Avandaro'' which would become a hit in the underground movement.&lt;ref name="Woldberg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woldberg|first1=José|title=La encuerada de Avandaro|url=http://www.debate.com.mx/eldebate/noticias/default.asp?IdArt=11282159&amp;IdCat=6115|accessdate=24 June 2014|publisher=El Debate|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The lost Telesistema Mexicano videotapes===
Shot by Telesistema Mexicano cameramen under direction of [[Carlos Alazraki]], those tapes were destined to become part of the planned TV special but were confiscated by their own company as soon as Luis de Llano showed up for work. Some footage of these tapes has been released since 1971 in movies and documentaries. In a 2001 interview, Luis de Llano recalled this situation and stated that may he find the tapes he will produce a movie with them though it is widely believed that they were sent to a storage in [[Tijuana]], and that years later the whole place burnt out. He also made clear that, contrary to popular belief, the [[Secretariat of the Interior (Mexico)|Secretariat of the Interior]] did not confiscate the tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mendoza Mocino|first1=Arturo|title=Gracias a Zabludovsky y Timbiriche, la llama del rock sigue viva: Luis de Llano|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/09/14/02an2esp.html|accessdate=24 June 2014|publisher=La Jornada|date=14 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent investigation, as shown in the ''Las glorias de Avandaro'' documentary, made as a request through the Federal Institute of access to information ([[:es:IFAI|IFAI]]) produced the official document proving that, indeed, the government did not confiscate the tapes.

===Booked acts who failed to show up===
*[[Love Army]] - As stated by the former band singer Pajaro Alberto in the ''Glorias de Avandaro'' documentary, the band suffered a minor car accident while on the road from Mexico City to Avandaro.
*[[La Tribu (Mexican rock band)|La Tribu]] - As stated by Armando Molina in the live soundtrack, La Tribu cancelled at the very last minute but their record company, [[Polydor Records|Polydor]], sent La Division del Norte in their place.

===Acts who declined to participate===
*La Revolucion de Emiliano Zapata: As stated by member Javier Martin del Campo in the fair use trailer for ''Bajo el sol y frente a Dios'' documentary, the band was already booked for September 11 to appear in Monterrey. As the band was heading north, they saw thousands of fans going south for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lara Lozano|first1=Arturo|title=Javier Martin del Campo en el documental de Avandaro|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq2O-eVFv4E|publisher=Enciclopedia del rock mexicano|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Javier Batiz: As stated on the fair use TV Azteca documentary ''La historia detras del mito: Avandaro'', he considered Molina's payment offer too low. Later, he regretted his decision and tried, together with his sister singer Baby Batiz some members of ''Los Locos'' and his girlfriend, to get to the festival but were stranded in the traffic jam and his girlfriend at the time got ill while on the road.

==Legacy==
The festival remains a controversial issue in Mexican society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A 30 de años de Avándaro.|url=http://hemeroteca.imagenzac.com.mx/2001/09/11/Sociales3.htm|accessdate=24 February 2015|agency=NOTIMEX|publisher=IMAGEN|date=11 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the festival, Mexican rock music was almost banned and was segregated to the so-called ''Hoyos Funkies'', illegal gatherings in abandoned warehouses and supported mostly by the proletariat. A few years after the festival the hippie movement around the world collapsed and Mexico's La Onda was no exception, giving way to the ascension of other music genres of the mid-1970s such as [[Disco]], [[Urban rock]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[Romantic ballad|Romantic Ballads]], [[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]], [[Progressive rock]] and, exclusively in the Mexican scene, the ''Rupestre movement'' championed by [[Rockdrigo Gonzalez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Villarreal|first1=Rogelio|title=La larga noche de Avándaro|url=http://clarimonda.mx/la-larga-noche-de-avandaro/|publisher=Clarimonda|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canales|first1=Miriam|title=ROCK MEXICANO: DEL HOYO FUNKIE A LA LUZ|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/06-04-2013/549229|website=SIN EMBARGO|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world-class quality of the bands that participated is generally praised and while the festival is little by little being acknowledged by official publications from respected institutions such as [[INEGI]] and [[Colegio de México|COLMEX]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia minima de México ilustrada|year=2008|publisher=COLMEX-Secretaria de edicacion del gobierno del DF|location=COLMEX|page=513|edition=1st|url=http://www.colmex.mx/pdf/historiaminima.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=125 años de la DGE|year=2009|publisher=INEGI|location=INEGI|isbn=978-970-13-5159-8|page=141|edition=1st|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still not completely accepted as part of the official Mexican history class, but it's often regarded as a milestone in the history of rock music, the hippie movement and [[Aftermath of World War II|post-WWII]] Mexican society in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Llano Macedo|first1=Luis|title=Avándaro: mitos, hechos, dichos y actualidad|url=http://www2.esmas.com/entretenimiento/musica/noticias/203665/|accessdate=27 June 2014|agency=ESMAS|date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cisneros|first1=Ernesto|title=Avándaro: ¿cuarenta años de qué?|url=http://sonnigetage.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/avandaro-cuarenta-anos-de-que/|website=Sonnigetage|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Halfway Jam''' was an 1980s music festival in [[Royalton, Minnesota]] (minutes outside [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]], and an hour north of [[Minneapolis]]) that takes place generally in the later part of July until more recently with newer bands being added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Halfway Jam celebrates 10 years of rock | url = http://www.sctimes.com/article/20130725/ENT02/307250011/Halfway-Jam-celebrates-10-years-rock | work = St. Cloud Times | date = July 24, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130729081114/http://www.sctimes.com/article/20130725/ENT02/307250011/Halfway-Jam-celebrates-10-years-rock | archivedate = July 29, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jam is now a 3-day event (Thur-Sat) which draws 6-9K per night and allows on-site camping.  Started as a Friday/Saturday event, Halfway added a 3rd day that was initially tribute bands, but started adding original acts in 2011.

The festival started in 2003 &amp; drew around a thousand people until the promoters started booking the more name bands.  There is a second stage (Rhino Stage) that features local/tribute bands from the area that plays in between main stage acts.

The date was chosen by a pan-national organization of [[socialist]] and [[communist]] political parties to commemorate the [[Haymarket affair]], which occurred in [[Chicago]] on 4 May 1886.&lt;ref name=Foner /&gt;  The 1904 [[International Socialist Congress, Amsterdam 1904|Sixth Conference of the Second International]], called on "all Social Democratic Party organisations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the [[8-hour day]], for the class demands of the [[proletariat]], and for [[world peace|universal peace]]."&lt;ref name=Lunacharsky /&gt;

The first of May is a national [[public holiday]] in many countries worldwide, in most cases as "Labour Day", "International Workers' Day" or some similar name&amp;nbsp;– although some countries celebrate a [[Labour Day]] on other dates significant to them, such as the [[United States]], which celebrates [[Labor Day]] on the first Monday of September.

Beginning in the late 19th century, as the [[trade union]] and [[labour movement]]s grew, a variety of days were chosen by trade unionists as a day to celebrate labour. In the United States and Canada, a September holiday, called [[Labor Day|Labor]] or [[Labour Day]], was first proposed in the 1880s. In 1882, [[Matthew Maguire (labor activist)|Matthew Maguire]], a [[machinist]], first proposed a Labor Day holiday on the first Monday of September{{refn|group=nb|"In 1884 the first Monday in September was selected as the holiday, as originally proposed"&lt;ref name="labordept"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dol.gov/opa/aboutdol/laborday.htm |title= United States Department of Labor: The History of Labor Day |accessdate= 2 September 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110903051707/http://www.dol.gov/opa/aboutdol/laborday.htm |archivedate= 3 September 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} while serving as secretary of the [[Central Labor Union]] (CLU) of New York.&lt;ref name="labordept"/&gt; Others argue that it was first proposed by [[Peter J.

May Day has been a focal point for [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstrations]] by various socialist, communist and anarchist groups since the Second International.  May Day is one of the most important holidays in communist countries such as the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]] and the former [[Soviet Union]] countries. May Day celebrations in these countries typically feature elaborate workforce parades, including displays of military hardware and soldiers.

In 1955, the [[Catholic Church]] dedicated 1 May to "[[Saint Joseph]] the Worker".  Saint Joseph is the [[patron saint]] of workers and craftsmen, among others.&lt;ref name='Saint Joseph'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-joseph/|title=Saint Joseph|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], May Day became the occasion for large military parades in [[Red Square]] by the [[Soviet Union]] and attended by the top leaders of the [[Kremlin]], especially the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], atop [[Lenin's Mausoleum]].  It became an enduring symbol of that period.

Today, the majority of countries around the world celebrate a workers' day on 1 May.

1 May is a statutory holiday in the People's Republic of China. Prior to 2008, it was a three-day holiday, but is now just the one day. However, it is usually supplemented by two other days to give the appearance of a three-day holiday, but not being statutory holidays the extra days have to be "made up" by working either the preceding or following weekend.  For example, in 2013, 1 May fell on Wednesday. Most workplaces, including all government offices, took Monday 29 April, Tuesday 30 April, and Wednesday 1 May off. As the first two days were not statutory holidays they had to be "made up" by working the preceding weekend (27 and 28 April).

May Day is not officially designated by the Japanese government as a national holiday, but as it lies between other national holidays, it is a day off work for the vast majority of Japanese workers. Many employers give it as a day off, and otherwise workers take it as "paid leave". 1 May occurs during "[[Golden Week (Japan)|Golden Week]]", together with 29 April ("[[Shōwa Day]]"), 3 May ("[[Constitution Memorial Day]]"), 4 May ("[[Greenery Day]]") and 5 May ("[[Kodomo no hi|Children's Day]]"). Workers generally take the day off work not so much to join street rallies or labour union gatherings, but more to go on holiday for several consecutive days (in Japanese corporate culture, taking weekdays off for personal pleasure is widely frowned upon).

Some major labour unions organize rallies and demonstrations in [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], and [[Nagoya]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Japan has a long history of labour activism and since 1945, has had a communist and socialist party in the [[Japanese Diet|Diet]].

In France, 1 May is a public holiday. It is, in fact, the only day of the year when employees are legally obliged to be given leave, save professions that cannot be interrupted due to their nature (such as workers in hospitals and public transport).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.service-public.fr/actualites/00790.html |title=Fêtes légales et jours fériés|date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=1 May 2012 |publisher=Government of France |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503210415/http://service-public.fr/actualites/00790.html |archivedate=3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations and marches are a Labour Day tradition in France, where trade unions organize parades in major cities to defend workers' rights.
It is also customary to offer a [[lily of the valley]] to friends or family.

===Germany===
In April 1933, the recently installed [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] declared 1 May the "Day of National Work", an official state holiday, and announced that all celebrations were to be organized by the government. Any separate celebrations by communists, social democrats or [[trade union|labour union]]s were banned. After [[World War II]], 1 May remained a state holiday in both [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]]. In communist East Germany, workers were ''de facto'' required to participate in large state-organized parades on May Day. Today in Germany it is simply called "Labour Day" ({{lang|de|Tag der Arbeit}}), and there are numerous demonstrations and celebrations by independent workers' organizations. Today, [[Berlin]] witnesses yearly demonstrations on May Day, the largest organized by labour unions, political parties and others by the [[far left]] and {{lang|de|[[Autonomism|Autonomen]]}}.

[[File:1. Mai 2013 in Hannover. Gute Arbeit. Sichere Rente. Soziales Europa. Umzug vom Freizeitheim Linden zum Klagesmarkt. Menschen und Aktivitäten (168).jpg|thumb|May Day rally in [[Hanover]], Germany, 1 May 2013]]
Since 1987, May Day has also become known for riots in some districts of Berlin. After police actions against radical leftists in that year's annual demonstrations, the Autonome scattered and sought cover at the ongoing annual street fair in [[Kreuzberg]]. Three years prior to the [[reunification of Germany]], violent protests would only take place in the former [[West Berlin]]. The protesters began tipping over police cars, violently resisting arrest, and began building [[barricade]]s after the police withdrew due to the unforeseen resistance. Cars were set on fire, shops plundered and burned to the ground. The police eventually ended the riots the following night. These violent forms of protests by the radical left, later increasingly involved participants without political motivation. (Read more: [[May Day in Kreuzberg]])

Annual street fairs have proven an effective way to prevent riots, and May Day in 2005 and 2006 have been among the most peaceful known to Berlin in nearly 25 years. In recent years, [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] and other groups on the [[far right]], such as the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]], have used the day to schedule public demonstrations, often leading to clashes with left-wing protesters, which turned especially violent in [[Leipzig]] in 1998 and 2005.

May Day violence flared again in 2010.  After an approved far right demonstration was blocked by leftists, a parade by an estimated 10,000 leftists and anarchists turned violent and resulted in an active response by Berlin police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5529267,00.html |title=Police battle rioters in May Day clashes |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===

On May Day 2010 there were major protests all over Greece, most notably Athens and [[Thessaloniki]], by many left, anarchist and communist supporters and some violent clashes with [[riot police]] who were sent out to contain the protesters. They opposed economic reforms, an end to job losses and wage cuts in the face of the government's proposals of massive public spending cuts. These reforms are to fall in line with the IMF-EU-ECB loan proposals, which demand that Greece liberalize its economy and cut its public spending and private sector wages, which many believe will decrease living standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8655711.stm | work=BBC News | title=Protesters confront Greek police | date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
[[File:Rome concert 1-5-2007 crowd 2.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional 1st May Concert in St. John Lateran square, [[Rome]]]]
The first May Day celebration in [[Italy]] took place in 1890. It started initially as an attempt to celebrate workers' achievements in their struggle for their rights and for better social and economic conditions. It was abolished under the [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|Fascist regime]] and immediately restored after the [[Second World War]]. (During the fascist period, a "Holiday of the Italian Labour" ({{lang|it|Festa del lavoro italiano}}) was celebrated on 21 April, the date of {{lang|it|Natale di Roma}}, when ancient [[Rome]] was allegedly founded.) May Day is now an important celebration in Italy and is a national holiday regardless of what day of the week it falls. The {{lang|it|Concerto del Primo Maggio}} ("1st of May Concert"), organized by Italian labour unions in Rome in [[Porta San Giovanni (Rome)|Piazza di Porta San Giovanni]] has become an important event in recent years. Every year the concert is attended by a large audience of mostly young people and involves the participation of many famous bands and songwriters, lasting from 3&amp;nbsp;pm until midnight. The concert is usually broadcast live by [[Rai 3]].

===Lithuania===
First May Day is an official public holiday celebrated as International Work Day ({{lang-lt|Tarptautinė darbo diena}}). First official celebrations appeared during [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]], but it had negative communist connotation.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, 1 May is not an official holiday. However, several left-wing political parties and organizations celebrate International Workers' Day yearly. Small demonstrations are sometimes held, mostly by anarchist and radical socialist groups. One of the reasons labour day never got established as a national holiday might have been the fact that the day that used to immediately precede it, [[Koninginnedag|Queen's Day]] (now King's Day at 27 April), was already a public holiday in its own right.

In Poland, since the fall of communism, 1 May is officially celebrated as [[May Day]], but is commonly called [[Public holidays in Poland|Labour Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anglopolish.com/index.php/en/archive/29-polish-tradition/155-international-workers-day-may-day | title=May Day in Poland | accessdate=1 May 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815142641/http://anglopolish.com/index.php/en/archive/29-polish-tradition/155-international-workers-day-may-day | archivedate=15 August 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/poland/tp/polandholidays.htm | title=Poland's Holidays | accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it is currently celebrated without a specific connotation, and as such it is May Day. However, due to historical connotations, most of the large organized celebrations are focused around Labour Day festivities. It is customary for labour activists to organize parades in cities and towns across Poland. The holiday is also commonly referred to as "Labour Day" ({{lang-pl|Święto Pracy}}).

In Poland, May Day is closely followed by [[May 3rd Constitution Day]]. These two dates combined often result in a [[long weekend]] called {{lang|pl|Majówka}}, which may last for up to 9 days from the 28th of April to the 6th of May, at the cost of taking only 3 days off. People often travel, and {{lang|pl|Majówka}} is unofficially considered the start of barbecuing season in Poland.

Between these two, on 2 May, there is a patriotic holiday, the Day of the Polish Flag ({{lang|pl|[[:pl:Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej|Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej]]}}), introduced by a Parliamentary Act of 20 February 2004. The day, however, does not force paid time off.

In Soviet times, streets, places, squares, parks and also factories were frequently named in honor of International Workers' Day, such as [[1 Maja Coal Mine]] in {{lang|pl|[[Wodzisław Śląski]]|italic=no}}.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, the 1 May celebration ({{lang-pt|Primeiro de Maio}}) was harshly repressed{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}during the long right wing dictatorship of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano]]. Since the [[Carnation Revolution]] on 25 April 1974, the Worker's Day is celebrated by unions but as well by several leftist political parties with parades and demonstrations. The first demonstration after the Carnation Revolution, only one week after the coup, stays until today as the biggest demonstration in the history of Portugal. It is an opportunity for workers, including non-permanent workers' groups, to show their discontent for existing working conditions in parades all over the country but mainly in the capital, where the two main national union federations (communist CGTP-IN and centre-left UGT) organize two different rallies (in Alameda D. Afonso Henriques and Torre de Belém). It is an official public holiday.

===Romania===
[[File:002 State and party leaders celebrating May 1.jpg|thumb|Delegates of the Romanian Communist Party on 1 May 1965.]]
In Romania, 1 May, known as the '''International Labour Day''' ({{lang-ro|Ziua internațională a muncii}}), the '''International Workers' Day''' ({{lang|ro|Ziua internațională a oamenilor muncii}}), or simply '''1/First of May''' ({{lang|ro|1/Întâi Mai}}),  is an official [[public holidays in Romania|public holiday]]. During the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], like in all former Eastern Bloc countries, the day was marked by large state-organized parades in most towns and cities, to which many workers were ''de facto'' required to participate. After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], 1 May continues to be an official public holiday, but without any state organized events or parades. Most people celebrate together with friends and family, organising [[picnic]]s and [[barbecue]]s. It is also the first day of the year when people, especially those from the southeastern part of the country including the capital [[Bucharest]], go to spend the day in one of the [[Romanian Black Sea resorts]].

===Russia===
[[File:Колонна РКРП-РПК на первомайской демонстрации.jpg|thumb|Russian Communist Workers' Party demonstration on 1 May 2008 in Izhevsk]]
May Day was celebrated illegally in Russia until the [[February Revolution]] enabled the first legal celebration in 1917. The following year, after the [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|seizure of power]], the May Day celebrations were boycotted by [[Mensheviks]], [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] and [[anarchism in Russia|anarchists]]. It became an important official holiday of the Soviet Union, celebrated with elaborate popular parade in the centre of the major cities. The biggest celebration was traditionally organized in [[Red Square]], where the [[General Secretary of the CPSU]] and other party and government leaders stood atop [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] and waved to the crowds. In 1991, which preceded the last year that demonstrations were held in Red Square, May Day grew into high-spirited political action. Around 50,000 people participated in a rally in Red Square in 1991 after which the tradition was interrupted for 13 years. In the early post-Soviet period the holiday turned into massive political gatherings of supporters of radically minded politicians. For instance, an action dubbed as "a rally of communist-oriented organisations" was held in Red Square in 1992. The rally began with performance of the Soviet Union anthem and raising the Red Flag and ended with appeals from the leader of opposition movement Working Moscow, Viktor Anpilov, "for early dismissal of President Boris Yeltsin, ousting [[Moscow Mayor]] [[Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov|Gavriil Popov]] from power and putting the latter on trial". Since 1992, May Day is officially called "The Day of Spring and Labour", and remains a major holiday in present-day Russia.

===Serbia===
In Serbia, 1 May (and also 2 May) is a day off work and a day out of school. It is one of the major popular holidays, and the only official holiday from socialist times that is still officially celebrated. People celebrate it all over the country. By tradition 1 May is celebrated by countryside picnics and outdoor barbecues. May is marked by warm weather in Serbia. In [[Belgrade]], the capital, most people go to {{lang|sr|[[Avala]]|italic=no}} or {{lang|sr|[[Košutnjak]]|italic=no}}, which are parks located in {{lang|sr|Rakovica|italic=no}} and {{lang|sr|Čukarica|italic=no}}. People go around the country to enjoy nature. A major religious holiday of {{lang|sr|[[Djurdjevdan]]|italic=no}} is on 6 May so quite often days off work are given to connect these two holidays and weekend, creating a small spring break. 1 May is celebrated by most of the population regardless of political views.

===Slovakia===
In Slovakia, 1 May is a day off work and a day out of school. Celebrations are usually connected also with the commemoration of the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|entry of the Slovak Republic into the European Union]] (1 May 2004).

===Slovenia===
In Slovenia, 1 May (and also 2 May) is a day off work and a day out of school. There are many official celebrations all over the country. In [[Ljubljana]], the capital, many people go to Rožnik Hill in the city. On the night of 30 April, bonfires are burned on many hills.

===Spain===
{{Main|Labor Day in Spain}}
In Spain, the 1 May celebration was established after the death of [[Francisco Franco]] in 1975; before that, it had been celebrated during the [[Spanish Second Republic]] period (1931–1939), but it was banned afterwards by the Franco regime. The first time it was celebrated was in 1977, when the [[Communist Party of Spain]] was legalized. Since then, it has become an official holiday that has been traditionally used by trade unions and leftist parties for social and labour vindications. Commonly, peaceful demonstrations and parades occur in major and minor cities.

===Sweden===

The party has dominated Swedish politics for nearly a century. The [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|trade union palace]] in Stockholm is seen at the end of the picture.]]
1 May has been an important part of Swedish history since the late 19th century. The day was made a [[public holiday]] in 1938 but had been celebrated by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] and the [[vänsterpartiet|left]] since 1890. The first May Day celebration gathered more than 50,000 people in central Stockholm. The crowd went to hear speeches by the leading figures in the [[Swedish labour movement]] such as [[Hjalmar Branting]] (later [[prime minister]]), [[August Palm]] and [[Hinke Bergegren]]. During [[World War I]] the demonstrations mainly had a peace message and the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal Party]] also joined the demonstrations. The [[8-hour working day]] and [[women's suffrage]] were the principal themes during the troubled times after World War I.

Recognizing the central contributions of workers and international worker solidarity in Swedish social, economic, political and cultural development, May Day demonstrations are an important part of Swedish politics and culture for social democrats, left parties, and unions. In Stockholm the  [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] always marches towards [[Norra Bantorget]], the historical, physical centre of the Swedish labour movement, where they hold speeches in front of the headquarters of the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]], while the smaller [[Vänsterpartiet|Left Party]] marches in larger numbers&lt;ref&gt;[http://storstockholm.vansterpartiet.se/2012/jonas-sjostedt-talar-pa-sveriges-storsta-forsta-maj-firande/ Jonas Sjöstedt talar på Sveriges största första maj-firande | Vänsterpartiet Storstockholm]. Storstockholm.vansterpartiet.se. Retrieved on 1 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; towards [[Kungsträdgården]]. 

Since 1967, the [[Communist Party (Sweden)|Communist Party]] and its [[youth wing]], [[Revolutionary Communist Youth (Sweden)|Revolutionary Communist Youth]], have held their own May Day march, known as {{lang|sv|Röd Front}} ('Red Front').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Röd Front 40 år |url=http://www.proletaren.se/ledare/rod-front-40-ar |accessdate=26 April 2017 |publisher=Proletären |date=24 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Röd Front marches were held at 33 locations across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Röd Front 2016 i bilder |url=http://www.kommunisterna.org/nyheter/2016/05/rod-front-2016 |website=Kommunistiska Partiet |accessdate=26 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Röd Front marches are usually held in the industrial and financial port town of [[Gothenburg]], Sweden's second-largest city and one of the party's strongholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Röd Front runt om i landet |url=http://www.kommunisterna.org/nyheter/2014/05/rod-front-runt-om-i-landet |website=Kommunistiska Partiet |accessdate=26 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rothelius |first1=Lars |title=Röd front 1 maj 2015|url=http://www.proletaren.se/rod-front-1-maj-2015 |accessdate=26 April 2017 |publisher=Proletären |date=1 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the status of 1 May differs depending on the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] and sometimes on the municipality. Labour Day is known as {{lang|de|Tag der Arbeit}} in German-speaking cantons, as {{lang|fr|Fête du travail}} in the French-speaking cantons, and as {{lang|it|Festa del lavoro}} in the Italian-speaking canton of {{lang|it|[[Ticino]]|italic=no}}.

* In the cantons of {{lang|de|[[Basel-Landschaft]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|[[Basel-Stadt]]|italic=no}}, [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], {{lang|fr|[[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]]|italic=no}}, and {{lang|de|[[Canton of Zurich|Zürich]]|italic=no}}, Labour Day is an official public holiday equal to Sundays, based on federal law ({{lang|de|Bundesgesetz über die Arbeit in Industrie, Gewerbe und Handel}}, article 20a).
* In the cantons of {{lang|de|[[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|[[Thurgau]]|italic=no}}, and {{lang|it|Ticino|italic=no}}, Labour Day is an official "day off" ({{lang|de|Ruhetag}}). This is equal in practice to an official public holiday, but is not based on federal law and cantonal regulations may differ in details.
* In the canton of [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] it is an official half-day holiday (starting at 12 noon).
* In the canton of {{lang|fr|[[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]]|italic=no}}, public servants get the afternoon off, many companies follow this practice.
* In the canton of {{lang|de|[[Aargau]]|italic=no}} it is not an official holiday, but most employees get the afternoon off.
* In the municipalities of {{lang|de|[[Hildisrieden]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|de|[[Schüpfheim]]|italic=no}} (both in the canton of [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]) as well as in {{lang|de|[[Muotathal]]|italic=no}} (canton of {{lang|de|[[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]]|italic=no}}), 1 May is an official public holiday, but as commemoration day of the local [[patron saint]], not as Labour Day. In the other parts of the cantons of Lucerne and {{lang|de|Schwyz|italic=no}}, 1 May is a regular work day.
* In all other cantons, 1 May is a regular work day.

The largest Labour Day celebrations in Switzerland are held in the city of {{lang|de|[[Zürich]]|italic=no}}. Each year, {{lang|de|Zürich|italic=no}}'s 1 May committee, together with the [[Swiss Federation of Trade Unions]], organizes a festival and 1 May rally. It is the largest rally held on a regular basis in Switzerland.

===Turkey===
[[File:May day clashes in 2013.jpg|thumb|Istanbul May Day clashes in 2013]]
[[File:Istanbul May Day 2012.JPG|thumb|Workers marching to Taksim Square, 1 May 2012]]
1 May is an official holiday celebrated in Turkey. It was a holiday until 1981 when it was cancelled after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 coup d'état]]. In 2010, the Turkish government restored the holiday after some casualties and demonstrations. [[Taksim Square]] is the centre of the celebrations due to the [[Taksim Square massacre]].

Workers' Day was first celebrated in 1912 in {{lang|tr|[[İstanbul]]|italic=no}}, in 1911 in {{lang|tr|[[Thessaloniki|Selânik]]|italic=no}} and in 1899 in {{lang|tr|[[İzmir]]|italic=no}}. After the establishment of the Turkish Republic, it became an official holiday. In 1924, it was forbidden by a decree and in both 1924 and 1925, demonstrations were intervened by arm floats. In 1935, The National Assembly declared Workers' Day to be a holiday again.&lt;ref name="marksist.com"&gt;[http://www.marksist.com/utku_kizilok/isgunu_mucadelesi_ve_1_mayis_in_dogusu.htm İşgünü Mücadelesi ve 1 Mayıs’ın Doğuşu | sınıf mücadelesinde Marksist Tutum]. Marksist.com. Retrieved on 1 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events leading to the [[1980 Turkish coup d'etat]], a massacre occurred on 1 May 1977 (Taksim Square massacre), in which unknown people ([[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]) opened fire on the crowd.  The crowd was the biggest in Turkish workers' history with the number of people approximating 500,000. In the next two years, provocations and confusion continued and peaked before the 1980 coup d'etat. The Workers' Day holiday was cancelled once again. Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcast on TV showed that two participants in the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces. Thus, 1 May 1996 has been remembered by workers' movements.&lt;ref name="marksist.com"/&gt;

In 2007, the 30th anniversary of the [[Taksim square massacre]], leftist workers' unions wanted to commemorate the massacre in Taksim square. Since the government would not let them into the square, 580–700 people were stopped and 1 person died under police control. After these events, the government declared 1 May as "Work and Solidarity Day" but not as a holiday. In the next year, the day was declared as a holiday, but people were still not allowed to gather in Taksim Square.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090531134748/http://rega.basbakanlik.gov.tr/eskiler/2009/04/20090427-1.htm Ulusal bayram ve genel tati̇ller hakkında kanunda]. rega.basbakanlik.gov.tr (22 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The year 2008 was remembered with police violence in Istanbul. Police fired tear gas grenades among the crowds, and into hospitals and a primary school. Workers pushed forward so that in 2010, 140,000 people gathered in Taksim, and in 2011 there were more than half a million demonstrators.

After 3 years of peaceful meetings in 2013, meetings in [[Taksim Square]] were forbidden by the government. Clashes occurred between police and workers; [[water cannon]] and [[tear gas]] have been widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/05/01/may-day-clashes-in-turkey/ |title=Clashes mar International Workers’ Day in Turkey &amp;#124; euronews, world news |publisher=Euronews.com |date= |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
It is a public holiday in Ukraine, inherited from the Soviet era. Until 2018 May 2 was also a public holiday (as in the Soviet era), instead in 2017 [[Western Christianity]]'s [[Christmas]] celibrated 25 December become a new Ukrainian public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.digitaljournal.com/news/world/ukraine-seeks-distance-from-moscow-with-new-christmas-holiday/article/507753|title=Ukraine seeks distance from Moscow with new Christmas holiday|website=m.digitaljournal.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCU42008437b"&gt;{{uk icon}} {{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news-42008437|title=Рада зробила 25 грудня вихідним днем|date=2017-11-16|work=BBC Україна|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 May's International Workers' Day remained a Ukrainian public holiday, although it was renamed (also in 2017) from "Day of International Solidarity of Workers" to "Labour Day".&lt;ref name="BBCU42008437b"/&gt;

In 2015, May Day rallies were banned in [[Kiev|Kyiv]] and [[Kharkiv]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/kharkiv-court-bans-communist-march-rally-on-may-1-387066.html Kharkiv court bans Communist march, rally on May 1]". [[Kyiv Post]]. 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late May 2015 [[Decommunization in Ukraine|laws that ban communist symbols]] came into effect in Ukraine, thus banning communist symbols, singing the Soviet national hymn or the Internationale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/21/ukraine-bans-soviet-symbols-criminalises-sympathy-for-communism |title=Ukraine bans Soviet symbols and criminalises sympathy for communism |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Interior Minister [[Arsen Avakov]] during the 2016 May Day rallies in some major cities the number of [[National Police of Ukraine|police officers]] far outnumbered the number of rally participants.&lt;ref name="mptrmd16U"/&gt; With in [[Dnipro]] 193 policemen protecting 25 rally participants.&lt;ref name="mptrmd16U"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7107361/ Avakov: "May Day rallies" passed without incident and noise], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (1 May 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:May Day in London.jpg|thumb|The Stalin banner belonging to the [[CPGB-ML]], featured in every London International Workers' Day rally since 2008]]

The spring bank holiday in the [[United Kingdom]] known as May Day was created in 1978 and is held on the first Monday in May each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bankholidays-uk.com/may-day/ May Day UK dates]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many traditional [[May Day#United Kingdom|May Day]] rites and celebrations, some of which have been held for hundreds of years. However, it wasn't until the late 20th century that May Day in Great Britain became linked to International Workers' Day, and the holiday is not officially a "Labour Day".

In recent years, the [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] movement has organized a number of large protests in [[London]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[Doncaster]]. In London, these have resulted in clashes with the police. In 2000, the clashes ended with a branch of [[McDonald's]] being smashed and a statue of [[Winston Churchill]] being given a grass [[Mohawk hairstyle]]. The [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|Cenotaph]] was also defaced with [[graffiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/732467.stm |title=Violence at May Day protest |publisher=BBC News |date=1 May 2000 |accessdate=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rutherford | first = Jonathan | author-link = Jonathan Rutherford | title = After Seattle | journal = Review of Education, Pedagogy and Cultural Studies | volume = 24 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 13–27 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/10714410212924 | date = 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10714410212924 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years, demonstrations have been more peaceful, with marches and gatherings, particularly in central London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4951406.stm |title=Workers in London May Day march |publisher=BBC News |date=1 May 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-led coalition government]] in March 2011 announced plans to move the May Day bank holiday to October to lengthen the tourist season,&lt;ref name="MayDayabolishedUK"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12640636|work=BBC News|title=May Day bank holiday plans unveiled|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although as of 2017 nothing had come of this. A London rally on May Day is organized by the London May Day Organising Committee.

===Australia===
[[File:Labourday1.jpg|thumb|The Labour Day March in Brisbane, Queensland is the largest rally in Australia.]]
While unofficial activities and commemorations associated with International Workers Day occur on May Day in Australia, [[Labour Day]] in the various states and territories generally falls on other days. Only in the [[Northern Territory]] (where it is called May Day) and [[Queensland]] is Labour Day celebrated on the first Monday in May, which is a public holiday under the name of "May Day". [[Queensland]] holds the biggest rallies in Australia, with the rally in [[Brisbane]] averaging 30,000 people. There are also rallies held in [[Cairns]], [[Rockhampton]], [[Townsville]], [[Barcaldine, Queensland|Barcaldine]], [[Ipswich, Queensland| Ipswich]], [[Toowoomba]] and other regional centres.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand workers were among the first in the world to claim the right for an eight-hour working day when, in 1840, the carpenter Samuel Parnell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/samuel-parnell|title=Samuel Parnell {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; won an eight-hour day in Wellington. Labour Day was first celebrated in New Zealand on 28 October 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/keyword/labour-day|title=Labour Day {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Labour day falls every year on the fourth Monday of October.

'''KOSMICA''' is an [[institute]] that runs poetical and critical projects about [[outer space]] activities and their impact on [[Earth]]. Its central activity is a series of curated [[festival]]s worldwide with over 20 editions in countries like [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[France]], [[Mexico]] and [[Belgium]]. KOSMICA also counts with other activities such as [[educational program]]mes, [[publishing]] and other curated activities. It has local offices in [[Berlin]] (Germany) and [[Mexico City]] (Mexico), with partner organisations in [[London]] (UK) and [[Montreal]] (Canada).

== History ==
KOSMICA Institute was founded in 2011 by Berlin-based artist [[Nahum (Artist, Musician)|Nahum]] in partnership with [[Arts Catalyst|The Art Catalyst]] in London.

KOSMICA Journeys started with a collaboration with Hangar 1 in Berlin. Over a month KOSMICA delivered weekly workshops at the refugee center located at the Tempelhofer Feld in Berlin.

This is a partial list of social and cultural phenomena specific to the Internet, also known as [[Internet meme]]s, such as popular themes, [[catchphrase]]s, images, [[viral video]]s, and jokes. When such fads and sensations occur online, they tend to grow rapidly and become more widespread because the instant communication facilitates [[word of mouth]].

==World's first Internet sensation==
{{See also|Beanie Babies#Internet}}
The world's first Internet sensation met the Internet in 1995 when [[Ty, Inc.]] introduced [[Beanie Babies]] to the online world.  The toy craze was aligned with the growth of the Internet.  At the time, the Internet was primarily used on college campuses for research.  A college student, named [[Lina Trivedi]], who worked for Ty, Inc. introduced the toy company's President, [[Ty Warner]], to the concept of the Internet. Warner devoted resources into research and development of the Beanie Babies Web site and Trivedi developed the first [[business to consumer]] [[Website]] ever created.&lt;ref name=beanies&gt;{{cite book|last=Bissonnette|first=Zac|date=March 2015|title=The Great Beanie Baby Bubble: Mass Delusion and the Dark Side of Cute|url=|location=|publisher=Penguin Books|chapter=The $12-per-hour Sociology Major Who Made Ty Warner a Billionaire| pages=107–121|isbn=1591846021}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very quickly, the collectability of Beanie Babies grew exponentially as collectors were now able to see all the Beanie Babies that were available on the Internet, as well as new releases that were coming out, and which Beanie Babies were retiring.  Ultimately, the Internet fueled the Beanie Babies phenomenon.&lt;ref name=BeaniesNYPost&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Beanie Baby Craze was Concocted — Then Crashed |url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/22/how-the-beanie-baby-craze-was-concocted-then-crashed/ |work=New York Post |author=Larry Getlen |date=February 22, 2015 |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This resulted in Beanie Babies evolving into an instant collectible market that spawned thousands of Websites specifically designed to chronicle these toys.  Beanie Babies grew in popularity quicker than any other phenomenon prior to its time due to the instant nature of the Internet.  Crazes prior to Beanie Babies took years to gain traction, however Beanie Babies were able to become a worldwide phenomenon within months due to the ability of people to create Web pages and share information on the Internet.  Beanie Babies were the first worldwide craze fueled by the Internet.&lt;ref name=BeaniesWashPost&gt;{{cite news |title=Now On The Internet: A Collectors' Frenzy For Beanie Babies |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/11/23/now-on-the-internet-a-collectors-frenzy-for-beanie-babies/2cf7f194-2d29-46a3-9508-32207f38ff7a/ |work=Washington Post |author=Margaret Webb Pressler |date=November 23, 1997 |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After seeing announcements on the Internet, people would line up at mall shops with their gates still down in hopes to get the most valuable Beanie Babies.&lt;ref name=BeaniesVanFair&gt;{{cite news |title=The Life and Death of the Princess Diana Beanie Baby Market |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/08/princess-diana-beanie-babies-20th-anniversary |work=Vanity Fair |author=Kase Wickman |date=August 20, 2017 |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many were buying and then trading these toys through Internet Websites for hundreds of dollars and building collections of toys that were exceeding $100,000 in value.&lt;ref name=BeaniesWSJ&gt;{{cite news |title=Ready for a Bear Market?

Logged-in viewers to the channel can enter commands corresponding to the physical inputs used in the [[Japanese role-playing game|JRPG]] video game ''[[Pokémon Red]]'' into the chat window, which are collected and parsed by a chat software robot that uses the commands to control the main character in the game, which is then live-streamed from the channel. The stream attracted more than 80,000 simultaneous players with over 10 million views with a week of going live, creating a chaotic series of movements and actions within the game and a number of original memes and derivative fan art.

'''Documentary film festivals''' are [[film festival]]s devoted solely to [[documentary film]], which is a broad category of visual expression that is based on the attempt, in one fashion or another, to "[[document]]" reality.

Although "documentary film" originally referred to movies shot on [[film stock]], it has subsequently expanded to include [[video]] and [[new media|digital]] productions that can be either [[direct-to-video]] or made for a [[television series]]. Documentary, as it applies here, works to identify a "filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nichols|first=Bill|chapter=Foreword|editor1-first=Barry Keith|editor1-last=Grant|editor2-first=Jeannette|editor2-last=Sloniowski|title=Documenting The Documentary: Close Readings of Documentary Film and Video|location=[[Detroit]]|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year= 1998|isbn=978-0-8143-2639-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cities around the world, documentary film festivals are held annually to showcase documentaries made that year. Many of them are theme or genre specific.

Russian Research Institute (IKI). 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a planned lunar polar orbiter, part of the [[Luna-Glob]] program, by the Russian space agency [[Roscosmos]]. In addition to its scientific role, the Luna 26 orbiter would also function as a telecomm relay between Earth and Russian landed assets.&lt;ref name= RSW&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/luna_glob_orbiter.html Luna-Glob Orbiter (Luna-Glob 2/Luna 26].

''The Planetary Society''. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The Luna 26 orbiter mission has been in planning since at least 2011.&lt;ref name= RSW/&gt;  Originally it was envisioned to be launched to the Moon together with the lunar lander [[Luna 27]] which will land on the [[South Pole–Aitken basin]], an unexplored area on the [[far side of the Moon]],&lt;ref name="Gosh BBC 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34504067 |title=Europe and Russia mission to assess Moon settlement |work=BBC News |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=2015-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA Lunar Exploration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/leag2014/presentations/carpenter.pdf |title=ESA’s plans for Lunar Exploration |work=European Space Agency (ESA) |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://congrexprojects.com/2014-events/14c05a/introduction |title=Russia-ESA Lunar Exploration Cooperation: Luna Mission Speed Dating |work=European Space Agency (ESA) |date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=2015-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but because of mass limitations, they will be launched separately.&lt;ref name= RSW/&gt; The orbiter's mass is about 2,100&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name= RSW/&gt;

The objective of the orbiter is to locate and quantify usable resources and materials that [[in situ resource utilization|can be exploited]] by future landed missions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sergey_Krasilnikov/publication/320471564_Sources_of_materials_at_the_three_high-priority_landing_sites_of_the_Luna-Glob_mission/links/59e763ac0f7e9bed362beb26/Sources-of-materials-at-the-three-high-priority-landing-sites-of-the-Luna-Glob-mission.pdf Sources of materials at the three high-priority landing sites of the Luna-Glob mission] (PDF).

==International collaboration==

The [[European Space Agency]](ESA) will contribute to this and other [[Luna-Glob]] missions in the manner of communications, precision landing, hazard avoidance, drilling, sampling, sample analysis and ground support.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lunarvolatiles.nasa.gov/current-activities/ Exploring and Using Lunar Polar Volatiles].

==Scientific payload==

The scientific payload on board the orbiter is composed of fourteen instruments&lt;ref name= RSW/&gt; that will be fabricated by Russia and by some European partners.&lt;ref name= RSW/&gt; The payload will study the lunar surface and the environment around the Moon, including the [[solar wind]], and high-energy [[cosmic rays]].&lt;ref name= RSW/&gt; The orbiter may carry some NASA instruments, or instruments from private USA companies.&lt;ref name='Cooperation 2017'/&gt;  Luna 26 will also scout sites for the next [[Luna 27]] landing mission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://search.proquest.com/openview/4c044642c36b74f9367296d892c5a5f9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=40798 The "Simplest Satellite" That Opened up the Universe].

The '''Lyric Theatre''' is a [[West End theatre]] on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] in the [[City of Westminster]].

Designed by the architect [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]], it was built by the producer Henry Leslie with profits from the [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[B. C. Stephenson]] hit, ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' (he made £100,000 from this opera),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/LyricTheatre.htm The Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, London, W.1]&lt;/ref&gt; which he transferred from the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] to open his new venue on 17 December 1888. It was the second theatre to be constructed on this stretch of Shaftesbury Avenue and is now the oldest in the street. The foyer and bars were refurbished in 1932–33, and the facade was restored in 1994.  At present it seats 915 on four levels, although originally it was designed with a [[seating capacity]] of 1,306.

Early in the theatre's history, it staged mostly [[comic opera]]s, and later it has been a home to light comedies, musicals and straight dramas.

The theatre retains many of its original features (including being built behind an original 1767 house front, at the rear to Great Windmill Street, the former house and museum of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|Sir William Hunter]]) and the theatre was [[listed building|Grade II listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in September 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=427103 English Heritage listing details] accessed 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lyric Theatre still uses water to operate its iron curtain.  Water was originally pumped from the river Thames to West End theatres and hotels and used to hydraulically operate heavy machinery like lifts.  Hydraulic pressure is now provided by electric pump, but it can also be operated manually by two people.

The Lyric Theatre has been owned by [[Nimax Theatres]] since 2005 when [[Nica Burns]] and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased it from the [[Really Useful Group]] (establishing the new Nimax group with the [[Apollo Theatre]], [[Garrick Theatre]] and [[Duchess Theatre]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4672413.stm | title=Lloyd Webber sells four theatres | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maggio Musicale Fiorentino''' is an annual Italian arts festival in Florence, including a notable [[list of opera festivals|opera festival]], under the auspices of the Opera di Firenze.  The festival occurs between late April into June annually, typically with four operas.

In April 1933, [[Vittorio Gui]] founded the festival, with the aim of presenting contemporary and forgotten [[opera]]s in visually dramatic productions.  It was the first music festival in Italy.  The first opera presented was [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s early ''[[Nabucco]]'', his early operas then being rarely staged.  The first festival's success, which included two performances of Spontini's ''[[La Vestale]]'' with [[Rosa Ponselle]], led to it becoming a biennial event in 1937 with the presentation of nine operas.  After 1937, it became an annual festival, except during [[World War II]]. Performances took place in the [[Teatro Comunale Florence|Teatro Comunale]] and Piccolo Teatro, plus the [[Teatro della Pergola]].  A new opera house, the Teatro dell'Opera di Firenze, was inaugurated in 2011 and permanently replaced the former Teatro Comunale in 2014.

Former musical directors were [[Vittorio Gui]] (1928-1936), [[Mario Rossi]] (1937-1946), [[Bruno Bartoletti]] (1957-1964), and [[Riccardo Muti]] (1969-1981).  [[Zubin Mehta]] became principal conductor in 1985, and now has the title of honorary conductor for life.  In January 2016, the Opera di Firenze announced the appointment of [[Fabio Luisi]] as music director of the festival, the first conductor to hold that title, as of April 2018, with an initial contract of 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2016/1/News/Fabio_Luisi_Opera_di_Firenze_Musical_Director.html | title=Fabio Luisi Named as Music Director Designate of Florence's Opera di Firenze and Maggio Musicale Fiorentino | work=Opera News | author= | date=28 January 2016 | accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, due to government funding cuts, two of the four operas (''[[Billy Budd (opera)|Billy Budd]]'' and ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'') were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Master Olof''''' ({{lang-sv|Mäster Olof}}) is a [[historical drama]] in five acts by the Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]]. The story is about the [[Protestant Reformer|reformer]] [[Olaus Petri]]'s struggle against the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the 16th century. First written in 1872, Strindberg rewrote it many times in both prose and verse.

Ludvig Josephson (the new artistic director of Stockholm's [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|New Theatre]]) agreed to stage ''Master Olof'', eventually opting for the prose version—the five-hour-long première opened on 30 December 1881 under the direction of August Lindberg to favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1985, 89, 95). Lane gives the length of the production as six hours. The name of the theatre in Swedish is Nya Teatern. Two theatres in Stockholm have used this name (one is now known as the [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)|Swedish Theatre]] while the other, [[Mindre teatern]], was demolished in 1908). August Lindberg took over from [[Edvard Stjernström]], who founded the one now known as the Swedish Theatre; see Lane (1998, 1040) and Meyer (1985, 89).&lt;/ref&gt; This production represented Strindberg's breakthrough in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1998, 1040).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
McIver is originally from [[San Jose, California]] and moved to New York City at age 14 on a Ford Foundation Scholarship for dance. In New York, McIver trained at [[George Balanchine]]'s [[School of American Ballet]] during the summers of 1965 and 1966, and was enrolled full-time in the advanced division courses at the School of American Ballet 1967–70.&lt;ref name="Chan-2016"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Melissa |date=July 20, 2016 |title=Who Is Melania Trump's Speech Writer Meredith McIver? |work=[[TIME]] |url=http://time.com/4415378/meredith-mciver-donald-trump-speech/|accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later earned an English degree at the University of Utah, graduating with honors in 1976.&lt;ref name="Chan-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Amber |date=July 20, 2016 |title=Who is Meredith McIver, the Trump staffer who took the fall for Melania’s speech? |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/20/who-is-meredith-mciver-the-trump-staffer-who-took-the-fall-for-melanias-speech/ |accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional dancer==
In 1981, McIver appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the revival of ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'', a production which closed after five performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dale |first=Michael |date=July 21, 2016 |title=Trump Speechwriter Meredith McIver Was Once a Broadway Baby |work=Broadway World |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Trump-Speechwriter-Meredith-McIver-Was-Once-a-Broadway-Baby-20160721 |accessdate=July 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trump affiliation==
In the 2000s, McIver worked with [[Donald Trump]] as both an assistant and as a ghostwriter.&lt;ref name="Queenan-2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood-2007"/&gt;  She co-authored ''Trump: Think Like a Billionaire'' (2005) and several other books, with Trump.&lt;ref name="Queenan-2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CopyCoAuthor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Copy|first1=Jack|title=Donald Trump likes to send notes to editors, compare bestseller stacks|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/04/donald-trump-from-good-paper-stock-to-bad.html|accessdate=28 July 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007 Trump deposition ===
In 2007, in a [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] in a defamation lawsuit he brought against [[Timothy L. O'Brien]], Donald Trump named McIver as the likely author, in two books they wrote together, of overstated claims of his indebtedness in the midst of the 1990s real estate market crash, making his financial comeback appear more significant.&lt;ref name="Horowitz-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2430267/trumps-lawsuit-on-net-worth.pdf |title=Deposition of Donald J.

=== Speech plagiarism controversy ===
{{See also|2016 Republican National Convention#Melania Trump's speech and plagiarism controversy}}
In July 2016, McIver contributed to a speech for [[Melania Trump]], which Trump read at the [[2016 Republican National Convention]] on July 19, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haberman |first=Maggie |date=July 19, 2016 |title=How Melania Trump’s Speech Veered Off Course and Caused an Uproar |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/us/politics/melania-trump-convention-speech.html |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was later found to have plagiarized passages from a [[Michelle Obama]] speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dvorsky |first=George |date=July 20, 2016&lt;!--"Wednesday", see also access date--&gt; |title=Scientific Proof That Melania Trump's Speech Was Definitely Stolen From Michelle Obama |work=[[Gizmodo]] |url=https://gizmodo.com/scientific-proof-that-melania-trump-s-speech-was-defini-1783966093 |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Muise |first=Monique |date=July 19, 2016 |title=Chances that Melania Trump didn’t plagiarize Michelle Obama 1 in 87 billion: expert |work=[[Global News]] |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2834389/chances-that-melania-trump-didnt-plagiarize-michelle-obama-1-in-87-billion-expert/ |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIver later issued a statement explaining that Trump had shared with her a passage from Obama's 2008 convention speech as an example of her feelings. Due to a misunderstanding, McIver thought the passage expressed Trump's own thinking, so she included that passage in the speech. According to the [[Associated Press]], "McIver took the blame but made it clear that Mrs. Trump knew the passages were from the first lady's speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ohlemacher |first=Stephen |date=July 20, 2016 |title=Trump speechwriter apologizes for Melania Trump's speech |location=Lakeland, FL |work=[[The Ledger]] |url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20160720/NEWS/160729994?p=all&amp;tc=pgall&amp;tc=ar |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump family declined McIver's offer to resign over the incident.&lt;ref name="McIverApologized"&gt;{{cite news |last=Diamond |first=Jeremy |date=July 20, 2016 |title=Trump aide offers resignation in Melania Trump plagiarism incident |work=[[CNN]] |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/20/politics/trump-aide-offers-resignation-in-melania-trump-plagiarism-incident/index.html |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=You decide: Did Melania plagiarize Michelle's '08 speech? |work=[[Fox News]] |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/5041589176001/you-decide-did-melania-plagiarize-michelles-08-speech/?#sp=show-clips |accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[business]] [[management]], '''micromanagement''' is a management style whereby a manager closely observes and/or controls the work of his/her subordinates or [[employee]]s. 

Micromanagement is generally considered to have a negative [[connotation]], mainly due to the fact that it shows a lack of freedom in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;Chambers, Harry (2004). [http://www.bkconnection.com/static/mywayPR.pdf ''My Way or the Highway'']. Berrett Koehler Publishers, San Francisco. Retrieved on 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Micromanagement |newspaper=Small Business Resource Centre (2006) |url=http://www.smbresource.com/micromanagement.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724040432/http://www.smbresource.com/micromanagement.html |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]] defines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/micromanage "Micromanage"], via ''Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; micromanagement as "manage[ment] especially with excessive control or attention on details". [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]] defines micromanagement as "manage[ment] or control with excessive attention to minor details".&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com (2008). [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/micromanage ''Definition of micromanage'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The online dictionary [[Encarta]] defined micromanagement as "atten[tion] to small details in management: control [of] a person or a situation by paying extreme attention to small details".&lt;ref&gt;Encarta Dictionary (2008). [http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=micromanage ''Definition of micromanage'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5yd3aW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q%3Dmicromanage Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of micromanagement can be extended to any social context where one person takes a [[bullying|bully]] approach in the level of control and influence over the members of a group. Often, this excessive obsession with the most minute of details causes a direct management failure in the ability to focus on the major details.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

==Symptoms==
Rather than giving general instructions on smaller tasks and then devoting time to supervising larger concerns, the micromanager monitors and assesses every step of a business process and avoids [[delegation]] of decisions.&lt;ref name=McConnell&gt;McConnell, Charles (2006). [http://www.nfib.com/object/IO_31411.html ''Micromanagement is Mismanagement'']. National Federation of Independent Business. Retrieved on 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Micromanagers are usually irritated when a subordinate makes decisions without consulting them, even if the decisions are within the subordinate's level of authority.

Micromanagement also frequently involves requests for [[TPS report#In popular culture|unnecessary and overly detailed reports]] ("reportomania"). A micromanager tends to require constant and detailed performance feedback and to focus excessively on procedural trivia (often in detail greater than they can actually process) rather than on overall performance, quality and results. This focus on "low-level" trivia often delays decisions, clouds overall goals and objectives, restricts the flow of information between employees, and guides the various aspects of a project in different and often opposed directions. Many micromanagers accept such inefficiencies as less important than their retention of control or of the appearance of control.

It is common for micromanagers, especially those who exhibit [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] tendencies and/or micromanage deliberately and for [[Strategy|strategic]] reasons, to [[delegate]] work to subordinates and then micromanage those subordinates' performance, enabling the micromanagers in question to both [[Plagiarism|take credit]] for positive results and [[Fall guy|shift the blame]] for negative results to their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David. ''Narcissism: Behind the Mask'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; These micromanagers thereby delegate accountability for failure but not the [[Ought implies can|authority to take alternative actions]] that would have led to success or at least to the mitigation of that failure.

The most extreme cases of micromanagement constitute a management pathology closely related to [[workplace bullying]] and [[narcissism|narcissistic]] behavior. Micromanagement resembles addiction in that although most micromanagers are behaviorally dependent on control over others, both as a lifestyle and as a means of maintaining that lifestyle, many of them fail to recognize and acknowledge their dependence even when everyone around them observes it.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; Some severe cases of micromanagement arise from other underlying mental health conditions such as [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]]. (Renee Kowalski)

Although micromanagement is often easily recognized by employees, micromanagers rarely view themselves as such. In a form of [[denial]] similar to that found in addictive behavior, micromanagers will often rebut allegations of micromanagement by offering a competing characterization of their management style such as "structured", "organized", or "[[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionistic]]".

==Compared with mismanagement==
Micromanagement can be distinguished from the mere tendency of a manager to perform duties assigned to a subordinate. When a manager can perform a worker's job more efficiently than the worker can, the result is merely suboptimal management: although the company suffers [[Opportunity cost|lost opportunities]] because such managers would serve the company even better by doing their own job (see [[comparative advantage]]). In micromanagement, the manager not only tells a subordinate what to do but dictates that the job be done a certain way regardless of whether that way is the most effective or efficient one.

==Causes==
The most frequent motivations for micromanagement, such as detail-orientedness, [[emotional insecurity]], and doubts regarding [[Competence (human resources)|employees' competence]], are internal and related to the personality of the manager. Since manager-employee relationships include a difference in power and often in age, workplace psychologists have used models based on [[transference]] theory to draw analogies between micromanagement relationships and dysfunctional parent-child relationships, ''e.g.'', that both often feature the frequent imposition of [[double bind]]s and/or a tendency by the authority figure to exhibit [[Criticism#Hypercriticism|hypercriticality]].&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; However, external factors such as organizational culture, severe or increased time or performance pressure, severe demands of the regulatory environment, and instability of managerial position (either specific to a micromanager's position or throughout an organization) may also play a role.

In many cases of micromanagement, managers select and implement processes and procedures not for business reasons but rather to enable themselves to feel useful and valuable and/or create the appearance of being so. A frequent cause of such micromanagement patterns is a manager's perception or fear that they lack the competence and creative capability necessary for their position in the larger corporate structure. In reaction to this fear, the manager creates a "fiefdom" within which the manager selects performance standards not on the basis of their relevance to the corporation's interest but rather on the basis of the ability of the manager's division to satisfy them.

Such motivations for micromanagement often intensify, at both the individual-manager and the organization-wide level, during times of economic hardship. In some cases, managers may have proper goals in mind but place disproportionate emphasis on the role of their division and/or on their own personal role in the furtherance of those goals. In others, managers throughout an organization may engage in behavior that, while protective of their division's interests or their personal interests, harms the organization as a whole.

Micromanagement can also stem from a breakdown in the fundamentals of delegation. When a task or project is delegated in an unclear way, or where there is a lack of trust between the manager and the person doing the work, micromanagement naturally ensues. Clearer delegation, with a well defined goal, clear vision of the constraints and dependencies, and effective oversight, can help prevent micromanagement.&lt;ref name="Canner and Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canner|first1=Niko|last2=Bernstein|first2=Ethan|title=Why is Micromanagement So Infectious?|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=August 17, 2016|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-is-micromanagement-so-infectious|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less frequently, micromanagement is a tactic consciously chosen for the purpose of eliminating unwanted employees: A micromanager may set unreachable standards later invoked as grounds for termination of those employees. These standards may be either specific to certain employees or generally applicable but selectively enforced only against particular employees. Alternatively, the micromanager may attempt by this or other means to create a stressful workplace in which the undesired employees no longer desire to participate. When such stress is severe or pervasive enough, its creation may be regarded as [[constructive dismissal|constructive discharge]] (also known in the United Kingdom as "constructive dismissal" and in the United States as "constructive termination").

==Effects==
Regardless of a micromanager's [[Motivation|motive]] for their conduct, its potential effects include:
* Creation of ''[[ex post]]'' [[resentment]] in both ''vertical'' (manager-subordinate) and ''horizontal'' (subordinate-subordinate) relationships
* Damage to ''[[ex ante]]'' trust in both vertical and horizontal relationships
* Interference with existing [[teamwork]] and inhibition of future teamwork in both vertical relationships (''e.g.'', via [[malicious compliance]]) and horizontal relationships (''e.g.'', exploitation of [[moral hazard]] created by poorly proportioned effort-reward structures).

Because a pattern of micromanagement suggests to employees that a manager does not trust their work or judgment, it is a major factor in triggering employee disengagement, often to the point of promoting a dysfunctional and [[hostile work environment]] in which one or more managers, or even management generally, are labeled "control freaks."&lt;ref&gt;Bielaszka-DuVernay, Christina (2008). [http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/hmu/2008/02/micromanage-at-your-peril.php Micromanage at Your Peril] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707150829/http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/hmu/2008/02/micromanage-at-your-peril.php |date=7 July 2012 }}. ''Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation''. Retrieved on 23 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Disengaged employees invest time, but not effort or creativity, in the work in which they are assigned. The effects of this phenomenon are worse in situations where work is passed from one specialized employee to another.  In such a situation, apathy among upstream employees affects not only their own productivity but also that of their downstream colleagues.

Severe forms of micromanagement can completely eliminate trust, stifle opportunities for learning and development of interpersonal skills, and even provoke anti-social behavior. Micromanagers of this severity often rely on [[Culture of fear#In the workplace|inducing fear in the employees]] to achieve more control and can severely affect [[self-esteem]] of employees as well as their [[mental health|mental]] and [[physical health]]. Occasionally, and especially when their micromanagement involves the suppression of [[Criticism#Constructive criticism|constructive criticism]] that could otherwise lead to internal reform, severe micromanagers affect subordinates' mental and/or physical health to such an extreme that the subordinates' only way to change their workplace environment is to change employers or even leave the workplace despite lacking alternative job prospects (see [[constructive discharge]], ''[[Micromanagement#Causes|supra]]'').

Finally, the detrimental effects of micromanagement can extend beyond the company itself, especially when the behavior becomes severe enough to force out skilled employees valuable to competitors. Current employees may complain about micromanagement in social settings or to friend-colleagues (''e.g.'', classmates and/or former co-workers) affiliated with other firms in a field. Outside observers such as consultants, clients, interviewees, or visitors may notice the behavior and recount it in conversation with friends and/or colleagues. Most harmfully to the company, forced-out employees, especially those whose advanced skills have made them attractive to other companies and gained them immediate respect, may have few reservations about speaking frankly when answering questions about why they changed employers; they may even deliberately badmouth their former employer. The resulting damage to the company's reputation may create or increase insecurity among management, prompting further micromanagement among managers who use it to cope with insecurity; such a [[feedback]] effect creates and perpetuates a vicious cycle. It may follow the forced-out employee to the new job and create an environment of new micromanagement.

'''Mile of Music''' (also known as '''MoM''' or '''The Mile'''{{cn|date=May 2017}}) is an annual [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and Roots music festival located in downtown [[Appleton, Wisconsin]]. Started in 2013, the four-day festival runs Thursday through Sunday and is a collaborative community event with support from nearly 50 business and community sponsors as well as 400 volunteers. The festival concept was created by long-time community advocate and marketing executive Dave Willems and his team at Willems Marketing, Inc., located in downtown. Willems recruited then Nashville-based touring artist and Appleton hometowner Cory Chisel to join the founding team along with Willems' staff at his marketing firm, which specializes in community and non-profit projects.

The festival features original, handcrafted Americana music of varying styles – [[Folk music|folk]] and [[indie rock]] to [[Soul music|soul]], [[Alternative (music)|alternative]] and [[Country music|country]] – with on average 225+ performers and nearly 1000 total performances. It's focus is on showcasing largely undiscovered, touring troubadours and bands with the mantra, "artists you may not know but should." The festival is "cover-free", meaning no cover songs and no cover charges. Almost every show at the festival is free to the public.

The festival's success over the years has benefited the local community, through significant creative economy impact as well as local youth music education and other scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;http://whby.com/index.php/News/WHBY_News/555622, WHBY News, August 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival has spawned its own beer, the Americana Pale Ale by Stone Arch Brew House, a local brewery in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.postcrescent.com/story/money/companies/buzz/2015/06/28/mile-of-music-beer-arrives-early/29352299/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The festival changes with each year, as it introduces more venues, and adds more charity events. The event is modeled after other music festivals, most notably [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/01/07/cory-chisel-sheboygan/21400755/, Sheboygan Press, Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The next guests, ''Your Face Sounds Familiar'' finalists Nyoy Volante and Edgar Allan Guzman, sang [[Maroon 5]]'s "She Will Be Loved". A recording that showed Padilla's career in 2015 played, with the caption "Crazy and Beautiful". Then he sang his soundtrack contribution for his movie ''[[Crazy Beautiful You]]'', "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now", featuring Morissette Amon.

After singing "What a Wonderful World", Padilla asked everyone to retweet the selfie that he took during his concert. He revealed that for every retweet, [[Pepsi]] Philippines will donate $1 to lighting projects that will benefit an Aeta community in [[Tarlac]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170126191640/http://www.pep.ph/guide/photos/6987/most-wanted-photos-daniel-padilla-sings-ikaw-ang-aking-mahal-for-kathryn-bernardo "MOST WANTED PHOTOS: Daniel Padilla sings "Ikaw ang Aking Mahal" for Kathryn Bernardo"].

Padilla and Harana Boys then sang [[Eraserhead]]'s songs. Padilla then sang his remake of [[VST &amp; Co.]]'s "Ikaw ang Aking Mahal". During this song, Bernardo's picture was revealed on the screen. The next guest was [[Kyla]], with whom Padilla sang the duet "Moon Dance". Then Padilla greeted [[Vice Ganda]], who was sitting in the front row, and sang "How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You". The next guest is [[Gary Valenciano]], who performed solo on stage. The last guest was [[Kathryn Bernardo]], with whom Padilla shared the stage for "So Real So Good".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170126191640/http://www.psr.ph/index.php/highlights-daniel-padillas-wanted-concert/ "Highlights of Daniel Padilla’s ‘Most Wanted Concert’"].

Unfortunately, Padilla was not able to perform his final song, "[[For Once in My Life]]", because the fans had become unruly, swarming the stage and forcing security to step in and whisk their idol backstage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160205091824/http://entertainment.inquirer.net/172442/mr-dj-can-i-make-a-request "Mr. DJ, can I make a request?"].

==History==
During the later part of the 19th Century, the [[South Philadelphia]] neighborhood that is now called [[Pennsport, Philadelphia|Pennsport]] was quickly growing, due to influx of impoverished immigrants. Between 1873 and 1915, was the final entry point for an estimated 1 million European immigrants searching for promising futures, was Philadelphia's first immigrant station at Pier 53, the [[Washington Avenue Immigration Station]], located just north of the Pennsport neighborhood. Philadelphia was America's second-largest city, a thriving industrial center, and a vital force in the American economy. The city also remained major transportation hub and gateway to America and Pennsylvania's industrial empire.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-3D7|title=Washington Avenue Immigration Station Historical Marker|last=|first=|date=2011|website=explorepahistory.com|publisher=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though only a fraction-no more than 5 percent-of the people who immigrated to the United States during those years, the newcomers who entered through Philadelphia represented every ethnic and religious group that comprised America's so-called "New Immigrants" who arrived between the 1880s and the outbreak of the First World War. In 1882 there was the great migration from Russia of Jewish migrants to Philadelphia that settled in the Pennsport neighborhood during this time period and many suffered from a severe lack of medical services. Numerous organizations failed in instituting a medical facility to aid these immigrants in the neighborhood. Ultimately, at the turn of the Twentieth Century, the Beth Israel Hospital Association was established in order to solve the problem.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12093-philadelphia|title=PHILADELPHIA|last=|first=|date=1906|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This establishment successfully treated the area’s poor Jewish population and also accepted patients from other faiths. Beth Israel was absorbed by the Franklin Free Dispensary only a few months after beginning their operation. At around the same time, Jewish physicians opened their Mount Sinai Dispensary in [[Society Hill]], however because of their common goal, both dispensaries, Franklin Free and Mount Sinai, agreed to merge and renamed themselves the Mount Sinai Hospital Association.

Philadelphia city laws stated that hospitals treating consumptives (now known as Tuberculosis) or immigrants, could not be built near homes and churches. The Mount Sinai Hospital Association considered building the facility outside of the city however they knew that it had to be built near where patients lived. By 1904, the law was amended after lobbying the city government and the association procured an old lumber yard on the 1400 block of South 5th Street, central to the Pennsport neighborhood, that was the most in need. The $25,000 purchase included the yard’s four-story building (built in 1893), which would become the first Mount Sinai Hospital. In March of 1905, Mount Sinai Hospital officially opened to the public and accepted its first patients.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hiddencityphila.org/2016/02/making-a-molehill-out-of-mt-sinai/|title=Making A Molehill Out Of Mt.

'''Grégory Villemin''' (24 August 1980 – 16 October 1984) was a French boy from [[Lépanges-sur-Vologne]] who was murdered at the age of 4. His body was found {{convert|7|km}} away in the [[Vologne]] River near [[Docelles]]. The case became known as the '''Grégory Affair''' ({{lang-fr|l'Affaire Grégory}}) and for decades has received widespread media coverage in France, where it continues to capture the public interest.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New York Times|title=All of France is asking: Who killed petit Gregory?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/16/world/all-of-france-is-asking-who-killed-petit-gregory.html|date=16 July 1985|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder remains unsolved.&lt;ref name=Local&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.fr/20130425/gregory-boy-murder-france-haunt|title=The smiling boy whose murder haunts France|publisher=The Local Fr|date=25 April 2013|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preceding events==
In the years preceding the murder, Gregory's parents, the Villemins, had been receiving anonymous letters and phone calls from a male threatening revenge against Grégory's father, Jean-Marie Villemin. This person, who had detailed knowledge of the extended Villemin family, was later referred to as ''Le Corbeau'' ("the Crow", French slang for "the informant").&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Los Angeles Times|title=COLUMN ONE : The Long Shadow of 'The Crow'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-09/news/mn-65497_1_anonymous-letter|date=9 December 1993|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
At 5 P.M 32. on 16 October 1984, an anonymous call was made to Gregory's uncle, stating that the boy had been taken and had been thrown into the [[Vologne|Vologne River]]. Grégory, who had been playing in front of his house, was later confirmed as a missing person, thus beginning a manhunt. Grégory's body was later found in the Vologne with his hands and feet bound with rope and a woolen hat pulled down over his face.&lt;ref name=Local/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Vologne-deycimont.JPG|thumb|The [[Vologne]], where Grégory Villemin's body was discovered]]
On 17 October the Villemins received an anonymous letter that said "I have taken vengeance".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Bernard Laroche, a cousin of Jean-Marie Villemin, was implicated in the murder by handwriting experts and by Laroche's sister-in-law and taken into custody on 5 November 1984. The sister-in-law later recanted her testimony and Laroche, who denied any part in the crime or being "the Crow", was released from custody on 4 February 1985. Jean-Marie Villemin vowed in front of the press that he would kill Laroche. On 25 March handwriting experts identified Grégory's mother Christine as the likely author of the anonymous letters.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; On 29 March 1985, Jean-Marie Villemin shot Laroche dead as he was leaving for work. Jean-Marie Villemin was convicted of murder and served 5 years in prison.&lt;ref name=Local/&gt;

In December 1986, Christine Villemin was charged with the murder, but was ultimately cleared of the charges on 2 February 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Independent|title=Mother cleared in 'little Gregory' murder case|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mother-cleared-in-little-gregory-murder-case-1470769.html|date=3 February 1993|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was reopened in 2000 to allow for DNA testing on a stamp used to send one of the anonymous letters, but the tests were inconclusive.&lt;ref name=France24&gt;{{cite news|publisher=France 24|title=Judge reopens case of four-year-old Gregory, murdered in 1984|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081203-judge-reopens-case-four-year-old-gregory-murdered-1984-|date=6 December 2008|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, following an application by the Villemins, a judge ordered the case reopened to allow DNA testing of the rope used to bind Grégory, the letters, and other evidence. This testing proved inconclusive.&lt;ref name=France24/&gt; Further DNA testing in April 2013 on Grégory's clothes and shoes was also inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Local/&gt;

In June 2017, based on new evidence, three people were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=15 June 2017 |title=Gregory Villemin child murder: Three held in 1984 French mystery|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40277466 |publisher=BBC|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grégory's great-aunt and great-uncle, as well as an aunt—the widow of a biological uncle who died in 2010—were arrested on 14 June 2017. The aunt was released, while the great aunt and great uncle have invoked their right to remain silent. The police stated that they did not know who killed the child, but that there are multiple new suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blavignat|first1=Yohan|last2=Piquet|first2=Caroline|title=Affaire Grégory : «plusieurs personnes ont concouru» au crime|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2017/06/14/01016-20170614ARTFIG00187-affaire-du-petit-gregory-trois-personnes-interpellees-dans-les-vosges.php|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=Le Figaro|date=14 June 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2017, the magistrate in charge of the first investigation, Jean-Michel Lambert, committed suicide, citing in a farewell letter to a local newspaper the increasing pressure resulting from the reopening of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.fr/actu/societe-faits-divers/affaire-gregory-l-ancien-juge-jean-michel-lambert-retrouve-mort-7789303749|title=Affaire Grégory : l'ancien juge Jean-Michel Lambert retrouvé mort|publisher=RTL|date=11 July 2017|accessdate=6 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714052001/http://www.rtl.fr/actu/societe-faits-divers/affaire-gregory-l-ancien-juge-jean-michel-lambert-retrouve-mort-7789303749|archivedate=14 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series''' is a [[drag racing]] series organized by the [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA). It is the top competition series of the NHRA, comprising competition in four classes, including [[Top Fuel|Top Fuel Dragster]], [[Funny Car]], [[Pro Stock]], and [[Pro Stock Motorcycle]].

The champion of each category is determined by a point system where points are given according to finishing placement and qualifying effort. The season is divided into two segments. After the first 18 races, the Top 10 of each pro category are locked in and compete in the last six races with the difference in points greatly minimized.

==History==
The series has four main professional classes:  [[Top Fuel|Top Fuel Dragster]], [[Funny Car]], [[Pro Stock]], and [[Pro Stock Motorcycle]].  Top Fuel was the first category, with Funny Cars added in 1966, Pro Stock four years later and Pro Stock Motorcycles in 1987.  Both Top Fuel and Funny Cars regularly see top speeds in excess of {{convert|300|mph}} today, and one thousand foot times anywhere from 3.70 to 4 seconds.  Both these cars burn fuel consisting of 90% [[nitromethane]] and 10% [[methanol]].  The Pro Stock record is {{convert|214|mph}}, with times often in the 6.4-6.7 second range and the Pro Stock Motorcycles usually run at 190+&amp;nbsp;mph ({{convert|190|mph|disp=output only}}), with times in the low 7- to high 6-second range.  Top Fuel (class designation:  AA/D top fuel dragster) and Fuel Funny Car (class designation: AA/FC top fuel coupe) have recently been limited to a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}}  track, instead of the historic 1/4 mile [{{convert|1320|ft|m|0}}], as a means to limit top speeds and increase safety (there had been a number of engine explosions at or near 300&amp;nbsp;mph resulting in driver injuries and death).  Currently, driver and spectator safety has been enhanced even while top speeds often approach and exceed 300&amp;nbsp;mph.

Some of the popular racers to come through the series include [[Don Garlits|"Big Daddy" Don Garlits]], [[Don Prudhomme|Don "The Snake" Prudhomme]], and [[Shirley Muldowney]].  Those three gained much attention from the 1960s through 1970s with their speed and personalities, a combination rarely achieved today through the political correctness of sponsorship in today's drivers.  Nonetheless there are still colorful characters today, such as 16-time Funny Car world champion [[John Force]]. His daughter, 2007 Rookie of the Year [[Ashley Force]] Hood has made appearances on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and was voted AOL's Hottest Female Athlete in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sports.aol.com/story/ar/_a/meet-the-hottest-athlete-in-sports/20070831141709990001 | title=Meet the Hottest Athlete in Sports |accessdate= 2009-09-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2008, following the death of Funny Car driver [[Scott Kalitta]], the NHRA announced that race distances for Top Fuel and Funny Car classes would temporarily be reduced to 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft from the traditional 1/4 mile (1320&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhra.com/content/news/30355.htm NHRA News: In interim measure, Top Fuel, Funny Car to race 1,000 feet]&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was intended to be temporary while safety solutions were explored; however, the races have remained at 1000 feet since Kalitta's death. Although unpopular with the fans, the distance remains at 1,000 feet today at the request of the teams as a cost-saving measure, with no indication by NHRA officials of any intent of returning to the full quarter-mile format any time soon. By late 2012, 1,000 foot racing became globally recognised as the 2012 FIA European title in Top Fuel became 1,000-foot championships, as [[Santa Pod Raceway|Santa Pod]] and [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]] (the last two quarter-mile nitro strips) made the switch, and [[Australian National Drag Racing Association|Australian]] nitro racing switched to the 1,000-foot distance only for selected tracks.

===The Countdown===
Starting with the 2007 season, the NHRA implemented a playoff system to determine the champion in each class, billed as the ''Countdown to The Championship''. Each season is divided into two segments of races, with the bulk of the races making up the first segment, and the final events making up the second segment. After the first segment is complete, the drivers in each class at or above the cutoff point in the standings (8th place up to 2007 and 10th place thereafter) become eligible for the championship, while the drivers below the cutoff point are eliminated from championship contention, though they still participate in the remaining race events. The points for the advancing drivers are readjusted so that they are separated by a fixed margin, with first place receiving bonus points. The drivers then compete for the championship over the final races of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countdown.nhra.com/content/general.asp?articleid=21167 |title=What is the Countdown? |accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title sponsors ==
[[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] was the [[title sponsor]] of the series from 1975 until 2001, when a condition of the [[Master Settlement Agreement]] required Winston to drop either its sponsorship of the NHRA, or the [[NASCAR Winston Cup Series]]; Winston chose to retain its NASCAR sponsorship.&lt;ref name=lat-nomorewinston&gt;{{cite news|title=After 27 Years, Series Goes Off Tobacco Road|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/08/sports/sp-1765|accessdate=15 July 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston ended their sponsorship with NASCAR two years later. [[The Coca-Cola Company]] has since held the title sponsorship rights for the series, under a deal that, in 2012, was extended through 2018. From 2001 to 2008, the series was branded with the company's [[Powerade]] brand, before switching to [[Full Throttle (drink)|Full Throttle]] in 2009. In 2013, following Coca-Cola's most recent extension of its sponsorship, the title sponsor was changed to [[Mello Yello]].&lt;ref name=sbj-melloyello&gt;{{cite web|title=Mello Yello taking over as NHRA title sponsor|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2012/08/27/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/Mello-Yello.aspx|website=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With Mello Yello having introduced a new logo, the NHRA unveiled a new logo for the series in January 2016, as well as a new "My NHRA" marketing campaign that plays upon the logo to feature drivers and other personalities discussing what the NHRA means to them.&lt;ref name="autoweek-nhralogo"&gt;{{cite web|title=NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series logo gets bold makeover|url=http://autoweek.com/article/nhra/nhra-mello-yello-drag-racing-series-logo-gets-bold-makeover|website=Autoweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1974, the season champion was determined by the winner of the World Finals event. The Professional categories contain the divisions of Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock (Automobile), and Pro Stock Motorcycle.

== Broadcasting ==
NHRA events have been broadcast on television, with such efforts dating back as far as 1985. By the 1990s, events were split between [[ESPN]], [[NBC Sports|NBC]], and [[Spike (TV network)|The Nashville Network]]. TNN also broadcast a weekly highlight program, ''NHRA Today''. Due to logistical and scheduling issues, including the possibility of long turnaround times between heats, weather delays, and other factors, events are typically broadcast in a condensed form via [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]].  From 1992 until 2000, TNN carried live coverage of selected final rounds, typically with a condensed package to air until the finals began.&lt;ref name=bsun-renovations&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharrington|first1=Kevin|title=Renovations, TV taking the credit for bigger, diverse crowds|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-10-28/sports/1990301134_1_drag-racing-restroom-facilities-meyer|accessdate=12 August 2015|work=Dallas Morning News|date=October 28, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chron-mercy&gt;{{cite news|title=NHRA still finding itself at mercy of TV networks|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/article/NHRA-still-finding-itself-at-mercy-of-TV-networks-5422818.php|accessdate=12 August 2015|work=Houston Chronicle|date=April 22, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the NHRA entered into an agreement with ESPN for it to become the exclusive broadcaster of NHRA events, shortly after MTV Networks had effectively shut down the CBS motorsport operations after its acquisition of CBS Cable, and the demise of TNN. During its 14-year stint as rightsholder, ESPN faced criticism for the structure and scheduling of its coverage. Due to scheduling conflicts with other sports properties to which it held rights, ESPN typically broadcast its NHRA coverage in inconsistent and otherwise undesirable timeslots. In the final years of the contract, the NHRA attempted to structure selected events so that they could be televised live; by the 2015 season, at least six events were broadcast live.&lt;ref name=chron-mercy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sbj-espnfs1nhra/&gt;

In July 2015, ESPN and the NHRA agreed to end their contract one year early, with the association citing ESPN's scheduling issues as a concern. In turn, the NHRA announced a new television deal with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] beginning in the 2016 season. Coverage primarily airs on the [[Fox Sports 1|FS1]] and [[Fox Sports 2|FS2]] cable channels, while 4 events per-season are broadcast on [[Fox network|Fox]] (including the flagship U.S. Nationals). Fox committed to televising live Sunday coverage from at least 16 of the 23 events per-season, two-hour qualification broadcasts and encores (including the condensed highlights program ''NHRA in 30''), and coverage of selected Sportsman Series events. NHRA president Peter Clifford explained that the deal would be a "game-changer" for the association, citing Fox's history of motorsports programming, as well as its commitment to increased coverage of NHRA events, including live network television coverage.&lt;ref name=sbj-espnfs1nhra&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources: NHRA Races To Air On FS1, Ending 14-Year ESPN Tie-In|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Closing-Bell/2015/07/13/fs1.aspx|website=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autoweek&gt;{{cite web|title=NHRA president calls move to Fox Sports in 2016 a 'game-changer' for series|url=http://autoweek.com/article/nhra/nhra-moving-fox-sports-2016|website=Autoweek|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/motorsports/2017/12/06/fox-tv-releases-2018-nhra-drag-racing-series-schedule/928916001/|title=Fox TV releases 2018 NHRA Mello Yello drag-racing series schedule|work=USA Today|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first two years of the contract, Fox had achieved an average viewership of 600,000 viewers—a major increase over ESPN's broadcasts. Some events had attracted an audience of over 1 million. The association cited favorable scheduling practices (including better time slots and additional encores, as well as using [[Fox NASCAR|NASCAR broadcasts]] as a lead-in), and increased promotion of the event broadcasts as part of FS1 and FS2's programming, as having helped build their audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/racing/nhra-chief-content-officer-ken-adelson-talks-changes-2018-relationship-fox-sports.html|title=NHRA Chief Content Officer Ken Adelson talks changes for 2018, relationship with Fox Sports|date=2018-02-06|work=Awful Announcing|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Numaish Masnuaat-e-Mulki'' meaning ''Exhibition of the Local Products'', was started in 1938 by a group of graduates of [[Osmania University]] to showcase local products. It was the reign of the Last [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]. From a mere 100 stalls in 1938 started at the [[Public Gardens, Hyderabad|Public Gardens]], the venue has shifted to the Exhibition Grounds, near [[Nampally Railway Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/12/30/stories/2003123010140300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Industrial exhibition to open on January 1 | date=30 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original name was changed to All India Industrial Exhibition, and was renamed to its original name, the ''Numaish'' in 2009.

==Exhibition==

The exhibition features dry fruits and handicrafts of Jammu and Kashmir to handmade garments from Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, handicraft items from all over India and electronic goods of the best brands in the country. There are special stalls organized by different ladies groups, convicts and much more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2008/jan/06/hyderabads_numaish_has_something_everyone.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The exhibition also featured [[carpets]] of [[Iran]] and some stalls from [[Pakistan]] till 2011. But due to diplomatic reasons they will not be available from 2012.&lt;ref name="articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-30/hyderabad/30572566_1_numaish-vehicle-parking-parking-problems | work=The Times Of India | title=Numaish parking plans in place | date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hyderabadi haleem]] is sold by Hyderabadi restaurant Pista House at the exhibition.

There are three entry points: Gate No. 1 (Gandhi Bhavan Gate), Gate No. 2 (Ajanta Gate), Gate No.3 (Goshamahal Gate). The Ajanta Gate is the  main entrance and the biggest.

==Entry and Car parking==
For entry to the exhibition, INR25 is charged per head.

From 2012, car parking is provided with fixed Rs 50 as fee for four-wheelers and Rs 20 for two-wheelers.  Besides, there is a lot of parking space inside the exhibition grounds. Vehicles are allowed entry till 4 pm. Another official parking space has been identified on the premises of Government Junior College, [[Nampally, Hyderabad|Nampally]] (opposite [[Gandhi Bhavan]])&lt;ref name="articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;
Still there are incidents of duping people in name of car parking. The miscreants who have leased out the open grounds near the exhibition charge Rs 50 for a four-wheeler and Rs 20 for a two-wheeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/article2795302.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=‘Open loot' at Numaish | date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveillance==
25 CCTVs, a three-tier security system has been put in place while door-frame-metal detectors have been installed at the three entry locations. Apart from these, watch and ward are on duty till 9 pm everyday during the exhibition. Live video streaming of the Numaish with the help of two tilt and zoom cameras is posted on the internet. From 2012, [[Geographical Information System]] (GIS) has been used to allot the stalls based on the availability of the space in the grounds.

== Revenue ==

In 2011, about 21 lakh people visited the exhibition and the society collected a revenue of Rs 13 crore.&lt;ref name="articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

==Cultural Programs==
Several cultural programs are conducted in the Exhibition Club during the 46-day period that include classical and popular musical concerts, magic shows, [[mushaira]] (poetry) etc. In recent times Bollywood and Tollywood artists have also performed during the Numaish.

The 75th edition of the Numaish inaugurated on 1/1/2015 saw many special programs in Telugu and Urdu including performances by Tollywood artists as well as special Ghazal programs and Comedy programs that have been attended in large numbers by visitors. The newly renovated club hall was the venue for a special tribute to Legendary poets of Urdu performed by top ghazal singers of Hyderabad. This was a rare occasion where so many well known ghazal singers got together and performed on the same stage. Some of the poets whose ghazals were presented are [[Ghalib]], Iqbal, Mir Taqi Mir, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Ibn-E-Insha and more.

Games will be available from 6pm onwards.

The Legendary Indian Artist, Padma Bhushan Awardee S.P. Balasubramanium was felicitated by the Exhibition Society on 8th February 2015 in a Grand Program arranged by the Society's Club and Reception Sub-Committee. The President of the society, Eatala Rajender, Telangana Minister for Finance, did the honors along with the other office bearers of the society. S.P Balasubramanium spoke and praised the services being rendered by the Exhibition Society. He also performed a few of his numbers along with a number of other Telugu Film Industry singers who came and performed as a tribute to Balu Sir (as he's fondly addressed).

The event is mostly centered on NVIDIA's own products but offers activities usually found at other types of events: a [[demoscene]] event, scientific talks, and programming classes. It's been replaced by the [[GPU Technology Conference]] in following years.

The same name was also used for Nvidia's quarterly magazine, published by [[Future plc]]. Publication was ceased after the 'Winter 2011' (#7) issue.

[[Image:Oireachtas na Gaeilge.png|150px|thumb|Oireachtas na Gaeilge.]]
'''Oireachtas na Gaeilge''' ({{IPA-ga|ɛrʲaxt̪ˠasˠ nə ˈɡeːlʲɟə}}) is an annually held arts festival of [[Ireland|Irish]] culture, which has run since the 1890s.  Based on the Welsh [[Eisteddfod]], Oireachtas na Gaeilge runs for one week, featuring performances, demonstrations and competitions.  The festival is held in two portions: a [[visual arts]] festival in April/May and the festival proper on the last weekend of October or the first of November, when more than 10,000 people attend the seven-day event. In 2007, the festival was held at [[Westport, Ireland|Westport]]. The 2008 festival took place in the Cork city suburb of Douglas, the local support committee was under the chairmanship of [[Peadar Ó Riada]], son of the composer and founder of the male choir [[Cór Chúil Aodha]], [[Seán Ó Riada]].

==History==
The first Oireachtas na Gaeilge festival was organised in 1897 by [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] (the Gaelic League), which envisaged it as part of a renaissance of traditional Irish arts and culture.&lt;ref name="ITM2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ó hAllmhuráin|first1=Gearóid|title=A Short History of Irish Traditional Music|date=2017|publisher=The O'Brien Press|location=Dublin|isbn=9781847179401|page=55|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.ezproxy.slv.vic.gov.au/lib/slv/detail.action?docID=4840554|accessdate=27 September 2017|language=en|format=via [[State Library of Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Round Room of Dublin's [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]], one of the largest halls in the city at that time. It was just a half-day festival, but the attendance still exceeded a thousand people, an unexpected level of interest.

In contrast to today's festival, there was little emphasis on the performing arts. The competitions included two for poetry, five for prose essays, one for poetry compilations; a competition for unpublished songs or stories in Irish; a competition for new song compositions and a recitation competition.

While the festival management pulled off accomplishments including the staging of the [[Eithne (opera)|first Irish-language opera]], the popularity of the Oireachtas waned in the early part of the twentieth century, and the festival was cancelled for a number of years in the 1920s and 1930s. In response, the organisers, under the Directorship of Liam Ó Maolaodha attempted from the 1990s on to market the festival to younger speakers of Irish via outings, discos, and other youth-oriented events.

The festival was originally held in [[Dublin]], but since the 1970s, it has been held in different cities and towns around Ireland. The festival culminates in four major competitions over the weekend: Comórtas na mBan, a [[Sean-nós song|Sean-nós]] singing competition for women, Comórtas na bhFear, for men, [[Corn Uí Riada]], for all age and gender categories, and the Comórtas Damhsa ar an Sean Nós ("Steip"), a [[Sean-nós dance|free-style dancing]] competition mainly based on the Conamara individual step style now popular around the country, but also includes dancing in other regional styles. Past winners of [[Corn Uí Riada]] include [[Áine Uí Cheallaigh]], [[Lillis Ó Laoire]], [[Máirtín Tom Sheánín Mac Donnchadha]], [[Mícheál Ó Confhaola]] and 2008 winner [[Ciarán Ó Con Cheanainn]] from [[Spiddal|An Spidéal]]. [[County Galway|Contae na Gaillimhe]].

==Media coverage==
[[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]] has been covering the bigger Oireachtas events live since 1973 and these broadcasts are in considerable demand from internet audiences around the globe, particularly Corn Uí Riada and the sean-nós stage competitions. Steip, the Sean nós dancing competition, on [[TG4]] has consistently attracted the station's highest annual audience figures. Its success is due to the hard work of Festival administrator Máirín Nic Dhonnchadha who effectively revived the competition from 2000 onwards. In 2008, for the first time, the station broadcast live segments of the Corn Uí Riada competition.

'''Sardi's''' is a [[Continental food|continental]] restaurant located at 234 West 44th Street (between Broadway and Eighth Avenue) in the [[Theater District]] in [[Manhattan]], in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagat.com/r/sardis-manhattan]&lt;/ref&gt;  Known for the hundreds of [[caricature]]s of show-business celebrities that adorn its walls, Sardi's opened at its current location on March 5, 1927.

==Creation and early years==
Melchiorre Pio Vincenzo "Vincent" Sardi Sr. (born in S. Marzano Oliveto, Italy on December 23, 1885 – died November 19, 1969) and his wife Eugenia ("Jenny") Pallera (born in [[Castell'Alfero]], Italy on July 14, 1889) opened their first eatery, The Little Restaurant, in the basement of 246 West 44th Street in 1921. When that building was slated for demolition in 1926 (to build the [[St. James Theatre]]), they accepted an offer from the theater magnates, the [[Shubert family|Shubert brothers]], to relocate to a new building the brothers were erecting down the block. The new restaurant, Sardi's, opened March 5, 1927.

When business slowed after the move, Vincent Sardi sought a gimmick to attract customers. Recalling the movie star caricatures that decorated the walls of Joe Zelli’s, a Parisian restaurant and jazz club, Sardi decided to recreate that effect in his establishment. He hired a Russian refugee named [[Alex Gard]] (1898–1948) (born Alexis Kremkoff in [[Kazan]], Russia) to draw Broadway celebrities. Sardi and Gard drew up a contract that stated Gard would make the caricatures in exchange for one meal per day at the restaurant. The first official caricature by Gard was of [[Ted Healy]], the [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]] of [[Three Stooges]] fame. When Sardi’s son, [[Vincent Sardi Jr.]] (1915–2007),&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', January 5, 2007, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/nyregion/04cnd-sardi.html "Owner of Sardi’s Restaurant Dies at 91]"&lt;/ref&gt; took over restaurant operations in 1947, he offered to change the terms of Gard's agreement. Gard refused and continued to draw the caricatures in exchange for meals until his death.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Height of popularity==
[[File:Sardisneon.jpg|thumb|150px|Sardi's neon sign]]
Frequent mentions of the restaurant in newspaper columns by [[Walter Winchell]] and [[Ward Morehouse]] added to Sardi’s growing popularity. Winchell and Morehouse belonged to a group of newspapermen, press agents, and drama critics who met for lunch regularly at Sardi’s and referred to themselves as the Cheese Club.  [[Heywood Broun]], [[Mark Hellinger]], press agent Irving Hoffman, actor [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], and [[Ring Lardner]]  were also Cheese Club members. In fact, it was Hoffman who first brought Alex Gard to Sardi's for lunch at the Cheese Club table. Gard drew caricatures of the Cheese Club members, and Vincent Sardi hung them above their table. It was then that Sardi recalled the drawings at Zelli's and made his deal with Gard.

The restaurant became known as a pre- and post-theater hangout, as well as a location for opening night parties. Vincent Sardi, a theater lover, kept the restaurant open much later than others in the area to accommodate Broadway performers' schedules.

Alex Gard, who created more than 700 caricatures for the restaurant, died in 1948.  After Gard, John Mackey took over drawing for the restaurant but was soon replaced by [[Donald Bevan|Don Bevan]]. Bevan did the drawings until 1974 when he retired, and was replaced by Brooklyn-born Richard Baratz,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardis.com/pcgi-bin/ccp5/cp-app.cgi?pg=ste_barataz Richard Baratz]&lt;/ref&gt; a banknote and certificate engraver by profession. Baratz, who lives in Pennsylvania, continues to the present day as the Sardi's caricaturist. As of 2005, there are more than 1,300 celebrity caricatures on display.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

According to actor [[Robert Cuccioli]]'s spokesperson Judy Katz, in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'': "On the day [[James Cagney|Jimmy Cagney]] died, his caricature was stolen from the Sardi's wall. Since then, when drawings are done, the originals go into a vault, and two copies are made. One goes to the lucky subject of the caricature, the other up on the Sardi's wall. This way, potential thieves won't have their moment."&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, David (October 28, 1997). [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/35486.html "Cuccioli Gets His Moment -- On Sardi's Wall, Oct. 28"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216185524/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/35486.html |date=2008-02-16 }}. ''[[Playbill]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Vincent Sardi Jr. donated a collection of 227 caricatures from the restaurant to the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of [[New York Public Library|The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.]]{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

While the Sardi family was Italian, their restaurant's cuisine is not; rather it tends toward "English food",&lt;ref name="Sardi"&gt;Vincent Sardi Sr. with Richard Gehman. ''Sardi's: The Story of a Famous Restaurant'' (Henry Holt and Co., 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; a Continental menu. In 1957, Vincent Sardi Jr. collaborated with Helen Bryson to compile a cookbook of Sardi's recipes. ''Curtain Up at Sardi's'' contains nearly 300 recipes ranging from a grilled [[cheese sandwich]] to a [[Champagne cocktail]]. By 1987, however, [[Zagat]] was describing the food as "a culinary laughing stock." One customer who was surveyed called Sardi's "the longest running gag on Broadway."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/02/arts/the-curtain-goes-up-again-at-sardi-s.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, a Los Angeles location of Sardi's opened on [[Hollywood Boulevard]], where it was similarly popular with celebrities. It has since closed.

==Today==
[[File:9.24.13Sardi'sByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|The ground floor dining room, with celebrity caricatures lining the upper walls.]]
Sardi's is the birthplace of the [[Tony Award]]; after [[Antoinette Perry]]'s death in 1946, her partner, theatrical producer and director [[Brock Pemberton]], was eating lunch at Sardi's when he came up with the idea of a theater award to be given in Perry's honor. For many years Sardi’s was the location where Tony Award nominations were announced. Vincent Sardi Sr. received a special Tony Award in 1947, the first year of the awards, for "providing a transient home and comfort station for theatre folk at Sardi's for 20 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/archive/ | title = The Story of the Tonys| publisher = The Official Website of the American Theatre Wing's ''Tony Awards'' | accessdate = January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Vincent Sardi Jr. received a Tony Honor for Excellence in the Theatre. Sardi's is also the venue for the presentation of the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]]s, as well as many other Broadway events, press conferences, and celebrations.

The restaurant is today considered a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] institution, to the point that composer [[Stephen Sondheim]] pointed to it when lamenting the changing climate of New York theater in a 2000 interview.  Asked about the Broadway community, Sondheim replied, "There's none whatsoever. The writers write one show every two or three years. Who congregates at Sardi's?  What is there to congregate about? Shows just sit in theaters and last."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000312mag-sondheim.html|date = March 12, 2000 | title = Conversations With Sondheim | first=Frank |last=Rich| publisher=The New York Times| accessdate = April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''See No Evil''''' is a collection of works of [[public art]] by multiple [[graffiti]] artists, located around Nelson Street in [[Bristol]], UK.

Before 20 August 2011, the chosen location, Nelson Street, was "one of the most depressing, ugly and run down streets in Bristol" (Mike Bennet).&lt;ref name="societeperrier.com"/&gt; A dreary '1960's urban nightmare.

A spokesperson of one of the buildings  said "anything that would revitalise the street and increase footfall for a minimal cost – then all the better."

The council viewed the project as a platform to revitalize the street and encourage its regeneration.  The councils Executive member for culture Simon Cook said: "This project is very exciting for Bristol. ...this will put us on the map internationally" as a cultural and tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/8711647/The-See-No-Evil-graffiti-project-in-Bristol-Britains-largest-street-art-project.html |title=The See No Evil graffiti project in Bristol, Britain's largest street art project - Telegraph |first= |last= |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 19 August 2011|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years previously Banksy show at the City Museum and Art Gallery had attracted large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.venue.co.uk/features/13107-dire-streets-graff-makeover |title=Dire streets' graff makeover |first= |last= |work=venue.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/22/see-no-evil-uks-largest-s_n_933650.html#s336130 |title='See No Evil': UK's Largest Street Art Project In Bristol, England (PHOTOS, VIDEO) |first= Melinda|last= Brocka|work=huffingtonpost.com |year=2012 |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisers also looked towards Melbourne, Australia, were a street project attracted almost half a million visitors a year as an example of how street art could help regenerate urban area.&lt;ref name="Dire streets' graff makeover"/&gt;

The name 'See No Evil', Bennett explained, is from the three wise monkeys who see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. "It sort of works on the artistic element, and because it has a musical element to it as well. And of course because we're taking over the old magistrates' courts" and Police station.&lt;ref name="Dire streets' graff makeover"/&gt; The irony of Inkie being invited to paint the very courts he was sentenced in after Operation Anderson years before, as the ringleader of 75 plus artists in the UK's largest graffiti-related arrest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZLMOgxH2rE |title=DrawingTheLinePart1 - YouTube |first= |last=|work=youtube.com |year=2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rollingstoneme.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7 |title=Guerilla Wallfare |work=rollingstoneme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/blogs/art-attack/inkie-interview.html |title=Interview: Inkie &amp;#124; Knowledge Magazine |first= |last= |work=kmag.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was not lost.

=== ''Who's Lenny?'' ===
A 16 minute long short film about See No Evil 2011, ''Who's Lenny?,'' was commissioned by the Council. It was produced by Bristol-based production company Hurricane Media.&lt;ref name="Bristolmedia whos lenny"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/2012/2/17/hurricane-media-take-home-rts-awards-for-see-no-evil-documentary-whos-lenny |title=Bristol Media &amp;#124; Hurricane Media take home RTS Awards for 'See No Evil' documentary, ' Who's Lenny?' |first= |last= |work=bristolmedia.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was made using a range of techniques including wirecam technology – a first in a UK urban environment - as well as [[time-lapse photography]] and 24-hour live coverage.

''See No Evil: Who's Lenny'' explains how once outlawed graffiti artists have now come to critical acclaim, and how one group in particular were invited to paint the courts of law in which they were once convicted for their art. The video aims to present street art as a vibrant and contemporary art form. The documentary includes interviews with some of the 72 artists involved including Inkie, Tats Cru, El Mac, Nick Walker, Shoe, Xenz, China Mike and Paris. Focusing on the See No Evil event, the film also explores how street art has a natural home in Bristol, capturing the spirit of Bristol graffiti scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://relevantbcn.com/index.php/art-alley/artists/item/2911-whos-lenny?-see-no-evil-bristol-2011 |title=Relevant BCN - Music, Arts &amp; Events by Creative People in Barcelona - Who's Lenny?

== Hear No Evil ==
Both years, alongside the live art event of See No Evil with graffiti artists at work, Hear No Evil hosted live music and DJ sets with artists from Bristol's music scene, plus graffiti workshops, food stalls, breakdancing, face painting, and pop-up galleries.&lt;ref name="brooklynstreetart.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bristol247.com/2011/08/19/bristol-gears-up-for-see-no-evil-street-party-70268/ |title=Bristol gears up for See No Evil street party – Bristol24-7 |first= |last=|work=bristol247.com |year=2012 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For both years there were music events in the disused Westgate Building.&lt;ref name="thisisbristol"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Landmark-Bristol-site-host-DJs-musicians/story-13068071-detail/story.html |title=Landmark Bristol site to host top DJs and musicians &amp;#124; This is Bristol |first= |last=|work=thisisbristol.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-19311899 |title=BBC News - In pictures: See No Evil 2012 block party |first= |last=|work=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=11 September 2012 |date=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both years had a Hear no Evil block party on the final Saturday and in 2012 Busking day on Sunday 19 August.&lt;ref name="bristol247 brown 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thisisbristol.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bristol247 williams 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Laura|title=See No Evil Bristol 2012: Your guide to the event|url=http://www.bristol247.com/2012/08/10/see-no-evil-bristol-2012-your-guide-to-the-event-55357/|accessdate=16 August 2012|newspaper=[[Bristol24-7]]|date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2012 the opening event was an audio-visual immersive event, "Mail, Maps &amp; Motion", on Friday 17 August, featured a collaboration of Joanie Lemercier (from 3D projection people AntiVJ)  and musicians Adrian Utley of [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]] and Will Gregory of [[Goldfrapp]], took place at the Passenger Shed.&lt;ref name="See No Evil.... Bristol"/&gt;

== Reception and future ==
Some Conservative councillors said that the exhibition was a waste of money and were unhappy the Liberal Democrat-run council had contributed towards funding it.

Bristol City Council Leader [[Barbara Janke]] said:  "When the economy is suffering generally, it is important for councils to take steps like these to stimulate the city's economy. ..This daring and entrepreneurial project has acted as a catalyst for change in this once unloved part of the city centre. ..."Bristol is leading the way by promoting one aspect of the city's own unique character to a much wider audience to generate wider economic benefits."&lt;ref name="thisisbristol" /&gt;

[[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] writing in ''The Guardian'' about the 2011 event concluded that street art was dying.  "Maybe there was a time when painting a wittily satirical or cheekily rude picture or comment on a wall was genuinely disruptive and shocking. That time is gone" and went on to say, "Images far too ordinary to be exhibited in art galleries are admired because they are on the street".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/aug/25/street-art-grafitti-mainstream |title=Street art is dying – and it's our fault &amp;#124; Art and design &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |first= Jonathan|last= Jones|work=[[The Guardian]] |date= 25 August 2011|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2012,  Nelson Street business woman, Lynne Tonks, said it was "the best thing that they ever did in this street...They've increased the foot flow," with more tourists were attracted to the area, less crime and vandalism.  "It's a pleasanter environment to work in and for people to come to," Ms Tonks said. "Graffiti is something that Bristol should be proud of, Banksy's put it on the map and other people are following - and it looks great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-19253918 |title=BBC News - See No Evil: Street art festival returns to Bristol |first= |last=|work=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=1 September 2012 |date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See No Evil 2011 not only successfully rejuvenated a very run down area of Bristol but generated enough publicity to turn it into one of Bristol's biggest tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jasongalaziddis.dontpaniconline.com/magazine/arts/see-no-evil-2012 |title=SEE NO EVIL 2012 &amp;#124; Don't Panic Magazine &amp;#124; Arts |first= |last= |work=jasongalaziddis.dontpaniconline.com |year=2012 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the legacy of See No Evil, Dave Harvey from Team Love said "In terms of legacy – obviously the street itself. This street this time last year, no one came here, there was nothing on the street, it was really grey and dismal. This year council figures show tens of thousands more people are coming down here every month to look at the art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boat-mag.com/2012/09/03/see-no-evil-bristol/ |title=See No Evil, Bristol &amp;#124; Boat Magazine |first= |last= |work=boat-mag.com |year=2012 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inkie said "The future of See No Evil is a more diverse base of art forms including photography, digital and animation with bigger music acts and better installations and street dressings. This is something we would like to take on tour to other cities across the globe. The legacy is the longstanding effect on the youth and their creativity in Bristol through the outreach projects and workshops in which we are directly inspiring the youth and showing them ways to express themselves. This will lead in turn to a bigger creative scene in Bristol for the future."

==Synopsis==
The action takes place in Chicago, Illinois, at [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]], Frank Lloyd Wright's home and studio in [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], and in [[Berlin, Germany]], between 1903 and 1914.

===Prologue===

The [[Cliff Dwellers Club]], Chicago, 1903. Architect Louis Sullivan, mentor and friend of Frank Lloyd Wright, has been drinking all afternoon. He muses on his estrangement from Wright.

===Act One===

Wright's studio, Oak Park, Illinois, 1903. Wright pitches plans for a new house to wealthy Chicagoans Edwin and Mamah Cheney. He and Mamah flirt; her husband is concerned with costs. After they leave, Wright muses on Mamah; his wife Catherine overhears him and they quarrel.

The Cheney House construction site, six months later. Workmen sing, townswomen gossip; Wright and Mamah arrive to view the work as their liaison deepens. Edwin arrives and there is a showdown: Mamah tells Edwin she is leaving him for Wright. Afterwards, Edwin laments the fact that, while he has gained a house, he has lost his wife.

Mamah's apartment in Berlin, 1910. As Mamah translates some verses from German, she comes to terms with her strongly ambivalent feelings about her life with Wright, recognizing, despite her love for him, that her dream of an equal partnership with him is and will remain just that. Sullivan, in Chicago, echoes the sentiment.

===Act Two===

Taliesin, Spring Green, Christmas, 1911. Wright delivers a prepared statement attempting to explain his living out of wedlock with Mamah while still married to Catherine. Mamah, though at his side, is clearly disaffected.

Taliesin, Summer, 1914. During the course of a [[cocktail party]], Wright pursues a new love interest as Mamah cannot help but observe; various clients, guests, colleagues, and employees &amp;mdash; including an inebriated barbershop quartet of newspaper reporters &amp;mdash; comment.

The Cliff Dwellers' Club, later that summer. Wright and Sullivan attempt a reconciliation, but are interrupted by Edwin Cheney, who delivers the news that Mamah's been murdered and Taliesin torched.

The ruins of Taliesin, later that night. The bodies of the dead are arrayed in the smoking remains of the house. A Maid explains that Julian Carleton, Wright's chef, has been found, his throat burned from drinking hydrochloric acid. Wright gropes for a way to go on, finds in the pocket of Mamah's coat a letter that gives him consolation of a sort. He vows to rebuild the house in her memory.

'''Stars on Ice''' is a touring [[figure skating]] show produced by [[IMG (business)|IMG]].  It was founded in 1986 as a vehicle for IMG client [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]], the 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist in men's figure skating.  The production is a theatrical show featuring a small cast of elite skaters who perform together in ensemble as well as solo numbers.  Hamilton retired from regular touring in 2001.

Stars on Ice was originally conceived as an ice show for adults, without the children's cartoon characters typical of other commercial ice shows of the period such as [[Ice Capades]] or [[Disney on Ice]].  It started on a shoestring budget, playing only a few dates in small-town arenas.  The first national tour was conducted in 1987-88.  In 1992, IMG bought out the rival “Skating” tour from [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham Presents]] and merged its resources with those of Stars on Ice.  Among the acquisitions from the “Skating” tour was [[Sandra Bezic]], who took over as Director and Choreographer of Stars on Ice for over a decade.  For the past two years, [[Jeffrey Buttle]] has served as Director.  In its history, Stars on Ice has won 3 Emmy Awards and the 1994 ACE Cable Award for Best Sports Special.

Stars on Ice tours the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and [[China]] on an annual basis, and has also staged shows in [[Europe]], [[Brazil]], and [[Korea]]. The Tour has played over 1,600 shows in its 32 seasons.

[[File:Sir Derek Jacobi on the Old Vic Theatre.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the theatre by [[Derek Jacobi]]]]

'''The Old Vic''' is a 1,000-seat, [[nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] [[producing house|producing theatre]], located just south-east of [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] on the corner of [[The Cut (London)|the Cut]] and [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]] in [[Lambeth]], London, England. Established in 1818 as the '''Royal Coburg Theatre''', and renamed in 1833 the '''Royal Victoria Theatre''', in 1871 it was rebuilt and reopened as the '''Royal Victoria Palace'''. It was taken over by [[Emma Cons]] in 1880 and formally named the '''Royal Victoria Hall''', although by that time it was already known as the "Old Vic". In 1898, a niece of Cons, [[Lilian Baylis]] assumed management and began a series of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] productions in 1914. The building was damaged in 1940 during [[The Blitz|air raids]] and it became a [[Grade II* listed building]] in 1951 after it reopened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=204779 English Heritage listing details] 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Vic is the crucible of many of the performing arts companies and theatres in London today. It was the name of a [[repertory]] company that was based at the theatre and formed (along with the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]]) the core of the [[National Theatre of Great Britain]] on its formation in 1963, under [[Laurence Olivier]]. The National Theatre remained at the Old Vic until new premises were constructed on the [[South Bank]], opening in 1976. The Old Vic then became the home of [[Prospect Theatre Company]], at that time a highly successful touring company which staged such acclaimed productions as [[Derek Jacobi]]'s ''Hamlet''. However, with the withdrawal of funding for the company by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] in 1980 for breaching its touring obligations, Prospect disbanded in 1981. The theatre underwent complete refurbishment in 1985. In 2003, [[Kevin Spacey]] was appointed artistic director, which received considerable media attention.&lt;ref name="bbc20030203"&gt;{{cite news|title=Spacey 'to run Old Vic'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2723437.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=3 February 2003|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Matthew Warchus]] succeeded Spacey as artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/22/matthew-warchus-kevin-spacey-old-vic-theatre|title=Matthew Warchus to take Kevin Spacey's role running the Old Vic|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=22 May 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=22 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Royal Coburg Theatre 1822.jpg|thumb|left|Royal Coburg Theatre in 1822]]
The theatre was founded in 1818 by James King and Daniel Dunn (formerly managers of the [[Surrey Theatre]] in [[Bermondsey]]), and [[John Thomas Serres]], then the marine painter to the King. Serres managed to secure the formal patronage of [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales|Princess Charlotte]] and her husband [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg]], and named the theatre the Royal Coburg Theatre. The theatre was a "minor" theatre (as opposed to one of the two [[patent theatre]]s) and was thus technically forbidden to show serious drama. Nevertheless, when the theatre passed to George Bolwell Davidge in 1824 he succeeded in bringing legendary actor [[Edmund Kean]] south of the river to play six Shakespeare plays in six nights. The theatre's role in bringing high art to the masses was confirmed when Kean addressed the audience during his curtain call saying "I have never acted to such a set of ignorant, unmitigated brutes as I see before me." More popular staples in the repertoire were "sensational and violent" melodramas demonstrating the evils of drink, "churned out by the house dramatist", confirmed [[teetotaller]] [[Douglas Jerrold]].&lt;ref name="jwf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frick|first=John W. |title=Theatre, culture and temperance reform in nineteenth-century America|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2003|page=86|isbn=978-0-521-81778-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Davidge left to take over the [[Surrey Theatre]] in 1833, the theatre was bought by [[Daniel Egerton]] and [[William Abbot]], who tried to capitalise on the abolition of the legal distinction between patent and minor theatres, enacted in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] earlier that year.&lt;ref name="Rowell1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowell|first=George Presbury|title=The Old Vic Theatre: a history|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-34625-8|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 1833,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Royal Victoria Theatre |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard|Standard]] |location=London |date=2 July 1833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the theatre was renamed the Royal Victoria Theatre, under the "protection and patronage" of [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Victoria, Duchess of Kent]], mother to [[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria]], the 14-year-old [[heir presumptive]] to the British throne. The duchess and the princess visited only once, on 28 November of that year, but enjoyed the performance, of light opera and dance, in the "pretty...clean and comfortable" theatre. The single visit scarcely justified the "Old Vic" its later billing asf "Queen Victoria's Own Theayter"&lt;!-- sic --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Rowell1993" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court Circular |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=30 November 1833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Henry Chance|authorlink=Henry Chance Newton|title=The Old Vic. and its associations; being my own extraordinary experiences of "Queen Victoria's own theayter"|year=1923|publisher=Fleetway Press|location=London|oclc=150444870}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1835, the theatre was advertising itself simply as the Victoria Theatre. 
[[File:Old Vic0185.JPG|thumb|right|The Old Vic, photographed in 2012]]


In 1841, David Osbaldiston took over as lessee, and was succeeded on his death in 1850 by his lover and the theatre's leading lady, Eliza Vincent, until her death in 1856. Under their management, the theatre remained devoted to melodrama. In 1858, sixteen people were crushed to death inside the theatre after mass panic caused while an actor's clothing caught fire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/theatre/old-vic-theatre-celebrates-200th-birthday-7-fascinating-things-you-never-knew-a3835981.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Coleman (2014), pp. 22–36.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, Joseph Arnold Cave took over as lessee. In 1871 he transferred the lease to Romaine Delatorre, who raised funds for the theatre to be rebuilt{{clarify|date=May 2018}} in the style of the [[Alhambra Music Hall]]. Jethro Thomas Robinson was engaged as the architect. In September 1871 the old theatre closed, and the new building opened as the Royal Victoria Palace in December of the same year, with Cave staying on as manager. By 1873, however, Cave had left and Delatorre's venture failed.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman (2014), pp. 43–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, under the ownership of [[Emma Cons]] (for whose memory there are plaques outside and inside the theatre) it became the Royal Victoria Hall and Coffee Tavern and was run on "strict [[Temperance movement|temperance]] lines"; by this time it was already known as the "Old Vic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47035 'The Royal Victoria Hall –The Old Vic'], ''Survey of London: Vol. 23''. Lambeth: South Bank and Vauxhall (1951), pp. 37–9. Retrieved 28 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The "penny lectures" given in the hall led to the foundation of [[Morley College]]. An endowment from the estate of [[Samuel Morley (MP)|Samuel Morley]] led to the creation of the ''Morley Memorial College for Working Men and Women'' on the premises, which were shared; lectures were given back stage, and in the theatre dressing rooms. The [[adult education]] college moved to its own premises nearby in the 1920s.

===Old Vic company===
[[Image:Old vic night.JPG|thumb|left|The theatre at night]]
With Emma Cons's death in 1912 the theatre passed to her niece [[Lilian Baylis]], who emphasised the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] repertoire. The Old Vic Company was established in 1929, led by [[John Gielgud|Sir John Gielgud]]. Between 1925 and 1931, [[Lilian Baylis]] championed the re-building of the then-derelict [[Sadler's Wells]] Theatre, and established a ballet company under the direction of [[Ninette de Valois|Dame Ninette de Valois]]. For a few years the drama and ballet companies rotated between the two theatres, with the ballet becoming permanently based at Sadler's Wells in 1935.

===Wartime exile===
The Old Vic was damaged badly during [[the Blitz]], and the war-depleted company spent all its time touring, based in [[Burnley]], Lancashire at the Victoria Theatre during the years 1940 to 1943. In 1944, the company was re-established in London with [[Ralph Richardson]] and [[Laurence Olivier]] as its stars, performing mainly at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] (now the Noël Coward Theatre) until the Old Vic was ready to reopen in 1950. In 1946, an offshoot of the company was established in [[Bristol]] as the [[Bristol Old Vic]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===National Theatre company===
In 1963, the Old Vic company was dissolved and the new [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] Company, under the artistic direction of [[Laurence Olivier|Lord Olivier]], was based at the Old Vic until its own building was opened on the [[South Bank]] near [[Waterloo Bridge]] in 1976.

[[Image:Old Vic.jpg|thumb|Staircase of the Old Vic]]
In July 1974 the Old Vic presented a rock concert for the first time. National Theatre director [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Sir Peter Hall]] arranged for the progressive folk-rock band [[Gryphon (band)|Gryphon]] to première ''Midnight Mushrumps'', the fantasia inspired by Hall's own 1974 Old Vic production of ''[[The Tempest]]'' starring [[John Gielgud]] for which Gryphon had supplied the music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Prospect Theatre Company===
For two years prior to the departure of the National Theatre company, [[Toby Robertson]], director of the [[Prospect Theatre Company]], sustained a campaign that the Old Vic should make Prospect its resident company.&lt;ref name=rowell157&gt;Rowell, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; For the Old Vic, Robertson's overtures proved increasingly hard to resist in the face of poor box office returns achieved by productions staged by other visiting companies; against this, Prospect staged a highly successful season which opened in May 1977, including ''Hamlet'' with [[Derek Jacobi]], ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' with [[Alec McCowen]] and [[Dorothy Tutin]]; and ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' with [[Eileen Atkins]].&lt;ref name=rowell158&gt;Rowell, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =History of the Old Vic, 1950–1999 | publisher =The Old Vic | url =http://www.oldvictheatre.com/about-us/history-of-the-old-vic-2/1950-1999/ | accessdate = 5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July the Governors of the Old Vic announced "a marriage that was all but a merger" between the Vic and Prospect. In September Toby Robertson, director of Prospect, was asked to take artistic control of the Old Vic, and Christopher Richards, general manager of the Old Vic, became general manager of Prospect.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect&gt;{{cite web | title =Prospect Theatre Company | publisher =Ian McKellen Stage | url =http://www.mckellen.com/stage/r2/prospect.htm | accessdate = 4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major problem, though, was the terms of Prospect's funding by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]]: this was on the basis of it being a touring company, and the Council – already funding the National Theatre and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in London – could not accept a case for a third major company in the capital and repeatedly refused requests to fund any London seasons staged by Prospect. Therefore, any London-based productions would have to succeed financially without Arts Council support. Prospect's first season at the Old Vic recouped its costs but left no surplus to fund future productions. Further stagings by visiting companies were box office failures and stretched the theatre's finances to breaking point.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Prospect continued to draw audiences to the Old Vic where other companies failed. In December 1978, the governors of the Old Vic agreed to a five-year contract with Prospect, announcing to the press on 23 April that henceforth they would be styled "Prospect Productions Ltd., trading as the Old Vic Company".&lt;ref name=rowell160&gt;Rowell, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately Prospect's touring commitments kept the company out of the theatre for the first half of 1979, leaving the theatre to sink further into debt. The company returned in July with Jacobi's ''Hamlet'' (toured afterwards to Denmark, Australia and China, the first English theatre company to tour that country),&lt;ref name=Continuum/&gt; followed by ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' with [[Ian Richardson]].&lt;ref name=rowell160/&gt; The following season, however, proved controversial: the proposed programming, including the double bill of ''The Padlock'' and ''[[Miss in Her Teens]]'', to mark the bicentenary of [[David Garrick]]'s death, and a revival of ''[[What the Butler Saw (play)|What the Butler Saw]]'', were deemed by the Arts Council unsuitable for touring repertory.&lt;ref name=rowell160/&gt; An internal report by Prospect now questioned "whether Prospect can any longer satisfy the triple task of filling the Vic, of satisfying the Arts Council Director of Touring's requirements for product of a certain familiar sort, and of realising the vision of Toby Robertson".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rowell, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was in effect fired as artistic director in 1980 while he was abroad with the company in [[China]], [[Timothy West]] replacing him.&lt;ref name=GuardianRobertsonobit&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/08/toby-robertson | work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=16 September 2013 | date=8 July 2012 | title= Toby Robertson obituary| first=Michael | last=Coveney }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, West's first as Robertson's successor, saw ''[[Macbeth]]'' with [[Peter O'Toole]], ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' with West as Shylock, and a gala performance presented to the Queen Mother to celebrate her eightieth birthday.&lt;ref name=rowell161/&gt; On 22 December 1980, four days after the gala performance, the Arts Council withdrew its funding from the company, sealing its inevitable demise.&lt;ref name=Continuum&gt;{{cite book | last =Hunter | first =Adriana | authorlink = | title ="Prospect Theatre Company" in Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre | publisher =A&amp;C Black | series = | volume =| edition = | date =2006 | location =| pages =623 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cFlFhuVMFGQC&amp;pg=PA623&amp;lpg=PA623&amp;dq=%22The+Old+Vic%22+%22Prospect+Theatre%22+%22Toby+Robertson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mV8ooYukE5&amp;sig=glE3lOsUU5ecrBRdq_ryN_aoDJA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeYIVKGqJMzYao2MgvgJ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Old%20Vic%22%20%22Prospect%20Theatre%22%20%22Toby%20Robertson%22&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn =9781847140012 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rowell161&gt;Rowell, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; The company gave a final season at the Old Vic in 1981, staging ''The Merchant of Venice'', then gave a final tour of Europe, giving its last performance in Rome on 14 June before disbanding.&lt;ref name=rowell161/&gt;

=== Youth Theatre ===
The 'Old Vic Youth Theatre’ was an acting company for young people between the ages of 12 and 20 mainly from the London Borough of Southwark. The group was founded by Tom Vaughan of the Old Vic Theatre, Raymond Rivers of Morley College and Barry Anderson of the Southbank Education Institute. The [[Inner London Education Authority]] (ILEA) was the enterprise’s main funding body.

During the early spring term of 1977 auditions consisting of improvisational scenes run by the Youth Theatre’s first professional directors Lucy Parker and Frederick Proud took place and around 40 applicants were chosen to form the company.

By the middle of the summer in 1977 the 'Old Vic Youth Theatre’ had performed two plays for the paying public. First was ‘The Kitchen’ by [[Arnold Wesker]] which also incorporated improvised scenes alongside the actual script and was staged in the Emma Cons Hall at Morley College. The Youth Theatre’s second production, ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ by William Shakespeare was first performed at the George Inn Courtyard as part of the Southwark Shakespeare Festival the same year and was the company’s debut production at the Old Vic Theatre itself.

In the autumn of 1977 a new round of auditions took place and the existing group expanded into two. One group concentrated on a famous scripted play whilst the other would devise a play through improvisation from which the material was scripted into a play by a professional playwright.

The Youth groups continued to produce plays with new members auditioning each September until the mid 1980s.

===Reopening===
The Old Vic was significantly restored under the ownership of Toronto department-store entrepreneur [[Edwin Mirvish|'Honest Ed' Mirvish]] in 1985. In 1987, his son [[David Mirvish]] installed [[Jonathan Miller]] as artistic director of the Old Vic and the theatre enjoyed several critical successes – including an [[Olivier Award]] for a production of the musical ''Candide'', but suffered three straight years of financial loss. In 1990, Mirvish terminated Miller's contract over budgetary issues, earning much negative criticism in the British press.

In 1997, Mirvish appointed [[Peter Hall (director)|Sir Peter Hall]] as artistic director and, again, enjoyed critical acclaim with such productions as ''[[The Master Builder]]'' with [[Alan Bates]] and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' with [[Ben Kingsley]], but continuing financial loss. Within a year of the appointment, Mirvish terminated Hall's contract – again to much negative comment in the press – and put the Old Vic up for sale. In 1998, the building was bought by a new charitable trust, the ''Old Vic Theatre Trust 2000''. In 2000, the production company Criterion Productions was renamed ''Old Vic Productions plc'', though relatively few of its productions are at the Old Vic theatre.

In 2003, actor [[Kevin Spacey]] was appointed as new artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre Company. Spacey said he wanted to inject new life into the British theatre industry, and bring British and American theatrical talent to the stage. 

Since 2015 [[Matthew Warchus]] has been Artistic Director of The Old Vic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/22/matthew-warchus-kevin-spacey-old-vic-theatre | title=Matthew Warchus to take Kevin Spacey's role running the Old Vic | work=The Guardian | date=22 May 2014 | accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut season opened in September 2015 with Warchus's production of a new play about education, ''Future Conditional'' by Tamsin Oglesby. 

===Bicentenary===

On 24 October 2017 The Old Vic announced its bicentenary season&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/old-vic-bicentennial-season-monster-calls-sylvia_44947.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The theatre celebrated its 200th birthday on Friday 11 May 2018 with a free performance of Joe Penhall's Mood Music, featuring Ben Chaplin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/theatre/the-old-vic-is-giving-out-free-tickets-to-new-show-mood-music-and-cake-for-its-birthday-a3796236.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Mediators' Retreat, which in 2006 became known as the Oslo Forum, was initiated in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mediators’ Retreat to be held in Oslo on 18–19 June|url = https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/mediators_retreat_to_be_held_in/id251039/|website = Government.no|date = 17 June 2003 |accessdate = 20 October 2015 |language = |first = Ministry of Foreign|last = Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a small gathering of mediation practitioners. The first Forum only included 17 participants but the event has now expanded to around 100 participants each year. The Forum is scheduled over two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hdcentre.org/uploads/tx_news/HD-Oslo-Forum-2014.pdf|title = Oslo Forum 2014: Engaging with radical groups in conflicts. What can we accomplish through dialogue?|last = |first = |date = 2014|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, a regional retreat was organised for the first time in Singapore to discuss peace processes in South and South East Asia. Since then, Asian and African regional retreats have regularly taken place to complement the global retreat organised in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title = Welcome Remarks by Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Zainul Abidin Rasheed at Asian Mediators' Retreat|url = http://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/media_centre/special_events/pedrabranca/press_room/mfa_pr/2006/200611/press_200611_1.html|website = www.mfa.gov.sg|accessdate = 20 October 2015|date = 27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The Forum aims to improve mediation practice, build a community of conflict mediation practitioners and increase peer learning. The Oslo Forum functions as a laboratory for testing peacemakers’ assumptions and ideas from diverse conflicts and regions, and as a safe venue for sharing lessons learnt and best practices, and challenging commonly held preconceptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Participants ==

Oslo Forum retreats attracts approximately one hundred senior mediators, key actors from the [[United Nations]], intergovernmental and regional organisations, as well as government officials, private organisations, conflict party representatives, war correspondents, outstanding analysts, thinkers and experts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/esdp/90605.pdf|title = Mediating Today's Conflicts for Tomorrow's Peace|last = Solana|first = Javier|date = 27 June 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = S183/06|publisher = European Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participation of conflict protagonists has attracted international media attention.

== Media coverage ==
All discussions at the Oslo Forum are held under the Chatham House Rule of non-attribution. International media outlets have, however, covered main themes discussed at the Oslo Forum. This includes for example BBC coverage of discussions on possible peace talks with the Taliban in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Afghanistan peace conundrum flummoxes mediators - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/10358053|website = BBC News|accessdate = 20 October 2015|language = |date = 19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Afghanistan's leaders face battle for peace - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33242063|website = BBC News|accessdate = 20 October 2015 |date = 23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with selected Oslo Forum participants on the side lines of the event and a recap of main themes have also featured in the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Scandinavia's Scarred Mr. Dialogue|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/opinion/14cohen.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 14 July 2008 |access-date = 20 October 2015 |issn = 0362-4331|first = Roger|last = Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Economist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Privatising peace|url = http://www.economist.com/node/18895458|newspaper = The Economist|access-date = 20 October 2015|issn = |date = 30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other outlets.

'''The Tree That Owns Itself''' is a [[Quercus alba|white oak]] tree that has, according to legend, legal ownership of itself and of all land within {{convert|8|ft|spell=in}} of its base. The tree, also called the '''Jackson Oak''', is located at the corner of South Finley and Dearing Streets in [[Athens, Georgia]], United States. The original tree, thought to have started life between the mid-16th and late 18th century, fell in 1942, but a new tree was grown from one of its [[acorn]]s, and planted in the same location. The current tree is sometimes referred to as the '''Son of The Tree That Owns Itself'''. Both trees have appeared in numerous national publications, and the site is a local landmark.

==Legend==
[[File:The tree that owns itself, Athens, Georgia (8342838973).jpg|thumb|Postcard of the tree from the 1930s or 1940s]]
The earliest-known telling of the tree's story comes from a front-page article entitled "Deeded to Itself" in the ''Athens Weekly Banner'' of August 12, 1890. The article explains that the tree had been located on the property of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] William Henry Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Knight |first = Lucian Lamar |title = A Standard History of Georgia and Georgians |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g0YUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Jackson%20Oak%22%20Athens&amp;pg=PA1446 |access-date = February 13, 2011 |volume = vol. 3 |year = 1917 |publisher = Lewis Publishing |location = Chicago |page = 1446 |via = [[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Jackson was the son of [[James Jackson (Georgia politician)|James Jackson]] (a soldier in the [[American Revolution]] as well as a [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]], [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]], and [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor of Georgia]]), and the father of another [[James Jackson (congressman)|James Jackson]] (a congressman and Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]]). He was the brother of [[Jabez Young Jackson]], also a congressman.&lt;ref name="1801–1851"&gt;{{cite book |title= Athens, Georgia 1801–1951 |location= Athens, GA |publisher=Mayor and City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;{{cite web |first=  George R. |last= Lamplight |author2= NGE Staff |date= September 15, 2014 |url= http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1087&amp;hl=y |title= James Jackson (1757–1806) |work= The New Georgia Encyclopedia |access-date= April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (William Jackson was reportedly a professor at the [[University of Georgia]], and is sometimes given the title of ''Doctor''. The nature of his military service and the source of the title "Colonel" are unknown.)&lt;ref name=cviog&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/athens/TREE.htm |title= Tree That Owns Itself |publisher= Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia |access-date= April 7, 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724055155/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/athens/TREE.htm |archivedate= July 24, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson supposedly cherished childhood memories of the tree, and, desiring to protect it, [[deed]]ed to it the ownership of itself and its surrounding land. By various accounts, this transaction took place between 1820 and 1832.&lt;ref name=plaque&gt;The date "1832" is given on a brass plaque affixed to the tree's retaining wall.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the newspaper article, the deed read:

{{quote|I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&amp;nbsp;... of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.}}

It is unclear whether the story of the Tree That Owns Itself began with the ''Weekly Banner'' article, or if it had been an element of local [[folklore]] prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.&lt;ref name=ABW1890&gt;{{cite news |title= Deeded to Itself |date= August 12, 1890 |work= Athens Weekly Banner |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oldstoneplaque.jpg|left|thumb|Plaque at the site, weathered by exposure; the stone faintly details a passage from William H. Jackson's deed to the tree.]]
The story of the Tree That Owns Itself is very widely known, and is almost always presented as fact. However, only one person—the anonymous author of "Deeded to Itself"—has ever claimed to have seen Jackson's [[deed]] to the tree. Most writers acknowledge that the deed is lost or no longer exists, if in fact it ever did. Such a deed, even if it did exist, would have no legal standing. Under [[common law]], the person receiving the property in question must have the legal capacity to receive it, and the property must be delivered to—and accepted by—the recipient.&lt;ref name=Reap&gt;{{cite book |last = Reap |first =  James K. |year= 2001 |title = Athens, a Pictorial History |edition = 3rd |location = Virginia Beach, VA |publisher = Donning }}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William H. Jackson did, in fact, own the property on the opposite side of Dearing Street from the tree. That plot included the present-day 226 Dearing Street, but in the early 19th century it was simply designated Lot #14. The tree, however, is located on a portion of what had been Lot #15. Jackson and his wife Mildred, along with a J. A. Cobb, sold their property to a Dr. Malthus Ward in 1832, the same year cited on a plaque as being the date of the tree's deed. The [[Clarke County, Georgia|Clarke County]] real estate indices contain no indication of when or from whom Jackson originally purchased the property, although much of the land in that area is reported to have belonged to a Major James Meriwether.&lt;ref name=DeedBooks2&gt;Clarke County, Georgia, Deed Book P, page 9 (June 15, 1832) and Deed Book S, page 301. (The latter simply identifies Mildred as William Jackson's wife.){{full citation needed|date= March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CVIOGDearing"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/athens/DEARINGS.htm |title= Dearing Street Historic District |publisher= Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia |access-date= April 7, 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810090041/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/athens/DEARINGS.htm |archivedate= August 10, 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Papers"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last = Cooper |editor-first= Patricia Irvin |display-editors=etal |year= 1979 |title= Papers of the Athens Historical Society  |volume= vol. 2  |location=  Athens, GA |publisher= Athens Historical Society}}{{page needed|date= March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Jackson may have lived near the tree as an adult, his childhood was actually spent in [[Jefferson County, Georgia|Jefferson County]], not in Athens,&lt;ref name=cviog /&gt; making it less likely that he had experienced idyllic childhood summers playing beneath the tree's branches.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Recent deeds suggest that the tree's square footage remains part of the property at 125 Dearing Street. These documents describe a parcel bounded on the east by Finley Street and on the north by Dearing Street, an area that would seem to encompass the tree.&lt;ref name=DeedBooks&gt;Clarke County, Georgia, Deed Books 1558–166 (1996), 338–455 (1970), et al.{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual [[plat]] map for that property clearly does not include the tree's oddly shaped corner: its eastern line lies roughly {{convert|10|ft|spell=in}} to the west of the tree's location—as far as the tax assessor is concerned, the tree's area is not a part of that property.&lt;ref name=Plat&gt;Clarke County, Georgia, Plat Book 32–364.{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not confirm that the tree owns itself, but suggests, rather, that it is considered to be within the [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] along Finley Street. [[Athens – Clarke County metropolitan area|Athens-Clarke County]] confirms that the tree is in the right-of-way, and is thus "accepted for care" by municipal authorities; according to city-county officials, local government and the owners of the adjacent property jointly serve as "stewards" for the care of the tree, while Athens' Junior Ladies' Garden Club serves as its "primary advocate."

==Biography==
The original Tree That Owns Itself is estimated to have started life at some time between the mid-16th and late 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="excursia"&gt;{{cite web |last= Dorsey |first= Derrick |url= http://excursia.com/destinations/USA/GA/athens/stories/20010406/att_tree.shtml |title= Mighty oak enjoys golden years |work= Excursia |access-date= April 7, 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040401032007/http://excursia.com/destinations/USA/GA/athens/stories/20010406/att_tree.shtml |archivedate= April 1, 2004 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letsgo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.letsgo.com/articles/view.php?article=north_america/local/tree.xml |title= The Tree That Owns Itself |work= Lets Go |access-date= April 7, 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070509215727/http://www.letsgo.com/articles/view.php?article=north_america%2Flocal%2Ftree.xml |archivedate= May 9, 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was considered by some to be both the biggest tree in Athens and the most famous tree in the United States.&lt;ref name="ABH1946"&gt;{{cite news |title= Stripling of an oak bravely sets out as heir to 'tree that owns itself' |date=December 5, 1946 |work= Athens Banner-Herald |pages= 1, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas99&gt;{{cite book |last= Thomas |first= Frances Taliaferro |year= 1999 |title= Historic Dearing Street |location= Athens, GA |publisher= Athens-Clarke Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree predated the transformation of the area into a residential neighborhood beginning in the mid-19th century. The residence adjacent to the tree, known as [[Dominie]] House, was built at the corner of Milledge Avenue and Waddell Street in 1883, and was moved to its present location about twenty years later.&lt;ref name="Thomas99" /&gt;

[[File:The tree that owns itself (4987035786).jpg|thumb|The original Tree That Owns Itself in 1910]]
By 1906, [[erosion]] had become apparent at the base of the tree. [[George Foster Peabody]] paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight [[granite]] posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had already set in, and the tree was permanently weakened.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

The original oak fell on the evening of October 9, 1942, following a long period of decline. Its poor condition had been known for years, and within days of its collapse, a move was under way to replace the fallen tree with a "son" grown from one of its acorns.&lt;ref name="ABHOct42"&gt;{{cite news |last= Scobel |first= Harvey |date= October 11, 1942 |title= Famed old tree that owned itself, bowing to ravages of age, crashes here Friday |work= Athens Banner-Herald |pages= 1, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One account suggests that the tree had actually died several years before its collapse, the victim of root rot.&lt;ref name="ABH1946"/&gt; The tree was over {{convert|100|ft}} tall, and was estimated to be between 150 and 400 years old when it fell.&lt;ref name="excursia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="letsgo" /&gt; It has been reported elsewhere that the tree fell on ''December 1'', 1942, succumbing not to old age and disease but rather to a violent windstorm that ravaged much of north Georgia that evening, causing widespread damage and killing several people.&lt;ref name="ABH1942"&gt;{{cite news|title= Windstorm hits Athens and area; several casualties reported |date = December 2, 1942 |work= Athens Banner-Herald  |pages = 1, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible that some portion of the tree had remained standing for several weeks, meeting a dramatic end at the hands of a killer storm, only the earlier date is supported by newspaper accounts. It is not known why the tree was not dated by counting its rings.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

==Son of The Tree That Owns Itself==
After the original tree's demise, its small plot sat vacant for four years. Dan Magill, the young son of Athens' Junior Ladies Garden Club member Elizabeth Magill, suggested that his mother's club find a replacement for the tree. Several Athenians had cultivated seedlings from acorns of the original tree. One growing in the yard of Capt. Jack Watson, at {{convert|5|ft|spell=in}} in height, was deemed the best candidate for transplantation. The operation was directed by Roy Bowden of the College of [[Agriculture]] at the University of Georgia, assisted by students in the Department of [[Horticulture]].&lt;ref name="ABH1946"/&gt;

The new tree was officially dedicated in a formal ceremony on December 4, 1946. Athens [[Mayor]] Robert L. McWhorter presided and Dr. E.L. Hill, pastor of the First [[Presbyterian]] Church, offered a short prayer. Also in attendance were Capt. and Mrs. Watson and representatives of the Garden Club. Club President Patsy Dudley announced that her group would henceforth take responsibility for maintenance of the tree's plot, which had fallen into disrepair during the vacancy.&lt;ref name="ABH1946"/&gt; The new tree, trimmed back to a mere {{convert|3|ft}} for transplantation, thrived in its new location. This tree is considered, popularly if not legally, to be the full heir of the original tree. As such, it is sometimes referred to as the ''Son of The Tree That Owns Itself'', although it is generally known by the same title as its progenitor. The tree was over {{convert|50|ft}} tall {{as of|2006|lc=y}}.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

On December 4, 1996, the Garden Club staged a celebration to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the planting of the new tree. Dan Magill, who, as a boy, had inspired the replanting effort, served as master of ceremonies.&lt;ref name="excursia" /&gt;

The tree sits near the crest of a hill, at the southwest corner of the intersection of Dearing and Finley Streets, in a quiet residential neighborhood near downtown Athens and [[University of Georgia|UGA]]'s North Campus. The portion of Finley Street leading up the hill to the tree is Athens' only remaining [[cobblestone]] street.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The tree's lot is separated from the larger portion of the adjacent property by a private driveway; its enclosure also juts several feet into Finley Street. Thus the tree may in fact appear to occupy a small but separate tract of land. The appearance of separation is accentuated by the retaining wall and ornamental chain barrier that surround the tree. Although located alongside private homes in a residential neighborhood, the Tree That Owns Itself is "open" to the public, and regularly attracts visitors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Although the story of the Tree That Owns Itself is more legend than history, the tree has become (along with the [[University of Georgia#History|University Arch]] and the [[Double-barreled cannon|Double-Barreled Cannon]]) one of the most recognized and well-loved symbols of Athens. It is routinely featured in travel guides and other visitor information, and has even garnered international recognition through such publications as ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not]]'', where it has been featured on several occasions.&lt;ref name="Ripley"&gt;Edward Meyer, Vice President for Exhibits and Archives, Ripley Entertainment Inc (October 26, 2006). Ripley's has featured the tree on at least three occasions: November 10, 1983, August 28, 1994, and April 27, 1996.{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tablets==
[[File:Forandinconsideration.jpg|thumb|Newer plaque at the site detailing a portion of William H. Jackson's deed]]
The site of the tree contains two stone tablets. The first is heavily weathered and has suffered the loss of one corner, while the second appears to be considerably newer. Both tablets [[paraphrase]] the same portion of William H. Jackson's supposed deed to the tree, with slight alterations made to transform the legalistic language into a [[first-person narrative|first-person]] declaration of affection:{{fact|date=September 2018}}

{{quote|For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feet of the tree on all sides&lt;br /&gt;William H. Jackson}}

A small brass plaque, about the size of a playing card, is attached to the lower left corner of the face of the more weathered of the two tablets. It reads:{{fact|date=September 2018}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;A
Descendent of the
Tree
That Owns Itself
Planted by the
Junior
Ladies Garden Club

In addition to the stone tablets a larger brass plaque is affixed to the concrete retaining wall that surrounds the tree. The plaque reads:{{fact|date=September 2018}}

The entire Dearing Street Historic District (of which the tree is a "resident") was added to the [[National Register]] in 1975. The District incorporates an area very roughly bounded by Broad, Finley, Waddell, and Church Streets, and was recognized for its [[architecture|architectural]] significance. The tree was locally designated a historic landmark on February 2, 1988.&lt;ref name="cviog" /&gt;

On May 7, 1999, during the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (Operation Allied Force)]], five US [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] guided bombs hit the [[People's Republic of China]] [[embassy]] in the [[Belgrade]] district of [[Novi Beograd|New Belgrade]], killing three Chinese reporters and outraging the Chinese public. According to the U.S. government, the intention had been to bomb the nearby Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement. President [[Bill Clinton]] later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://congressionalresearch.com/RS20547/document.php |title = Chinese Embassy Bombing In Belgrade: Compensation Issues |publisher = Congressionalresearch.com |date = |accessdate = January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Intelligence Agency]] director [[George Tenet]] testified before a congressional committee that the bombing was the only one in the campaign organized and directed by his agency,&lt;ref name="Schmitt1"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/global/072399china-embassy.html |title = In a Fatal Error, C.I.A.

== Sequence of events ==
In the days prior to the bombing, an attack folder labelled 'Belgrade Warehouse 1' was circulated for command approval. The folder originated within the CIA and described the target as a warehouse for a Yugoslav government agency suspected of arms proliferation activities. In this form, the strike was approved by President Clinton.

It is unclear if other NATO leaders approved the strike. A report by the French Ministry of Defense after the war stated that "part of the military operations were conducted by the United States outside the strict framework of NATO"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/11/world/us-military-acted-outside-nato-framework-during-kosovo-conflict-france-says.html |title = U.S. Military Acted Outside NATO Framework During Kosovo Conflict, France Says |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |last= Whitney |first= Craig |date=November 11, 1999|work= |publisher=New York Times|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a dual-track command structure existed. NATO had no authority over the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 stealth bombers]] that carried out the strike.

According to the CIA account, the target was checked against 'no-strike' databases but these raised no alarms; these are lists of protected sites such as schools, hospitals and places of worship. The joint Observer/Politiken investigation later reported its journalists had interviewed various NATO and US officers who had checked the databases the morning after the attack and found the embassy listed at its correct location.

On the night of May 7–8, the strike was carried out by bombers of the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[509th Bomb Wing]] flying directly out of [[Whiteman Air Force Base|Whiteman AFB]], [[Missouri]]. The bombers were armed with JDAM GPS-guided precision bombs but the geographic coordinates provided by the CIA and programmed into the bombs were those of the Chinese embassy {{convert|440|m|yd|abbr=on}} away. At around midnight local time 5 bombs landed at the location indicated, striking the south end of the embassy almost simultaneously. The embassy had taken precautionary measures in view of the ongoing bombing campaign, sending staff home and housing others in the basement,&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Diamond |first = John |title = The CIA and the Culture of Failure: U.S. Intelligence from the end of the Cold War to the Invasion of Iraq |publisher = Stanford University Press |year= 2008 |page = 552 |isbn = 0-8047-5601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the attack still resulted in 3 fatalities, Shao Yunhuan (邵云环), Xu Xinghu (许杏虎) and his wife, Zhu Ying (朱颖), and 20 injuries.

== Chinese reaction ==
The raid caused a dramatic rise in tension between China and the United States. An official statement on Chinese television denounced what it called a "barbaric attack and a gross violation of Chinese sovereignty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/338424.stm |title = Nato hits Chinese embassy |accessdate=October 25, 2009 |date=May 8, 1999 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's ambassador to the [[UN]] described what he called "NATO's barbarian act" as "a gross violation of the United Nations charter, international law and the norms governing international relations" and "a violation of the Geneva convention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/338557.stm | title=Embassy strike 'a mistake' |accessdate=October 25, 2009 |date=May 8, 1999|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Clinton telephoned his Chinese counterpart [[Jiang Zemin]].

Large demonstrations erupted at consular offices of the United States and other NATO countries in China in reaction to news of the bombing. On May 9, 1999, then vice-president [[Hu Jintao]] delivered a national televised speech condemning the "barbaric" and "criminal conduct" of NATO, which "incited the fury of the Chinese people."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;(Chinese) [http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2003-05-25/14421097103.shtml "资料：1999年5月9日胡锦涛就我驻南使馆遭袭击发表讲话"] Accessed July 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  He said the unauthorized demonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang reflected the anger and patriotism of the Chinese people, and which the Chinese government fully supported, but urged against extreme and illegal conduct.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/1999-05-09/world/9905_09_china.protest.03_1_federal-directorate-nato-bombing-supply-and-procurement?_s=PM:WORLD "Chinese in Belgrade, Beijing protest NATO embassy bombing"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009063910/http://articles.cnn.com/1999-05-09/world/9905_09_china.protest.03_1_federal-directorate-nato-bombing-supply-and-procurement?_s=PM:WORLD |date=October 9, 2012 }} May 9, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests continued for several days, during which tens of thousands of rock-throwing protesters kept US Ambassador [[James Sasser]] and other staff trapped in the Beijing embassy.&lt;ref name="Dumbaugh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congressionalresearch.com/RS20547/document.php|title=Chinese Embassy Bombing in Belgrade:Compensation Issues|accessdate=April 8, 2010 |last= Dumbaugh|first= Kerry|authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 12, 2000|year= |month= |work= |publisher=Congressional Research Service publication|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The residence of the US Consul in Chengdu was damaged by fire and protestors tried to burn the consulate in Guangzhou.

{{quote|During the first day and a half of the crisis, many of our colleagues, especially those in the Chancery and at some of the Consulates, were in significant danger. Though U.S. Marines protected the Chancery from direct assault, officers on the spot engaged in a full-scale destruction of classified materials that might fall into the hands of demonstrators should the Embassy be overrun. In hindsight, it appears the danger was never that close, but several Chinese did jump the compound wall and had to be confronted by Marines in full battle gear before they were persuaded to jump back over the wall.
Except for Shanghai, with its own Marine guard contingent, the other Consulates were protected only by Chinese security guards. In Chengdu those guards were of virtually no help. Demonstrators climbed the compound wall, set fire to the Consul’s residence, and smashed their way through the outer door of the Consulate. They were using a bike rack to try to crash into the interior – while screaming that they were going to exact vengeance – when city security forces finally arrived and routed them.

President Clinton's apologies and those of the US State Department were not initially allowed to be broadcast by Chinese state-run media outlets. The demonstrations continued for four days before the Chinese government called a halt, eventually broadcasting President Clinton's apology on television and ordering the police to restrain the demonstrators. The two nations' leaders finally spoke on May 14.&lt;ref name="Dumbaugh"/&gt;

===Settlement===
By the end of 1999, relations began to gradually improve. In August, the U.S. government made a "voluntary humanitarian payment" of $4.5 million to the families of the three Chinese nationals who were killed and to the 27 injured in the bombing.&lt;ref name="Dumbaugh"/&gt;  On December 16, 1999, the two governments reached a settlement under which the United States agreed to pay $28 million in compensation for damage to the Chinese Embassy facility, and China agreed to pay $2.87 million in compensation for damage inflicted to the U.S. Embassy and other diplomatic facilities in China.&lt;ref name="Dumbaugh"/&gt;

==Official investigation and reporting in the aftermath==
Late on May 8, US [[Defense Secretary]] [[William Cohen]] and George Tenet issued a joint press release stating neither the aircrew involved nor the equipment were to blame for the incident.&lt;ref name="Schmitt2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/10/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-human-error-wrong-address-of-embassy-in-databases.html?pagewanted=all |title=CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: HUMAN ERROR; Wrong Address of Embassy in Databases|accessdate=October 23, 2009 |last= Schmitt |first= Eric |date=May 10, 1999|work= |publisher=New York Times|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt to explain the bombing came on May 10. William Cohen told reporters "In simple terms, one of our planes attacked the wrong target because the bombing instructions were based on an outdated map".&lt;ref name="DefSec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=536 |title=Secretary of Defense Cohen's News Briefing on Chinese Embassy Bombing |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |last= Cohen|first= William |date=May 10, 1999|work= |publisher=US Department of Defense|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement made no mention of the CIA. It was subsequently revealed that the CIA possessed maps showing the embassy.&lt;ref name="Schmitt2"/&gt;

While US officials then began, on the record, to deflect questions pending the outcome of further enquiries, they continued to brief journalists off the record. For example, also on May 10 [[Eric P. Schmitt|Eric Schmitt]] published an account with most of the elements that were to feature in DCI Tenet's later admissions.&lt;ref name="Schmitt2"/&gt; The officials briefed Schmitt that "the Chinese Embassy and a headquarters for a Yugoslav arms agency ... look very similar: same size, shape and height", and that the buildings were {{convert|180|m|yd|abbr=on}} apart, which was less than half of the measured distance.

Media criticism focused on the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|National Imagery and Mapping Agency]] (NIMA), which issued a press release to counter the attacks stating that "recent news reports regarding the accuracy of NIMA maps have been inaccurate or incomplete" and that "a hardcopy map is neither intended, nor used, as the sole source for target identification and approval."&lt;ref name="NIMA"&gt;{{citation|title=MEDIA RELEASE:990516-2 |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |date=May 16, 1999|work= |publisher=National Imagery and Mapping Agency|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official State Department account===
In June, Under Secretary of State [[Thomas R. Pickering|Thomas Pickering]] led a delegation to China to present the US version of events.&lt;ref name="pickering"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/6524.doc | title=Oral Presentation the Chinese Government Regarding the Accidental Bombing of The P.R.C. Embassy in Belgrade|accessdate=October 24, 2009 |last= Pickering |first= Thomas R.|date=July 6, 1999|work= |publisher=US Department of State|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:ChinaEmbassyBelgrade3.png|thumb|left|x144px|alt=SW and NW sides of the embassy showing bomb damage|Fire broke out after bombs struck the SW (R) and NW (L) sides of the building.]] Deleted --&gt;According to the official account, CIA analysts knew the address of the Yugoimport office to be Bulevar Umetnosti 2 (2 Boulevard of the Arts). Using this information, they attempted to pinpoint its geographic location by using the known locations and addresses of other buildings on parallel streets as reference points. Pickering referred to this technique as intersection and resection, not related to the method of resection and intersection.

Parallel lines were drawn from known addresses and locations on a parallel street. With this information it was attempted to reconstruct the pattern of street addresses on Bulevar Umetnosti, which was information unknown to the targeters. The pattern of street addresses on Bulevar Umetnosti was not as expected, and the targeter erroneously pinpointed the embassy "located on a small side street at some distance on Bulevar Umetnosti" from the intended target. This was not true as Ulica Tresnjevog Cveta (Cherry Blossom St, the small side street where the embassy was located) does not connect with Bulevar Umetnosti which ends {{convert|200|m|yd|abbr=on}} short of the junction with Cherry Blossom St.&lt;ref name="Schmitt2"/&gt; A procedure designed to determine the coordinates of a known address on a known street produced the coordinates of a different address on a street neither a continuation of nor connected to the street targeted.

Multiple checks designed to prevent attacks on sensitive targets each failed as the location of the embassy had not been updated since the embassy moved to New Belgrade three years earlier. As a result, the bombers took to the air with the coordinates of the Chinese embassy programmed into the bombs on board.

This account didn't draw a connection between the use of an old map and the targeting of the embassy and didn't address the reason that target authorization listed the objective as a warehouse instead of an office building.

===George Tenet statement===
On July 22, George Tenet made a statement before a public hearing of the House Intelligence Committee.&lt;ref name="Tenet"/&gt; Covering the same ground as Under Sec. Pickering's statement in China, he additionally acknowledged the target package originated within the CIA and that it was the sole CIA-directed strike of the war, stated that he had been personally unaware that the CIA was circulating strike requests and recognised that the CIA possessed maps correctly displaying the embassy. Deputy Defense Secretary [[John Hamre]], giving evidence the same day, stated that "NIMA is not at fault".&lt;ref name="Hamre"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1999_hr/990722-hamre.htm |title=Testimony of John J. Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense Before the House Select Committee on Intelligence |accessdate=October 27, 2006 |date=July 22, 1999|year= |month= |work= |publisher=(FAS Copy)|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese reaction===
Few Chinese politicians believed the US version of events, believing instead the strike had been deliberate.&lt;ref name="ChinaJournal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peter Hays Gries |date=July 2001 | title = Tears of Rage: Chinese Nationalist Reactions to the Belgrade Embassy Bombing | journal = The China Journal | issue = 46 | pages = 25–43 | publisher = Contemporary China Center, Australian National University | location = Canberra, Australia | issn = 1324-9347 | oclc = 41170782 | jstor=3182306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ambassador [[Li Daoyu]] stated "we don't say it was a decision of Clinton or the White House",&lt;ref name="Arkin2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A10160-1999Nov2 |title=Chinese Embassy Continues to Smolder|accessdate=October 26, 2009 |month= |work= |publisher=Washington Post|quote= | first=William M. | last=Arkin | date=November 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Chinese government describes the US explanation for "the so-called mistaken bombing" as "anything but convincing" and has never accepted the US version of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18047.htm |title=Strong Protest by the Chinese Government Against The Bombing by the US-led NATO of the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Yugoslavia |accessdate=October 22, 2009 |date=November 17, 2001|year= |month= |work= |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Observer'' and ''Politiken'' investigation==
Acting on a tip-off, Jens Holsoe of Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'' contacted UK paper ''[[The Observer]]'' with a view to conducting a joint investigation.&lt;ref name="observer1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Kosovo/Story/0,2763,203214,00.html |title=Nato bombed Chinese deliberately |work=The Guardian |date= October 17, 1999|accessdate=January 27, 2012 |location=London |first1=Ed |last1=Vulliamy |first2=John |last2=Sweeney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holsoe, together with [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]] and [[Ed Vulliamy]] of ''The Observer'', interviewed numerous sources including a NATO officer "serving in an operational capacity at the [[4 star rank|four-star level]]", a staff-officer serving at a [[2 star rank|two-star level]], a "very high-ranking" former US intelligence officer, a NATO flight controller at the Naples HQ for Kosovo air operations, and a US NIMA official.&lt;ref name="FAIR1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1764 | title=Chinese Embassy Bombing--Media Reply, FAIR Responds|accessdate=October 25, 2009|date=November 3, 1999|website=FAIR}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a four-month investigation, they published their findings on Oct 17.

According to the journalists' investigation the embassy bombing was a deliberate attack, which is consistent with the pattern of strikes that night where, according to NATO's official briefing of May 8, "the focus was wholly on disrupting the national leadership [of Yugoslavia]".&lt;ref name="Shea1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nato.int/koSovo/press/b990508a.htm | title = Morning Briefing | accessdate=October 25, 2009|date=May 8, 1999|website=NATO Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from "the FDSP weapons warehouse", every target that night was a command and control (C2) center.&lt;ref name="Shea1"/&gt;

A further report in ''The Observer'' of November 28, 1999 added more details.&lt;ref name="observer2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3935955,00.html |title=Truth behind America's raid on Belgrade |accessdate=October 25, 2009 |date=November 28, 1999|work=The Observer|quote= | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, American officials indicated that the reason behind the bombing of the embassy, was because they believe the embassy had provided signals facilities for Željko Ražnatović, commonly known as [[Arkan]], a [[Serb]] paramilitary leader wanted by the [[ICTY]] for [[war crimes]]. NATO's briefing of May 8, which stated Arkan's HQ was at the Hotel Yugoslavia {{convert|500|m|yd|abbr=on}} away, is consistent with this interpretation.&lt;ref name="Shea1"/&gt;

Representatives of NATO governments dismissed the investigation. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] described it as "balderdash" and UK Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] said there wasn't a "shred of evidence to support this rather wild story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nato embassy attack 'not deliberate'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/477374.stm|accessdate=June 25, 2011 | work=BBC News|date=October 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the ''New York Times'' refused to report on the investigation until its findings could be corroborated. Subsequently, [[Andrew Rosenthal]] informed letter-writers by post that the ''Times'' hadn't found evidence to support the allegations. The Times didn't contact the authors or their sources.

Other sources, including major American media such as the ''Washington Post'', ''New York Times'', and ''Chicago Tribune'' maintained that while responsibility was found in the inaccurate planning of air strikes, the attack was not deliberate.&lt;ref name="WideNet"&gt;{{cite news
 | author = Steven Lee Myers | title = Chinese Embassy Bombing: A Wide Net of Blame | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801EED91431F934A25757C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1
 | work = New York Times | location = New York | date = April 17, 2000 | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International News wires like [[The Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], and [[Agence France Presse|Agence France Press]] (AFP) published numerous reports supporting both the accidental and deliberate attack theories. The American media was criticized for devoting little attention to the incident, as well as for consistently referring to the incident as an "accidental bombing", where China contested that belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1764|title= Chinese Embassy Bombing&amp;mdash;Media Reply, FAIR Responds |accessdate=February 3, 2008 |date= November 3, 1999|website=Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Observer/Politiken article was ignored by the US media; however, a ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' article by Laura Rozen featured an interview of ''Washington Post'' columnist and former intelligence officer [[William Arkin|William M. Arkin]], who was dismissive of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite news | author = Laura Rozen | title = A "Boneheaded" bombing
 | url = http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2000/02/10/embassy/index.html | work= Salon | location = San Francisco | date = February 10, 2000 | accessdate =October 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging that investigators had spoken to signals intelligence officers in NATO, Arkin told Rozen: "The Chinese Embassy and the Hotel Yugoslavia, where [[Arkan]]'s generals were believed to be commanding his paramilitary Tigers, are right across the street from each other, and in fact both were bombed the same night [...] I think there were communications emanating from the Hotel Yugoslavia across the street. And I think that stupid people who are leaking rumors to the Observer have made that mistake."

The Hotel Yugoslavia was attacked on May 7, but NATO was aware of its function and connection with Arkan.&lt;ref name="Shea1"/&gt; Arkin did not discuss the way that NATO planners could be aware of the HQ and target it successfully if they were confused about its location.

==ICTY investigation==
A report conducted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] entitled '''Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''' after the Kosovo War examined the attack on the Chinese embassy specifically and came to the conclusion that the OTP (Office of the Prosecutor) should not undertake an investigation concerning the bombing of the Chinese Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaching its decision, it rendered the following observations:
*That the root of the failures in target location appears to stem from the land navigation techniques employed by an intelligence officer in an effort to pinpoint the location of the FDSP (Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement) building at Bulevar Umetnosti 2. The officer used techniques known as "intersection" and "resection" which, while appropriate to locate distant or inaccessible points or objects, are inappropriate for use in aerial targeting as they provide only an approximate location. Using this process, the individual mistakenly determined that the building which we now know to be the Chinese Embassy was the FDSP headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY|location=Para 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The USA has formally apologized to the Chinese Government and agreed to pay $28 million in compensation to the Chinese Government and $4.5 million to the families of those killed or injured. The CIA has also dismissed one intelligence officer and reprimanded six senior managers. The US Government also claims to have taken corrective actions in order to assign individual responsibility and to prevent mistakes such as this from occurring in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY|location=Para 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The aircrew involved in the attack should not be assigned any responsibility for the fact they were given the wrong target and that it is inappropriate to attempt to assign criminal responsibility for the incident to senior leaders because they were provided with wrong information by officials of another agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY|location=Para 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amnesty International report==
[[Amnesty International]] examined the NATO air campaign and assessed the legality of its actions.&lt;ref name="Amnesty"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur70/018/2000/en/ | title="COLLATERAL DAMAGE" OR UNLAWFUL KILLINGS? : Violations of the laws of war by NATO during Operation Allied Force|accessdate=October 27, 2009 |last=|first=|coauthors= |date=June 5, 2000|year= |month= |work= |publisher=Amnesty International|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of the embassy bombing Amnesty reported both on the official explanation and to the Observer/Politiken investigation without arbitrating as to which was true. NATO was criticised for continuing its bombing campaign uninterrupted when its safeguards to protect civilians were known to be faulty. A genuinely accidental attack would not imply legal responsibility, but the report stated that "the very basic information needed to prevent this mistake was publicly and widely available" and that "NATO failed to take the necessary precautions required by Article 57(2) of Protocol I" of the Geneva conventions.&lt;ref&gt;"COLLATERAL DAMAGE" OR UNLAWFUL KILLINGS? p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of the location==
Marking the 10th anniversary of the bombing, on May 7, 2009, [[mayor of Belgrade]] [[Dragan Đilas]] and [[Chinese Ambassador to Serbia]] [[Wei Jinghua]] dedicated the [[commemorative plaque]] on the location. The author of the plaque is Nikola Kolja Milunović.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Nikola Belić | title = Spomen-ploča na mestu nekadašnje kineske ambasade | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = May 7, 2009 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the visit of the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] [[Xi Jinping]] to Serbia in June 2016, he and his [[President of Serbia|Serbian counterpart]] [[Tomislav Nikolić]] visited the location, declared the nearby [[Turnaround (road)|turnaround]] a Square of the Serbian-Chinese Friendship and announced the construction of the Chinese Cultural Center on the location of the former embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/9/politika/2355508/predsednik-kine-stize-u-trodnevnu-posetu-srbiji.html|author= [[Tanjug]]|title= Predsednik Kine stigao u trodnevnu posetu Srbiji|date= June 17, 2016| publisher= [[Radio Television Serbia]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the center began on July 20, 2017, in the presence of mayor [[Siniša Mali]] and Chinese ambassador [[Li Manchang]]. The edifice will have 10 floors, 2 below the ground and 8 above, with the total floor area of {{convert|32,000|m2|abbr=on}}. The project will cost 45 million euros and should be finished in January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = B.H.| title = Počela gradnja prvog kineskog kulturnog centra na Balkanu | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 05 | language = Serbian | date = July 21, 2017 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rs.n1info.com/a284816/Vesti/Kultura/Pocela-izgradnja-Kineskog-kulturnog-centra-na-Novom-Beogradu.html|author=Beta|title= Počela izgradnja Kineskog kulturnog centra na Novom Beogradu|date= July 20, 2017| publisher= [[N1 (television)|N1]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2017, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Donald Trump]] announced the '''United States recognition of Jerusalem as the [[Capital city|capital]] of Israel'''&lt;ref name=FR58331&gt;Proclamation 9683 of December 6, 2017, [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-12-11/pdf/2017-26832.pdf#page=1 82 FR 58331]&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered the planning of the relocation of the [[Consulate of the United States, Tel Aviv|U.S. Embassy]] in [[Israel]] from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=nyt271206/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/06/trump-officially-recognizes-jerusalem-as-israels-capital-orders-us-embassy-move.html |title=Trump officially recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital, orders embassy move for US |first=Alex |last=Pappas |date=December 6, 2017 |website=Foxnews.com |accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], the [[Prime Minister of Israel]], welcomed the decision and praised the announcement. On December 8, Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] clarified that the President's statement "did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem" and "was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide."&lt;ref name=TillersonStatement&gt;{{Cite news |issn=0190-8286 |last=Morello |first=Carol |title=U.S. Embassy's move to Jerusalem should take at least two years, Tillerson says |work=Washington Post |accessdate=December 9, 2017 |date=December 8, 2017 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/tillerson-us-embassy-move-to-jerusalem-should-take-at-least-two-years/2017/12/08/83ec13ac-7170-4058-9972-11d4a8e8cc18_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] Bill Clinton promised that his administration would "support Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel" and criticized President George H.W. Bush for having "repeatedly challenged Israel’s sovereignty over a united Jerusalem." However, after the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] in 1993, the Clinton administration did not proceed with their plans in order not to disturb the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Never_ending_Story"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.769498 |title=From Bill Clinton to Trump: The Never-ending Story of the Jerusalem Embassy Move |newspaper=Haaretz Daily |date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which declared that "Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel."&lt;ref name="Jerusalem_Embassy_Act_of_1995"&gt;Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USPL|104|45}}, November 8, 1995, 109 Stat. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also stated that the American embassy should move to Jerusalem within five years.&lt;ref name="Never_ending_Story" /&gt; Backing the legislation was viewed by some as reflecting American domestic politics. Clinton opposed the Jerusalem Embassy Act and signed a waiver every six month delaying the move.&lt;ref name="Never_ending_Story" /&gt;

During the 2000 election campaign, George W. Bush criticized Clinton for not moving the embassy as he had promised to do, and said he planned on initiating the process himself as soon as he was elected. However, once he took office, he backed down on his promise.&lt;ref name="Never_ending_Story" /&gt;

In 2008, then Democratic candidate Barack Obama called Jerusalem the 'capital of Israel'. On June 4, 2008, Obama told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), in his first foreign policy speech after capturing the Democratic nomination the day before, that "Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided." However, he backtracked almost immediately, saying "Well, obviously, it's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-07/what-have-past-presidents-said-about-israel-and-jerusalem/9234736 |title=Donald Trump: What past US presidents have said about recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital |newspaper=ABC News |date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement==
[[File:President Trump Gives a Statement on Jerusalem, December 2017.webm|thumb|President Trump's statement on Jerusalem, December 6, 2017]]
On December 6, 2017 President Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from [[Tel Aviv]] to Jerusalem. In his statement Donald Trump did not mention [[East Jerusalem]] as the capital of a future Palestinian state, but he did say that United States recognition did not resolve the dispute over Jerusalem's borders. President Trump explicitly stated his support for maintaining the [[Status quo of Holy Land sites|status quo of the holy sites]] within the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]].&lt;ref name=nyt271206&gt;{{Cite news |issn=0362-4331 |last=Landler |first=Mark |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |date=December 6, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement, Trump signed the waiver, delaying the move by at least another six months.&lt;ref name=tti271207&gt;{{Cite news |title=After Jerusalem recognition, Trump signs waiver delaying embassy move |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=December 24, 2017 |date=December 7, 2017 |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-jerusalem-recognition-trump-signs-waiver-delaying-embassy-move/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Trump's announcement, American embassies in Turkey, Jordan, Germany and Britain issued security alerts for Americans traveling or living in those countries. The United States also issues a general warning for Americans abroad about the possibility of violent protests. The American consulate in Jerusalem has restricted travel of government employees to Jerusalem's [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. The US Embassy in Jordan banned employees from leaving the capital and children of embassy employees were told to stay home from school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=staff |first1=T. O.

===State Department remarks===
Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] later clarified that the President's statement "did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem" and "was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide."&lt;ref name=TillersonStatement/&gt; State Department officials said on December 8 that there will not be any immediate practical changes in how the US deals with Jerusalem, including its policy of not listing a country on the passports of citizens born in Jerusalem.

===American domestic reactions===
====Former US ambassadors to Israel====
Out of 11 former US ambassadors to Israel, nine were critical of Trump's policy change. [[Ogden R. Reid]] who served as an ambassador to Israel from 1959 to 1961 was one of the exceptions saying, "I think it's the right decision." [[Edward S. Walker Jr.]] who served from 1997 to 1999 also supported recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital: "It's really a question of what are the lines, the borders, to be drawn around the state of Israel and the ultimate state of Palestine." [[Daniel C. Kurtzer]] noted America's international isolation in his remarks and [[Richard H. Jones]] expressed concerns that moving the embassy would fuel further violence. A number of former ambassadors, such as [[Martin S. Indyk]] stated that they were open to recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, provided Israel would agree to slow settlement construction and recognize [[East Jerusalem]] as the Palestinian capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |issn=0362-4331 |last=Chan |first=Sewell |title=Nearly Every Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Disagrees With Trump's Jerusalem Decision |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |date=December 7, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/world/middleeast/israel-jerusalem-ambassadors-state-trump.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Christian organizations====
[[American Christian]] organizations were divided: the [[National Council of Churches]] (NCC) which represents 38 different denominations issued a statement saying the change in policy was likely to exacerbate regional conflict and cost lives, while the [[Liberty Counsel]], a right wing [[evangelical]] organization supported the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Cohen |first=Debra Nussbaum |title=American Christian Organizations Split in Response to Trump's Jerusalem Move |work=Haaretz |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |date=December 7, 2017 |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-1.827412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move had been supported by many [[conservative]] American evangelical organizations and leaders including [[American Christian Leaders for Israel]], [[Jerry Falwell]], and [[Mike Huckabee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Intense push by US evangelicals helped set stage for Trump's decision on Jerusalem – Israel News – Jerusalem Post |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Intense-push-by-US-evangelicals-helped-set-stage-for-Trumps-decision-on-Jerusalem-517293}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnnie Moore Jr.|Johnnie Moore]], one of Trump's evangelical advisers, said the announcement fulfilled a campaign promise to Trump's evangelical voter base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Burke |first=Daniel |title=Why evangelicals are 'ecstatic' about Trump's Jerusalem move |work=CNN |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/politics/american-evangelicals-jerusalem/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also welcomed by Rabbi [[Yechiel Eckstein]], the founder of the [[International Fellowship of Christians and Jews]].&lt;ref name="JP_Jewish_Org_reaction" /&gt;

====American Jewish organizations====
The majority of prominent American Jewish organizations welcomed the move,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/american-jews-support-trump-jerusalem-decision/4153051.html |title=Trump’s Jerusalem Move Welcomed by Most Major American Jewish Groups |first=Michael |last=Lipin |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], which comprises 51 national Jewish organizations, as well as by a number of its member organizations: [[AIPAC]], the [[Jewish Federations of North America]], the [[American Jewish Congress]], the [[American Jewish Committee]], [[Hadassah]], the [[Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations]] of America and the [[National Council of Young Israel]]. The Conservative Movement's US, Israel and global branches also welcomed US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Conservative-Movement-backs-Trump-recognition-of-Jerusalem-as-capital-of-Israel-517589 |title=Conservative Movement Backs Trump's Recognition of Jerusalem as Capital of Israel |work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America|Orthodox Union]], the US' largest umbrella organization representing [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], thanked Trump for "beginning the process of relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://advocacy.ou.org/union-orthodox-jewish-congregations-america-applauds-president-trumps-historic-change-u-s-policy-toward-status-jerusalem/ |title=Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America Applauds President Trump’s Historic Change of U.S. Policy toward the Status of Jerusalem – OU Advocacy Center |date=December 6, 2017 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] said recognition was "important and long overdue", while continuing to express support for a [[two state solution]]. AIPAC expressed its support for an "undivided Jerusalem" but also said that relocating the American embassy to Jerusalem would not "prejudge the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process". [[Morton Klein]], who heads the [[Zionist Organization of America]], said that Trump was "finally recognizing the obvious". The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] said Trump's announcement "will right an historic wrong".&lt;ref name=jewishgroups&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. Jewish Groups Divided in Reactions to Trump's Jerusalem Announcement |work=Haaretz |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |date=December 6, 2017 |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.827377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was also welcomed by the [[Republican Jewish Coalition]].&lt;ref name="JP_Jewish_Org_reaction"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/How-US-Jewish-groups-are-reacting-to-Trumps-recognition-of-Jerusalem-as-Israels-capital-517280 |title=How US Jewish Groups Are Reacting To Trump's Recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's Capital |work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/238974 |title=Jewish organizations hail Trump's Jerusalem move |work=Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reform Jewish movement]] called it "ill-timed" and said it would "exacerbate the conflict", but also declared that "Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people and the State of Israel" and that they "share the President's belief that the US embassy should, at the right time, be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cortellessa |first1=Eric |title=Liberal US Jews blast Trump’s expected Jerusalem declaration |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/liberal-us-jews-blast-trumps-expected-jerusalem-declaration/ |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |work=[[Times of Israel]] |date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JP_Jewish_Org_reaction" /&gt; The [[Jewish Democratic Council of America]] similarly expressed support for Israel as an undivided capital, but criticized Trump for neglecting to "meaningfully support peace between Palestinians and Israelis." Left-wing Mideast policy group [[J Street]] said the timing was "premature and divisive". J Street, [[New Israel Fund]], and [[Reform Zionism|progressive Zionist]] organization [[Ameinu]] expressed concerns that the move would undermine Middle East peace efforts and could lead to violence.&lt;ref name="JP_Jewish_Org_reaction" /&gt;

====Other American groups====
In December 2017, more than 130 [[Jewish studies]] scholars from across North America criticized the Trump administration's decision, calling on the U.S. government to take actions to de-escalate the tensions and "clarify Palestinians' legitimate stake in the future of Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.jta.org/2017/12/10/news-opinion/united-states/over-130-jewish-studies-scholars-sign-statement-criticizing-trumps-jerusalem-decision |title=Over 130 US Jewish studies scholars criticize Trump's Jerusalem decision |agency=Jewish Telegraph Agency |date=December 10, 2017 |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Haaretz]]'', many of these scholars have been critical of the Trump administration and the current Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Maltz |first1=Judy |title=Trump's Jerusalem Backlash Continues: Over 100 Jewish Studies Scholars Issue Condemnation |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.827850 |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Muslim]] [[Civil and political rights|civil]] [[advocacy groups]] rejected the policy change, including the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) and the [[Muslim Public Affairs Council]] (MPAC). On December 5, Muslim, [[Interfaith]] and [[human rights group]]s held a protest outside the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ghazali |first1=Abdus Sattar |title=American Muslims reject Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as capital of Israel |url=http://www.milligazette.com/news/16018-american-muslims-reject-trumps-move-to-recognize-jerusalem-as-capital-of-israel |accessdate=December 13, 2017 |work=[[The Milli Gazette]] |date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli and Palestinian responses==

===Israel===
[[File:Relocation of US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem DSC0565 (41211030695).jpg|thumb|Jerusalem on 7 May 2018]]
On December 6, shortly after Trump's statement, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said the announcement was a "historic landmark" and praised the decision as "courageous and just". During his remarks Netanyahu said there is "no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel", adding that Jerusalem has "been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years".&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt; He later said that he has heard condemnation about the announcement but has "not heard any condemnation for the [[Palestinian rocket attacks|rocket]] firing against Israel that has come and the awful incitement against us".&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{Cite news |title=US allies round on Trump over Jerusalem |work=BBC News |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |date=December 10, 2017 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42297437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement was well received by [[Knesset]] members of left, right and centre parties including [[Yesh Atid]], [[Bayit Yehudi]], [[Yisrael Beytenu]], and [[Likud]]. [[Isaac Herzog]] called it an "act of historic justice" but also added that the next step was to "realize the vision of two states". In contrast, [[Bezalel Smotrich]] of the [[religious zionist]] Bayit Yehudi party issued the following statement: "For 30 years we have fallen into the pit of the Palestinian state as a realistic solution. The time has come to rethink things". [[Avi Gabbay]], who was recently elected to lead the [[Zionist Union]], also supported Trump's announcement, saying that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is more important then a peace deal.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{Cite web |title=How will US Jerusalem move affect Israel's far right? |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/jerusalem-move-affect-israel-171210122104793.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=knesset&gt;{{Cite web |title=Knesset Speaker: Thank you, POTUS — now, the rest of the world |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=December 13, 2017 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Knesset-Speaker-Thank-you-POTUS-now-the-rest-of-the-world-517223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's Deputy Education Minister [[Meir Porush]] of [[United Torah Judaism]] party said building in "parts of [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]] and Jerusalem that need housing would be better than a declaration that means nothing". [[Yisrael Eichler]], also of UTJ, expressed similar views saying he would "rather have 1,000 homes for young couples in Jerusalem than one American embassy building." In contrast, left-wing party [[Meretz]] said recognition of Jerusalem should only come with the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, adding that Trump's declaration "de facto betrays the Zionist vision and the values on which the State of Israel was established".&lt;ref name=knesset/&gt;

[[Hanin Zoabi]] and [[Ayman Odeh]], both members of the [[United Arab List]] party, said the US could no longer act as a peace mediator. Odeh said that "Trump is a pyromaniac and will set the entire region ablaze with his madness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Labor’s Gabbay welcomes Trump’s Jerusalem move, urges ‘trust-building’ measures |accessdate=December 13, 2017 |work=Times of Israel |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/labors-gabbay-welcomes-trumps-jerusalem-move-urges-trust-building-measures/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian churches based in Jerusalem===
On December 6, 2017, the primate of the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem]], Patriarch [[Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem|Theophilos III]], widely regarded as the most senior Christian figure in Jerusalem, and twelve other church leaders in the Holy Land sent a letter to Trump warning that his move “w[ould] yield increased hatred, conflict, violence and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, moving us farther from the goal of unity and deeper toward destructive division”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/us-recognition-of-jerusalem-as-israel-capital-what-it-means What does US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital mean?] The Guardian, December 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Theophilos III, the letter was signed by heads of Jerusalem's [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian]], [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopioan]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] patriarchates as well as the Roman Catholic Church's [[Apostolic Administrator]] for [[Jerusalem]] (the [[Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]).

==International response==
Trump's Jerusalem decision was widely condemned by world leaders. European US allies that objected include Britain, Germany, Italy and France. Romania, on the other hand, declined to follow the EU position and also indicated it may relocate its embassy to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-decision-to-move-embassy-to-jerusalem-sparks-controversy-04-20-2018 |title=Romania President Slates Call to Move Embassy to Jerusalem |work=Balkan Insight |date=April 20, 2018 |access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/romania-begins-process-for-possible-move-of-its-embassy-to-jerusalem/ |title=Romania begins process for possible move of its embassy to Jerusalem |work=The Times of Israel |date=April 20, 2018 |access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-diplomacy-jerusalem/romanian-ruling-party-chief-says-plans-to-move-israel-embassy-to-jerusalem-idUSKBN1HR0UW |title=Romania govt supports moving embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, president concerned |agency=Reuters |date=April 20, 2018 |access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] also made a plea that all nations remain committed to "respecting the status quo" of the city. China urged caution regarding the potential escalation of tensions in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="pope"&gt;{{Cite news |issn=0362-4331 |last=Horowitz |first=Jason |title=U.N., European Union and Pope Criticize Trump's Jerusalem Announcement |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |date=December 6, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/europe/trump-jerusalem-pope.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations ===
====Pre-announcement====
Shortly before Trump's announcement, in November 2017, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted on a resolution in Jerusalem 151-6 with 9 abstentions. The resolution stated that "any actions by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem were illegal and therefore null and void.  It further stressed the need for the parties to refrain from provocative actions, especially in areas of religious and cultural sensitivity, and called for respect for the historic status quo at the holy places of Jerusalem." It was part of six resolutions on Palestine and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="UN resolution statement"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/ga11982.doc.htm |title=`Declaring Israel’s Actions in Syrian Golan, East Jerusalem ‘Null and Void’, General Assembly Adopts Six Resolutions on Palestine, Middle East |date=2018-11-30 |website=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Security Council====
The United Nations Security Council vote on 7 December to condemn Trump's decision failed due to a veto by the United States, despite the support of the remaining fourteen members of the Council.&lt;ref name=farnaz&gt;{{Cite news |issn=0099-9660 |last=Fassihi |first=Farnaz |title=Fourteen of 15 Security Council Members Denounce U.S. Stance on Jerusalem |work=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=December 9, 2017 |date=December 9, 2017 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fourteen-of-15-security-council-members-denounce-u-s-stance-on-jerusalem-1512777971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergency meeting was requested by Bolivia, Britain, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=pope /&gt; US envoy [[Nikki Haley]] called the United Nations "one of the world's foremost centers of hostility towards Israel".&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Britain, France, Sweden, Italy and Japan were among the countries who criticized Trump's decision at the emergency meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Friday |last2=December 8 |last3=Pm |first3=2017-08:15 |title=Trump's recognition of Jerusalem condemned at UN security council meeting |accessdate=December 9, 2017 |date=December 8, 2017 |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/world/trumps-recognition-of-jerusalem-condemned-at-un-security-council-meeting-817874.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December, a Security Council resolution calling for the withdrawal of the recognition was vetoed by the United States, for a tally of 14–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beaumont |first1=Peter |title=US outnumbered 14 to 1 as it vetoes UN vote on status of Jerusalem |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/us-outnumbered-14-to-1-as-it-vetoes-un-vote-on-status-of-jerusalem |accessdate=December 19, 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
====European Union====
The European Union's foreign policy chief [[Federica Mogherini]] emphasized that all governments of EU member states were united on the issue of Jerusalem, and reaffirmed their commitment to a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Trump's Jerusalem plan revives tensions in EU diplomacy |work=Reuters |accessdate=December 9, 2017 |date=December 8, 2017 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-israel-france/u-s-has-excluded-itself-from-middle-east-peace-process-france-idUSKBN1E2102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogherini said that embassies should not be moved to Jerusalem while the final status of the city was disputed. She also noted that Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem was considered a violation of international law under a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|1980 United Nations Security Council resolution]].&lt;ref name=pope/&gt; On December 11, Mogherini said that European nations would not move their embassies to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

====European political parties====
Trump's recognition of Jerusalem did receive some European support from anti-Islam politicians. Czech President [[Miloš Zeman]] said the European response was "cowardly". [[Geert Wilders]], leader of the Dutch anti-Islam party [[Party for Freedom]], said that "all freedom loving countries should move their embassy to Jerusalem" and affirmed his support for an undivided Jerusalem. [[Heinz-Christian Strache]], leader of the Austrian [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]], similarly stated his wish to relocate the Austrian embassy to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=wapo2&gt;{{Cite news |issn=0190-8286 |last=Taylor |first=Adam |title=Who supports Trump on Jerusalem?

===Arab and Muslim world===
[[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Salman]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] said that moving the American embassy to Jerusalem would be a "flagrant provocation" to Muslims. Saudi Arabia and [[Egypt]]ian [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] both expressed similar concerns about the viability of the peace process. The [[Jordan]]ian government said Trump had violated international law and the UN charter.&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt; Turkish president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] called Israel a "terrorist state".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/erdogan-israel-terrorist-state-171211085734826.html Erdogan: Israel is a terrorist state]". ''Al-Jazeera''. 11 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, The [[Arab League]] held an emergency meeting in [[Cairo]]. After the meeting, the League's [[List of Secretaries General of the Arab League|Secretary-General]], [[Ahmed Aboul Gheit]] issued a statement saying the change in US policy was "against international law and "amounts to the legalization" of [[Israeli occupation]].

[[Iran]] said the U.S. announcement was in violation of international resolutions and could spark a "new intifada". [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[President of Lebanon|President]] [[Michel Aoun]] said the policy change would derail the peace process. [[Qatar]]'s [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Qatar)|Foreign Minister]] [[Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani|Mohammed Abdulrahman Al Thani]] called it "a death sentence for all who seek peace".&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt; [[Indonesia]]n [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Joko Widodo]] condemned the decision and asked the US to "reconsider the decision".

On December 13, 2017, during an [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) meeting held in [[Istanbul]], more than 50 Muslim majority countries rejected and condemned Trump's decision by passing the ''Istanbul Declaration on Freedom for al Quds'' ("Jerusalem" in Arabic) and calling for the worldwide recognition of "an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its occupied capital".

'''X-Mas Festival''' was a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[festival]]/[[Concert tour|tour]] held annually in [[Europe]] from 1999 to 2005. It was organized by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[booking agency]] [[Metallysee]]. The 2006 and 2007 editions have been cancelled, and the future of the festival is in doubt. Metallysee plans to launch a new tour in January 2008 under the name [[Black Winter Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metallysee.com/news.htm Metallysee news] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119173109/http://www.metallysee.com/news.htm |date=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 2006 edition was cancelled after [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]], [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]], [[God Dethroned]], [[Cataract (band)|Cataract]] and soon later [[Krisiun]] decided to pull out, [[Trail of Tears (band)|Trail of Tears]] disbanded and [[Soilwork]] refused to headline the tour. The last announced lineup featured [[Gorefest]], [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]], [[Prostitute Disfigurement]], [[Madder Mortem]], [[SkyForger]] and [[Darzamat]]. The owner of the agency blamed one of his employees for the cancellation, and this person left the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=72989 "Belgian booking agency apologizes for string of European tour cancellations"], [[Blabbermouth.net]], May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the 2007 edition was also called off without a reason. The lineup should have featured [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Samael (band)|Samael]], [[Malevolent Creation]], [[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]], [[Wykked Wytch]], [[Blood Red Throne]] and [[Innerfire]]. The Onslaught website claims that the festival has been postponed, and will be held in January 2008 under the name [[Black Winter Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onslaughtfromhell.com/news.html Onslaught news]&lt;/ref&gt;
